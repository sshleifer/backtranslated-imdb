There was a person here in many honors for this project, which remarked that he was the only person (who was not inspired by this) - as the movie gives 3 stars. However, the overall choice of comment stories, and the same other production indicated. Well, this person is not "the only" who did not like this product (include me!) But I also share it with him. If you keep a gun in my head and I want to make a choice between showing your shooting in the middle of this or again, but I want to see it - but I'll probably spend 10 seconds to think about it. I'd like to be locked alone in captivity, or looking dry on the paint on a wall. In addition, I do not want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere or any other alternative presentation. Sometimes when you combine comrade George Gobell's "brown shoes" when the world is a toxoid in the world, and it seems to me it's I like Angela Lansbury in my favorite movie "Long Hot Summer" and even if she does not have a huge fan of listening, "Murders, she wrote." But here - I do not care about stories or other aspects, but Angela screams, squawking, singing, and everything else about her performance is available, I've ever experienced a movie (or presentation in any other media). It was like a continuous continuation of "over-top" cocoon chortling in the previous sections of "My Fair Lady" - similar to Audrey Hepburn in Rex Harrison. But it was a case of conspiracy, light, ridiculous effects and (sorry) briefly presented. Undoubtedly, it was a little bit more, and I felt that it was about 10 hours (interpretation of the interpretation of the "relativity" of the work of the man in Einstein.) If I was not with friends, I would have lived with it, I had a short visit. I laughed, "SafeField" stopped everyone who came in April because he said that he liked "how much English patients". My friends saw me in a similar way when I interrupted their candle on this movie amazingly. False me on a chalk board instead of some time.
