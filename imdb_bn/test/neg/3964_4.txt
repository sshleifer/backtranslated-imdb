The heroic story hero "Benzie" ("Higgins") has many different things to different people. On her busy day "Benzie" took breakfast at two kids' homes, chatted with an officer of the law, an old lady followed the cats, and reminded an old-fashioned caf√© owner for the day's increase. Helping others, joy to others, companionship of all. <br /> <br /> Her young friends are abducted and their problems are taken away from the abandoned palace. From here we can only save "Benzie" on that day. <br /> <br /> The plot is the author / producer / director Joe Camp's routine, and he has an impact on the speed of the slow motion. Although the audience will be difficult to resist loving little ponds, and the children of all ages make sure to worship him. Cast is never going to be a background of "Benzie". <br /> <br /> Which do not want to inspire you, but to rent funny family. Academy Award nominated for "Benzieir" theme, "Eiffel Love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
