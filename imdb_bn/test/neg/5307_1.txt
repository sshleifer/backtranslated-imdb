Sometimes when I hear an unlisted cast, I hope that the movie will be uploaded together for 2 hours and not for 10 rupees or 2 hours, but for the actors, the careers. Everything has been wasted in the case of "be cool" <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> How the movie sequels, and not the best. If you see that the scene was shot the same way, then Quintin Tarantino has heard the picture of his "false fiction" picture and listen to the conversation that you can not help but consider the fact that 1) it is going to suck a waiver movie to viewers , Or 2) Talk to viewers about a signal from Human Human in Humane at Human Effects. Trying arrested. Oh ta (If you are frustrated, the choice is correct.) The first and good film "Get Short" is cool and glittery Chilean Palmar is a musician reviving for the music business pro campaign. He stole a Jewish singer (Christina Million) from his jewelery and gave the Jewish manager (Vince Von) ants and turned him into a singing sensation. Of course a movie about a former mobster could not be complete without causing new mobsters to ruin. Favorite people's choices are often played by Russian actors, American actors who are not able to play Russian, if my whole family elevates the head with their Russian bare hands. <br /> <br /> I was not so much Russian, that the film was offended by the way the Russians portrayed, but instead I was offended by horror conversations as a writer. This picture tried very hard to laugh at the audience laughing. It turned out to be a potentially good line in a redundancy. Russian, black, and gay joke had the same reworded only a few times. After calling The Rock's character, ***** (he played Vince Vaughan as a homosexual bodyguard), and Cedric was a ***** character of the Ententiary character (he played a black wrapper with an alliance who did not get frustrated, who did not play His track with guns) I wanted to walk from the movie theater, because it was painful to engage. If it "get the short", it does not have to be a film or a bad smile to create a play. <br /> <br /> What was lacking on this movie that "got the drink" was a hot spice in Chile. He is a completely different person in this sequel. One thing was more dialogue in old Chile. John Travolta "Cool Haze" does not have more than 20 commentary lines, because they are run by repetitive lines, and hundreds of concerts are also present by most random celebrities. I will not destroy this shock by publishing everything for those who want to watch this movie (please please !!!), but I would say that it will surprise me forever that these people have agreed to agree. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,. Tarantino never creates pop fiction for a fool as a director of "Cool Ho". This dance number was annoying, long, and just plain throbbing. Playing a black ants in the club with a total of 10 people makes the scene no memorable. <br /> <br /> The background has torn off why I left the theater? Everything about this image was a big question mark. I just do not understand some points. I was not even able to explain why Russians were after all, or why this image was created, because I am bored. I came out of this movie that everyone in LA was a psychic, and this film is probably worth trying, diat coke, yahoo !, honda insight hybrid, t-mobile, trippa (even the spokesman himself in the movie) and bad screen writer guild . Plot hole, stupid dialogue, many random cams, awesome performances (even by professionals) and immense efforts to imitate "Pulp Fiction" make this film the worst movie of 2005, and this is only the third month of the year.
