Blood is started by young female artist Sai (Sarah Ferrucu), a mysterious but impressive man named Ranfild (Jonathan Oldham), and he returns to his studio apartment where he gives him some kind of tree bark that is used as hallucinogenic drug when melted. Sai quickly became hooked as he whisked in an alternative fantasy reality involving vanitary animals. Saias' photographer friend Rais (Chris Ivan Civic) became concerned about him because he had been drunk more than the reality because he was addicted to drugs, his drugs could shake his drugs or destroy his life, and why did the mysterious Rennfeld make him addicted? Does the first thing have any significance of fantasy fantasy like stuff and travel? <br /> <br /> This animated Archie Vampire Flicky operated and operated by Christopher Hutson is about 95 minutes tidium and is easily accessible to all bad comments. This script is thought to be more attractive than the strikingly named SXV'Althan S. Sex (how do you pronounce it?) Which also credits as a producer designer, and its unusual name has been blamed. The makers of drug addiction, drug addicts and rape racket are ready to create a horrific film based on a very fierce fantasy with its strong moral message against drugs. Most of the film was initially presented on drug issues about narcotics, how wonderful it was for the first time, and how he was hopelessly addicted, which eventually destroyed him, his life and his friends survived. He never gave the drug where he kept this drug like Rainfield, initially he gave him a little bit, but hey, who carries? The first twenty minutes of bleed is not really boring and dull, next hour or even better, which is not much better than a mess of the last ten minutes that a vampial monster and Ranfield appear again. Patronizing moral material, the imagination element seems like a thinking and does not exist any more horror. The conversation is awful, every sentence tries to be deep, loads the hidden depth and tries to make so much money that makes it impossible to hear it. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is terrible and because arbitrary, there is no gossamer or violent talk, and the whole thing is set in an apartment that does not have any light. The fantasy setting looks a bit better, but it is clearly seen and underused. There is no fear, there is no atmosphere, and to make things worse, the manufacturers have decided to use very fuzzy colors which I hate and find annoying, is a beautiful color picture wrong? It looks like I was with the makers of the current filmmakers who think that it automatically cools a film or it enhances the environment which will not often make your movie uninterrupted and obscure. <br /> <br /> <br /> It was probably a low budget and shot in Los Angeles and it has reasonable production value, but it's all soft. Acting did not affect me, I have no difference or no good sign. <br /> <br /> Blood is a terrible vampire picture, which is a psychological horror, as well as all types of physical. The real life is the parallelism of digging habits and what it can do with little or no effect because the whole thing is so low. For such a film may be an audience but considering other comments that one is big.
