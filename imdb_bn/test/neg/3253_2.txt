Have you heard the Cloning Redundancy theory, where a copy is poorer than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that. They tried to mimic everything from the first movie. Now, doing this in a few cases. Robert Stack is actually a little better than Ted Knight, when they basically play the same character. I really like Randy Cayd, who is less or less offensive than who actually kills the bill. But Jackie Mason is not a Rodney Dangerfield and worse than that, C2 has shown once and for all, Dan Accraodd is the worst comedy actor ever. I like him very much, and C2 has passed the coffin closed in his "curiosity" career as much as I'm concerned about. He thinks similarly, Driving Miss Daisy and Sophie-Factor hosting Toffee more sticky. Otherwise, it is mostly "for CadShek", "has been there". Watch the original one instead of each version, and you'll find more for your rental money.
