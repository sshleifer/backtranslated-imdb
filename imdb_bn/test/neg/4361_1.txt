... first? Killjoy 1. But here Killjoy 2 review: <br /> <br /> (There are spoilers, so readers are alerted. <br /> <br /> Oh my. Oh, me, mine, mine. I was telling you that I had no hope at least that bit of this movie would be good. It was made without any doubt, without any doubt, Kilojo (the first film), this sindhu did not have many promises. <br /> <br /> Expected, it is not provided. <br /> <br /> Death was even lama than the first film. There was no eye sight, and each single propose was so fake that I would not be surprised if they created a kindergarten class. <br /> <br /> Look, I do not even know where I start. . HM, for beginners, the movie was not even feature length. It was just an hour and eight minutes long (68 minutes), but then it was actually a remedy to finish it again. In fact, this is the only reason that this film was not as bad as the first, because the first one was no more. <br /> <br /> Typically, I do not give spoilers to reviews, but since I do not want anyone who wants to go through torture after watching this film abuse, I'm looting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> To kill normal serial killers in horror movies, explosions, firefighters, guns etc. Assume what it takes to kill Killjoy? A F *** ING Glass Glass Do not lie In the end, a girl drank water in the face of the cylinders after drinking water. Then the kilo began crying, and they looked like his face, leaving dry rubber cement like his face. Then he kept there, and the people went to sleep. <br /> <br /> hit the act now Very serious Even a person at least bit was not trusted. I do not know what I'm saying, it seems like others have hired some of the residents living in the street to act in this film. <br /> <br /> Well, I genuinely doubt that they have spent more than $ 100 to build this movie. They had nothing to do. It mostly happened in the woods, which could not spend any movie on them. Actors were not going to try any effort, so it is probably disrespectful that they are probably "working" for free. They did not have any special effects or good props, and they probably used ketchup for blood. Hell, who am I kidding? They probably did not even cost 100 dollars. They probably spent $ 3.29 on ketchup bottles and it was there. A F ** KIN movie is made with a budget of $ 3.29. <br /> <br /> They also could not hire a police uniform for Bob's request. In the end, after the death of Kilojoy, the girl got up and said, "Where is she?" And the main woman answered, "She has gone." Then, suddenly, some blurred fats on his face were not found anywhere in the "Do you have a phone." The girl answered and said "Oh, hi mother!" And smile. Then lean stupid man walks along that it is a police officer. However, he wearing khaki pants, and green shirt up a regular button with a lump badge in a front pocket. Hell, probably it received the director while patrolling the safety in the third badge. Then they all entered a tensioned blazer and the credits were rolling. They got a Tan Blazer so they could not even get a police cruiser. F ** ears' lam. The first movie did not have the ice cream that was in Calzhe also. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Killjoy is not funny (and believe me, she tries to be). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is a very hair threat by criminals. Someone commented on some boys without passing a third child, whose boy answered, "I will show you the third grade!" In a threat method. That's the worst threat I've ever heard. "I'll show you the third class! <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad, it's dirty, it's messy until you do something bad, and you feel so guilty about it If you want to punish yourself, do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> Just remember; if a burning gay sex with a huge black Afro to bore you to death with gay jokes (and at the same time trying to kill you) Try Ray, just throw him some water. Case closed. <br /> <br /> Last Rating: 10 out of .1
