Most of the comments in this board are debating the legitimacy of comparing R-DGs with the DVD cover. Forget about that ... this film - er-- home movie is completely horrendous. How can anyone with a discipline of credibility claim this as 10/10? There is no plot, there is no one. I could not believe that I spent the money to rent it (after that later) and I believed myself that it was possible (based on box cover art and some kind of movie festival rewards). The only thing that I remember is that, incredibly, one of the annoying main characters is believed to be one with a bullet from the head ... and he ends up saving the wounds and making the final credits alive. How nice. And the look is awesome, there is a series of killers. Double wow The real story - I have actually denied so much that I wasted my money and vitality in this rental which I kept videotape for six months. I told myself that it never happened. The video was a delusion at the top of the TV - my self-disappointment was a mental symbol. After pointing out that anyone was actually real and that I needed to get a firm, I decided that I could not leave it there. I thought, "How much do I deny the grief of murder by killing myself by watching this fame?" I did the right thing and it came back to hell that it was. So, I think most of the IMDB community will work in the same situation, I wake up a bit, and went to the video store at 2:00 pm. After making sure that nobody was around, I got out of my car (still running), took the movie to the slot of the drop box, and did not go back to the hell to book it. <br /> <br /> I think I hope that some hooligans of Hollywood video will find me (the bill must have uploaded a bit like $ 1,238.67 in that time), so I moved away from the area. However, incidentally, there has not been much like the storyline of the murderers.
