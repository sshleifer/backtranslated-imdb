I suffered obsolescents of this movie last month at the Siege Festival. If there is a possibility of a movie being "unfilm" to avoid its existence, it should be the first in the list. Maria Lloydn is not a director, she is simply a fool, who holds a camera in hand and a professional filmmaker by holding down the word "action". What is wrong The film itself is useless and the total waste of good actors, which can do better in any other project. Val Kilmer has nothing but his face in front of the camera. His character does not have specific weight in the movie. Can you tell about the same thing about Jose Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joachim de Almeida? The character of Rudd Serbiazija is shameful in writing. Warning Speaker <br /> <br /> He's talking to himself mostly on the way to the tunnel (now I'm doing it, now I'm bat, I'll search in my bag, now I'm turning left, now I'm turning right. ..) to bring an obvious idea about his actions to the audience. This is simply meaningless and proves lack of talent in the director. The end of the Spokespersons <br /> <br /> The junk in the audience was a common joke about the fact that the title of the movie itself had a clear formula for rating: Zero
