In addition to DA (James Echhaus), and a short attendant woman who is sympathetic to the illness of Allen Gulden (Rene Gelweger), she is the only credible character herself and the character of the film. He is the one, not his dead mother, who is and is - the one true thing. This is not only the role of the jailguard, but also the role of the plot ...... Until the plot goes against itself - and in the eyes of his weakly-willed, shallow husband, the soil can do nothing "for a real thing" for his wife or girl. The girl can understand the view of the girl, but such intelligent realization must be given the way to the unpleasant feeling of a husband leaked outside both the reality of husband and daughter. <br /> <br /> Allen faces his father's cruelty in a powerful scene of this whole movie for booting. Elen is just another powerful strong woman who would be likened to the Cribbby father. A very flawed movie - so called a bore and flawed as time worthless.
