Yes, the movie was boring and vague. After a certain point, I wanted to feed this people to Krok so that we could get this movie. <br /> <br /> This plot is that three Australian boats take a fishing trip on a boat, where the fishing guide straps over a gun. He said that he would do it for insurance purposes only, all crocs have been hunting for this river. She is eaten by a crochet immediately. Then three of them get behind a tree, being sorted by the revenge in their attempts to escape. They spend most of the movie debating on the best way to escape. <br /> <br /> According to the prophecy, a survivor finds the guns of tour guide and shoots crocodiles. Oh, they killed the only favorite character of the movie! <br /> <br /> Where do you need Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin?
