I once had a big Olsen fan. I found this movie at the age of six and I saw it almost nonstop for nine years. Then it kept up on my shelf collection dust till yesterday. I was left stupid. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Allie and Mail, two-year-old son, were sent to send their ambassador grandfather for Spring Break. Along the way, they can expect that a French-French boy will show them more fun in Paris. I think the two guys are okay, empty French words aside. <br /> <br /> The plot is expected and humorous shallow and authentic. Mary-Kate and Ashley play very naughty girls face-to-face. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you are not on Welsen Twin or Family Movies.
