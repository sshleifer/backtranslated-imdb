Since 1982, it seems that in every two or three years we get a movie which is called "The Next Officer and Gentleman". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The character comes back for the girl, the character of C's feels great to the trainer.) And this film is expected as the rising sun ahead and horrible miscast above. Coster plays his usual "wise teacher" character, the only character he can play, and you've got an idea of ​​his limited acting abilities here. Out of the character of Richard Gere, the actress is wrong, only acting skillfully with a knock on the right raves. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Go? " The film does not seem to be unused by any plot point and does not seem to be the last. "Oh wait, we have forgotten the story of the girlfriend, or her graduation story, or what happened after six plot points in the movie ..." I see here "The more bad words." The general public's opinion is never surprised by me.
