I have to go with my son Allen (who has reviewed this photo) ... Jimmy Gangangoras (My copy is entitled - Guess they have "guessed" part that there is no "ninja" and Ninja is not mentioned anywhere. Film ...) is a total time wasted. One of the most annoying, annoying "movies" sincerely I was unhappy to see. <br /> <br /> A hooker is repeatedly (non-graphical) raped by two zombies, and then a policeman, non-graphical) when the police do not believe in his story. He met a man who was beaten with a dead body and both tried to find ways to take revenge on the unfortunate criminals ... <br /> <br /> First stop - There is no "gangbang" (or really all other "banging") Zombie Nija was GANGBANGERS. I hope at least some horrible / obscene hybrid bodies, or re-penrets, or perhaps more detailed stories - but not - the film did not have any gender at all. At least one bit and 'LL' in-out may have been a bit of a bitter annihilation, but in this regard we got a bunch of totally annoying shot scenes for zero money. I for "trash" movies and most other sculptures, gorse, obscene, and elemental elements, but this sucks in virtually every imaginable way. Save your time, please pass this one ... 1/10 (and one for only a few short shots for some sub-par titties ...)
