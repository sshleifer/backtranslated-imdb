It is a shame that many children as well as parents can immerse themselves in this drying, bandwigen-jumping tray. I often get surprised if Mr. Wisdom looked back on his excuse for the film with no pride in his subsequent years. After appearing in this low budget rubbish, at least Sally Geson had a decision to retire. A few long forgotten pop cameras called Pretty Things could not rescue this movie from its horror. Instead of investing 60 Nostalgia, instead of 'Hey We Go Go Goal Bubble Bush', Barry Evans and Sally's sister Judy have instead played.
