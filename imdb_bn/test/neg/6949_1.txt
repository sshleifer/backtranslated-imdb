Awful, time consuming. This is not a camp or trash value. Movie Clubs Watch Movies Between 10 to 12 Years Old Kids <br /> <br /> How can anyone rob a movie about vampires and lesbians on earth? <br /> <br /> This is not a movie, combine a few vampires / sophisticated enthusiasts in the same room, and it just shoots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture does not look good on anything. No plot, no real actor, no real special effect, no ridiculous. Some overheat goths touching each other can not be called a sex scene. nothing. <br /> <br /> Well, the cemetery was beautiful but during the dark one should shoot the vampire movie. <br /> <br /> The purpose was probably better: create a trash film in the spirit of Ed Wood. The problem can not deliberately make a bad movie. It takes an effort to create talent and a "real" movie. Ed wood may have a lack of money but he was sure of efforts. These guys lack everything. Ed Wood was a genius than this boy.
