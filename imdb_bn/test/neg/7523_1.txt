It's a time machine all right. It operated in "real-time" for 96 minutes, but it looked like 96 years old. The first 20 minutes were uninterrupted. Lots of "dead" time in abundance. what happened? When will happen? Who care? Obviously this movie was made in a tight budget, I noticed the following for your progress: MORLAS: The ring part is nothing like the Lord's set and the reuse of clothes to save a little money, hey? Morlochs control the "fearful dude" ... These guys might think that none of the most awesome things were wearing one of Gene Simmons: (Kiss of the band) old clothes ??? Little-known fact: Future fixes nail completely. <br /> <br /> Save your money, save time. Pass this one.
