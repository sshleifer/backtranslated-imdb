The Art House has been in the theater for a long time and I went to see Douglas Foedes because it received such a great review in the papers. <br /> <br /> The matter with this movie is that it has no head or tail, but only one section about the life of three main characters. <br /> <br /> When it started, I already knew that it would be a long sit but sometimes things are not good, in this case. There is no real development or interconnection between the players. You start by a situation, suddenly there is a girlfriend and then there is a guy with whom he will have to be friends with him to fulfill the ambitions of sports, but the way they are together is quite strange, because they are <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Crime or jealousy feelings with other people are rarely significant and I could only think of "when They are sex again? ". And when you think of it, it's really pretty insane. Because it basically means that nothing here is not really valuable, but three teenagers are going to it and for me, at least it creates a great movie, stay clear from it and save your money (my? 7,50 is lost) , There are better art-house movies. <br /> <br /> I can give three stars for performance performance.
