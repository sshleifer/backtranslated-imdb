Before we get tired of them, there could be many disaster movies. Come, we can see them all day in the invention channel. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that the first part of this film is only a soap opera. The Great Predictor's grandson predicts and everyone starts crying about the family's name being terminated. The evil mother-in-law believes strongly to throw the wife on the arm's arm, with whom she wants to meet. What can you believe Wife wants to allow new wife! At the same time the mistress has a love for someone who has no wife, but she sends him packing. <br /> <br /> Soap opera is over now, earthquake is showing. <Br> <br /> Special effect is really good, but dubbing is bad. That's why I liked subtitles. Actors are all very experienced and won many awards, so you can see in Japan's best repetition story. <br /> <br /> However, the soap-opera story comes back to the end of Kichi.
