Why do people do bad movies? Does anyone know who works in the film was not a point to what they were making? There is something about this picture that throws me away, in addition to being "unreal, gracious and neutral" to this film. I appreciate them for trying, but sometimes the "actors" in the film tries hard work and does not have any single character or gentle intelligence. This movie deserves big zero. But I did not have that option, so it got 1.
