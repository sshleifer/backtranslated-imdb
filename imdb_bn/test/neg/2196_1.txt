[As a new resolution for this year 2005, I agree to write a comment for each movie shown in the theater (10%) or DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I must admit that the DVD has revolutionized this practice. For example, I can hear Cast's real voice, which is a necessary personality trait. In my country, non-French movies are dubbed and we end up with imperfection: the French voice is terrible, far away from its true voice! The same people or the same people with different people! <br /> <br /> And if everyone thinks my comment is unreasonable, well, in 2006, I will stop my reviews ... Ah, AH .... So, enjoy them now !!! ! <br /> <br /> My summary is not the story, location, cast is very enjoyable <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The talented actress is able to capture the film with the viewers .... <br /> <br /> This is a feminine "memorable" reminiscent .... So if you find a moment of life in your life, the scene of this movie is even worse Because the life of Sandra is a mess ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For natara touch) .... <br /> <br /> In fact, at the beginning of the film, his sad life, tragic life forever, until finally came back. .. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the time: * WarGham *
