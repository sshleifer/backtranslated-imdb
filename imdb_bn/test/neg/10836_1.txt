Killer Flood: The Dum the Day: 1/10: Finally, a movie whose title is a vague proof. Even under the low quality criteria of disaster movies, I allow me to correct me in a rude way, even the low values ​​created for TV disaster films are also really horrific. Where do I start? <br /> <br /> The embankment model may once have seen the pictures of the dam, but I doubt it. Most of the dams, especially big power stations for generating large electricity, are not near me, I do not know some of the power plants, some sluice gates for water, even high pressure electrical wires or two. <br /> <br /> The dam is slightly less. Two, count them, two employees of the entire staff of the dam, three counter. And the crews are apparently imported from a cliched ridden two-film film, because they have heroically and inadvertently eulogized full of death scenes with floating images floating by grandchildren. Defying a jolt among them is a way of defying that managed to get the shot by the dam. <br /> <br /> Special effects can inhibit the illuminated water on the water flowing through the city, which is a 60-year-old Gadzila film like Matrix. A three year old drawing with a blue crayon on film stock will result in good results. Since the disaster money shot disagreed, how is the rest of the picture? <br /> <br /> No need to say the script and follow the special effects. This is rough no diamond. This is rough. So what is it a guilty pleasure? The killer flood is awful enough to create some smiles and the film is a great disqualification that creates a classic of good culture, but bad disaster films will have to be fine like wine. (Internal, Shower, Weather) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green, which is hidden from the flood of Dampster with a golden neon, is sometimes thought of as a great hunter Henry Fonda is a killer bee. Check back with me in 2024.
