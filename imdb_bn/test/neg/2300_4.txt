The murder of Red Comin in Griffers Abbey was a long way in the most horrible thing ever happened in the Scottish War of Independence and the fights (and murders) in the church were not unusual. Many times, Robert Brusus's wife, daughter, and two of his sisters were captured during the war in church, where people were killed. And it compares to the massacre of the Warwick, where at least 8,000 warfare (some, yes, in church) is killed in English. <br /> <br /> It says that this is not a good movie. This is a little damaging to Robert Murray's absolutely stupid spark presentation. Whatever the Bruce anyway, it was not a mess. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that they did such a good thing because someone could create a really good fight for a war which is so amazing that it sounds like there was something completely lost in the Battle of Methwa that was hidden from the long guerrilla war to Bennkorn Until it was hidden in hiding. Even though this is not it. Written and played badly and played weak in a large amount. very bad!
