"The Curse of Michael Maywers" is a very frustrating piece to deal with a fan of the Halloween series. After the very disappointment of Halloween 5, this series reached near near plot lines with stupendous abstraction between a teenage ritual dedicated to the witchcraft and Michael Mayer's worship. "Curse of Michael Mayras" raises the rise of blood and gore, but represents a loss of honesty in the series. This is very bad, because this last film for Dumbled Plansense. Lumice's character. Pleasance is now very good as some good screen moments (if your favors are worth more than the series) and he says "very retired doctor". Unfortunately, he died before the film ended, and at the end of the film it is very clear that the original climate scenes have never been realized. From the beginning, starting with credit, the Hollywood movie made for Halloween 6 has more sense, like the block-buster Horror Flickr, which started in 1978. A faithful Hollywood former student should have demanded more from this film, ... Lumis and Donald Plus are more eligible.
