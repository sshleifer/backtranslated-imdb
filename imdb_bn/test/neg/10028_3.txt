Stupid hikers go camping on the hills of Utah to run only in a killer, stupid gypsy. <br /> <br /> Most of the runs in the Call Slasher film, which are mostly suffering from lack of imagination. Hunting Characters All are well-known idiot teens, which means that nobody really cares about them, we will be surprised only when they die! It is not mentioned that there is a very many sugar moment and is pad with endless, unnecessary nature footage. However, there are few moments of interest in Slashar's fans, touch the occasional touch of the atmosphere, and Don Pikey is a decent music score. Still, it is a normal business for dead-campra movies. <br /> <br /> There are better films in this vein, but it can be quite spectacular for all the slaughtered fans to die. Although Don (1981), Falcon Turn (2003), even before the Just Just Just Watch of The Final Terror (1983), he could be rewarded further. <br /> <br /> * ****
