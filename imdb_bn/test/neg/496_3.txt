Here is another great movie critic will love. The problem is that this is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie court is easy. Ten criminals escaped from prison, went crazy after tenth, and told where their treasure. <br /> <br /> There are several crystals in the first half, which are very broad and the second half is a protagonist of a character. Fantasy and sadness <br /> <br /> <br /> Two half is not just a mixture. Personal scenes work very well (those who are a new friend of the Filipino bride who are happy, their friends make theirs, although they are not a part of the audience by tugging with heartwarming people who work in the restaurant.) They simply do not mix with each other. <<br /> <br /> This movie is not full set up. One view shows that boys are suddenly looking to change to buy a snack under a desert vending machine. The next scene is a full crew sitting in a restaurant. Where do they get dresses and wigs? (Including both big guys and a midget in crew) How can they get all the clothes and money to buy food? And the most annoying is why they drag? They can definitely face the guys in the drag and there is something more memorable for the witnesses than to eat it clothed as a big man and a dwarf women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because everyone else except the old guy seems to mix in each other. (In fact, they wear white jumpsuit in most of the movies), very few characters have developed in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks a mental punch. Since we are often trying to find out who is in the scene of their personal wages. <br /> <br /> The second half contains excellent wonderful camera shots and a big emotional moment and a great symbol which makes the film look great. It is also a boring movie which slowly and slowly. <br /> <br /> 9 A big disappointment of the soul, these reviews focus on a great movie and it is nowhere to be found, fortunate itself to find out.
