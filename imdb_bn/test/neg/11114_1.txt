I knew this movie that it would be horrific, but if it does not break new and revolutionary roles to make the festival as acceptable as entertainment, then the enemy The plot is deep rising with cruddy effects and HORRID acting. This line ... Well ... there is no way to put this film down because I think the words in English are not even made. The sad part is that filmmakers thought they were actually doing something good. You will not trust your eyes by seeing how many films you snooze without trying to hide it. Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Zipper Crippers' Off / Plot Devices are directly and the list can go on forever. However, unlike any film, it is less than just celluloid stools. The most incredible thing about this movie, the way it tries to be able to succeed but fails is that it is gimli-frekin '- in itself. How can they afford John Rhys-Davies but do not have decent effects, writing, actors, or sets. Really horrible ... and that kind of good is not bad.
