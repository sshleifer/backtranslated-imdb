There is no esperanto in this movie <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie specially because the IMDb lists Esperanto as the language used. But IMDB is wrong about the language used in this movie. There is absolutely no esperanto. It's almost all English navigas with few words. If you are looking for an Esperanto movie then do not watch this movie. Instead, other options are "idiots dellight" (with Clark Gabelle), which contains some esperanto, "incubus" all Esperanto (although completely incorrectly stated), and Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Detector" has some Esperanto road signs. Some of the words "Gottaka" were supposed to be esperanto, but I never heard anything. <br /> <br /> Another critic is correct. This movie is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend your time elsewhere.
