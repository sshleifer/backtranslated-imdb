I saw this film right in the middle of going through a breakup. At 3:30 in the morning, I was taking a nap with quick snack. It was not very bad at the time, but since I tried to see it, I could not get it as I did that night. <br /> <br /> At that time I thought it was nice and I loved the variety of characters, even though they could make my opinion better than Goran Vi. But the one thing that kept me watching was the character of Heather and her husband's tragic "commitment", which she does not want anymore, which makes me feel sad for him and at the same time makes him a route. (I think I was in the same situation at the time, probably because I loved her so much.) Not a bad movie, but for the sake of praise, you have to stay in a lot of romantic characters and hope you never have.
