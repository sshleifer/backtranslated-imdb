Of course, all this dirty question raises, 'Does a fantasy really need another parody movie as a self-referential key teen comedy?' The harmful 'horror movie' (i and ii) can go as far as possible with the formula - 'any other teen movie' is not really rational or casual link. <br /> <br /> This plot originally runs a cone line between parody and tribute ('John Hughes High School'), based on Fairflash Kinnfick 'Seas All That That'. Everything from 'American Beauty' to 'Worcester Blues' is excavated for reference. The result is finally an unfulfilling visitor experience. The negative aspect of placing a carbon copy of 'She's All That' is that we all know where it's going. And if we did not, then the jokes would be meaningless. <br /> <br /> There are rarely to recommend here. Token gross-out view (a leakage toilet) seems to be bad among all the 'sentient' references here. There is a sunny moment - the song sends the fun and funny line to the audience. It stinks, does not see it.
