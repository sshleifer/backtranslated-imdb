I've ever seen this worst version of William Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece. It seems that the filmmaker did not actually read Shakespeare's text. No, they took what they wanted from the movie of Lyons's Olivier. The plot has stagnated and its requirements have shrunk, even though non-canon has created turmoil between Olivier Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Instead, have we "torn a bit in the Kingdom of Denmark"? Casting is another problem. I understand that there were many weak bits in the film Branag (Robin Williams and Charlton Haston thinks in mind), but it has very few moments. I do not like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is stale. Mel Gibson's unclear Stuble is annoying, and he is often surprised if he has any idea what he is saying. Most actors think that only this part is remembered - they know less about what is being said than the sophomore in high school. <br /> <br /> If you want a Hamlet version then see Kenneth Brunge or even the licensees Olivier. To be frank, even Disney's Hamlet is good.
