With all kinds of films up and down in the carrier, it tried one of Altman's science fiction, and it clearly shows that it is not its fort. <br /> <br /> The picture is really stagnant. It's a great studio that is trying to jumper in the experimental theater inspiration and a studio Post-Star Word bandwagon (after that the film does not seem to be modeled) but you can imagine that the studio is a different Paul Newman Saif-fi film) . The story is incomplete, the characters are among us strangers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the movie is so bad thinking that the lack of plot Starting with, it's not really about anything. <br /> <br /> Designed to confuse the confusion, the photography has been restored by the blues on the edge, and the score is terrible. However, "Quintet" has a redeeming feature. The film is not clearly illustrated in snow and ice, but the interior is also kept cold. You see the breaths of each scene actors. You really feel cold.
