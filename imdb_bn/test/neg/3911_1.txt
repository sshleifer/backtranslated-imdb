There is only one word describing this picture: BAD !! I do not even know why this movie was made, or how they played Dennis Hooper in this movie. Stuart Gordon is such a good director and hopper is a good actor. The image is stupid stupid. I like the idea of ​​"square pig" and there was an interesting love scene associated with cyberbug, except for the other, to avoid this film.
