As a flagship show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is the locale of the major fall of G4 TV; This is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it carries sex to try and cover its tedious error. His predecessor, Screen Savers, was a venue for problem solving technology problems and the latest and greatest scouting of technology. It was an excellent show with a favorite staff and it was fun to see some modes and other tests that could keep the order together. <br /> <br /> Tech4 acquisition by G4 disturbed the station's longtime fans, but the initial income was actually committed. The emphasis on gaming was an excellent addition and I really enjoyed many coverage of E3 and other big entertainment events. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, AOTS now stands as its former self-shell. Channel supervisors have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and on any other side that may enjoy drill from young adult males. As a result, it also covers games that beat Olivia Munn or spend as much time turing the adult film industry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The same problem is that the young gamblers may find gaming in the G4 - the active gaming community is 10-15. Instead, they can look at more adult listeners. A channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like that are expected. At G4, it's tragic. <br /> <br /> At least men's targeted spikeships, like CSI, have good programming. AOTS, and G4, have very little left to offer. <br /> <br /> Very bad, really.
