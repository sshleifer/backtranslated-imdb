The plot of this movie is very thin, and there are not many performances. Val Kilmer - I do not know why he agreed to do this movie - plays a minor role as a gang leader. In short, tired of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> A man, who is decorated like an archeology / religion professor, is exploring a small region of Moscow, some of which are connected to the construction of railways and to Bolshevik. Revolution In that history, the tragedy of a church invented the "spirits" and the spirits of a dirty purpose inside the underground ruins. Professor decided to appoint a friend to find his friend underground and hire some of the Russian guide. The whole film is based on this plot and has some underground footage and some cameras have effects; Like many people who can be seen in "Day Watch", "Night Watch" etc.
