This movie was terrible. It was very terrible. <br /> <br /> Most boring trials are conducted. Defense attorney is allowed to ramble on and when asked a witness without the prosecution without any objection. He attacks the children brought to witness with cruel anger and repeatedly loses them to tell them that they lie, they are liars. These are not the only issues that they subject to child victims of sexual abuse. The trial is stupid and it has completely destroyed the movie ... (laws and order courtesy me for the court's accuracy).
