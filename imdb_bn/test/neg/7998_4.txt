This is a very famous ninja movie but it is not a beautiful movie. If you want to see some ninja and some statistics but want to know something about the rabbit. For this movie only for devotees and those who want to nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the movie are best. You can see Ninja figures and battles just in this scene. The middle of it, almost as bad as the movie. Acting is bad. Shaw (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic but he can not fight well. The scenario is also not good. Its so easy Franco Nero comes from his best, old friends army and war. He also protects him from the Mafia, but having sex with his wife (go to bed) and his friend know this but Niro will not say anything negative. Is possible in this life? <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie started a trend; Ninja movie There is also Nizami master show Kasugi, but some battle scenes are not realistic and even not even with Shiur. This film is down to the average even it's a classic.
