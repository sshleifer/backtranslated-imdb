This film was a child in his writings and was ridiculous in his visual effects. The scenes where the father Marin stays in his bed and a proud native signs his poor performance and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. Jump from the scene to the scene from the scene. The initial writing does not give any information to Kalpana and does not leave any place for doubt. At one point the lady doctor said that she thinks that this city will be "soon to explode" from all insane phenomena. Actually, there was nothing in the movie to make the line relevant. From the terrible work of this movie, I never knew that there was no tension in the village. If you go to Chess movies then go ahead and hire it, but if you want to accomplish this, check Exorcist: Start
