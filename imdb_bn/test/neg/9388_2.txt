Positive, I would say it's pretty nice to see. Negative, there is not enough reason to mourn the life for more than 2 hours in front of the screen. Long, whiny and dotless. And I do not want to say this, I really wanted to like this movie, it seems that everything was going for it, there was a so-called "buzz" and there was trouble to track it apart. I tried a bit more to the story, I believe it was fantastic. And I hope the team will do wonderful work in the future, they will definitely have the power. But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, to go this one.
