How well started (and quite annoying) quickly sank into a boring world. <br /> <br /> The Dreamer (Twisted Sister Infamy) has clearly written Screenplay and has the potential of cyber-pitch-free spots, they are really outstanding pensing here, bad conversations, and you can see it in the greatest non-endings of all time. . Despite some useless performance, the director handles a truly blurred first reel. It looks like a really good budget effort. <br /> <br /> There is no such luck. The plots go over all the maps and the Snyder's character deliberately drop psychological luck cookie lines with the permission being passed for meaningless conversations. Bad, supportive throwing just registers, and only half the credible dialogue comes from a young girl who helps an intelligence navigate on the internet. <br /> <br /> What is a great idea? Oh, and there's a new twisted sister song, if you care.
