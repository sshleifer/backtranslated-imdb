I was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors in "Dear John", but it was very slow; And I felt that the screenplay and direction of both policy-makers hampered the flexibility. I usually enjoy the film adaptation of these novels. Surprisingly, I think the film has done an excellent job of portraying realistic military activity. <br /> <br /> Cinemography was very good with love letters, with enough focus on each word or phrase of each letter. I feel that Channing Tait became a very "hung-dog" series of expressions in response to losses.
