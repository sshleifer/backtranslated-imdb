Powerful as the real story of Phulna, this book was published before it was released from prison and it had the opportunity to say it. <br /> <br /> This is based on his diaries, but he is uneducated. How does that work? <br /> <br /> She said that some parts of the film are correct and the acting is not bad, some sensitivity is shown. <br /> <br /> This story is about to be old in the TV series. The order is in many hours. <br /> <br /> Read his autobiography. Highly recommended. This is a fantastic story
