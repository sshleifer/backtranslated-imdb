The discussion has been one thousand times. "Venice Merchant" is antisemitic? (I think it is.) Is it always wrong to point out this little bit of antitemismism in great piece of art? (I do not think it.) Does this game not stain fame as Shakespeare's best playwright in the world? (I think it.) If he plays a role in a certain racist objective it does not? (I do not think it was.) Michael Radford knew this, and for this reason, he added a suggestion about the tragic situation of the Rev. Venenic Jews in his film Renaissance. <br /> <br /> is in vain; This is what always has to do with the game and the new makeup is only a first (but vain) that anyone has dared to set a permanent set that keeps permanent turmoil, because its degree of opposition will not be particularly disappointing because the game comes in the name of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time in hating people - Shylak? Why are we appointing a great and serious actor like Al Pasino, if everything eventually gets destroyed in this distraction (but hey, I'm irresponsible - Shakespeare-wrote this) Court room scenes And now I want to learn it myself, Shylock is just like myself. <br /> <br /> He claims his claim, that the deal is not very responsible - Christian Antonio, who always looks down on him, signed a full awareness of the outcome. Sure, Shylock claims is cruel and vain, but that's not the point. What we see (or see) is that he is a man who has been humiliated for his life, all the things that he has on his hatred. I think, some people like condolence may be a little inappropriate in this way. <br /> <br /> But this game / movie (they're one and the same) is doing now .. Become a soap opera! He is cruel crazy with his knife, awful (rather short-minded) listener, poor "victim" tied to his chair. True, Antonio accepts his fate, but why can not he say "sorry" just one word? I think we will not lose a lot of talk about the ridiculous verdict of young Dattore from Padua; This is a truly "popular verdict" which is not much different from the Nazis's judgment of 400 years later. From one minute to the next, this Jew has plundered everything, sentenced to being a baptized Christian, and kicked. <br /> <br /> Is it horrible ??? Of course not. The story is moving towards the romantic complexion of the ring and its happy ending. <br /> <br /> What can learn Libby's Jewish museum in Berlin and similar places around the world are the germs that are often neglected by mass because embedded in the alleged allegations for the majority of the minority or for some people who are so devastated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it just does not work). I do not think anyone can be compelled to be kind. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie; Not particularly for the Oscars.
