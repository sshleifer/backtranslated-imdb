The Garden State was one of the best medium films. The film looks like a set of a collection that the author (Zach Bref) had instead of a solid story. The isolated plot can be even more compelling if it is not isolated with unmatched scenes that are nothing but "jokes." Eventually, these scenes are often released on the conversation (Jack walks walking on a walk, birds under crazy, shouting on the scene, going to the list). <br /> <br /> <br /> The main character is flat, isolated, and finally impossible, apparently with his father, where he ignored his father's problems selfishly, recently with a deceased wife, and the most vague of droning about himself, "What will I do with my life?" Problem. <br /> <br /> The film ends when Andrew (Zach Bref) does not decide to return to LA because he can not remove himself from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman) whom he has known for two days. . Which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is the love of the first sight that cures professional conflicts ... Surely you can interpret this as abuse of priorities, but if it is better in this case. Much better <br /> <br /> <br /> This image does not know what it wants to be. A towel in a drama, a comedy, a teenage prostitute film, or other things. I'm not as a single-class person, but a person who likes multi-style pieces by Stanley Kubrick. Because I think it does not work for the Garden State because it moves around rather than combining discipline together; <br/> <br /> I have heard a lot to tell Jack Breach a bit, it was his first feature film and he started from the beginning. As Director, Author, and Chief Actor It is dominant as a first movie, I think he can do well with the money he has. For the very first time, film director director Michel Gondry ("Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington") Perhaps it would be better if he was arrested or instructed or played for writing. Zach Breath is a talented actor, probably his second attempt will not be so tiring and confused.
