British British director Alan Gibson's "Dracula A.D. 1972" has been recognized as one of the least hungry entries in the Hummer studio series about the immortal bloody of Bram Stoker. In fact, it was the first time since Terrence Fisher's memorable "Hacker of Dracula" (1958) that Christopher Lee and Peter Kushing fought each other as a fierce enemy. A few years later, they will restore the same role in Hammer Dracula: "Dracula's Shantik Rights." In addition, it was Hammer's second-to-last Dracula, which was performed as Lee's notorious fanster. For the record, "Dracula A.D. 1972" was the seventh Hummer Dracula. <br /> <br /> The sensational suggestion prepares you slightly differently than the production of this great horror membrane of 1872. Eternal Contest Count Dracula and her generosity Professor Lawrence Van Helsing literally came to the neck of each other in a clever car in the Hayde Park in London. Car accidents, and Dracula arose hugging half of a wooden wheel with his scattered mouth wrapped in his chest. Of course, Christopher Lee had to catch this broken wheel against his body, but the script hit his own way quite a lot. Count is over and his opponent Van Helsing also does the same. However, Dracula's disciples hijacked the counter ring and kept the vampires' axes a bit scary to keep them safe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A funny young man, Johnny Alukard (Christopher of "grass blade" Meeting with the name), who loves to raise a hat with a group of Hippies, which crushes the parties and drives the British police with their antics. Alicard could be descendant of Dracula's slaves. Now, the roll of Alcard's Count and his blood is in the blood. AlucaCard chooses the sight of an impure church to arrange a black mass. He invites you to appear in this black filled iron (Super Corolla Munro "The Spy Who Loved Me"), the geneer (Marsh Hunt), and Jessica Van Helsing (Stefani Bicham) because it is a bit different from them. Surprisingly, they revive the count, and the evil bloody person sets his eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after discovering the body of Laura's body, Scotland Yar Inspector Murray (Michael Coels of "Doctor Who and Dolce") requested for help from Van Helsing's modern day birthday Lorimir (Peter Cushing). Dakula wants to take revenge on Van Helsing by taking the next grandson as her bride. Laurimia tracks Alaskard; They fight in Chelsea's apartment, and young vampires drown in a tub of water. Remember, the running water is as sunny and deadly as vampire vicious as crucified. Van Helsing found Dracula in the church in the desert waiting for her daughter to count. Van Helsing and Dracula Tunnel. Van Helsing is flowing in the face of the Hello Water Dracula. The vampire is waiting for him to enter the open graveyard, and he is separated again. <br /> <br /> The main problem of "Dracula Eddy 1972" is that we do not get enough amount of li as calculation, although we do not get enough cushing as Van Helsing. In addition, painter Don Hutton kept the drummula near the Ramshekal church and did not allow the vampire to leave the city. Despite its low budget, "Dracula A.D. 1972" can be very good. The visualization of contemporary Van Helsing to embrace Alicard and to make Dracula almost ridiculous. You think that he knew about this backward spelling technique. Until you panic horror movie, this one will make you javascript. Occasionally, Gibson presents us with a fantastic close up with Dracula with eyeballs of our fantastic fangs and blood shots, but this is almost as awesome as this chiller gets, and that's not saying much.
