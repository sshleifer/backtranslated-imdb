I'm not sure what the appeal was to the movie, but I could not find it. It's really a long, barely credible, rarely strain conversation in one set of three sons. <br /> <br /> It can not move anywhere, so the characters are almost intricate, so the underlying plot is evenly the same. It's lost on me, of course the movie revolves around. <br /> <br /> One thing that prevents you from walking is that it is an unrealistic possibility that it can have a specific point or meaningful measure, and that all the jarring, along with the satirical personality, are played quite reasonable. But you have to curb yourself for endless dialogue, on many occasions, teach that the teaching will stop% * and * for a moment.
