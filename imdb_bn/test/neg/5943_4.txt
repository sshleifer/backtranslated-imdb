"Midnight Clear" has a great premises. On the eve of the Battle of Bulls, an educated farmhouse, surrounded by an unfinished mission, is more educated than the unfinished leaders, sent by very bright GI. GI is facing a group of German exhausted war, and it becomes clear that they do not want to fight anymore <br /> <br /> There are problems there. It's really quite simple. The Germans want to surrender, they do it and the end of this film. If the Germans want to fight, they do it and that's the end of the movie. So GI and Germans throw snowballs at one point instead of playing games with each other. Interesting for one or two scenes, but quickly became very annoying. After all, these are GERMANS. The enemy Nothing in this movie reminds me that they should not be taken captive or shot. The film seems to make them more humane. Indeed, most of the German characters want to shoot me, with a scene where the German officer refuses to deal with the Jews or refuses to surrender a mere listened person! Why should I care about such characters? Just let them shoot and move on to the Battle of Boulogne. An excellent scene: GI is coming back from Germany, where the Germans had their sights but not the fire. When walking across a clearing, they understand a group of Germans have their level on their mausers. Germans are about 100 yards away. GIS then does something that I have never seen any GI work in a silhouette. They throw their rifle and throw their hands! It can be great in the movie, it's a perfectly intelligent response from your target rifle to the distance. Although it seems to be too far, in reality it is a point-blank range for rifles Anyone I worked on in this movie that was a cruffler would be seamless!
