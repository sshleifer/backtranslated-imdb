Well, I must admit that this movie is laughing occasionally in my face. OK, but it's not a good movie. Most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and are really unconvincing. Do not give them all the great acting performances, but some really try, but fail because their characters are badly written. The perfect example of Julia Cochities: She changes her eating habits from one conversation to another, she does not drink alcohol, she drinks champagne allergic afterwards, she feels very good for most people (actually she is) but still with the looks "perfect "Finished with the fat, and refused to give some" realistic "chance to the boy and the last Yant ... the last one is chessy, though I like one of the final scenes, when everyone finally stops speaking and the director gives us a chance to breathe again. Shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughters (mostly because of it, I guess) about sex and relationship and probably offer some minimal amusement. Yet, the whole picture is a big stereotype and there is nothing really special about it.
