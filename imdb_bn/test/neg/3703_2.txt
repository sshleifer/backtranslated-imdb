If it is not for editing curses and an impressive blur, then a character fingers the other, but it will be easy to make this low-budget snooze mistake for a cy-fi channel pilot. The destruction of a group of telekinetics is primarily endowed ambiguously enough with the protagonist, trying to survive a telenetic plot against government's plot to destroy a government, largely trained as a military weapon. Well, without speaking of the film, annoying, anticipated and even interesting special effects. Top-billed Louis Gossett, Junior played a minor role which has triggered an evil government bureaucratic program and now wants to remove all traces. She walks through the part and is hard to understand why she is disturbed. Another member of Cast is a script that claims a little bit of a decent job.
