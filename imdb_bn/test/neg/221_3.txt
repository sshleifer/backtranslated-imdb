I am not generally angry to review with the rebels, but in this case I will exception. The first scene of these films is weak and then when it goes to a handful of meat and potatoes it sucks. This movie was largely for the bad guys because captain-day-day was unbelievable and there was no connection with him or you did not do anything to like him. The lead actor gave poor performance and Lawrence Fishburn or Matt Dillon could not save the film. Sometimes there is an open or spectacular moment in a movie that might not be extraordinary. There is no one in this movie. If you want to look for a movie, nothing is going to cause you interest ... Do not choose this ... Save your money.
