I think the trash sucks really. I saw it a few weeks ago and I did not see that kind of C ** P in John Waters' female problem and it was worse. Dialogue, acting; It really stank, it was so bad it would leave me a movie and seek back my money. But I'm really glad that I saw it because I can say my honest opinion on him. Even though it stinks, this film will see.
