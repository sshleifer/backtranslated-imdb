So lam it's not even funny. A zombie infection overtakes a small college campus and backed up a couple of coups sent to find out the source of an official squad's outbreak prevalence. Not sure it is easy to ensure the confirmation of zombie DNA smoke. Once you have bitten you "one of them". The whole university has been fully infected by Amok-end-driven. <br /> <br /> This signal does not retrieve the dead body of death (2003). Stupid entertainment is done though. Any zombie freak added to just a few glimps of woman's nudity in pregnancy and bursts should keep happy. Creded Cast Members: Emmanuel Waghiyar, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Hague and Nadine Welazek. The word "f" holds an unimaginative script together.
