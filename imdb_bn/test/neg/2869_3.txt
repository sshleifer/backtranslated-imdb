I like the CCY and Vivo La Left, so I saw it for £ 1.99 for gamestation when I could not resist it. This is the first scriptered left-hander of the Left Magar, who wrote himself and Brandon Decimilo, and the whole CCY crew (Ryan Dunn, Rab Manja, Rek Yay, Jenny Revel, Don Vito etc.). Brandon is also an artistic director - it's one of the greatest capabilities of the movie - most of its color style is SiWiish - but it also shows growing. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>} Willo (played by Bam, named Vilo Valo on any occasion?) And Falcon (Bran) played his best partner who expressed anger through various stunts. <br /> <br /> It's like a linear story (which is actually very basic) and poor performance as it looks like CKY movies. His weird, generally super-churchmatic gang seems to bring out life from them when they know what their next words mean. Acting and scripting is mostly annoying, but the second half of the film is much better than the first (though expanded for 90 minutes), and Tony Hawk's Camomo, the sub-plot of Diccimillo, such as 'The Futuristic Invention Awards' And 'Diamond Bike', the soundtrack is very strong (it's not all the tricks and frosts - actually Bombfuk MC is in the use of his music. Images steals). Funny ideas in the second half of the film are more real - especially Don Vito has played a fair role in the next part - and the scene that seems to be stealing it. <br /> <br /> Movies will apply for those who like CKY antics, but are not the only original elements and fillers or story lines are bullish. Oh, and some would say that in Montage skating, especially in movies, good in 1998. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > The last 20 minutes of the documentary agreement with the RAB, the real talk of the crew and the crew's real feelings are unexpectedly to each other (Naturally came to the left as a whole, especially on the water of Rab's water) and the problem and Ryan right come across to the people of the world. The last ten minutes of a documentary contract with a friend (who is a free CKY member) is trying to insinuate heroin while in Magarara's house - and the gang (clearly App and Ryan) with careful care - otherwise a wonderfully gorgeous soft DVD. <br /> <br /> I was very cultural for £ 1.99 - although I hope the left is now invited and in short skits.
