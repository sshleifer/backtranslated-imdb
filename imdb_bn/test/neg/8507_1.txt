Debbie had a giant hit with the recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life"; DD Con movie with the same name, though, was a terribly embarrassing flop. Connie Michael Jaslo, who plays the man in Stereotyptical Uupie-Wangby, premixedly plays a miracle-hateful-weak girl. They are involved, but everybody knows that Jessley is not going to marry anybody who is not blonde and has been built, so sister is surprised when she pushes her. Not saying, sister is very embarrassed. Fortunately, she is writing a few songs in her extra time, and she thinks she's pretty beautiful. She calls it - can you guess? - "You are my life light." He hops in the car and sells his songs and drives from big cities to a new life. Now, I sat in the theater and saw the hopes of driving to the big city, "Greetings to the sky, finally we got all kinds of expositions. Now maybe something interesting will happen." And something interesting happened. Credit rolling. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was. The movie is not played badly, badly written, and badly portrayed, it ends in middle. This movie is really, deeply bad film, and we are not speaking civil-movies-bad things here. We start talking unmitigated flop, ending a real yawner from the beginning. If you like Debbie Boone songs in all ways then buy a copy of it. But this flash does not waste your time or money. This is a movie that you'll be happy about. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
