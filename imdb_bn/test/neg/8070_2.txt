Rollerskating Vampire ?! I'm sorry but for 80s that can easily be very impressive horrible ... you can give the original excuse of the original odd moment because it is parading old films and TV shows, but once it has been done, so the signal needs to be a little less camp, even Not too lazy! Alongside, the first film was in the presence of Chris Sardon - a person who can think of casual knitwear discoctures even seductive! - This is a lack of grief, so there was no 'danger' that happened, it just seems silly. <br /> <br /> I saw this just once when I was 7, but already already having a huge genuine fan I remember feeling I hate. To me, there is no signal to the freight night, a durable spoof that is not worthy of any valuation.
