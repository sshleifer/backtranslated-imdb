Comparison of the 1995 edition and it is inevitable. Sadly, this version is too small. <br /> <br /> Welding is unclear and played wood. The director got the impression of not being able to read the book, so can not understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Sir Walter Elliott has been portrayed as toxic but his unwanted fascination which was captured nicely by Redgrave (in the 1995 edition) can be found nowhere <br /> <br /> Musgrove sister is so unlikely, why nobody understands Why Wentworth or someone else will give their second glance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the 1995 edition, Hindu and Root emotions were able to express depth, both of them felt each other with their body language and facial expression. Many people do not understand that if anyone reads the book, they have been busy for years and years of regret. <br /> <br /> This product does not hold the mental complexity of the relationship of the original character. <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (he saw him in the first year), tension thick. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this version, when Lentia is welcomed, it really is invested, then there is no underground. In the 1995 edition, viewers watched Anne's Ventworth's anger. He is scaring his curiosity in front of Anne, as you say, "See what you have left, I do not need it or you will no longer want". <br /> <br /> She still suffers, if she thinks, like the scene where she asks her sister and Admiral to return home. In the 1995 edition, the viewer felt Anne's shock that he would take care if he was tired, we still feel weird that he still cared for. In this version, he did not go as he went to Lucia. <br /> <br /> The biggest, male or female, is talking with Anne Harville, who is completely locked. Actors are just reading lines with an emotional investment. <br /> <br /> When Ann Vincent's letter reads, he seems to be reading groceries. <br /> <br /> Experience the joy of bringing the 1995 edition, where the audience at its second chance. She reads the letter as we have with her. The director was reading the letters of both actors and you hear them both voice. Wentworth is full of feelings of depression, passion and hope, while Anne's first unbelievable is then developed to delight. <br /> <br /> There is more scenes after the release of this product, perhaps it was necessary to explain the viewer because only it happened. The 1995 version did not need to be explained, we knew and were very happy about the character. This product is the only thing for it, it keeps the Smith Smith sub plot, not the 1995 version. <br /> <br /> The original version of Austin was included in the 1995 edition. After marrying Emmy and Mr. Eliot, the scene that Admiral has conducted in Wentworth, wants to return to his home after the wedding (where he and Mrs. Kraft are hiring). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
