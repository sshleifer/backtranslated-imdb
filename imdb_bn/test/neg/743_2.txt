What a terrible adaptation The worst part was music. Saxophone mosaic and synthesizer playing in a story in the early 1800s ?????? The only character that did not allow me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight for my eyes to keep open, and I usually like Jane Austen movies. I did not even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should pay me to take it. Catherine and Henry eventually ran an enthusiastic kiss when I did not realize that they did not have any chemistry or hints around the movie that they cared about each other. Isabella and her brother's way were overdone; It was not a secret to me that he and his brothers discovered the part of the excitement of "Bad Boys" and Jane Austen's film, that you do not feel well. Perhaps it is probably on the list of ten bad films I have seen.
