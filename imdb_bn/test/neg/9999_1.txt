When we do not have anything else, most reality TV shows make people stupid for themselves, because it is not too fat or can not sing, or cooked at a lower cost than going beyond Hollywood's main ideas. In the last 15 years, I can not remember when something real or intelligent comes out on TV. Do our indebtedness with the left observer to fool ourselves? I used to think that such programs would run the whole circle, but each year they brought something new that is more weird than ever before. Ok so this one needs to lose weight in humans ... Most Americans need to lose weight. I just feel some degree enjoy enjoying the humiliated people. Maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else like a shake. I do not know, but I just want to find out something that does not insult your intelligence.
