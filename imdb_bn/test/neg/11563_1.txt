This movie is really bad. It seems to be mostly portrayed in a park or basement. There is a giant spider but we all see it one leg. Cheap cheap sock dolls with pistol teeth that have some insects that live in a cave. And this plot is a post-apocalyptic mambu jumbo cluster, which gives absolutely no knowledge. The whole thing is just ridiculous.
