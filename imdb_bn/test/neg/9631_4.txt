By the year 1971, Hummer's film studios were suddenly going on and it became more evident. Ryper's hand is an incident where the point is even frustrating - Jack's soul holds his own daughter! Yeah right, nobody was expecting a documentary but this plot seems to be scraping under the barrel for stupid firmness and you're asking yourself why the world's producer Jack the Ripper came in the story. Did this movie give a snappy title? <br /> <br /> Production prices are unexpected and cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap TVM feeling, but you know that you are not going to see hello horoscopes as soon as the title begins, because the music is ridiculous inappropriate. I think the composer was trying to touch the theme tune and touch but music is something similar to a soppy romantic movie. <br/> <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy this picture much and reminded me of the Fantum Raspberry Blower in London. I saw a couple of weeks ago I smiled to laugh two smiles
