Filmmaker Brian Forbes, who once displayed a light, symptomatic touch with incognito elements like "Light Down the Bound" and the original "Stepford Wives", completely wanders here. Not only was his guidance disqualified, he gradually adapted Sydney Sheldon's first novel; The result is fierce. Roger Moore played psychologically made for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, visible chin, a hot-under-the-collar police (it's easily the most shameful performance). Here are some of the only actors Eliot Gould, who knows about one or two things about enlivening a left script, for some acting. Bland, choppy, and cheap produced. **** No Star
