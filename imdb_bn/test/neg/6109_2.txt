Here is a movie which is clearly being sold to ex-Entrepreneur by the unidentified viewers of the banks. <br /> <br /> Hybrid of fiction and document has been tried, "Kadosh" falls into the chair in the cell. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is not perfect and insightful. To understand his runaway handling for details, there must be more than the first opening scene where it is very clear that the super-hero hero does not know how to properly enter his Tiffillin. More generally, the description of chaos style-style (in this case of Jewish super-customs) is not a manual role, a good documentary role; Later, you should provide an organizational policy for the viewer (a GSL, if you want), so that they emerge with a better understanding of the views. This clearly does not happen here, being super-sunny rituals even more enigmatic. The director seems to have done a decent job explaining it verbally during the film release campaign; Cinematic, however, is a serious case in stuttering it. On the other hand, as a fiction-feature, it enjoys the level of character, simplicity of the plot and the flexibility of the message. At some time I felt I was watching cartoons. (For example, on the wedding night consulation scene - without going into detail in corners, positions and dimensions ... well, technically this may not be a realistic screenplay of human sex, as it is, brutal.) <br /> <br /> Anyone in this picture There are subtleties. The imagination of the movie and the spirit of thought, to take an active part of the cinematic text, which I believe is a sign of a good feature, it is completely absent. On the contrary: I felt the film, occasionally being fed forcibly with chewing-up and way-with very clear ingredients. In fact, the director Geetai himself also placed an interview, an architect "painting the scenes in places" and for the appropriate and anticipated track, to paint the scenes with the passion to advance and advance the plot; But that creative, great dark, ornamental spark (let's look at "Kadosh" is not a tragedy), it is made on a two-dimensional screen that turns the spell into the world's expansion of the audience. Missing without a trace. Probably a work of a visual-engineer, perhaps an essential ideology; Certainly not a true film maker. What I saw was a passion-game of animated things instead of human blood-and complexity. Acting, by and large, the compulsive idea for this movie (sometimes tortured) has failed to overcome beyond this estimate of an idea. A notable, relatively minor, Mikve-Lady and Mother are both excellent and seasoned with Leo Koenig. <br /> <br /> It tantalize the rigid adhesion of the winning formula (eg Exotica a serving, plus heart-wrenching yet simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, especially politically correct) my interest buds. Here the bottom line, everyone says, I was just bored for a significant part of the movie. Despite the novel, perhaps as a movie set, to make the progress of using the ultimate guest neighborhood, for which Mr. Gatai and his crew deserve all praise, I got very na√Øve in the way of "Kadosh" (Nadus "Sire").
