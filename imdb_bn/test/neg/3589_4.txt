I know, it's a movie. But when real life is portrayed (in any case) it should be as faithful as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Gal√≠ndez" is not as accurate as it seems. No it really impressed as Dominican Republic. Actually, it is astonishing to see that the location of the filming in Santo Domingo was actually Cuba. And incredibly enough, movies with Cuban themes (Havana, the Lost City, Bitter Sugar, The Godfather Part II) were actually portrayed in Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they shoot this movie in Cuba instead of Dure? Spanish dialogue over Cuban pronunciation is awful! Those who do not have Dominican! At the historic level, Galinase would never have been hanged. He may have got shot, frustrated or he is going to die from inhuman torture. Then, thrown his body in the Caribbean Sea. But Trujillo did not order death by unknowing. It was not allowed in his sick mind. <br /> <br /> The acting is not distributed as expected. Harvey Keitel looks like he just hopes to paycheck. I like the leading actress of "Deep Blue Sea". Some of the rest Cast Cuban films were excellent, and likewise went for the selected shooting position. <br /> <br /> I'm suggesting "La Fiesta del Chiba" (Goose festival), sold by author Mario Vargas Llosa, by his cousin Luis Loosa. It's a little more realistic with Dominican history. Trujillo's character is very well-documented, and the phenomenon of melanage is treated very briefly in this movie.
