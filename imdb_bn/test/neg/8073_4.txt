I remember vacationing in Florida while broadcasting this movie. I had to set up my VCR to record it. The expectation is to kill me. I was announced almost half a year ago, as I was known about this movie. After 4 days of filming we returned from Florida, and I saw it early. As soon as I tried, I tried, but I could not do it. <br /> <br /> I am the big 3 Stage fan. And as I know a lot about them. So I did not expect to learn anything from the movie, and I did not. I was more interested in the picture and saw how accurate their information was. There was a lot of things wrong with this photo. Actors, scripts, reenactments, all can be much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is a very talented actor. But let's face the events, Moe Howard went out of his reach. She does not look like her, she does not sound like her, and thus, she can not act like her. Michael Chalcis is also very gifted, but Curly's screenplay did not score much with me, even though the coachie got sick, he worked very well. The screenplay of John Kasser's Sheem can be better exercised. It was more of a bad impression than an illustration. The worst was Joe Bessar. They skinned him, and he was really more annoying than he was. It was just plain laziness. I do not like Joe Shorts, because the movie looks like he never hurt. But he was not that annoying, and definitely not that thin. The best performance belongs to Ivan Handler. She was the most accurate stooge screenplay. Larry's character problem, his hair is very thick and the way is too red. I know that it is very technical, so why do not I like this movie and do not count it on my list. <br /> <br /> Go back to Shape, who has become my favorite stew. She is writing as a whining, quivering, chicken. True, he had many phobias, but he was not that bad. Initially, he did not leave the group because he was afraid of Ted Hailey, although he did not like him, left the shape because he had received another studio offer, which he could not easily close. Instead of truth, this film likes to wet her bed, does not lose her, runs in a closet, and is shamefully bowed out of the team. Another problem is that Shame made Columbia Shorts almost, Curley worked as Stuage, but only one, Fright Knight, which was shown to be her first child, was shown. His career is almost completely ignored. Plus, the lousy editing happened a terrible and most flawed error. Shamp was born in early 1895 and died in late 1955. How old is his age? Well, here's a hint, not as a movie 59. <br /> <br /> to write now, which I think only this movie was flawed due to its exit. Some of the lines can be fooled and improved and / or can be launched better than them. One line that really got me, was at the end of the movie, when Ma oe prototype was watching how IPok was working. <br /> <br /> "We do that, the brow is in contact with the bone and not the eyes, although the film looks real." This line was poorly written and weakly kept in film. This may be one of the lines that the audience says! Wonderful and I'm sure it's done with some people, but the last part of the movie is not the line's place. A good place to ask you? When they look for the first time in Colombia and are familiar with the sound effects machine. I initially knew there was no sound for Ipok, but for example Mou said, "What about this?" And eyepokes curly or Larry Zeus White then says, "Are you okay?" Or "how are you that?" There is a lot of wrong place in this movie, which is a clear sign of the script being run out. Another name is the origin of the simp, although it is not bad, and so I will release that slide. <br /> <br /> What does this picture look like? It is screwed by stooges by Colombia, which they explain. I'm not sure that ladder was a wrong boy, but it was a dramatic stuff that could make viewers sympathetic to them. I know this film was a drama. I do not know everything is going to be crisp and clear and absolutely perfect. However they made some material and they ignored the real components that had serious conflict with each other. For example, the stroke of the colony is not even about how it happened in real life. I know, I know, the drama, but the purpose of the drama is to make real events more dramatic. Curly stroke movies in real life are more dramatic than showing what they do. Here's what really happened. While sitting on a scene close to the screen, the curly was sitting, a scene was shot, they summoned him for the fight scene but there was no response. Mother went to take her away and took off her younger brother's head, half paralyzed, unable to talk, and her face drops. Md said, Baba? And try to help him from his chair. The poor curly drops her knees. Then called ambulance. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie was not terrible, but it was certainly not good, even OK. This image portrays helplessly and incorrectly stooges and sometimes goes overboard with the drama. This movie contains incorrect, long list. If you do not believe me, see a stroller named Stregel in the threestooges.com news forum. It's about one and a half long. I can slide some things in the movie. But others were ineligible. The three stoges were gifted, and most of today's comedy is far away from what they have done. Do not believe me See Simpson, and more so Renn and Stimpy. But these pictures fail to capture their talents. It is more important to keep them in trouble, which is important, but if the title of the movie can be three stugges, it will have to portray their consciousness and basicity more than anything else.
