Leonard Rochetter and Frances De La Tour do not carry this film, not the struggle, because the script was fully accumulated outside the old episode. When it came out, it was a real disappointment because it was also done in a bus ticket budget. Attempts to move out of the house - which are awkwardly unrecognized, there is a bad thing - a picnic does not work simply with a boxing match in fiction, rugby, and local gym. Most of these are not perfect - especially the character-light setup for better spots. That said, the interplay of Rossiter and De La Tour (and anyone else with him) is mostly ridiculous; They may even operate soda siphon gag, but you can literally see struggles with reflexed script recycling that changes the plot through half. Don Warington did much less than 'Black', and because of the random script hack, Christopher Strawley changed the character at least twice. And finally, in the TV series he often did (though you do not remember - you can read the scripts), the Erich Chapel allows you to finish the 'end of time'. Are they filmmakers, or are they too frustrated for the film business? Rossiter and De La Tours are always funny but as a film, it's a fondly remembered TV series, an awesome PostScript. Slit
