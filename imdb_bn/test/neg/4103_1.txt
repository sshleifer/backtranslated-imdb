This picture of my friend is recommended to me. I can not see it because my friend is a video game type. But name and cover look good for some reasons. I was so wrong. I mean first of all, what's up with their case? And acting! It seems they got the people of Bern. Except for Ban Kingley. And why did he have this movie? He thought it was a comedy! But I did say special effects were quite good. But that was the only good thing. I want to say seriously, the movie is worse than Perl Harber. And that's actually a understatement. Everyone must think, "Oh, I'm paying it so it does not matter to the worst movie in the world." I used to understand why anyone would make such a film if they got to film, edit, produce, write and post their best friends for filming and editing. Probably one of the worst sci-fi movies. One really jacked up the film
