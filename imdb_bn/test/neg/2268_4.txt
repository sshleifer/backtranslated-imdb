Shawwas can be a good story, but the director completely frees the talent. I do not know when he will stop. The story when people call for confusion, then ten minutes of the scene imitate the confusion of man. When the story calls for a little background history, then ten minute views of the bracelet are visible. When the story calls for throwing a baby tantrums ... you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Do not mention the extreme tension so that you can count the nose hair of the human. There is a big screen movie, this movie should be watched on 13 TVs. Also, Amartya Subhash is seen as a great actress, which I have seen for a long time. <br/> <br /> I can give it 4/10 because the matter is different, because the story is not bad. Actually got a movie like Shawwas. Indian film scene from the Indian entrance to the Oscars, but there is no idea about the status of Indian judicial committees. The film is not good because its not good.
