Jack Frost comes back with an army of Staphofam balls that can be shot by the loaded super-sockers of the margaritas. How's that for a plot? The film relies on the ridiculous determination that when it dies with the BBQ team and it is struck by the carrot, it only raises one eyebrow. You can also say that even the whole movie is skating at thin ice (or-boom-tees). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " But actors do not excuse the desire to participate in such a final trip. <br /> <br /> For those fans, hope for Jack Frost, be ready to accept him. As a Falic Carrot growing up the beach with free over-the-word comments
