I was horrified of this movie. I understand that it was shot in a small budget but the act was terrible and the film was just plain. The plot was predictable and the central character was a disrespectful moron. In fact, all the letters were disrespectful and were not completely improved. Someone related to the audience movie one. It is supposed to be suspicious but it is very difficult to "in" the movie if you are not worried about the characters. Someone felt like an outsider forcing me to tell a stupid story. All Plot Twists were very little at the end - I was actually supposed to "shocked me" when I was laughing. All in all, I thought it was a really bad movie.
