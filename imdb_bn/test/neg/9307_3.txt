Mr. Disaster Saturday's morning Warner Bros. cartoon's memorable non-stop disaster and a deliberate series of death experiences. Like the coyote that came down from the arc five times to climbing, "leading man" (like a child growing up child) always led to the postponement of his meeting with Grim Ripper. <br /> <br /> This Australian "Wonderful" is seemingly unfunny, and sometimes even depressing. 2 (for 10) for a visual stunt (some never try to call Duffy) and using bright colors (like advertising high-class national laundry detergents). <br /> <br /> An age bracket where this "comedy" could find the following. I've definitely passed that age long ago. Calling all preteens: Here for a "ha-ha"!
