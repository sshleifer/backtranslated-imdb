It was a voice of a person who almost ended up watching the second episode of Rome and grabbed the opportunity to see "what happened later" - this movie easily closes at the end of Rome. If you see hatred in Rome, but a historic accuracy is a foul mudded screw-fest, you can enjoy Imperium: Augustus But, if you think Rome is a thrilling thing, if you enjoy a complex conspiracy, acting frustrating and enjoying the act of the actors, Imperia will obviously express you as an extremely horrible, unnecessary and exhausting soap opera, which is not with much freedom. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I especially dislike the film of Cleopatra Rome as sexually transmitted sexual immorality. The woman must have a lot of strength and dignity, and the Imperium's actress will make the part fit better. O'Toole and Rampoling are good, and so are some others. But then ... if you know - and love - like a very cool groin, you'll find his illustration in Imperia - a crying mother is like chicken bone - absolutely ridiculous. Imperium is supposed to be some malicious characters, but this actress relies heavily on staring at men and much more. You will find no interesting female characters in this epic. There are also ridiculous mecensas, which we see as a scrolling drag queen, although she has found little historical evidence that she was such (she is once known as "cheerful to his delight" in anniversary). <br /> <br /> Internal rather small and clichés over clichés. Cleopatra is larger than a computer game or a game room for children in Egyptian theme parks. There really is a looooooooot of poor 3D graphics that are not up to the standards of 2003. <br /> <br /> August is presented as a series of Augustus flashbacks. So we take a quick look at some historical events, some of which are well presented, but nothing. As an "eternal flame" of Augustus, there is an incomplete amount of waste to show Livia. This matter does not even sizzle for a moment, the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear-induced musical scores. The amount of reality that can be watched for the event is destroyed by the end cone dry synchronized dubbing (most actors and non-English speakers). <br /> <br /> Everything in this epic is warm. Indeed, there is more historical narrowness than Rome, but dramatically, it is easily annoying. Character depth and lack of dialogue sharpness. Camera-work often gets reduced to static shots, and the light does not give anything to please your eyes. <br /> <br /> There is no one to hate Imperia and no one can hate it. Despite whether you liked or liked Rome, there are many good movies and miniseries around. Ancient Rome: The rise and fall of an empire will be one thing I recommend.
