If I do not ever see the first Road House, then I think the film might get another star, but still it creates a 3-star movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) it is basically exactly the same parallel but the actual plot is still mentioned. This does not really work and does not work. Also, acting is weak ... I never felt like I was in the movie, but I felt that I was watching the man. Even better actors like Busey probably do not work due to screen or perhaps awkward editing. The strange thing is that the movie looks like a movie in the mid 90's, but it is made in 06. Why I am not sure why this happens again due to some signals. Music, appearance, and overall overall feeling reminds me of cinemax movies late in the night about 10 years ago. The odd thing about all is that I hope to come to the rule some time ... often it reminds me of more moving movies with the performer. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing is the love interest. The character of the girl looks like the total absence of the character of Little Lewis Lane, which is quite annoying. And from the Walk of the Line I heard that the word "Southern accents" could not be heard. I understand this common place in movies, but no word will work better than trying to sound like you on TV on that universal hic space, where anyone from the south (or KY and WV) uses the same word. Of course, people living in the desert of the AZ Sound, like people in 2000+ miles away from the southeast region. The technique that came in 10 years ago in B movies was thin. Why do the writer / director decide? <br /> <br /> The following line: If you are a fan of Road House or like good movies, I would not really recommend it. Also, if you have not seen it yet, do not loot it by first seeing this version. The real road house was one of the casual classics that people love and keep an eye on. It was American graffiti, degraded and confused, and recently unexpected success like Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first one!) And Napoleonic Dynamite. Why they looted it !!! ??? <br /> <br /> They could not create a signal in the Road House without the high budget version with the right actor / manager. Sure, you can never raise the original (eg bad news beer, longest yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it, it will be significant as I mentioned with examples. But a low budget, off-the-network, road house is a crime to produce self.
