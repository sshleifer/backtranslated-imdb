The cool shoppers are incredibly familiar with the word "Video Vest". It was a notorious British list that contained all the movies that could bring 'harm' to the society, if seen by illegal audiences (dramatization). For Gore buffs, it is a tremendous checklist as it is inhumane cruel and annoying realistic movie (death, cancer, Holocaust, drill killer) as well as harmful and extremely ill horror films (The Burning, Nightmare City, Toolbox Murders). Remember, the "Bloody Apps Night" listed among other "vestiges" is quite unusual. Is it really poor? But blood and violence have been so badly presented, I can not imagine that anyone would be offended in it. And the fool plot (about a great doctor who planted a gorilla heart in his dead boy's chest) is not exactly what you would not bother to say. That's a fairly fun-decorated-flick with all the residues horror acting and spotty sleaze. The effects of making Man-Ape are ridiculous and there is no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere. If you are in the right mood, then enjoyable in other ways. A few sequences of detailing Lady-Wrestling (which works for a living among lead actresses) are very cool.
