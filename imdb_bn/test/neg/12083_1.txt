This movie was potential. It has been operated differently. What was needed was a different director. It's sure. And perhaps a different leading lady. I just can not understand the character of a minisy driver - or at least how he played it. He was totally incredible. I can not believe that he liked his performance in this film. The director probably ordered him or the manager was unable to supply what he was trying to do. I'm writing this because I'm still seeing it. I think I hated his shoes by trying to do some 'work' that I did not understand. Well, we're just heading to the boy that he starts with the boy (I still see). I'm starting to get embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise now. If you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way, check it out.
