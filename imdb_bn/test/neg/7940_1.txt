Precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film that has seen from Charlie's Angels 2 on Charlie. Shame is actually false in fact that they were a good throw and a good premise to work with. <br /> <br /> Spinner ......................................... .................... I know they are descendants of Rio Bravo Remix, but did the author of this photo actually see Rio Bravo? Rio Bravo was the main reason for a Western classic film that Sheriff (John Wayne) was charged with the murder of a prisoner for his murder by his brother and his gang. 13 Nobody wants to free anyone from anyone They are all dead. So, my first question is, why not just start the following from the beginning? Why "attack" everywhere? I know that the contract plot was a tricky and frustrating but it is not a knowledge and / or presented properly. If the old police starts from the beginning, why is this whole movie necessary? If the crowded police spends an agreement on the door behind the sudden siege, how can he get the opportunity? As soon as he appeared in the door he was shot and they had their entry points. It's all right. <br /> <br /> Any episode of a city that is pre-predicted by the police (with helicopter and a huge explosion) can all be fought but there is no notification? However, as soon as there is a fire they "leave before leaving the fire department" ?????? How do they plan to cover the chaos that is happening ?? Are police walls, bullet casing, footprint, tools used, and bullet available to be found that "Bishop Men" is going to be any agency? How about those police snipers? How could they possibly miss so badly often? When I tried to run that two prisoners, the two small mounds of snipers were foiled by the snow. It is not possible to shoot a high powered rifle through a wave of snow. <br /> <br /> Set-up is interesting but ridiculous, but the movie decided to kill the special character with the bullets on the head for just one reason. I know that the makers of the film were going to Shankar, but what they found because of the cruelty and anger of the audience was disgusting. Do not think the box office bombing reason does not mean that everyone speaks of friends and families away from this? The special scene should be a big part of the word (which is dirty when every whirl is rotating). The conclusion continues to be stupid because Wilen eventually refuses to pay diarybees to give Austen powers instead of killing the helpless helpless people. I know that many people mentioned closed scenes in Woodrow (> Snicker <<) wood, but why does Ethan's character spread to the jungle in the first place? He does not even look for the secretive and his friend to go away with the SEV? They cut a wooden pistol, slowly cut into his hands. GACK I could go but would not. What I can say is that you want to avoid this expense.
