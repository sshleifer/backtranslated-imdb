It was before my birth before the film was created after the brief existence of The Sex Pistols and the breakdown of the controversial Grounding English punk band. However, I started listening to their only album, "When I was a teenager, in 2003," sex pistols were not here "," never minded Bb * and% @ # and s, here's the sex pistols "I started listening to. Until "The Great Rock" n 'roll swindle "did not see, but that year saw it a few times and it was quite good (obviously not good but pretty good), even if I only have a bit of mind It can not, and do not see how it's all connected. This is the third time I have seen for the third time in three years, I do not care too much for it. I'm not sure about it that the first one is found in most cases (now can not be remembered). <br /> <br /> This photo is a musician, where sex pistol manager Malcolm McLaren told her next to the story of the band and its members; Guitarist Steve Jones has deposited it here as "crew"; Drama Paul Cook, "T-Maker" has been submitted; Basist Sid Vicious, submitted as "The Gemmic"; And John Leiden (AKJ Johnny Roton) submitted as "Collaborator". McLaren claimed that he made the band (and even the genre of punk rock) as a scam to earn money. He told Helen Wellington-Lloyd (AKK Helen of Troy), where he went on to talk about different stories. It's basically the talk of McLaren, pistol songs, band footage, imaginary scenes (often silly, weird ones), different cartoon sequences, etc. In a wicked way! It has been proved that McLaren is a liar, I know that many people have already mentioned this issue, even with band members. He was not the driving force of the band, he did not make them (nor did he discover punk rock, and sex pistols were not the first punk band, although they were unique). It was on the band members who created the band. "The Fleet and the Furry", a more credible film about the band from the Julian Temple, who made the film, has been told from the point of view of the band members, who oppose McLaren's claims. However, the disloyalty of "The Great Rock" n 'Roll Swindle is not my biggest problem with it. If it was really entertaining (which I thought was it was in a certain amount), I would be able to ignore it, as I was able to do clearly. Except for my third viewing, without sexual pistol songs, some footage, and at least one flexible cartoon sequence, it was quite dust! For the first time, I found the song "Kya Booni Bambi", which is very tedious, but it is very tiring. <br /> <br /> What is this fun memorial for sex pistols fans? It seems like a good number of fans, not just about the small but true story of Groundbrick 70's punk band, but for entertainment. Once that was my opinion "Great Rock" n 'Roll Swindle ". For the first time I saw a thing of MacLean that was not remembered, and at that time I saw the second time, I was aware of what the pistol manager was using to explain the film, but I still could not remember anything I said to him! Clearly, the other aspects of the film seem to be impressive, now, after seeing my third, I can definitely remember some of McLaren's things, but it's still not 100% clean, like most movies, I guess its words are not memorable, perhaps because they're presented. If you're a pistol fan, suppose it's "sweeter "Trying to give, but for me, it mostly tries to be fun, but it fails.
