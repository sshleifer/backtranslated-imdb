There were some decent moments in this movie, and a few times where it was quite funny. However, it was not created for it overall, it is a terrific annoying film. There was no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I did not understand why he would consider leaving his wife out for this dog, which he had guessed. There was more chemistry between Armageddon and Levi Tyler. Well, there was a better chemistry between the Demolition Manager Sly and Sandra. <br /> <br /> There were moments in this movie that just did not have to stay there and it was slowly moving slowly. <br /> <br /> It was a poor remake of "my best friend wedding". Unless it is running in the video for one and a half years and rent it to 42 centimeters, even if you have nothing on rainy Sunday afternoon and you do not think of a good movie for rent.
