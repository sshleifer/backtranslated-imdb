Altheller: Thief Master. <br /> <br /> See some movies, steal some of them, write a script ... it will be very easy to be a Turkish director. I think Alcatel "Identity (2003)", "So (2004)", some series that saw crime, kill etc. He said, "Eureka, Eureka" (I found it! Movies <br /> <br /> You can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie, it took me only 10 minutes and he shouted, I am a murderer, I am a murderer. "<br /> <br /> Tamar Karadgali is same (sux). Excited Mix, funny macro man. <br /> <br /> There is just one good thing in the movie. The performance is very good Can see.
