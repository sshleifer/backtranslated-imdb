As a great title to the above comments: I was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was white and white to dub me in some of the film's recorded recording studios. <br /> <br /> Although I speak German, I would like to see all the dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be very confusing for the Indian audience ... So, all the German in this movie speaks in English! Interesting enough I've made more than one character, so if you actually want to waste some time to watch the movie then listen carefully; <br /> <br /> All non-Indian characters are only 4 voices! . . . .
