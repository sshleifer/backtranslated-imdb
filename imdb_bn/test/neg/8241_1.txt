Sorry I can not disagree with the last comment. Frankly speaking I was worse than carrying Columbus, said enough. Seeing as a sunny place, the last film for the most spectacular Charles Hartrey went to the bogus level on the buses, among which the films made at the same time were very interesting. Barbara Windsor was ashamed. A character similar to acting friends, who still thinks for eighteen years, is not a Scottish man's ant ant, Rab C Nebsbett on holiday. The series miraculously trundled with back-like duffers, and carry in England. Carrying Dick was not bad, but the end of the series with this film was very close, for this sadness, because I could not think of a bad movie before this movie?
