This debut film, directed by Bobby Clark ("Purky's", "Black Christmas", "Non Christmas Story"), did not really pump my pad like I expected. Actually, it just bothers me. It is a theater troupe that was going to the graveyard with death criminals, where they planned to restrain some evil forces and revive some bodies ... their tribe leader, an imaginary black-magic enthusiast and potential homosexual, tried to try a exhumed Calling the help of the devil with the re-animation of the body, which fails so they are closer to the body, nir Go to the caretaker's home and play with it ... nothing interesting to finish fifteen minutes or so until finally go to their graves and go after desecrater. Make-up effects are OK, Gotti is very low (PG rating) and very annoying characters focus on many, which is really on my nerves. I think bickering for one hour is considered to be the "comedic" status of having terrible actor groups, yet I found no comics in it. The whole idea is just ridiculous - as long as these kids want to open the pole around the body and bind them. Characters are stereotyptic and bland and the movie is simply annoying ... do not waste your time with ...
