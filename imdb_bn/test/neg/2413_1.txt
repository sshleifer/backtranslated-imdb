So I give it a star for the true quality, but I'll give it half for the perfect enjoyment. Unbelievably weird hybrid of sexual trick and vigilant thriller, "Young Warriors" is simply a bad movie that you can expect to look around in the video, but it is rarely. It starts with about half an hour of walkie hi-genx, sexual jokes, and teenage synanges (Martini Mix, with an olive that is not seen). Then the younger sister of the main character is raped by a bunch of swim bikes (an abusive view that prevents me to pay 10 for entertainment value - not rape entertainment!), And the original character is to help her to clean the rest of the crazy brothers. , Find out the responsible bikes, and whoever is a minor criminal, they are killed on the way. <br /> <br /> It is essential to have a very delightful, non-stop funny unpleasant rape scene, and no serious bad movie fan. Trust me - I have spent my time at this time, and this is the best. A great view of the highlights libraries, a splendid flickering slow-moot shotout included in a slavery bar (with a very beautifully captivating shot of his own foot), some decent slammy performers (Richard Round, Ernest Burginen), a few semi- Famous acclaimed face (Linda Day George, Chitker Queen Linna Quigley), and a few cited Relatives (Chak Norris brothers, Mike, a member of the family of James Van Patten). It's even a great "What have we been doing?" Morality follows the typing type, although the turning point comes when the vigilante fratboys gun down a few couples robbing a shop with a toy gun. I always wondered why that drama was that catalyst; After all, whether they were children and were not harsh criminals, and whether they were actual guns or they were actually hiding a shop, so I can say, it was better for our surveillance, boys, right? Wonderful stuff. Highly recommended, do not blame me just when you enjoy it despite yourself.
