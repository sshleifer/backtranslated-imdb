Well, is this movie really "flipped" HAHA to get it? The attitude of this movie is like a throw. The plot is only a copy of the PL fiction, it is acceptable, but "PLUMP" (haha) if this piece is made! Really incredible The story is so sad, and the whole thing only collects a few smiles. It tried to make some jokes from several other movies, and it mostly failed. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but it's not really the way to go get a smile. Most of the supposed "funny" moments are completely ironic. The film is running quietly in approximately 75 minutes. They can do a lot of fun, it seems they made fun of a blockbuster movie, they were gambling, and hey! I think they are lost <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That's really enough! <br /> <br /> What is the rental price? Umm ... as I said, "Plumpbele", but you will only collect some "Plumpsus" from him! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10!
