The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment, which ends (thank God). Three sequels have not been judged at an entertaining price, but this special film is nothing but a shameful attempt to use the name "Magnificentent Seven" and Bernstein's enthusiastic music theme. Production values ​​are like TV movies and letters can be forgotten and separated: "II" and "III" in the part you can not remember their names, you can not remember their faces here. Lee Van Cliffs had an improper choice about Chris's role, but nobody could change Yule Brenner to our mind. Do not waste your time.
