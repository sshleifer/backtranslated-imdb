You can get the value of watching slow start and bad acting past. The story line was quite decent. The father was unemployed because he was unemployed, and in the summer without him, his child was rarely seen because his former wife had him custody. Dad is very angry and most of the time is frustrated. The monster of the story was not very scary. The giant equilibrium breaks being so incredible in the movie. The way moviemakers perform this scene is when the child is sitting in the house and the giant attacks him. When the monster goes to attack the child, his hand is caught in a chain attached steel trap. The giant is about a foot away from the kids' mouth. Throughout the film, the giant is completely strong enough to break or break something. Still the snares and chains of the steel take him away from the child! Perhaps moviemakers did this for this shock factor because nobody wants to see one of the main characters. Moviemakers only wanted to fear us that it might be a possibility that the child might die. Instead of breaking the continuity, the moviemakers have to replace someone who has to replace the child!
