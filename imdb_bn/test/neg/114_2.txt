I saw the Mughal video VHS. One of the distributors of the 1980s, whose catalog I want! <br /> <br /> This movie was quite poor. Although "do not look atic", the main tip to repeat it is "Do not go to Villa." Just getting a villain's base is a bad idea. A character does not get stuck in the movie for an hour, and it should be done before actually learning what it's there. <br /> <br /> The film starts in Turin, Italy in the 1950's. Two men are fighting, and a woman is telling them that villas are making them to do this. A man kills another, then pardons him, and threw the female knife and pushed him along with him. He floats the villa, and after leaving the chair, how did he leave the chair (what does that mean?), But when one hand comes to the ground and falls into the ground. <br /> <br /> <br /> From there, today's day, thirty years later. Suddenly, and do not seem to have anything to do with the movie. The temptation is to inherit the female children from temptation. The main girl played by the same actress who played her mother. The two men of the proposed men think again at least one other character. He warns not to go to Villa by some caution, but they all, if they do not use it, they fabricate it. People die The lawyer who won all his cases tried to investigate a little. Last too poor Why was the family cursed? An unfortunate annoying movie. There is a small print disclaimer behind the video reading, "The illustrations of the packing can be an artist's mark and can not necessarily present actual scenes from them." In this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that is less Or low accurately dragged the underground woman's underground scene, though there are two hands, and the woman is different. It's true, sometimes there's nothing to do with cover art movies. I also reminded a critic who had a bad film prediction scale, in which movies with cover pictures got at least one point.
