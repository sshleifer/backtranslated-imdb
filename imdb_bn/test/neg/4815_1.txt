Cartoon "Bullyclub" makes fun of about a quarter before the cartoon, no dead heroo does not prove that you can stop a good movie (Manchester Candidate) without copying the quality of a single hole from your plunder object. Acting only registers on cable access TV scale, the plot is not less than the old "Sagt Rock" comic, and only Boris J. Badanov-style "bad guy" missions are missing from Kami. This film has achieved tremendous achievement, which can be enjoyed by anyone with an incompatible organs.
