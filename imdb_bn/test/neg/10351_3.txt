It's not too bad, but it's finally a lack of quality standards in the Australia series. <br /> <br /> The jokes are low and far away, the actors are attractive (they can not be), think a lot about filmmaker cinematography (it is supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kim and Kim ... it's stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Talking and kim two curvy, middle-aged women think that they are wearing hot and humorous clothes. There is no "Look at me!" Joke Kim's fat friend is not all fat and he's not even a little stupid. She is a stereotypical black / Latino chick. <br /> <br /> This is not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. It does not compare. Nothing is the same I admit, this show is quite funny, but it is not something like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to taking an American Bogan family. They have failed. It is supposed to be really stupid and sunny, but the actors do not act stupid! To me, this is a common American TV show. It's frustrating if you want it to be something like Aussie show however. <br /> <br /> 2 stars because it's an OKAY show, it's just nothing to be what it should be.
