This is the worst comedy I've ever seen. Although it is difficult to explain because (if you do not see it), I'm sure you did not see any comedy that was not good or bad; It's okay (that's the real part - not good or bad, just there)! <br /> <br /> Tell me that I see every comedian in the main role and like them. That's what makes such a mystery. Supporting leads are actually played (even though the dialog is bad). The only character that is fairly good, is played by John Goodman. He has done a great deal with a short conversation and actually has a funny line (I will not waste the only funny line in the film, if you want to see it in any way, it includes a pancake.) The big secret is the main lead. I do not call their characters, because no characters have been developed. These scripts are not so annoying to give kids that they even lead the fictional name. They just use their own. They do not even seem to be trying to work. It looks like they have sent local junior high to their local schools. When I was 13 years old, I had actually written a paper for my English class- it was not funny. <br /> <br /> Do not be bothered to rent this line below. It's not funny. It does not even have the kind of bad conversation you can bother. I was just sitting there and I saw the whole thing. It was so annoying that I could not do any such irritation. I can not imagine how it got ratings of 4.
