I just saw the whole movie ... The journey of Mars started just about 85 minutes after the 110 minutes of the movie, and then there was 5 minutes to stop. This 85 minutes long is very annoying and has not contributed to the film. Finally, while reaching Mars, it was not a very good plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, ... why would anyone want to name his child after a villain, who has 3 breasts despite having only one eyebrows <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mars view They are an interesting experiment in the constitution, just as "Dr. Calgary's cabinet" was for the Expression month five years ago. <br /> <br /> I can give 4/10 for this great look ...
