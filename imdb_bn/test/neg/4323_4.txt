Lone Chaney Junior Khariz is seeking his partner, Annaka, whose soul now lives in the beautiful host of Amin (Ramsey Ames) of Adina descent. In Andha, the High Priest of Arkan (George Zucker) Yusuf Bay (John Caradin) is in charge of the Khariyas to continue their evil deeds. Tom (Robert Lowy) must surely find his beloved Aminas to find ways to save some future Mummy from terrorism. <br /> <br /> Kharis series routine, expected entries prove that almost every movie follows a specific format / formula. The city was at risk of a jolt suddenly, in which the cover was confronted with Musharraf, who was gifted with the great power of embracing the life of the capable people who were easily restrained by the only Chuckhold from authentic. Frank Reich, who had seen Khirsis in action and knew a lot about Egypt's history. The previous picture (Mummy's tomb) proves that anyone who survived the previous conflict with Mummy, must die later. Well produced, but the lack of originality that series will separate it from other movies. Sadly, Carrenne is sleeping with his role as Bad Youssef Bay. The embarrassing scripts are with the wrong Khariyas, who, without any bad influence, can carry unknown Amena, carrying both arms with long arms, with the right hand holding the right hand. An attitude, this frustrating mountaineering, where Tom's heroic attempt does not go according to the plan, because Kharis holds hostage to his daughter-in-law, the film is taken away from the slightest throat.
