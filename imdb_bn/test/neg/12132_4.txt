First seen on 4/30/2009 - 4 of 4 (Dir-John Waters) 4: Some interesting scenes and good parts like the comedic instrument of Karne Waters-like comedy, but it did not create any suitable experience. John Watters conducted this fifty-footed music-filled explosion and played the title role of Johnny Depp. This movie is very similar to what it has done with the 60 "spoiled" title, but it is not effective. Some tunes are interesting, some characters are attractive in their quirky water-like ways, and sometimes overdone though illustration is fine. The story is like "Gries", where there is a good group and a bad group. The guy from the bad group, Cree Baby, forces from the good group. The good girl then joins the bad group but once Cry baby hurts him - he falls back to the good group. This is just the last set up where Cree Baby tries to win her back. Now, one of the difference expected in Water's film is that bad groups do not seem to be bad all the time and good groups act as they know what they kill and kill them. I definitely saw this in Hairspray, as well. Cruelty and secrecy in this movie are not really funny, although it just feels like us that the film can be better. The main appeal of Johnny Depp's character is that he was able to roll his cheeks (this way his name) a tear several times and fall in place for women everywhere. This is overused and the bottom line is that the movie is okay, but that's not great.
