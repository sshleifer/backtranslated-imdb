The young couple on the street, having their own business focused and having a casual sex in their vehicle during a broad daylight. Nevertheless, suddenly, they are being menacing and terrorist by an insane psychopath of an old and drunk pickup truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premises? Oh yes, now remember, we've seen it thousands of times, and nine ninety nine cases are "better than rest"! These weak and sad new movies are the most surprising of the horror fans even insulting, because it is not a single original packaging or memorable escape feature. It is very sad and nasty, but every tiny wheel-slash flick is evil and nasty nowadays, so it's no longer a real wonder. The ultimate main problem with this production is incredibly large quantity of incredibly intriguing plot holes and meaningless sub-plot. Writer / director John Shiban very well understood that the ultra-thin basic story was not enough to fill the whole film, and thus he stuffed his film like Thanksgiving Turkey, with its rich and non-angular padding material. Nicole's boyfriend disappeared in a abandoned and dirty rest stop in California. Immediately killing his character is not a result of a very long film, and then he is seen facing a motor home family of frequencies, suffers from perspective (?), In which he talks with the previous victim of violent killer and his deeply emotional (and annoying) Conversation with the officer, who will not die, even though the truck ran over him ... twice! The fool's sub-plot never leads anywhere and they are certainly the most kind and desperate efforts to stretch a movie's length I've ever seen. Instead of all uninterrupted padding, more attention is needed to build the camp and its lead characters need to be more preferred. Jimmy Alexander's character Nicole is a boring and idiot girl, and you're not worried about whether you really will be concerned. His boyfriend Jesse, as well as the cop, both of them have been disappointed and their brutal death still does not hurt me, if you ask me. I've just calculated three sequences, including torture and void harmful, which was exciting and exciting enough to keep a sad smile in my face. It's still very low for today's horror films. Basically, "Rest Stop" is a tragedy of cash for the success of movies like "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but you're basically good to see. It is the first production company of 'Raw Feed', a new production company. They are promoting themselves as a new name in great horror, but if they want to believe us they will have to bring something far better than "rest stop".
