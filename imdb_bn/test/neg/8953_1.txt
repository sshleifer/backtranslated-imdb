This show is the worst show ever! Norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc. I have seen it for any reason because my stupid wife likes it. How many times can fly from Norris flying scene to the air being a sticky blind villain even though a stick? No tree, no building, just houshash .... thin wind He always solves the case or whatever the best of efficiency. No star ever gets glory. All her Norris It is very clear that Norris has kept himself very strictly and that no one will allow anyone to upload him in any scene. Terrible acting, terrible scripts, terrible series
