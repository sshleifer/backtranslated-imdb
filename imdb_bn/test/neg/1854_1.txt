Michael Kenn and Michael Gambon are both difficult to imagine, both class and experience actors are involved in such a barbaric movie. Responsible for this corrupt product, Neil Jordan and director Connor McPherson will be reduced. I have seen so many bad movies with good credit for a long time. Because blackboxes are identified as the owner of the anxious and inaccessible bookspace in TV sitelinks, the comedian, Dylan Muran, has shown here more similar routines, except for a quarrel with the lack of additional and comedic controls. It is easy to see how the story can be done, because the situation is loaded with interesting and comical possibilities. A classical actor (Kane), with a predictable outcome, tries to rob the mob (Gumbon and Co) with a left wannabe colleague (dying) associate. It can be and have been well. Sadly, it can not be.
