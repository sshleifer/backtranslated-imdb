A great jump in perfection of really painful movie. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is bad. Activation (if it can be said), light, sound, script (if there is), editing, direction, camera work, it's all nasty. There is a single element that works well. If I think it was deliberate, but I can give some credit to this movie, but I can not believe that people can create such a great movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth buying and screening to your worst enemies. .
