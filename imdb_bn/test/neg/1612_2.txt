In space, a spacecraft was sent off by Neil Stryker (Glen Carbot) and took Terra into parallel world, surrounded the sun against the Earth. Due to the existence of space, this world can be threatened by the order, and the striker is kept confined until it is determined to do with him. The striker, however, suspects around him and escaped. With a sympathetic nurse and an elderly scientist who opposes, Stryker will try to manage a spaceship and return to the world. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> In this case, it's easy to see why it does not make it. First off, there's nothing new about the show's set up. It was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by FGGET or The Incredible HL or the Apps Planet. You know that after leaving a strange job followed by a foreign agency or reporter of a newspaper, a newborn baby constantly travels from one city to another. This is a formula that has died. The second strike in the space of the disaster is his leadership, Glenn Corbett. Could this guy come across any less choice? I was rooting for her for the catch. Without sympathy for the main character, such shows will not work. Finally, this science is supposed to be fiction. Only everyone has left elephants, and some people hanging on the horizon to show three nets, I say to reach the conclusion that this is some remote planet? So is this the only event that they all speak in English, dress like human in the world and carry plimouth phares? Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> Cameron's Mitchell Welding was the only bright one for me. Of course, there is some difficulty in seeing this horrible thing, but you know the old word - Cameron is better than no cameron (yes, I've never heard it). <br /> <br /> Among the many movies made for these 70 TVs, I saw the mystery science theater 3,000 in space. I will not call this a great episode by any side of imagination, but there are some good jokes along the way. So in the end, when I see the movie 2/10, it gets 3/5 of my MSST 3 rating scale.
