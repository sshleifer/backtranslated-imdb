I am ashamed to admit publicly that once I have taken the cover of this film! An absolute reason why the movie should be studied before watching it! The 'creator' of this movie always calls us to be useless and harmful to us. <br /> <br /> Based on the powerful graveyard and rebirth of legendary Indian shapes, this story brings us a painful ride. The 40+ actors in the college (now really?) Had the goal of their ex-friend Monisha Koirala (who was a Cobra in her previous life but now a ghost!) And her unfortunate, eternal, powerful boyfriend Cobra / machine gun lover Munish Kohli ( Who was not seen after gratitude). Do you know more now? <br /> <br /> I voted to study for upcoming examinations in school instead of this movie! If you are in the sun let it pass a pass. If not ... then you probably will enjoy it.
