To finish all, leave the end of the day and see the 9th gate instead of Roman Polanski. The film seems perfect ninth getati stiriootaipikala perfect stiriootipikyala European film American film. Ninth Gate <br /> <br /> Noor-Ish, intelligent, nicely preserved, atmospheric, great acting (janani Depp, SSP), beautiful scenery, good Cinematography, funny one-liner, intellectual, lowest false language, thinking Thoughtful একমাত্র দোষ হ'ল কয়েকজন মানুষ খোলাখুলি শেষ পর্যন্ত বুঝতে পারছেন না এবং বলেছিলেন যে সিনেমাটি "বেদনাদায়ক" ছিল এবং সেখানে কয়েকটি সন্দেহজনক দৃশ্য ছিল। /> <br /> end of the day <br: Warm use vile language, moral language to be used, a commercial soundtrack to a musical score than the efforts of NYC as the devil, which only covers Gabriel baine hamtalei heard (but you Shout out to the colonel's Jonathan Davis you can take) plot, violence, incredibly expected, had nothing to do with violence, and I've mentioned too much violence?
