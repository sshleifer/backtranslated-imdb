When a group of businessmen began to die in the presence of mysterious Mr. Kulbab, the case was given to FBI agent Dick Martin. After the death the mount continues, Mr. Martin obviously has not achieved much success. At the end of the movie, the strange truth has been revealed, which I will not publish here. <br /> <br /> Another comment in this state is "It should not be a classic movie and should be delighted." I'm sorry but I disagree with this opinion disagree. This "classic" is only old, not related to its quality in any sense. I've enjoyed a very low budget "B" movie since this period, but it's not one of them. <br /> <br /> Pacing feeling helplessly slow, the camera works quite beautiful, most played fairly wooden (even my opinion is not great in Lugosi in this) and the plot, when it has an interesting compound, follow the very difficult to follow Is.
