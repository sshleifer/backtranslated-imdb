Medical student Paul Henning won a place at exclusive Heidelberg Medical School. When he met his train in the body of a young man, his separation broke into the table, then he started investigating in the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death and uncovered a highly abusive conspiracy by an anti-opaque secret society run by the school. Lots of annoying and gross, scary parts. It even has a good script and end. But it's a poor part. What else can you see from this movie? This is a good mystery and horror movie. But, of course, if you like it, go buy it. If you do not, then there is no reason to waste your money for it. <br /> <br /> Rated for extreme graphic violence, sexual orientation and immorality.
