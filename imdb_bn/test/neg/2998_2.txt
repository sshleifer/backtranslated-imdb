The first simple part: This movie is insane copolia! <br /> <br /> This reminds me of "Magnolia". And then I thought - some have made the movie even more annoying than "Magnolia". <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about Polish brothers, but this image seems to have been learned by anyone. The film does not know anything about school but much about telling stories. Trick plot material and Slaghammer's symbiliism are bad enough, but the dialogue is just sad. <br /> <br /> Detailed comments can be a laundry list of failures. Which are not considered funny or satirical; "Ornaments" are beautiful coffee table pictures with medium music; The "mental" parts are straightforward. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the movie does not show a little love for the priest, without a little blanket status to the priest. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe that I have honored this picture.
