I do not know what happened to Director Helal Ferrer. Since it seems to have lost it since the "physical graduates" rebuilt. Two of the best films of "King of New York" and "The Bad Lieutenant" have remained: For one decade innocents have gone wrong. With films such as "and chronus" (whatever its meaning) and "New Rose Hotel", she feels determined to be frustrated and gives birth to her former fans. There is no life in this movie. Even though his actors have played a great role in all his projects, the results of this speculation do not justify the jail. Whatever the point - that new drug seller is the same as new breed of any other middle class new Yawkuh - mind numbing scripts and annoying aspects are lost. <br /> <br /> I saw this 4-plaque on El-Plex outside the city on this opening night, I was surprised to buy a ticket in the lobby, and it looked like it was filled with a large, ethnic mixed group of men, women, their twentieth century and Thirty Then they started in the theater, but it was "8 miles" which was not the drama "and Xmas"! The drama shown in "more and more" (Remember, this was the first night!) A total of 4 people saw this, I, my wife and two! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
