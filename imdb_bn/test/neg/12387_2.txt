I will not bother reading this book and not based on this adaptation. I hate every character of this event - Miranda was broken by violent, selfish and annoying conversations, her sister was almost a quarrel, and I have ever seen the worst screenplay of psychosocial depression. I have a degree in psychology, and this was not right. In fact, until it was mentioned, I did not realize that the trio could be bi-Buddhist - I thought he was a normal, slightly nasty teenager. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The creators and producers of this show have not done any research - Trai's psychological problems are not remotely precise and Forensics is not involved in the end of "Twist" (and if you do not make it clear but miles away, you can see a big ole Dummy!) <br /> <br /> Garbage Hoist.
