I saw this movie on a flight from Paris to Boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and vague. It seems that he has lost his legs in French movies right now, and this is a good example that a multi-script script could ruin the brilliant actors. Although some may find the "playfulness" of the script in accordance with the instructions of the euro post-modernism, the whole project looks like a golden year of the euro-cinema and postmortem after the death of a true fictional reality --- a strange Bunuel reminded here but without charm or intellect.
