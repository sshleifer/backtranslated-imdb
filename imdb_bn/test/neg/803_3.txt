Sometimes without the worst science fiction film, or I have seen the worst, 'Time Under Fire' is still much less under the average. On premises and the first 10-15 minutes is not bad, it starts as a story in the X-file, with the time travel, the Bermuda Triangle mixes the mysteries. Very soon the mix of other style elements (too much) together, but the story is not beyond the level of interest of a TV series. Soon, 'Time Under Fire' quickly deteriorates the continuity of the clich√©s, not only mixing multiple types of styles, but can not create something memorable among suspense or special effects that will help viewers remember the film till tomorrow. The acting is bad, and the ornamental line of the script does not help at all.
