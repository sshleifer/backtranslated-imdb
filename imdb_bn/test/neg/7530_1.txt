I do not mean to say here unrighteous words, but to call it the next religious classic is still another example of the low quality quality filmmakers themselves. This movie is an offense for what we hold sacred, and not in the insulting "Acharya" method. This film became more archetype for harmful conversations, delivered by more chaotic actors.
