I agree with comments related to down spin. The last scene shows a little better, but the authors definitely need some more points. I think the characters are still interesting, though sometimes they "white trash" things a little too spin. Subtlety and Nuuan "Office" goes like a long way on shows. I think both targets of the same night and lineup will be somewhat similar to viewers. Someone would think that things like Karma and full Eastern religions are a big thing about some different and interesting shows, but they just excavate the surface of the subject. In my opinion, it shows the humiliation of many people about Hollywood's intelligence. We can manage more title content. It has been proved before many other shows.
