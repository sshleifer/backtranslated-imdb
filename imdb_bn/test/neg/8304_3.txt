How nice. Just now. I've never seen a horror movie, it seemed like a bad self-insert that someone wrote a day in 20 minutes. And then I happened to come on "Lady Frankenstein". This movie accepts anything you know about Frankenstein and completely reverses it ... and not well. If you have seen this movie, then you have covered it on Italian TV, or you have a version of the 50 Chilings Classic Box Box like I have, as number 24. And that's why these movies are here. Because they are not very good. That's enough, on the film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her college graduated daughter (?) Shows how she graduated with just a medical degree and yes, yes. Then again there were many female doctors. So he said how he works, he wants to help his father and he said. And then he makes the giant and murders him. So she apologized for just 7 seconds and then with the assistant, how was it a bogger. The giant escapes and goes on a rampage. Well, I can not really believe that they killed Frankenstein at the beginning of the movie. He died ... 20 minutes. Then her daughter went away. Which is .... not complete knowledge, but sure. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster that is angry ... to create another monster! Oh yes how I love his argument. So his new monster kills someone and puts his body in the assistant's brain ... I know. Just sleep and go along with it. So fill the monsters and duke it out. How do I ask the assistant "Why do not we just kill the people?" And he replied "They do not know how to kill it!" And finally he killed it with an ax from the head. Haha Oh yes, someone could figure out that ELSE. So the brain kills Lady Frankenstein by killing the new giant. The end <br /> <br /> This movie ... was weird. Some were so serious like volunteering fanfic wrote. There is no other way to describe this movie. It was a very strange nude scene. For example, this girl had naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, raises the demon girl and the man goes away. Haha Nice person Then he struggled a bit and died ... to be honest, I really do not know what he's dead from. But whatever. It's lady frankenstein It does not have to be knowledgeable. <br /> <br /> Why were there so many in this movie? Why? Moments that moment I leave. Films should not be done, but for some reason I can see that more than that. <br /> <br /> So the final word, I saw this pack is not the worst movie, but it's a boring, and full of many holes and random things. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein gets 10 Frankenstein's screen views
