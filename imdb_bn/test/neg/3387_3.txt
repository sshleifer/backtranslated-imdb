Last night, I was sitting with my TV room, beer, TV tray, pretzels bowl and I decided to keep my trusted VCR movie "Monster Man". A fun filled, poor, crash and hopes of a movie's bash cheesefest. What do I get instead? One of the most stupid, stupid, intrusive and predictable movies I've ever been satisfied and saturated. And worse than that, all the time (and I use this next word loosely) "sex scene" girl keeps all her clothes! I will make this summarized short and sweet: Add "Hitachi" to mixed hitters with "Do you have my mother car" (film 1/2 about), for example, "I Madman" to add an opponent's radiance version to the primary villain and finally some Inconsistent black magic is a source of information about how to tear this movie into a junkie in mumba and jambo. It is completely completely guessable. The only notable reason for this friendly movie disguised as a "horror movie" is that some moments (though "hero" is a big boring gaiake and the other is Jack Black Clone) in 2 boys, and so funny (mostly moderately funny, mostly SNL Skit). Unlike other, "Monster Man" is a giant mess! 3/10 (this will be handed to me during the Halloween-just hope that the person sees it I do not have my house eggs or bad)
