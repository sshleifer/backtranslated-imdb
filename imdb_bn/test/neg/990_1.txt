This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, it's done terribly. It did not flow. It was very sticky because many people do not understand this movie. I have seen this incident very long ago, I was thinking about what was happening, it was a kid like that stolen by someone and it ended up roughly while fleeing police, for some reason the police released him and had to face him. The parents sent her to live in the desert with her uncle, where she looked like a girl who likes to climb up and Eladhulaya to enter the competition for climbing into the read, and his uncle, and yes it's like I said terrible movie.
