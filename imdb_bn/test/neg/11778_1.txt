I like kind of jag It's a joke but it has many campaigns recently. For an outsider (an non-American) patriotic feeling may be a bit more. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to be a lawyer for Rab and McKenzie (as they were in the first part of the TV show) Stop the war and become the super Heros that sees the entire continent. It's almost like watching an appointment video from the US military. <br /> <br /> I still see the show, so it's not bad. But I would like more episodes when Rab and McKenzie investigate military accidents and will not save the world in the future.
