I worked in the movie which originally released this movie, Western Pictures. Western was also the same problem that many small independent film companies had, they did not have much meaning to keep production prices for their movies. Alone that money alone you will not have to buy a good film. See Kevin Coster's Waterworks, for example, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this case, it was the director and writer. With the main fault of this movie, it has become quite difficult for even a movie movie. <br /> <br /> I think the main foundation of this movie was "Let's keep a bunch of playful characters in a room and see something interesting." This is an interesting idea, but not valuable to watch your time. <br /> <br /> Most Western films have a complete perspective and feel to them. Even my wife and I have the ability to spot this quality in non-Western films. Many times we were able to spot that quality from the trailer or TV commercials. We sat there, saw trailers or advertisements, and afterwards, we all roamed around, and almost synched, we used to say, "Now it's Western movie!" This is a Vestron movie.
