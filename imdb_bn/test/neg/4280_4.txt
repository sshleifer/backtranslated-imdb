As a brilliant Disney fan, I was not completely influenced by this movie, certainly not enough motivation in the theater. I'm very happy that I found it in DVD and saw special features. <br /> <br /> You must check the "Musical commentary": The whole film can be seen with the comments of Root and Tutorial, the Kikkil Relief Musa, the story is the voice of Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two gentlemen of the famous second city comedy Troupe Ad-Libby - among the characters - about a decade-old movie that they explicitly like. I smiled full time. The gains I got from this statement were entirely composed for my film's tepid reaction. Make yourself a favor and hear it!
