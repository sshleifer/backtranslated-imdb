An anonymous film that can be directed by someone. Where is Anthony Mann, the director of classics like "El Cid", "Nude Spar" or "Laramie to Man"? <br /> The wonderful shot of the clouds, lovingly portrayed. This story is very quarters, and almost entirely apart from the dramatization. The couple almost lived a regular life and the user who complained about the choice of AMHOON's wife, IMH, was less attractive than she missed completely; her voice was loud, she was the perfect housewife of the penaplex. At this time, the women were barefoot and pregnant: there was not even a single woman in the base staff, even the tasks on the desk. All of them were worried about their husbie, who fought for democracy and fought against one enemy whom we never heard of, but in 1955 it was not difficult to guess. <br /> <br /> One wonders why a young man who never saw Man Cinema could choose one of his cool movies.
