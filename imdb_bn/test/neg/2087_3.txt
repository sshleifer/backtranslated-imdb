Just had a dessert, I would say, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was terrible and even the plot line was ridiculous. Instead of 1, I gave it 3 out of 10 because I oddly enjoyed a lot of movies. My expectations were not high to start with, but I turned out to be cornier than expected. I thought it would not be bad at the start of it, but as soon as the competition name - Golden Whisk - came, I started to change my mind. It went downhill to all. Apart from what I like about this movie, its unreasonable plot and others without breaking into dialogue are cooking them. However, there is a movie about pastry chef, there were fewer scenes where they were actually some baked. I would recommend watching this movie instead of cooking channels. You'll see more ready to prepare the food, and you are unfortunate one-liners dodge. However, if you enjoy a lot of love stories, which are sometimes fun, go ahead and watch.
