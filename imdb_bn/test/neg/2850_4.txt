Well, it was not completely waste. Arman's movie was naturally very good, the German stuff in German was strange because I think that in the beginning of the movie, Bulgaria looks like ... dint 'to go back and check ... Central theme: The serial killings have been reduced with full gang war. It is not seen in any movie where the character is considered to be Italian, it is believed that Turkish is accepted with German words (American act and brightness). Climax was the most impressive part and some parts of it still did not seem to me. In any case, if you are not good at anything then you can see this movie.
