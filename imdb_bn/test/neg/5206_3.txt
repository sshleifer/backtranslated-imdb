I liked the film, it's just that characters run around any real point of their craziness. I was saying, poor goat. The goat was Nahing when it was preoccupied with ants. I liked rape scenes to be more graphic (though not one with goats). Selena played Jane Rayall this single image. She was very nude all over. The crazy couple who tortured and tortured many people reached the right place. I have almost forgotten about gay transvestite couples who have been selected for sinners also. If you'd like to rush off the wall staff, this is your film. 3/10
