The previous Tarantino movie was from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from his own written love guy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To entertain the whole point of a movie - if you call people to head and relax their scalps want to do !!!! - And if there is a worthless sin in a movie then it is very annoying or hateful. <br /> <br /> This movie is an endless and annoying annoying and horrific scene while talking only on different language tables. There is also a scene where 3 people talk about 45 minutes of the same table, thanks, they shoot everyone. I wanted to kill them after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when F ** closes up <br /> <br /> This table talk style is Tarantino Hallmark, but in other movies, I care about what I am saying and what people are talking about. Here, I can not care less. All Quintin films show a huge confidence, especially Jackie Brown. But here there is a wide-ranging feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea that he was going with the film. <br /> <br /> Is it violent? Of course there is torture and scalping galore, but you have to remember me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, even I did not think I saw a review titled MSNBC, that day I saw it before. <br /> <br /> She is out of hostage and apparently dead novel. But give us a QT benefit and leave us the movie. <br /> <br /> I came out halfway through this movie and I do not recommend anyone watching anyone that he does not care about a deadly comentino fan. <br /> <br /> I gave it 0/10.
