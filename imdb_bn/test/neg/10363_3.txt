... or better, see Fandango you want to see the really cute and funny male college age Flick Road. Rolling Kansas is committed (actually the program guide has given it 2.5 out of 4, which is usually fairly worth watching), but I'm going through it very fast. Usually there are great music in road travel movies, but I can not think of whether the music was there. The only high point was a small role with Rip Troupe as an old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise miss along with jokes and time passages. Four main characters are unknown actors and I do not think any of them in any other movie. (Oh, yes, that was Thos. Headen Church it was, but he is everything, good, bad or indifferent). When you are not a movie, you feel like rocking others.
