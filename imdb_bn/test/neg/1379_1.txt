Carlos Mencia is not funny. Carlos Mensia is not funny, from his step-up especially from the ruins of this train in a TV series. I have been trying to convince people for two years that they have stolen another comedian's joker and as far as his comedy elements go, they are much less than the sub-parallel results of "Johnny-A-E-E". Psycho astronaut joke? Britney Spears Breakdown Discretion? I hope this is just a schedule error, but Carlos and Comedy Central, those topics, and many others are running the late night TV show host's inaugural monologues, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many more. Lampooning ethnic and ethnic stereotypes? Claudio stands near the opportunity to develop with Carlos Mencia. Perhaps people, especially visitors and comedy Central executives, have received the exact label from the issue of "New York" magazine this week: "Carlos Mensia, unexpected joke-filterer."
