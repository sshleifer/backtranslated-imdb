Cujo is a giant, lovable, gentle and loving St. Bernard owned by the family of Cambara, the crew initially smuggled somewhere in a rabbit and a local wooden mouse Castle Rock on a field. The rabbit disappears into a boro and Cujo sticks his head in the entrance holes. The rabbits disappeared from the sight of the evil, and they began to gnaw the bark barking bark. Donna Trenton (D'Wallace-Stone de la Wallace) is a relationship with Steve Kem (Christopher Stone, the real life husband of De Wallace), who works with her husband, Vick (Daniel Hue Kelly), who discovered. Of course, their relationship becomes strain. For all of this, their young son Tad (Danny Pinto) Joe Cambar (Ed Lautter) has set up cars for his residence outside his barn. Joe is planning a weekend holiday with his friend Gary Pavier (Mills Watson) when his wife Charity (Kailani Lee) has won 5,000 dollars in the lottery and decided to take her young boy Bret (Billy Jane's Billy Jacobi) along with the trip. See his father. To find Gerry's house, he found the dead on the floor to find the Joke; he went to Kolkata for help, and his dog attacked Kujo now and attacked him. Go to Cambler's Firmhouse to repair Dona and his car. The place has disappeared, except that the face has gone, his mouth swollen, his blood has turned red and faded with pain. Cujo get on the car and Donna and Tad, fortunately for them the Windows firm firm, whatever the attack for whatever time it is. Donna tries to launch the car but it is completely broken, they are both trapped, but hopeful someone will come and rescue them. Cujo lying awake, ready to attack and kill anyone that crosses his way. Managed by Luis Tage, I think the film was a little slow for my taste. The first half plods along, the second half steam builds up a head but I still felt it was a tiny and unexciting. Everyone involved is fine, I have no complaints there. Technically the film is fine, photography, music, special effects, editing and it is usually well-made. The big problem seems to be the padding for the Don Carlos Duneau and Loren Carrier scripts and especially to extend it to the first half, which runs most runs. It is felt in more than 90 minutes as a result of clocking. It is a little predictable as well. Cujo is not really afraid to me as a monster, I just can not find out I'm overweight St. Bernard terribly slobbering. I think there is really no mistake with this, but I do not think that I want to see it soon. If you find a copy of the copy or T.V. You can find it free but the average is not very bad.
