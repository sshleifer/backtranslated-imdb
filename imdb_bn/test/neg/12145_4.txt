Gold Riders (1951) <br /> <br /> A dust Western / comedy feature (with Sheng Howard at this time, I've always enjoyed "third stog") with three stages and doing their normal roles and generally by the reliable Edward Bournes Managed, who has also done some fun classic shorts - so one should surprise, what is wrong at the moment? The most likely answer is that the 15-minute two-relayer works as well as a lot more for the 55 minute feature film. Many of their classic shortcomings are different, the Gold Riders are not rethinkable. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
