Oh how wonderful this movie! I do not know it is a horror film or a drama, because the stories and the genre of both are not very well established! The story is not running, it is slow, annoying, and sleeping from the beginning to the end. This movie really bores me! But I really like the camera work, it's pure, fresh and clear, very good acting, the little boy was the best actor in this movie, but it did not let me jump from my seat. But this movie lets me catch a pillow, lying on the bed and sleeping till the credit roll ... <br /> <br /> Boring! Not worth it! I said, this movie is crushed! <br /> <br /> 1/10
