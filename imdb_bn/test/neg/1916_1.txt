It comes near the worst movie I've ever seen. Started with the author that you would connect with Jasper (Josh Hartnet). When he did not make any mistakes, Sam (Lley Sobiski) gave him a blanket for Chris Klein, the way he let you mad Sam. Do not you think it is released on it, so your Kelly's feelings are not realistic and their relationships are evil. It drags you in both directions, and it gets rather tiring and annoying. The only good thing I saw in this movie was Cast. <br /> <br />
