The things that I tease on the screen, the things that I try to watch in my movie, disturb and annoy them, at the moment where authors, directors, set designers, screen caterers, or anyone who does not think it ends up and, with the sole exclusion - Or commission - undo all other works done by others who have worked in the movie. At the moment "Wait a bloody minute ... what happened?" That remains the dead story of his track. (There was not much need for this movie story, because anyone who saw it, will know that Quintet's descriptive drive has been well-accumulated before the start of the shoot.) There are several moments of this movie. And you get too long to think about them. The film is about two hours long and scripted dialogue is probably going on on five pages. There is a lot of time to think about its deficit. <br /> <br /> The film has been frozen in the frozen world. Another ice age has been set and the whole world is in death. It's cold. Very cold It's actually very cold on screen. The film was shot dead in Canada in the winter and in each scene there is a realistic ice cream and original ice and breathing of the human body. Time and again we are reminded of how it is fecking cold. People wear waddle like big hats and layers and clothes and wear dress wear around Waddle. Must be a terrific shoot. When our hero comes in a sequence of my nitpick while checking into a room in a hotel. Coming out of the room in the middle of the night, he speaks a conversation of important importance for the small plot through a large grill of two walls divided wall. I'm not asking why the wall in the two rooms has a convenient grill. My annoying thing is that Grill has not been blocked by the long-term tenant with the shocking persecutors. If you are trying to keep warm, the wall you need is a huge dune hole which enters your home in a dense house frequently. Trust me I live in such a way, I saw this photo sitting under a dive with a hot water bottle in my house's house. My breathing was misting as much as the actor. If that great hole was whacking my wall I'd block it with something. Maybe I could not see the film's best choice in a uninterrupted room in the middle class, but the boy saw me in the film Lausi Insulation.
