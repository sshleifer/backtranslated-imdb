Another example that Sweden should be away from trying to make spectacular action movies, it does not work, Weederbars still fills Menen Piece Knot. May be good at Stormer, I think, and some scenes are lightly effective, but plot full holes. Why is Hamilton going on a civilian attack, knew that his wife is being held hostage? Mark was fun to see Hamill, but his bad guy-part was very less writing. I am constantly surprised that relatively large Swedish films are made without an intelligent, functional script. 1 out of 5
