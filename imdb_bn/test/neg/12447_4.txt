Do not be fooled by the 'prize' and the comments below. This is just 1 poor movie. George Cass has played his character (soft gangster) very annoying to see it. The opening scene is a dramatic display in the scene. The head of the character seems to be somewhere else in the rest of the film. His emotions do not match what is happening in the film. The things he said did not add anything to the voice-over film. It just makes Zeus more uninterrupted with the head of the cloud. <br /> <br /> The story and the movie were combined with a total lack of imagination. All the other parts of the film were stealthily stolen from other modern directors. Hopefully, John Roston will use his own style and ideas for his future movies.
