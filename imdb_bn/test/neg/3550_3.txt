It really starts interesting - the story develops around the main character, who runs "clean business", especially to clean crime scenes. As a former policeman, he carried out some strange situations, when one task suddenly "disappeared indiscriminately". In addition, he discovered some relations in the investigation of police corruption. Her "Colombo Feeling" is fair, deep she gets into the background of the story. Good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) with some twists in a mysterious story --- but only last 25 minutes. (7 stars out of 10 here). SPOILER :::: Suddenly, the movie has lost its touch and ultimately there is a complete unnecessary shoot out of betrayal of friendship with the 14-year-old daughter and honesty outside the development of character ... why not without investigating her for the friendship of Cutler? Or the girl is discovering some information? Or ... the story of many possible stories is imaginable ... it's really over!
