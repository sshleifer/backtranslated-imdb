One of the worst movies I've seen! After seeing this, I started walking, what happened? I'm confused today, can anyone explain me this movie? Both acting and photo quality are bad, you think you are watching a school project made with Home Camcoder. First of all, I can not believe how some people might give 10 stars to this movie. Because, this incredibly bad movie! This movie is not all scary! There is also no typical horror clich√©s. This movie was intriguing and acting terrible. This is not unusual, miraculous or horror, it is simply very Turkish feature films. And finally there were many unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. When I saw 'Gomda', I became so frustrated, it is sad for the Turkish movie maker. Please do not 'cinema' in this way!
