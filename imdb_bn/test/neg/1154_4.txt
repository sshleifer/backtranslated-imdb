You probably did not see the series after the broadcast, but "Cleopatra 2525" will show a little interest; And I do not think that many people did. But if you are still somewhat curious, then there is no budget for the "25th Century King Rogers" space without shipping and design or clothing. <br /> <br /> In this case, the part of the Baker Rogers (Cleopatra) played Jennifer Sky. Jennifer could be expected to be the best thing as very nice and quite talented; And there is a beautiful comedic touch. However, promotional material will be closely monitored that it is a bad hairstyle and a salvage Army Traffic Store is slightly worse for clothing. If you think that Jennifer can be brought back, "Jace" will be a huge disappointment in her Cleopatra look during her time. Looking at the "Fetish Fetish-Evered Girls" target audience of teenage boys, "It is not a good idea to quarrel over the value of your heroine or her dress." Attract a lot of visitors It's love or hate, "Baker Rogers" watches hot clothes and many good guest stars. <br /> <br /> The other two exploitation elements are Cleopatra's two female associates; Hell (Zina Torres is basically playing his stock "Fogli" character) and Sir (Victoria Pratt-another "JSA" connection - a very structured version of Natasha Henstritz). Torres Cleopatra did a good job playing outside of the character, which provides most of the show's comic relief. <br /> <br /> The Torres theme song, "Some Year Link Parody Song", 2525 (Exordium and Terminus) "Rick Evans" (1969) "sings the song. You think that "I remember the opening of words in the year 2525, if people are still alive, women can live, they can find ..." I suspect they have given it a series titled so that they get this interesting little But who knows, perhaps the title of "Baik Rogers" is respected and they are thinking of using the song later. <br /> <br /> So, the foundation of the show is that the surface of the earth is adopted by the Belize (not WKRP) and the underground movement of the human being. One of our three heroine fighters fight against an isolated (potential) female voice (correctly referred to as "voice"). In contrast to Baik Rogers, Cleopatra, like a wonderful third studio, is still frightened and confused by its cryogenic sleep, or perhaps disturbed by shabby hair. Sky has close eyes and wonderful nice close up eyes. The Gog Cleopatra, like "Bak Rogers", uses a general 21st Century opinion and everyone is completely deep or totally annoying. <br /> <br /> The action "Against Firefire" is a highly edited "JSA" garbage that is not more realistic and is not particularly entertaining. A good world that travels around the "Spiderman" fashion of girls, is a kind of web slinging through tunnels and shafts in the labyrinth of their underground world. <br /> <br /> It is strange (or perhaps the budget is not considered) these are only half-an-hour long and there is not enough time for any subtlety and duration except for a two-part ceremony. <br /> <br /> Do you know again? I'm just a child.
