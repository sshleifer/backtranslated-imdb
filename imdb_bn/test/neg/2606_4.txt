When the Family Guy was the first premier, I did not have a discriminatory mood. In the 1990s, there was a tricky, weird cartoon property, why should I? Nickelodon Dog produced; Rain and Steve and Rocks are among the other fine cartoons of modern life (yes, it has sponges). All were playful, dream-like animations and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogues. Simpsons has taken a complete event, perhaps its biggest protector is not bright enough to claim it, but your time is a very good investment and certainly rejects false propriety that all TV junks. Start as a peculiar but ridiculous attack on everything with the unique and intelligent mock below South Park. It is as exciting as the Monty Python-escrow show, and brutally fast and intense social criticism (such as the great underpants gnomes their defense) and finally settles to be completely "meta" like self-language and simpsons, and unfortunately sharks jumped. The family girl is like the Simpsons and South Park god. It pushs the button and is a favorite among college students and vivacious enthusiasts. However, what is in neutrality is the lack of intelligence. <br /> <br /> This is especially famous for the incognito for flashbacks. Many bad tv sitcoms or commercial are mentioned. Some interesting (especially from the first two seasons), most not Are spontaneous interesting references? I'm not sure, but in most cases the show is standing that its characters are painfully unusual. Homer and Burt have the charm and there is pure indecision to cartman's own sensitivity and pursuing his terrible behavior, Peter Grafin has no excuse. He's just a loud, obnoxious pig. For any reason funny story coming from his character, the writer forgot how to disrespect that day. Lois is very shallow and dull; Meg is a prop, is only misused; Chris Border is annoying and only occasionally funny, and the two main stars of the show (Stuvi and Brian) are inconsistent in their characteristic that it is really all stupid. <br /> <br /> Another trick I can not stand is when a character explicitly points to something and lingers on it for an uncomfortable long time. This happened a lot, and I can not bear it anymore. Not only does he like to beat Peter, but he is not talking about chicken chicken, I talk about pop culture and it's like a foreign audience. It's not intelligence or even strange humor, it's completely annoying and useless <br /> <br /> This event may not be fun, in fact, some previous episodes rolled me up. Highlights are included in the pilot episode, where Peter lost contact with the reality after losing his valuable television; When Peters shows religious zealot father and wreaks damage; When Peter became a narc, and "pancake" episode in Megs School. I suspect that these were the events that accidentally included actual human traits in their characters, or that only the writers had the actual comedy inspiration. <br /> <br /> One last thing, the show is not objectionable. This is not the only objectionable who will not see the show at first place, so it's almost like a circular joke to the hipsters singer.
