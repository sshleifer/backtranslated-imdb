Well: technicians with medieval sword. Also, the film looks much smoother than most B-movies, but let's face it: Quake or Duum has more atmosphere. <br /> <br /> BAD: Intelligent plot, acting and completely incredible universe. I am usually able to see potentially very bad movies; Hack, I like a good B movie like "Split second" and the choice. But there is nothing after this one, borodam and clich√© offer ... from the very beginning. Oh, and I forgot the lousy special effects, they see more like the old playstation game than some of the myths! The use of a classic poem to sell this goat insults me! Conclusion: quite simply annoying. Want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, sex worker!
