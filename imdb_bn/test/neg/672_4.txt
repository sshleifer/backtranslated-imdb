Leon Shamroo Cinemascope Colorful painting is quite unique here, in this <br /> <br /> Various visual color filters have been used.

The pronunciation is so diverse, from Ustinov and Promsom to the British, to Blayette's Hollywood, and to be mature, it seems to be a true secret without a central point of view. Tommy Rettig is jarringly American. Extending range from acting style zombie-like stilted. Just a Ustinov stole a conniving one-eyed girlfriend show - what does it have to steal. Courtyard - Story of a young Egyptian doctor, inspired and abandoned by the rich - and parallel themes of the religion of God alone, persecuted by authority - has interesting points of interest. But when the film's plot fails, it's hunting music and visual scenes.
