Based on the exploitation of "General Dissent Criminal" Martin Cahill, the subject of John Burman's 1998 film "The General". There was a rough rise in a slum area in Cahill and graduated from armed robbery with respectable minor offenses. He points out his poor background in every opportunity to justify his criminal career. This is a common excuse for the perpetrators, who easily ignore thousands of slum dwellers who can not loot post offices and end up selling guns. Cahill made a fool of police and local authorities, without mentioning the IRA, which made him a lot of enemies as well as the "hero of the man". However, he was originally a casual, self-service thief. <br /> <br /> My primary problem with "ODC" is that the hero has been made as a loving Irish barbaric. Kevin Spacey has done a good job of showing Lynch with oily charm and calm harmful combination, but the character is seen as a very moral and selfish hero, even a hero. <br /> <br /> The picture is well played by shot and well-played, but it lets you down the script. Author Gerard Stambridge could not make up his mind; Is he writing a grittier treatment of an Irish "lock stock" or thiefing career of Martin Cahill? The problem is when a writer is based on the central character of a real person. It is also unfortunate that "ODC" John Bojman's "The General" movie was released which is the more accurate screenplay of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a shiny thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it is no surprise that his exploits got movie treatment. <br /> <br /> The studio was set up to capture the story of Kehel and it ended a good Hollywood-style. Kevin Spassy's Charitative-Twinkle-Bigmist-Thief Michael Lynn is unknowingly driven by "ODC" motorcycle. In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, to prove that he can not fool an outdated, communal and corrupt paratrial organization and go away with him. <br /> <br /> Do not move away from its superstition because it highlights the self-image of its "man's human". To avoid the death of "ODC", Michael Lynch has given up everything to end a weak and shallow movie.
