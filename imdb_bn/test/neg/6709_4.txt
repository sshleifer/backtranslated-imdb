I would not normally regard it as a valid criticism for a movie call to annoying. However, when a movie is created harmfully for other parts of the clear parts that was not good at the beginning and it is sluggish like rolling without a real salary, I think it is appropriate to call a spade a spade. And The Ghost is a very annoying movie. <br /> <br /> A movie which is named as its name, tells the story of a little girl, which is being cheated by a mystery, which holds secretly. Its past Simply, it will feel a whole lot complicated and less attractive. <br /> <br /> The plot line for the maximum photo is nearly obscure and hook, memorabilia, just makes things worse. It seems that there is no source of what is happening at any moment, including a screenplay and director. Instead they chose what a filmmaker equivalent of a sitcom clip show to do roughly. Ringtones, Dark Water, Shatter, The Grace series, and the slides taken from Paul's smuggling for good measurements. Making matters worse, half a dozen women proceed to all the dresses and likewise continue reading their lines, which make them impossible to tell separately. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to realize with this movie. The story is not all well thought out. Amnia hostage lazy Mystery material is non-involved and managed with little grace. Characters never resolve a bit, all the information is only perceived by the memories of the past when it is convenient for the plot. <br /> <br /> Attempts to add at least an opportunity to add paints, reflections and water shots, a thematic link with subtext, memorabilia and final twist (which I will not reveal) is excellent, but often overwrought. Even think the score is borrowed and clich√©. <br /> <br /> The worst, the stimulus measures for damnation are not very interesting and the final bout is expected and lame. "Wait, do you mean a character whose 15-minute screen time is but does not seem to do anything with the plot? Very kind of knowing for this kind of audience tripe. Anyone that shows these rips off any film can also find them awake with this little one. I thought that Shimizu was under the barrel for such frogs (his boring film was not less than 5 times), but his second rate of work was like rehabilitation, a film that I could not even finish myself. More miles away. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.collider.com for more reviews
