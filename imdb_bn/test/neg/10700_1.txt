This is one of the most annoying performances in an angel Norris film horror, sometimes Kevin level and a weak script. The characters were terrible, and it rarely has any action, plus even Chuck Norris stinks this! Christopher Neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story is not very interesting plus Norris seemed bored with the whole thing and I did not blame him as I was too! One of the most annoying performances of a Calvin-level film, I was never tempted to tape my VCR, as well as there was no chemistry with Norris and the levels! If you are looking for a big martial arts, then do not leave Norris, but if you want a movie with an unintended story, very few steps and bad acting looks! This is an angel Norris movie horror, with the one of the most annoying performances ever to the Calvin level, avoid like plugs! The directions are incredibly bad. Oron Norris has done incredibly bad things here, no mysteries or thrills blood cameras do the work and kept the film at neutral speed! There is a little bit of blood and violence. We get 2 impaling of poor, ripped out the heart, bursting of body and few gun wounds. Acting is really bad. Chuck Norris is not usually here and feels very annoyed here, his plane is flat, and his performance is not so great and I'm a big Norris fan, it's his worst! (Norris still rules!). Calvin Layer is wildly annoying here, his whiny malicious performance grated me severely, I was so expecting to get him good! But sadly he did not. Christopher Neame was quite weak as the main villain, his voices were quiet, but he played big time! Sherry J Wilson is pretty and she's okay to do. The rest of the cast is terrible. Above all, to avoid it, it does not deserve to be tortured, even if you are a big Norris fan (like me). 5 of the BMMB
