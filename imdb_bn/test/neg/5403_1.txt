As a helpful warning to others, I believe "Skilton Man" is actually worse than "Rapper Island". I am using RI as an example of the worst original movie presented on the science fai channel, but I still saw the most ridiculous and extravagant film in SM. Yes, I saw almost the whole thing, it's about 35 minutes coming. It's my pure stranger to paint me with. What was the science? Once Skeleton Man and Living Platoon Leader (or whatever - I did not do well on the military unit terminology) reached the chemical plant, the movie is almost disrespectful that an impossible nonsense move into a zone. The same idea was similar to another viewer, who was surprised to see that many films were edited together to complete a horror.
