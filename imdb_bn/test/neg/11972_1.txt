My roommate and I have other friends who work on local blockbuster videos. She finds out really awful movies for us and tells us about them. One of them was the "Christmas Horror" film, which featured former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg as the murderer's seven close closure. We did not see it immediately, but we do not think anything could be bad. Apparently, we were wrong. We have shown this Slashar film that "acting" is a Shemorik vs. murder killer. At first we thought that Cain would actually be a horrific killer, and that's why we wanted to see, but he was not, and it made the movie worse. Was absolutely the movie that was a teenage play. If you want to save your brain from trying to flee from your head, never see this movie.
