This is my first "terrible" rating on IMDB and I could not remember the more worthy movie to honor with it. I hope to get the trash to entertain and get the saddest, lazy kind of trash. I have found a movie which can not take care of anything with its creator. <br /> <br /> There is still no allegation about Larry's written, written and starred "Hell Raid", a simple plot in 1976 hidden treasure and a triangle of keys, two banders and a fatal murder. Larry firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly and firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly and firmly firmly firmly firmly and firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly and firmly firmly firmly firmly firmens it firmly and firmly firmly and firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly firmly. There is a dialogue containing horrible fire extinguishing / figurative enough to stop the word "fire" for life. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hooper has been completely humiliated, others are not lucky. Sometimes they hit the road on their bikes, causing Michael Madsen to feel more sad because his high handles seem to insult humiliation due to being present in this movie. There is a lot of silicon-enhanced nudity, but there is a fairly small step and no humor, creating a surprise that has some kind of audience in their minds. <br /> <br /> I guess most people will be cheated, with 60-year-old biker fans watching this movie. Make yourself a favor and instead revisit the real stuff.
