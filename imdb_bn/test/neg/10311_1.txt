Previously the liberal way to comment. Electricity and plastic waste in this movie. On the other hand, I found a lot of interesting fun to see it as friends and describe it as "out of the past!" "I can not express what words I can feel about this word" "This movie will move you" As expected, the friends took these aesthetic comments as enthusiastic consent. They were wrong. I was worth $ 5 for foisting sadistic pleasure movies on these people. On the other hand, one (former) friend says that I am 90 minutes behind his life. I especially enjoyed the "gun point" of movie parts. It's really weird in the awesome.
