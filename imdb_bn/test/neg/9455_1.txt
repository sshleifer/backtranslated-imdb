Buying for Â£ 1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There are no reasons to see even the wood acting, the lame impact and a horror storyline all up to be a movie. PV is one of the movies which can not be bitterly beneficial for good benefits; Instead, this bile tries to create itself as a possible fool, stupid, and shit. <br /> <br /> A vampire has created a series of sales of old people as a lifelong, and those who take it under its control. A former lab intern's team tried to try and stop him. Someone should stop this garbage builder. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie, and I am really worried about the human race because 2 people gave it 10 times 10 out of 10 tortures.
