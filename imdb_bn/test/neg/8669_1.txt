Why is so terrible adaptation made to them? The entire "Complete Genie Austin" series is a huge disappointment as part of Masterpiece Classic. Characters have complete miscast and no chemistry on screen. The whole thing seems to run rather. It seems to be a great composition compared to the film publication based on the same novel in 1999. I really want to forget it. Although I'm really glad that "Pride and Prizudis" will not be rebuilt as part of this project and we will see icon and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer L.K. as the title. If you skip this "Manfield Park" consider yourself lucky!
