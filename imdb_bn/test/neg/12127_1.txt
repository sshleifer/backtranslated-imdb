This movie was terrible. Acting was long, but the writing was so bad that it was difficult to know whether anyone was acting well. This is one of the worst movies of the genre - I am disappointed by anyone to monitor it very much. <br /> <br /> If you see Cree-Baby then I recommend changing it and only Mr. For Depp and Hours and Half
