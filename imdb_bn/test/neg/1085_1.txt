This picture was intensely bitter from the beginning to the end. OK, so I salute Burmone for increasing global recognition of Burmese events, but that's what he earned. About 10 minutes in the film, I thought, "Oh no, we go back here", and I could tell you exactly what's going to happen in the next 80 minutes. Patricia Arquette had such a role outside of her depth, and her performance was woodwork and incredible. You think, being such a conventional saddled with conventional scripts, perhaps annoying set, and reflecting on the screen as such. The film was just ridiculous. At one point, Arquet's old friend was shot dead and he prostrated himself on the ground. In the next scene, he is running through the forest, probably trying to break the 100 meter record! - Or maybe he's just trying to escape from Borman !! If you have trouble sleeping in one night, play your VCR colorful game and you will lose some time. I rarely criticize such a movie, but in this case it is completely justified.
