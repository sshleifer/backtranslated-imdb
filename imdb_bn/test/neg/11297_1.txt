* Hannibal Speaker * Hanib Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) has returned ... for a movie mock! Now he is in Italy, praised our food (like Reynoldo Pazzy (Ziancarlo Giaynani)), but Claris (Julianne Moore) and even the former victim Major Gargar (Gary Oldman) returned to the United States for scores. <br /> <br /> I tell you, this film is not worthy of being spoken with the silence of Lambos and Manhattan, because it is true, completely complete, completely bid. <br /> <br /> I mean, with the opening of Ray Lightown Kanium, the last scene was opened and he was forced to eat his brain part? WTF? Then, why were all so annoying at Hell (including Clarice)? And why is not the story going anywhere? I think the 'tin' chapter of this Hanib series; Foolish, fool, fool for the sake of Gore and the whole embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, especially if you like any of the Honeyball movies (SOTL, Manhana, Red Dragon, Honeybill Rising). <br /> <br /> Hanbal: 1/10.
