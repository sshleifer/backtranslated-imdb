Well, first of all, excuse me with the hair on the head. I had rented another day for movie rentals and saw this. I heard something about this, so I picked it up and looked back and it was a brief review from John Faron AK Arro of Hefazat-e Islam! At the moment, I thought, "Well if she likes it, I like it!" So I hired it and finally came to see it last night (college keeps me so busy). Oh and I want to add that I read the review of the array and it proves that it has given half an inch of 4 stars. So my expectations from this movie went to IIFE from very high. After watching this, I again agreed with Arro (and the quote quoted from the review was the only positive thing!) Wow, is this movie sinking or what? Why do I start with the start? Well, this image was so humble in my opinion. Even the cool Gore bit does not make me excited and when you are not excited about any movie, it's bad! Character I hate many and from the beginning I could say who would die and who did not. Actually this picture proves to me a bit wrong, but the worst thing is that the special character I wanted to die was not! What's the hack? And the main daughter and people are seen chemistry? Did not feel it He was apparently there to be an eye candy and to love him, otherwise I thought he was a waste! And as a horror fan I would like to know that while "Fool's horror movie" does not happen sometimes will not be a movie otherwise, but here those who have sustained me! Hello Why should you look from her when the killer is made in the room of Noon? And it is supposedly done by no less than smart characters. Twist .... Ah, it was fixed, if it was not a billion times and I could not sit through this fall of the film to reach this point! My main point: The stupid movie sucks my favorite (actually my only favorite) film with some words from critics. Jerks!
