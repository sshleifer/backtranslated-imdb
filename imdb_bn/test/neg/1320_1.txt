As bad as they get. This image makes a terrible mistake to not care about what's happening to viewers. The two women in this Flicker are so stupid that you start to root for the bad guys, so this thing will end. <br /> <br /> This picture is one of the few who was so bad that I had to travel to another channel. <br /> <br /> Put a hibro language, this image lacks pricelessness. People, even people from Ohio, do not just act like this. Well, what do the authors do <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
