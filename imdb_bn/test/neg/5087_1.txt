In addition to the beautiful images of New Zealand's cineographer Alun Bollinger, this image is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is so divided and lost that it is difficult to know what is going on at any given time, and only when you feel that you are following it, the part is lost again, like a lost two-pole dog. <br /> <br /> Musical score depends too strongly on horror, too emotional pieces, which in a certain way tries to force viewers to feel, such as a sensation of instrument is played as row sheet ?? 'Feel sad here'; 'Feel frustrated here'; 'Feeling Fierce' On top of it, the repeatedly used repeated samples put the audience at the laughing point. <br /> <br /> On silent film days, where musicals were the only illustration of voice ?? But when you look at the river queen you will not think like this. <br /> <br /> There was so much of voice-over use that it is astonishing to see if this image really needs an image. It might be easy to play a radio but even it will be hard to follow. It is very clear to ignore the stolen items from the <br /> <br /> and the Jane campaign piano. Is not the beach and forest shots just about identical to the piano ?? Perhaps a few of these later Alun Bollinger cameras work ?? But feelings and dimensions over the voice are very strikingingly closed. And when the character of Holly Hunter is torn apart by his wings, then who can be forgotten, Sam is being cut by blue in the form of his index finger. Does it remind you when the wirewarm separates its 'trigger finger' and surprises the ax? I think so. <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not recommend watching this image for everyone, unless you wear some ears-muffs and just go with the mind scene.
