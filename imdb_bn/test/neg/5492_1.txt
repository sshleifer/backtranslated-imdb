I do not think odd artist pictures. But when they are indecisive to the false symbolism and ambiguous dialogue, and when it is clear to the filmmaker's arrogance more than the benefit of the audience, I will be disturbed. I'm not a fool yet, I just could not understand what the image was trying to say. Or not The film is a fantastic form of human communication. Why some movie makers use it instead?
