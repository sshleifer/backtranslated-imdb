Why, oh, why is this trash considered a classic? I've seen high body numbers on Simpson's episode. In fact, nothing happens in this film, and most of its running time is filled with less less helpless soap opera with less helpless melodrams. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Tenton family is struggling hard and the father goes to his mother and the younger son goes to repair the car. But when they go to the birds, they discover that the guard dogs are crazy. The rest of the picture is sitting only in their car, when Slurbering St. Bernard overlays them over. <br /> <br /> About this child, I've never seen a more annoying child in a film. And obviously she is completely aspirate like blond-like and blue-eyed kids, specially featured in packets of kindergarten, such as me, brown eyes and dark hair people are clearly more sympathetic. She is all crying and whine. Goes for the same mother. He drives the car out, gets in the car, drives it, gets in the car. <br /> <br /> I know this was made in 1983 but I was sick of the horror film. Characters are stupid, irrational decisions. If Mummy uses some common sense, she can move away from the chick. <br /> <br /> It has very bad writing and zero tension. If you want to see a good "bad dog" movie then see John Luffier's Man of the Best Friend. It's funny, inventive, a good dog, a high body count and more involved stories. Leave this garbage away.
