The first word I can find to describe this movie is Awful. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First, this plot is a very thin plot (do not comment further in this section) and a plot to follow many of the characters in this character. It makes the movie so bad, because you know what's going on. Secondly, there are many questions in the movie which are never published. One of the questions is (and it's no spoiler): What is good in that spine !!!!!!!!!! Thirdly, the characters are very bad, not only because the film is not bad, but also because of the sorry actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Or are afraid of the threat of sudden threats, but you are not afraid, you are not afraid because you know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The movie is about a bad killer ants as a movie! I hope this was a very big movie but the story is bad, because the actor is bad, the film has raised many questions and is not alarming because the movie is unlike.
