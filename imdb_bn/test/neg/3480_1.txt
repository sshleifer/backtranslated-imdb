Being a fan of bad movie, I was thrilled to find 3 packs of best buy cr @ ppy horror today. The set was cheap and was a horror movie called "The Dark" which I remember to see in the theater. <br /> <br /> The rest of the two were equally bad. "Animals from the emergence" are probably the worst of the bunch. Since many of them are not bad because they were all bad. But the story of his stupidity, bad acting, terrible influence and obstruction actually made it a lot of fun to see. I was rolling over the floor with the development of each new plot. The discovery of the abandoned ship, the missing worker, realized that something was terribly wrong !!! It was a lot better !!! Of course, everyone's favorite scene seems to be a sexual scene. God !! I lost it almost !!! One of these is "Giant Cam", I have to say that I enjoyed this picture a lot. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of bad movies, so I've enjoyed it but with all the fairness, I have to give the movie 1. 1. It was effective ... but if your bag is rubbish, at least this rent ... ( Yes BAD pun was deliberate)
