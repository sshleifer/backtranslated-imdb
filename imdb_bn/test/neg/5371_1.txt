This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course its net. But it is hated. I personally know that this may seem real "to make" minds affecting more creative films. The young lead men can not be more unconvincing. He reads the line-everything he says Do we really believe he knows what he is saying? Blair-Witch has a lot of ways in this show. The fear is "cold" and computer generated seems to be reproduced. Or is it from a projected line "What was it? Did you hear it?" Also, there are truly trusted psychologists that simply do not want to "stay on screen". Another Doo-Factor ... How do these producers feel that we're actually going to buy that unusual operation, only in possible 2-day possible (if we are lucky) only to be wizarding in the film? I do not think so. A 2+ week on a site should be more believable. They are "disappointing" with computers with "NASA radar checks" and those that look fancy. And IE: Exorcismms should not be staged like "Exorcist" movies. When will they fix it? The acquisition of Satan or other evil spirit influenced people differently. They just do not waste their voices like tall blair and fartily like cartoon love on the drug seed. This show will help greatly as said good synthesis on "mental power" as well. We would like to see and hear everything that is definitely flashing in front of them. Other stories bs do not cut away In a final note - shooting stars do not interest when you show fake pictures before the UFO. I hosted this show that the young dark-haired people could be pressed downright terribly down-right. To avoid this show. For fear: See the old unforeseen mystery episodes ... not new (entertainment has been oh-so wrong). But that's for a different blog.
