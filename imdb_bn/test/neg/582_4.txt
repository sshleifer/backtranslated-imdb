Lu Costello (Sons Abbott) is a small town self-appointed "garbage collector" (and inventor of a time-control device!) Who secretly presents big shots to the city's nephew. After sleeping, Lou's daughter (Dorothy Provin) goes to a dirty cave - why do not we learn in error - and 30 feet appear as a monster. Provine certainly played a good game, and she is not bothered to try to see the ridiculous (since it was impossible), yet the screenplay is really cruel for this character, its not a monster but turned him into a nagging harpy. When attacking the army soldiers, Castello will be the one who will accept, but nothing will be done with the transition. Last year, through the attack of 50 feet of the lady, the picture has been highlighted by Lou Custello in his final bow, but gives something else. The special effects are marginal, when the script needs a fun line and direction snapper passes. * **** to 1/2
