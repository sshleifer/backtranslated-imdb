My wife and I saw this abortion since her start. I hated it immediately, but my wife jumped over it for a few years. It became worse for me and the letters were annoying and sad without a freedom fighter. My wife became tired and we stopped watching. Sometimes I pass through it by catching a clip or by surfing the channel. Always shout someone to someone else or do something terrible. No lighter moments nor any kind of happiness seems to be. We always saw it when that was always my main whip- no ridiculous The authors seem to have no idea about the drama - they seem to think in the conflict IS drama, and of course it is only a material. Light and shade are strictly needed and the actors can bring it. I'm sure Eastendor's actors are capable but there is nothing to work with them. It will be the most depressed acting act of showbiz. I do not understand why British people see and love it. What the world speaks of our mind? I have heard that it does not know anything about my life or anyone else's life, like "real life", unless we blame ourselves from high buildings or public transportation. The themes that deal with it are far from being seen by the family but still are still pre-Watersheds. I love series like breaking or wire breaking but I would not expect them to see them at 7.30 or 8.00 in the evening. The program is big in the trash and should be avoided at all costs.
