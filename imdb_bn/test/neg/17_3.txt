In 2009, I would see the biggest disappointment could end. Park seems like a rare person who dislikes Oldbawas, but I think her "Lady Revenge" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" are among my best films. We saw in the 2000s. Therefore, I was really looking forward to seeing this, especially it got such positive reviews. Instead, I found the film clipped, and broke it if there was a new ground in the vampire style. And when I can appreciate some of these movies, I feel that the park did this very unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Others compare "on the right" and vice versa. "Right Right In" was better than this one and there was a saying that there was a fresh tail in the vampire style. Sadly, the park system was tired.
