Did you have to play (acting?) Or become a crew member for this movie's genuine appreciation? Yes, I'm serious about "Selena" and 42-year-old old age what we were doing / was doing. <br /> <br /> It all became a type of thing like "John Waters", bad friends are acting badly, friends. Somewhere along the line, the fun stopped, those who were supposed to be friends were not talking, and BAD became even worse. <br /> <br /> I felt a bad image. The size of one gold spandex pants, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film looks so bad, I do not even want to see my mother. <br /> <br /> I said to my director Cast and crew, <br /> <br /> "Why can not we all go together? <br /> <br /> <br /> For twelve years, people !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
