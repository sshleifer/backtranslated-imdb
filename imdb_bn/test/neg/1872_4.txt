Just one night late tender caught on the classic movie "Rain Man". The film was released in 1969. Sheryl Night is a star like her longtime landlady Natalie, who is unknown to unknown reasons - she leaves her husband and travels on the road to travel, where she does not even know where she is going. Natalie is also a newborn pregnant, which complicates things. On the way, he was a brain-related former soccer player "Jimmy" (James Kane), who kicked and beaten his college. There are many twists and turns in the way along with the path, as Nali struggles to take Jimmy's care and she realizes that she is mentally limited and can not take care of herself. He is going through a phase of his own struggle, lack of utterance, and his care. Natalie seems to be a woman at the end of a nervous breakdown; She had some strange phone calls to her husband, who wanted to come home. Natalie tries to dump Jimmy several times, only allowing her to re-enter her life through circumstances. A young Robert Duvall who plays a strange and annoying police in Natalie's friendship. This picture is going to end badly and understand everything you're doing. This image is a bit disrespectful at times, and the script is somewhat lacking. Francis Ford Coppola gave this direction, and of course he would soon become very famous for the direction of "The Godfather" over the next few years. The actors are good, saying, they will all be future before their film. Sheryl Knight is known at least three, although he is included as an actor. James Ear is particularly useful here and he just seems to live in this character. This picture is a little more than curiosity now, no doubt because it's an early film from Coppola, and I admit I never heard of it. So God bless Turner Classic movie for bringing it to a new audience.
