I can not believe that Isaiah and Washington were in the world! The plot (and I rarely use that word) centers around an army of fats that terrifies an urban apartment complex - at least I think what it was. This script was not an idea, I could not be less aware of the characters, and cameras were shown on their feet and shadow images of running rats. What should I do running. As an African American man, I often "support African American films" to appeal to my siblings. I tried to help, but enough enough. None of the others will have to see garbage. Please, brothers and sisters, do not produce any such product directly as the mouse's mice. Please!
