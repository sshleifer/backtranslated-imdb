I logged in here right after watching this movie, it seems that it was so terrible that at least its reviews might be entertaining. But all of you miscreants appear kind of like it. And so, since I want to do the job correctly ... <br /> <br /> From the first shot, the film shows a completely uncertain image of an irrelevant bridge to prolong its humiliation for the attention of viewers, long time. Then it goes to some slow-moving skboarding, which is at least a bit cooler, but then the offset that I heard the most annoying soundtrack shines on tears of attention on the song. Some girls screeching whispery on sounds like banging slim sheet together. Anyone who decided to stay there did not get ridden on a skateboard, I guarantee it. Visitors were present there to check the limits of patience. <br /> <br /> The movie's speed is almost 50 percent less than that. Do you know what's worse than an gratuitous slow shot? * Nothing is happening an gratuitous slow shot. * A guy walking along a guy here. A guy sitting here. Looking around a guy here. Here's a guy looking for another guy. After a while, I started watching the movie at double speed, whenever people appeared on the screen in the original dialogue and appeared on the screen, which was rare. Once, surprisingly, I slowed down to find out what I said to the movie, only to listen to the camera, but the sound was another awesome, awesome song and its original voice was not audible. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of some great tips that I've heard about writing - if you do not have to say anything, you will not use the fancy technique to act. Work to get back and say something. These camera tricks, such as slow and strange lighting and lenses and strange music, see the absence of the content and sounds. Many people have apparently bought it, and have realized mental gravity and deep meaning, but I think they are projecting it on a film that does not work in creating it.
