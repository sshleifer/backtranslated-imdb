I just grabbed the "King's departure" on the wire, and maybe it was right that I was a girl, but I thought it was on the insane side. The script and the direction are ugly (once I blame John Milius, it is all clear). Supporter actors were not really bad - James Fox was outstanding. I usually enjoy Nick Nolt's biggest disappointment. Once he became natively, he began to speak in a very tight, thick English, and in half the time, he felt nervous as if he used to smoke somewhat of the woodland forests of Borneo. And then the end - what ??? Lioroid can be in the same boat as the botanist (by the way, the botanists dumped the girlfriend, or what?) ??? The boat just happens to run the landscape around an island-ripe takeover by a crazy Anglo-former headhunting army deserter ??
