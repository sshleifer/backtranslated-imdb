When traveling with a team of Misbah for Miss Galaxy's debate, the aircraft, powered by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Sanders (Charlie Slater), is isolated, where Nueva's ship is protected by Jurassic insects. Although the group struggles to survive, foreign people use the ship to destroy human race and to control the earth in the world. <br /> <br /> I like parody, but "Miss Castaway" is a crime in the brain of people. Horror stories and special effects are very, but really very bad. "Lost", "Castaway", "Jurassic Park", "Six Ideas", "Titanic", "Apps Planet", "Riders of the Lost Ark", "Congo", "MIB", "Perfect Storm", "Austin Powers "," Gosses "," Mission Impossible "," Third Encounters of the Third Kind "," Star Wars "and" HLK ", but the problem is that most of them are not stupid and funny. In the end, better than trailer film. My vote four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Misano ques impasseville" ("Mission is almost impossible")
