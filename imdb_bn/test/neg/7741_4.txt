I saw the version of the movie MST 3, and this review includes minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, it seemed like it could promise as a chessy-ciphey flick, but the more I saw it, it got more frustrating. The first reason is very stupid - I liked Mousy shy girl with glasses to have a lot more choice than the model Wanda's at the end of the movie. More deeply, reducing specs and replacing the actual characters of clothing changes are replaced. Instead of growing a character that could take care of herself, as was the beginning of the movie, Wanda was reliant on men to do everything for her. Acting could be better (although I used to get tired of getting crack in Ireland's voice - they were even in the movie! It was not bad.) The background was right, but it could be a little hockey (people with aliens = spokesman), and more explanation . <br /> <br /> Maybe I was just interested in movies, but Joel and Bots were very few for me. The film can be better than them. <br /> <br /> Overall (for the movie, not MSST3), it's 3 out of 10. It was exactly what it was.
