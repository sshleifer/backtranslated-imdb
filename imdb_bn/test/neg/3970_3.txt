Part: Clones are not a bad movie. My tape has its MST 3K version and it's ridiculous, but it's not the worst movie ever. As far as I can say, it is more than 80% of the movies they have fun. If they could conceive of a better script, more money and decent actors, It was not too annoying and it might have been a classic if there was a bit more excitement. Sadly it was botched in production and ended up on MST3K.
