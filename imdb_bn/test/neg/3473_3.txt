The title of the movie "Nero" is one of Germany's most fascinating Roman emperors, Lucius Demi≈°is Enobburbas, which is known as Nero. Although at least this attempt tried to show more historical accuracy than Nero, it was completely fantastic, Nero Peter Ustinov "Kow Wadis!" Acted in. It is still a major failure. And those IMDB-commentators still believe that the campaign for Suetton and Tesitas is true, please read a book about Nero published less than 20 years ago. Nero Rome does not burn, it is proven! She did not kill Britannicus. He did not maim for relief, murder and pleasure, he was the first emperor who was banned from gladiator fights. The film is still made up of many mistakes, errors and genuine styles, especially the sets were cheap and disrespectful, the palace looked like some villains, the city itself seemed like it was like a cheap set. The acting was good and sub-difference, the music was almost impossible and the film was soon broken, after which Niro became emperor in a scattered, bad-edited world without any explicit fiction. So there is still the possibility of an epic biography of Neur, which shows the truth of Nero, despite the falsehood of Roman Emperor Suetton et al of Roman rule.
