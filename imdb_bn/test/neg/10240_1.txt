<br /> <br /> I said, "Manas, the fate of luck" <br /> <br /> <br /> I used to think that Manosu, my monkey, will always be the worst movie ever. Actually, I did not think anything bad. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxin" is the rare movie where every single piece of it is uncomfortable, rigid, dark. You have often seen a movie and commented, "Who makes this thing poor?" From the illumination to the soundtrack the script influenced the script. . . Well, everything, this movie is absolutely unendurable. It is very bad, I never used to say that this is the worst comedy or the worst drama I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to laugh too. I'd like to eat a platelet of broken glass rather than sit again through again.
