Holding the rest of the Marx Brothers box set, I was frustrated at seeing everything outside of a non-night. This stinker is unfortunate I'm left out of the worst, tricky line seen and characterized so far. The playwright is so evil, it is difficult to deal with television and it is difficult to try and try. <br /> <br /> As Marcus has done well, outsiders are suffering from their debris and they have at least one good gog or two when there are so many good. The material here is clearly written for someone and it actually spoils Marx's talent. To avoid. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 3/10
