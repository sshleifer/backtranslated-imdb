This film is bundled alongside "Gali Fimavano le Coulte ... Lo Chiamovano Camposanto", and both films leave many more to be desired by their DVD prints. First of all, both films are very dark - it sometimes makes it hard to see what's going on. Secondly, there is no subtitle of a movie and you are forced to watch a dubbed movie - even though "i priso del potrera" seems like a good dub. Personally, I always like the subtitles but it is not a problem for the unreasonable. However, this DVD problem is not the fault of the original filmmakers - only four decades later the indifferent package is being sold in the market. <br /> <br /> This photo is about the murder of Garfield. This is a serious problem, because Van Johnson sees more like a goriff like Judy Garland. No way he looks like a garfield. He has no beard, missing hair color and style and does not even stop it anyway (believe me, I'm an American history teacher and let us know about such things!). The real life Garfield was a civil war general and Smith Brothers looked like a boy in a cough drop box. Plus, Dubbing is only used to voice voice for other people using voice. Van Johnson is so never before or even so macho !! He was a good actor ... but certainly not a believer general or Maoist was the President. <br /> <br /> In addition to the stupid cast, this image was not in any way at Garfield's death. It is clear that filmmakers are not gerafields, but monetize JF's crazy ideas about the idea of ​​death. Garfield was shot in Washington, DC (not Dallas) with only serious mental problems - with guns, not a group of men with rifles. However, according to most experts Garfield (actually two months later) was a deadly doctor - who investigated and investigated and investigated a bullet recovery and never stopped refusing to clean their hands or equipment in the investigation. In other words, George Washington (died primarily by blood clot when suffering from pneumonia), he died due to immorality. They did not acquire any rights in the film ... In fact, apart from killing President Garfield, <br /> <br /> Because this film is not nearly identical to the real history, it is like reading a history from any other planet or like a serious brain Someone with injury Why are you niggans, war robots and Greek deities when you do it? Along with some decent acting and production costs, the script is the key to the cow's cow, because I do not recommend watching it. It's just a complete and nasty mess.
