McCain arrives in Brighton; In spite of having a written reception in the British press and state-fund-British-cinema, I think in writing that we want to get a bit of Graham Greene's rural, hard-working London-by-sea. <br /> <br /> This is not even the ambition of it. Directly reproduce the character Guy Ritchie type out of their clone 'n creep trailer. The format looks more like a British TV series than a movie (Brighton is a backdrop goldmine, which has been broken down by plastic studio work). <br /> <br /> I saw this film for Fame in good acting from Jansen ... He is a bit slick for this company, his big brand incomplete related to blockbusters as Deep Rising The search continued (even a role!) The search continued. Circus boring 3/10
