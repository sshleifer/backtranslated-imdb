Nightclub star Robert Mitcheon investigated the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors) known as a missing personal artist. She is hired by Jaclyn Smith, wife of the concern of missing people. Jacqueline failed to inform Michiem that she knew better than her husband. After all, the settlement of her wealthy husband who he helped his boyfriend James Franciscus. <br /> <br /> What more do you expect from a rotten slashher film with Robert Mitchem? Manix goes to the west, the monkey is abused, the models are reduced to classic cars, and Smith is continually upgraded by Cyber ​​Danning, until a gyöllo style is wrapped, as well as a sad sadness for a sad tragedy. This is BAD Cinema. And this movie is sooooo poor. It makes the look mixed with trick or behavior like Halloween. Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Graphic Rated for violence, nudity and sexual situations.
