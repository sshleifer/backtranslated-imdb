In the opening shot when the US Marines disagreed with the US flag seriously, there is a difficult road in front of a movie, but unfortunately it was reduced. A military adviser credited, who apparently retired US Marines, is becoming even more annoying that this incredible violation of the protocol and the law became unknown. Even more annoying how they reported how a Marine is, then buried in a very brief way, how they identify the body, or even more annoying without the slightest explanation about the body being identified. The US government is still missing from WWII, and it takes months to identify the residue. For a few months or more, the military shot is in MIA and only when KIA is declared when remnants are detected positively, or red tape for several years. Here we believe that it will happen in days or weeks. Perhaps this could happen in Denmark, but there is no United States in the United States that has little involvement with the United States military. <br /> <br /> There are many other humorous moments outside when characters come with zingers outside nowhere. Some of the actors and actors should appear in the extended meeting as they struggled to find their motivation for such a hug. A script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been created on the spot, working from Cliffs notes. There is no way to know whether this script was really awful, or it was the responsibility of the mediators or mid-operated children in the studio. In both ways, it is not a terrible movie that should ever have been.
