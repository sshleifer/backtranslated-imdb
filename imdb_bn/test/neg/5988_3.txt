Shreiq is a full moon production. I knew what to expect (very low quality) but I do not expect to be sad to see Mrki. <br /> <br /> It's very awkward. Bad acting, confusing script and direction The annoying character I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably made in one week. I saw Skarmed's episode which was more complex and reliable than this cheaper. <br /> <br /> This is the look and feel of a poorly visible TV series orphanage episode. It was a joke to watch and I could feel dimmer and dimmer by the minute of my mind. It should not work very hard to see a movie.
