I've seen this movie 6 or 7 times, and it really gets fun every time. Perhaps what I enjoy is the clear character of the movie which offers us: All the American male heroes, his blonde girlfriend, the dancing dancer with glasses, a girl, the opponent joke, and the girl # 2. However, then we are presented with a converting mullets with two magical martial arts experts. Anyone can explain that, please contact me. Other highlights include Bobby Johnston's JB character Dell and his trademark line, "That's why I surround him." Seeing Johnston's performance, his carrier does not seem to be surprised at the fact that it comes down to the state of soft-core pornography. (Speaker) Also, after more than one philosophy, I still have no idea that at the end of a big night there is no talk; It's just electronically muffled noise. Oh well, that's probably good for that. And finally, why are all monsters so cruel? Is the wet skin scarier? It certainly did not help in this film.
