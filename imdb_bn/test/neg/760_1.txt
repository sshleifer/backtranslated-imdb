A terrible film; Badly written, played badly, cliched, hackneyed, drops. The courtyard is a good opportunity to educate about black cowboys, but the film is really terrible. This is a bad mix of the 1950's Randolph Scott B movie and the 1970's Spaghetti Bad. Villains are cardboard, flashbacks are ridiculous, excuses for dialogue <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Frankenstein's giant died on the lab table.
