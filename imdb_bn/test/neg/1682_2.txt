I gave six six gifts to the show because this event was actually a platform for Daimon Weinz because Cosky was for Bill Kocca, it had a lot of problems with humor and I think it's really a laugh as opposed to screaming screams. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle is a funny patriarch and an advertiser. He was a phenomenal in the film, but in the show he was there for advertising and although I liked it, I felt that the laughter was more important than the width. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Made a great choice for. I think J and Michael were more equal to the show but the other woman who was winning was eating lines with her crazy husbands and she went with her overwhelming discipline because she thought that it worked. <br /> <br /> Junior is just plain fool, Although his character should have been well developed and he has his moments of glory, we drive back the stupidity as he learned nothing, which drives me nut !!!!!!!! In most cases (the episodes I saw) are not referred to as concentrated around it. <br /> <br /> Claire is an attractive sister of a Christian dated, I think her boyfriend's character is even more attractive (She would be better than sticking to the film, the authors wanted to do more to show her intelligence but it is not enough stereotypical). br /> <br /> Kady Lovable and the little girl. I believe the author established his character as well as his parents and Franklin, <br /> <br /> Franklin I love this character and I think they are smart guys (T. J. this little talent For this reason they have done a great job of casting (if Zaara can be smart, then the bottom will be shown but it is tried) <br /> <br /> To all, this city is going to make a wonderful zodiac show. The finish and the respect is well done, I love the show and want to stay longer than that. I can not wait to see the end of the series
