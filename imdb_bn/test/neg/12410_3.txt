Repetition: The only terrorist who lives in the desert and acts as the other sword agent remembers the way his life has become. It started with the fact that instead of the woman he liked, he decided to marry his brother, which led him to leave his house. Huang, one of the Taliban who kept himself in the midst of a complex love story, where a woman wanted to kill him for the escape from the promise of marrying his younger sister. But sister wants to hire a sword to keep Huang safe, and if the woman and her sister are actually the same person then everything will be okay. <br /> <br />: The original version was released in 2008, I redeemed the release of the Redox version. I can not tell how the two versions are different, but Redox is very heavily equipped with the Xixia action system in China. It seems unfortunate that I have forgotten one of the most important elements in the style of a successful and entertaining movie. An understandable story But the true author and director of his style scenery and visual elements seems more important and more on the focus of Car Y Wang. There are so many colorful, beautiful scenes that are not related to the whole story. <br /> <br /> The story was edited and the timeline was also broken. There is a lot of rest in the scene, broken time lines and deliberately rescheduling. Very slow and quiet scenes suddenly get relieved by fierce and overwhelming fights, that only themselves are liberated by something else and irrelevant. As a result, a confusing and very unintentional movie. <br /> <br /> To make this cruel but very less fights, the film is kept in action mode. Posters and photographs may also be understood as this but are regarded as false marketing around. Within 90 minutes, only a few minutes may be considered as action, the other can not be far away. The film is very slow, very dusty and therefore very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can say that I'm not a Chinese-style fan, because often they seem to be suffering. Among these same issues, the most important scenario is more important than the story, but the worst example I have seen in the Time Redox's Ashes. <br /> <br /> 3/10
