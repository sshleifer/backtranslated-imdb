This movie is the worst movie of my life that I have ever seen! I wasted my time on this. I took a penalty for me because I saw this movie completely. Surprised wonder, how can Sunil visit create such a movie? It does not have any insecurity. Looks like he's gonna shoot the scenes and then join some editing software !!! Music is certainly good, but the film does not need so much unwanted songs. Kangna Ranat looks fake and I wonder what is the role of Selina Jaiti in the movie? Bobby Deol is good. At least he can work! Instead of closing shirts in almost all of the scenes, you have to read some of your portals! The last was the most merciful! <br /> <br /> I watched the "300" (movie) after watching Shakalak Bom Boom, you say what I felt about this Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect Bollywood, but the director and producer are really real, not everything is fantastic!
