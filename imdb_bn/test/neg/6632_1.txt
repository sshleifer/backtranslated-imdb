This was not supposed to be made in a movie. Everything about it was stupid and I do not think I was disappointed even once. Bits and pieces were okay that I guess but that's about it. Many parts were equally similar to many other movies which made them a lot of hell. There were some famous actors / actresses but none did good, they certainly would not care. It is a film that tries to finish an "intelligent" but it was so stupid that it was not literally the value of any release. Carrot top is probably the worst comedian out now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> /> <br /> Rent: Only if you see something else and get a free coupon, it's still not worth your time.
