All right, this movie has become so bad, the first and the first one! Zombies make up was very fake! Very poor acting! And do not really follow it first! While watching this I remember Wow think this is a best composition compared to this first. I want to catch it on TV, do not spend your money! It's the worst movie I've ever seen but its not on the list. I started to see it last night and fell asleep so I saw it today and almost fell asleep again! The plot was in vain, I mean that a small military team has been sent to lead a lead zombie's blood and sent it to a mission, so they could use it to save lives and stop zombie, but they wanted you to kill it all. They made lots of bad guys who were really bad. If you ask me that it was a residential resident and not a good rod. If acting was good and fearing to see what they are actually behind the corner you might be made. With this dead body my grandmother went to the building and could survive! In 1-10 I give it a 2.
