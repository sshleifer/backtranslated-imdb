I saw this movie tonight and do not need to tell me that it's awesome! I hope this will be great, because you know, there are not many movies about the mixed Asian vampire in our Asian culture; But in the beginning it started in a bad way: the launch of the film seems to have not ended! Plot is so weak and if you stop fights and soundtracks then you really do not have anything useful! The director of this movie does not look for some important concepts of how much time he can spend on spending and spending in flashbacks. (Not to mention some other things) <br /> <br /> People like me see a great vampire movie who wants to see, I really recommend to see 'The Last Days' or 'Interview with Vampire'.
