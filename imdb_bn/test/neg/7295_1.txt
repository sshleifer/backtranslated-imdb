If you have seen Atlantis 1, you will know that the film was really cool, it was a great animation and a good script. This movie was so sloppily drawn and animated. The story is also dopey. I was so frustrated in this half-baked drill that I could not make it in the first hour, and Man tried it! One of the issues in this film was that it expanded the character of "rig", which makes her more sympathetic and three-dimensional. Take this from me, judge this junky from the cover of the video box. The cover has grabbed Disney Scalco badly, apparently to pieces easily from a helpless parent. It will not be too bad if it is alone, but it is not completely usable, as a bright piece of coatels, like Atlantis.
