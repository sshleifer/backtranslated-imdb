I think my biggest mistake was to see this repetition of 'Piranha', which is back to back with Joe Dante's '78. I gave "Woman" last week. Curiously, the right to see the remake after '76 Originally has really appreciated the 2006 edition for various reasons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This process is back in '95 pirina version. It's actually a low picture that it's enhanced. Originally, the '95 version is less or less the same movie, because it tells the same story and it is followed by a visual landscape (only Barbara Steel's character and military intervention was written in it). But cinematography was not good. The acting was very bad. In particular, Alexander Paul (playing Heather Menezes' character) again showed me that he was an awesome actress. Bradford DeMillan (from the '78 version) showed the way to play his Charlton Hesson, which was amazing, when William Kat William Kats did well in the '95 version. So I do not really think of him. But the entire cast is a very inferior and the only appropriate event, James Karen ("Living Dead Review", Part 1 and 2), explores Camo. John Karl Buechler's make-up effect is not as handsome as Bob Bottin's. Musical score had some rings on it, but the score of Pino Donaggio was much more memorable in the original. So these errors are really being shared with the re-showing the original as part of this double bill. <br /> <br /> As Scott P. The lemon rimik has been followed by Dante's original, I think it is quite entertaining to sit through it though it is not the root of the intelligent danta. But really, I do not like Levi's version, it's really that the first film stock footage was reused during most of the Piranha attack scene. I do not like it when movie-makers do this (and I'm not talking about flashbacks or other legitimate reasons to use footage). I mean, if you do not bring the new shot element (or imagination) of the budget, then for Pitt's request, do not repeat the friction. But Roger Karam has made this (cheaper) remake, so I do not think it should be astonishing about using the footage again. <br /> <br /> If you decide to visit "Pinarah", then make sure you've seen the original when it's been a while. You may enjoy this remake a little later. And oh yeah, the cool little stop-motion creature from the original is not expected to be found anywhere in this movie. But worse than this, there is no nude nude in it (actually there were several tat-shots for that, and the blonde girl who pulled her underwear out of the scene in an open scene, even accidentally had her jeans!). This '95 version has been made for TV.
