I'm a big fan of HP Love Book, and Mito's background has made some good stories and stuff. And in the last years there were some children who made movies about HP's work, ?? Low groan flicks for bigger part ?? And HP are shown to their public places like the movie festival festival. Now, as I said, most of them are not big, but at least the lovers' heart and the films like "soul" and "cool air" or "cheeky calls" - think of what I want - fan base and other loonies that are HP's Gifts for like creation. Still there are people like Yan Zukan who tear the name and created a movie that I conducted myself and watched some of the friends in the beach. What Mr Jackson thinks is ... But, blocks like maybe earlier films like Aaron Vaneck or Brian Moore may not be worse, but they can still offer any stories, real characters and some connections. Lovecraft! The name "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" is not a movie loop-adaptation by blabbering. <br /> <br /> This flick is not only for the stomach and hiding fans of Methos, but it will not appeal to people who like 1. Good movies, 2. Laughing about bad movies, 3. Good C degree splatter movies or 4. See everything that has been written on DVD cover. I will not go to the "plots" of this waste, because it is already discussed by others on this page, but as I said, the unknown departure was like a movie that I made with some geeky friends. Since there is a lack of ideas for this story and the ridiculous "Morocco-Nonsense-on-the-art-stuff" The self-helping flicks of this "quality", if you know all its blocks and know HA-HA, you will see how XY can eat the old Tomato sauce and the fake blood made from the stuff? But hey, you do not keep it on DVD-cassing, it announces a real movie and wants money for it? <br /> <br /> Can I give it for both ?? Effort or something like that
