This terrible cartoon-like epic has become a godly classic for some reason that it is difficult to work harder. It can not be considered as a complete artificial look of set design or all-star cast actor. These days are shown very frequently on the FOX movie channel or AMC. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that the famous actors such as Walter Kabutar and Joan Fontaine have also spread in this rebellious science fiction, none of which is true of the ring. It's like a costly budget, spending a full show of guitar letters and disagreeable conversations on a Saturday afternoon. This is a comic book version of the novel Zeus Verne. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He contributed absolutely nothing to the role of his cardboard but finds an empire and uncomfortable presence and quite a lot of time. Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and one of the best, Peter Lor - as well as Frankie Avalon, who has made the title tune - it's safe - nobody's favorite title is becoming tune. <br /> <br /> A great disappointing experience to sit through a movie that spoils interesting cast and almost insults someone's intelligence. Completely unconvincing end from the beginning. The film, as well as the superb submarine, has long been submerged under the sea for a long time before fighting with the octopus, bringing the film to a great conclusion.
