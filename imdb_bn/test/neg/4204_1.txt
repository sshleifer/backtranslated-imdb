I work at an office on weekends, and have a TV that only receives a channel. So, I do not have the option of turning some good. Although I keep it, it provides a little background sound. Sometimes, I get a decent movie / show. Not today Today, I got a "breaker breaker". The city looks like a third rate set (of course, it is). All actors and bad guys they just look like graduation from Stantman School. I saw a good dramatic act of carnival. Special effects (Michael Jackson Manhood after further fraud in the fire at the end of the film). Even at the end of the movie the horse was a terrible actor ... a bad thing, badly shot, badly written movie.
