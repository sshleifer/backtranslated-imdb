This movie has made me feel bad! When I think the cat in the hat. I think hat books cats You know, a few years ago parents used to teach their children. Well, though I will do this movie a lot better! But my dream was not much like a book! Instant It's more like young adult humorous cinema. The cat is talking to a machine in the garden (hoo) cat talks to her, as her hoo (Auzin Adult humorous). Naming his vehicle I was a little unprepared for a kids movie though everyone. Under the rating you will get: light cude humor and some bi-entenders. I mean briefly adult humor. I could come back to this movie! Wal-Mar said that the film will not be opened, they said. If you are thinking about buying this I probably advise you to rent before buying.
