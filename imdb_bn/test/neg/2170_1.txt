At the time of voting I was going to give 2, but after seeing 1, it became terrible and nail to the head. The blood thirsty savages of Native Americans as a screenplay deeply disturbed me. This is the third picture I D. Saw it Griffith is where the horses of men are sterilized in ugly ways. People will not be able to talk about his story so I will try and stay away from Mr Griffith personally. In my opinion, three films were probably influenced by millions of people and their children's thoughts about children. Perhaps the reason for such a lot of anger is still with us ... Some might say that the camera work was great, the action was the first for its time. Positive positives are more negative, it takes $ 10 from you and is ready to make the dime back.
