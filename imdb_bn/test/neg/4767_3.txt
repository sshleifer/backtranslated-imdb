This is not one of Miss Davies' worst movies, it's pretty bad. And it is tragic that in recent revisionist fashion, the recent IMDB writers deliberately raised their pictures to create objectionable scores for their past - or it seems. For some years, the common sense was that Davis was a terrible actress, and his role was only because his bee William Randall had bought his way to Hartley Hollywood. This is certainly the Citizen Hall of Osson Wales photos. Harvard used his wealth and clout to build Davis's career. With all these money, he has created some extraordinary films and it is no surprise that people got snippies due to the extra attention he received. It is compulsory to see that your movies are asleep with the financier. However, despite this edge, he has made quite a bad film and I think in most of our films he needs balance. Finally, no reasonable person could believe that today (1/5/08), PEG O 'two other Davis films that appeared in my heart and recently Turner Classic Movies (Floreroder Girl and Marianne) were extremely high-score - High No, Ben Rate, our best years of life and all the queens in the western fronts, their rankings are more than such films !! Actually, Marina will now be ranked as the fifth best movie based on IMDB with 8.8 scores !!! Meryn was not aware of Davis and most of his movies were financial disaster, this is a serious problem !! However, she was a much better actress than Citizen's ear and before she started to sleep with Herrest, the films started spreading. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <p> Mostly because of Meron's terrible miscasting. His French pronunciation in Marianne was beautiful, although his Irish pronunciation at PEG seems just wonderful - especially not Irish. Plus, and maybe I misunderstood, but using the word 'yes', he used to pronounce it as a Shakespeare without a film set in Ireland in 1930! Also, there was a great emphasis that Mourin would have to be a gifted star - so they could dance and sing without acting. The song actually fit the scripts in some of his films, but here it comes out of the place and is critically disappointed from the picture. It seemed as if you could almost hear the heart shouting, see - she is a great actress --- look at her song and dance. Sadly, Marion was just uncomfortable in this scene and finding the place. But the concept of playing this young man, 36-year-old Mario, is the biggest problem. The character that she played at the beginning of the film was believed to have been played by Mary Pickford Thirteen and in the 20th century - completed with dry tiles and fortunate attitudes. Miss Pickford can also play this role, even though she was not a girl. But here, Marian kept some weight and looked at at least 30. No offense - She was fine for her age - but she could not look like a teenager! Surprisingly, after overcoming the hearts of millions of people in Marine's career, he did not realize that the most important thing needed to spend his money was a good script and that fit Mario's titles. Believe me, I've rated a lot of her films a lot (I especially worship the people shown), but here she just could not help but flop - the film was a turkey.
