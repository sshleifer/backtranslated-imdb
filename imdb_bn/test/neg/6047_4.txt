In Chicago, four electric power led by Dean (Richard Greco) came to an old building to isolate the electricity. They accidentally activate a portal and reach another level, where Chicago is destroyed by the Spider Queen and the mutants live. This group is managed by Crane (David Na Rum Man) and Ela Elena (Kate Greenhouse) and the inventor of the portal Dr. Richard Morrelli (Colin Fox) discovered who lived for 30 years at this level. They joined forces trying to rebuild a portal to come back with them. "Webses" is a visible movement of "Sliders", only bad. Most conversations seem to be written by a person who did not finish the primary school, so they are frustrated. In addition, the story is unreasonable, and it seems Chicago is the only city in the world. The scientist is trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wire, as he is stealing a car, and is also very interesting. Richard Greco's face looks like a white version of Michael Jackson and is terrible. If the viewer closes his or her brain, he may prefer this forgotten TV movie.
