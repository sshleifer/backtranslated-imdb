If there is a movie that is considered a missed opportunity, then that movie Galaxina. Maybe a sexy statuesque female could be wrong based on a sci-fi film near Android? Surely such a movie can not completely waste the waste? Well, sadly, this movie is near vain. There are several errors with this product, but two fundamental problems completely destroy the entire enterprise. First of all, it's not a comedy with a fun bit, or at least a movie where potentially fun things are presented incredibly unnecessarily. Secondly, the title character is unfortunately unusually underused. It may be because Dorothy Stratane was not actually an actress but if it is still the best thing about film then it was a terrible decision. I do not really think to be a great thesis to pull off a sexy Android role to be perfectly honest. However, what we have kept is the mind-flexible comedy relief, which often produces spoof-type gags that are unlikely as the Alien, Star Wars and Big Saif-Fit hits like 2001. It's not badly written and all is funny, and it does not even have a plot to grow things along the way. The story is originally sent to get a rock that is about a police space-cruiser. That's it! Steven Spielberg once said that there was a high-concept movie whose plot line could be described in one sentence. Did you define what he defined as a movie which can be described in a sentence - <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems unlikely to win the fire, but it's unfortunately failed. Has been there. It seems that they tried to unite Star Wars in the explosion and adult comedy situations. It really achieves, which makes you cool and annoying that it should not have been. Barberala is not 80 for this. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the end of this film, it was horrific and terrible murder that killed Dorothy Straaten. And that's why Galaxin earned a significant amount of interest in his civilization. I think it's a big shame that Dorothy does not have any good films that can be immortalized.
