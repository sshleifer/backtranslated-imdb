The retro doll master is complete and the crane cap. In particular, doll stupid, and look crappy. Acting was powerless and the story was rancid.This movie is back in the past, where the doll was first made, where puppet master or Retro Putt Master was given PG-13 rating, the first Pope Master would be given PG-13 rating. There is no horror or doubt in this film. This movie was a puppet master film, which bubbles in mind, because it does not exist in this installment. Blood belts, good acting, or any entertainment like previous movies. Do not watch this movie, do not rent it, even you can not watch it on TV, because this movie is not old, violent and crappy.2 completely. 10. As a doll master fan, I'm disappointed ... seriously.
