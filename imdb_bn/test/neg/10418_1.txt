I am writing this review here and the movie is still not sitting. Actually, I've just checked, and have more than 45 minutes. But no matter, there is no need to see it till the end. I will write this review and play in the sunny background and will come up with some surprises that I never want to see or know. <br /> <br /> Enemy to this movie? Characters are not trusted. The plot is not trustworthy. The film's barbarity is frustrating. Basically, each element of the movie has a false ring. Bussasema apparently thought that there are some of her dozens of movies that already found the handsome theme of the defective families and the meaningless meaning of life. However, Buscemi was wrongly wrong, because there is nothing new in this movie. It tries very hard to be depressed, but thankfully no one can be depressed, because it is clear that no such person is present in the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image was voted for many unwanted prizes. Annoying !!!! Bottom Line: Stay away from this unmatched film at all costs.
