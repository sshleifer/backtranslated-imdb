I was a fan of Bappy and I hope the Angel will end only in one season. But when I came to the end I saw. And what can we get? This episode was known as "No One Away", it was one end. <br /> <br /> I was so frustrated by this episode. This is the worst way of this series. Why can not it get a happy ending? Why a few of the main characters die? Why did Angel become a man again reconnect with Buffy? No Angel must sign the blody piece paper that he will never be a man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " One should spell a word to make sure that someone has written this scrappy on this screen and lost in hell. <br /> <br /> Do not be bothered to see it, it's too bad, it hurts!
