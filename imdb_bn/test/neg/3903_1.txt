Jerry Ryan was the only reason to rent the movie! OMG that I've ever seen is the most annoying, vain movie !!! How lame !!! I really mean, give me a break! After the Voyager, I hope he will offer a good introduction !! <br /> <br /> If I was one of the last people on earth, I would not be in a travel trayer in Desert yet !! This is just a bad movie! About the Indian tribe and how he actually compared it every 10 seconds, it is really old. Poor Jerry, good luck next time!
