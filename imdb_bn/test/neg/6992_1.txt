Everyone really loves watching a bad movie. You see it, take a good smile and forget it at the next half hour. But this is not the one who is the one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, there is talk of a voice with a leather pants and a victory like Dracula's 50's. How did someone come with this guy ?? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or whatever ... My serial box has better acting skills (probably than all), it's incredible. But the most deadly battle scene where you think there might be something. They exceed so much hair, it's kind of description. No shame, I can not believe how this movie was approved by this studio. But I just had it thrilled. It's a self-deprecated pleasure to see. If you only see this in search of a movie for pain, and in that case, this one is sure to be the winner.
