I saw this picture a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist, and finally my ex-girlfriend on a small island. <br /> <br /> When the tape starts, my friend and my girlfriend are bound to the woods, until the cave ends up in the area. I closed his eyes and said, what would happen if I could not open it? Nazi and archaeologists closed their eyes and started crying a few seconds later. Nazi faces melted and the head of the archaeologist exploded. After a few seconds the video tape comes out of VCR and returns to the box and closes the top. Myself and my girlfriend were cruelly released. <br /> <br /> As a result of this experience, the video cassette was kept in a piece of wood and the same piece of wood was stored in a huge warehouse, and never seen.
