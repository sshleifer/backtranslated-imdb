Highly formulas with cosmic-shaped logic holes and a latent comedy. Oh, poor NYC lawyer! He is one of the most respected lawyers in the area, although he is not just by scraping, and when he gets to reduce the salary, he does not find out another work. We see him arguments in court so that others may rise and congratulate him on his burning, victorious delivery, but he can not stand up to anyone in his determination. In the house, people are ignoring problems until the storm from the house. <br /> <br /> The only character you want to root is the final maid, who is considered to be the real man who uses the world for logic and communication to survive. How ridiculous the maid should bring a chicken and wine to the lawyer and his wife on New Year's Eve because he is sorry for them! (Not played for bit smiles.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, very incredible and with a ** SPOILER ** Pat, the 180-degree end-everyone is active. How do they get top-stars big for this? If I live in the studio, I will send it again for full reconsideration.
