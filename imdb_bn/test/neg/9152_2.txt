Based on a fairly good "best seller", this movie - like most live-time movies - played more like a recombination than an actual movie. The only difference here was that it was not Meridith Baxter. Of these, women are not more than 20 years old and the general acting is very bad. <br /> <br /> The letters were all cliche and one-dimensional. The story was in the nature of sugar. I will not recommend it, but it's a thing that people like the book and those who look at the network will always think it's great. I just saw it because my girlfriend wanted to see it, so she did not have to read her loan book to her sister. It was not made for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end though, so she does not think it was as awesome.
