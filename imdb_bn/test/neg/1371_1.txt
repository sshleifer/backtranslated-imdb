I'm sorry but this guy is not funny. I swear, I've got good jokes at the age of 4 when he comes to some of his For example "Dee dee dee" is probably the worst catch phrase I've ever heard. There is no creativity in it, and when you reach the stage of showing your show to make fun of challenged people, incredibly slow in Mensia's part. <br /> <br /> Although everyone compares this stupid to Chappelle, they have no competition. First off they were very very different shows. I think all the menie heard only 10 minutes of average in just two minutes line to know about God what to know about him The Chapeles show came much more as a sketch sketch, which captured 2-4 all the show. All chappelle had a brief overview of each skit before and after each each. This place, if Mensia fails even more, Does Mensia think that there is a similar standup comedy to talk about her stopup special, which would be a beneficial idea? Before Mensia, some years ago someone wanted to hear George Lopez's progress, but dragged him out of his place of death? <br /> <br /> I say, although this person hates his people for his racism, I can not stand him for his disagreement. Comedy Central may brand as "controversial" for the minorities, and then leaving Chapels to follow the path. Problem, this guy is very clear that he does not want to be a chapel. So instead he performed his crappy show like a burning trainwreck on the ground. Does anyone want to see weekly standups on the same thing every Thursday, I'm not sure as fake. <br /> <br /> Although I can not express gratitude at the comedy center. This is made of ass's show. Personally after watching his stand, I do not know how he saw his first show. Jim Gaffigan, Zak Galifinakis, etc. There are many more worthy comics ... actually nobody is better than this fool.
