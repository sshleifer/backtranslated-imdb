This film is playing a deprived part of VH1's "Bencha Yeh Hua Nau" or "Behind the Music". The first half of the film (which describes its "glory day") is portrayed as an oddly absurd rock star by Abbey Hoffmann. You know kind of; Pashur's lead singer, beautiful boy, could not write any song, there is no yoke, but free and nothing gets all glory for girls. As a result, he is responsible for his success, misbehaves it, and eventually destroys it with himself. Hoffman's glorious days are suddenly ended when he is bombarded to deal with cocaine, surges and hides. <br /> <br /> The second part of the movie is hidden in the house. In it we see Hoffman as cruelty, everyone blames everyone, but for his own fall. Finally the bar completely passed to him; And he could not come grips with that. Sad The end Last credit roll and oh no! We have learned that in 1989, AB Hoffman committed suicide. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the filmmakers do not have this picture for Huffman to make this film. Because of the involvement of Tom Hayden and Gerald Liechkurts, I'm sure they used this film as a tribute to a person's life which was an icon for 60 years and leftist anti-war movement. These have failed miserably they. The film presents Aid Hoffman as an unconditional congratulations. We are not told about what drives him. How did he reach his opinion? How did he manage to capture the imagination of the whole generation? How did he organize a huge movement? Why was he involved in cocaine dealing at the height of his comedy? Why? Who knows, and does not seem to be the filmmakers, who is finally careful?
