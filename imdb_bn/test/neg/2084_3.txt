I did not see this movie when I originally came out, but the title has some songs to share and over time the word has been used and I think there must be something for Fick, so I dig it and give a view. Now I want to spend approximately an hour and forty minutes of my life (it takes too much). There was nothing special about the film, the acting was good, there was no big plot, there was no plot to keep the hole there. There was not much for the movie there. There were some chemistry between two people, but nothing about their relationship was compulsory; Nothing interesting about their stories. Lastly, when he tried to get the train to catch his fledged romance, my wife or I did not want to catch him. In fact, we have been able to make each other better and we do not really care if they come back together. So what can be said about this love story when there was no emotional investment in my 25-year-old romantic relationship as well as my wife. I'll leave it in the "Missed" section. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamach www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
