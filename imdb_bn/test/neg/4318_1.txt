All right, I went to this website before watching this picture, read comments, got a pump, - where they were pretty good for B-Flick - it looked and was completely disappointed. The main character of the rebel main characters straight out of the Midwest Act is suffering from wannabe stomach disease and even not allowing me to start two poles, it means there is a bloody door that is simply visible, check it out! This plot was completely predetermined, the editing was limited, I spent the movie when the editor closed at last, and the direction was clouded by bad cinematography. Now do not make me wrong, I love B-Flix, some really good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "High tension" <br /> <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
