All right, now I know where these annoying police / genocide TV shows come from. I believe they are coming back to this movie. "Sina of the Crime" is like a TV episode, or a serial episode. Finish with stock letters and situations - Hotshot police who tends to clash with their tops ... Older police, who do not want jobs on the desktop until the eyesight fails ... lazy racky ... double crossing dame etc. <br /> <br /> I like many actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I have seen this movie because I'm not the fan of this genre. When I was discussing the case, I would have tended ... something about bookies and informers. And oh yes, there was a stripper, previously played by wholesome Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is this: Why did he call Van Johnson "Uncle Wigli"? Was Uncle Wiggly a Rabbit? A character from a children's book? What does the hack have with something? I think I'm not just a hard guy's film Nair-Is, but I do not get it. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the dialogue mocked me "No one talks like that!" However, I can relate to a scene where Cop's wife (Arlene Dahl), who is worried about working at any time, realizes that she might not have her husband center of her life. Yes, I know that someone feels so much love, so dependent on them that they are constantly scared for their safety. So this movie has true moments, style conversations and under the atmosphere, which is confidently impressive and trying to make a real effort, it actually looks outstanding to me. <br /> <br /> A little background: this movie is Louis B. When MGM received from the girl, then Doug started to scurry and started to finish the orderly musicals that made MGM so great. Dore was determined to bring more "reality" to Shari's movies. I hate Shoaib's love. Maybe we can blame him for making all the ugly, shameless movies in life, ugly "true" about life, and (and, in my opinion, helps in being permanent), is paying attention to the worst of humanity instead. How did the classic movies designed to be designed by us do not raise us - the Great Depression and providing a necessary confusion during World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, we still need such confusion! There are still plenty of depression and war. And when they want to escape, nowadays people will bend? Trashy, the true brain of brain death Thanks a lot, drool!
