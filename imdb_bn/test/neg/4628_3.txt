I had a very difficult time sitting through this film. Unless you really are really adulterers and people want to talk about their sexual exploitation, I can not enjoy this movie. Geez - Most of the main characters behave like adulteration and their seriousness increases due to their many betrayal. I was grateful to the only element of the demonstration scene where one character was pissed and the blood spread everywhere because he picked an STD- Big Surfish !! Hmm <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie, see the series, Barbarian attack. Despite the general impossible nature of many letters, the order is very involved and more realistic - the value of your time.
