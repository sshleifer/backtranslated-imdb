The Twilight Zone had a wonderful show, it was very disrespectful - with some great episodes, some shy and in many. Do not believe deadly fans - there were some stickers and it was certainly one of them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They can remove them. Although I believe that Castro is a cold and dictator (and thousands of refugees and political prisoners will testify about this), it is amazing how such promotional episodes actually humorate American efforts to visualize the audience, and Castro seems to be right. !! Think about it - Sarting and company wanted to hit Castro, but instead it seemed clear, obvious, and stupid in the process. <br /> <br /> It's really bad - it can be seen almost ridiculous today.
