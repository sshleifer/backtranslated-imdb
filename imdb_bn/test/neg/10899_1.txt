You just want to gore, and nothing is without pain and torture, you came to the right movie. If you want at least acting, logic, story, compatibility, even the last good guy a slower, but go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I could not think of myself but thought myself, "Jezez, are there people who are mentally challenged?" For example, behind the scenes and seeing other people, the main actress met a police officer and cry on the forehead He spread his story about everything and told him about cyclops to run a yellow truck. The yellow truck was dragging and the officer walk with him, talked to the man and stopped the truck without any hassle. The actress came out and said, why did not she arrest him? And then the truck passes over to the police officer ... on the road side, the truck stands about 20 feet away on the street, when the actress tries to pull the copy but is too heavy. (At that time) the truck got up again and twice the police walked on foot. The truck then drives. Why the actress guns are not beyond me. (After which he shot coppy twice on the head because psychotheraph was going to burn him alive) once by mouth, which he could not kill and to finish the job twice. * Roll eyes * After that, he escapes to the bathroom to go to the blast and when he reaches the roof, he wanders around and the police are no more ... okay <br /> <br /> Another example, the main actress trapped in the bathroom Meet the woman she had, she fell like a blood gallant on the floor, covered about 1/3 seconds of the room. (Probably more) The main actress goes out of the possession of a towel, she returns and everything is gone. : / They do not explain why everyone remains invisible. Fools are fools <br /> <br /> I like scary / thriller / gore movies, but it was very slow. I lost brain cells watching this dribble and you should not have too much.
