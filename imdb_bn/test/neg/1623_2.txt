A movie of redeemable quality (in addition to the Ather scarf-Lynchloth) is a part of the comedy, the emphasis is on the comedy. This amazingly villane has something special ... Oh, the presence of Shakespeare which makes this movie portable (hence 2). I just giggled every pirouetted, lifting an incredible eyebrow of hechchman or hero. A true example of not paying enough money to anyone. (And that beer!) <br /> <br /> Now, what happened with the 12-minute Hang-Glider scene? Really, really, really bad. I can not stress enough. <br /> <br /> So, seriously, if you refuse to watch this movie, see Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. Those who have endured many horrific movies with favorite silhouettes.
