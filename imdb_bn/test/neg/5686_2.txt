This movie was freely rent, it was not a bad idea about it, it's a very bad movie. I hired it for Thanksgiving because we can eat turkey and then the family shows a horror movie. So you ask, what makes this movie so bad makes you just 2 stars? The dialog The lack of conversation makes this a movie perfect for a deaf audience. If you rent it, make the volume zero and pop in any heavy metal CD from your volume. I know you will enjoy it. This holiday turkey plot was bound by technology and geek so you need a translator to describe. Now those who enjoy the good advertising effect for you ... Ah, they are not much better than the video game trailer or the worst case scenario. The actors, both of them, are not many to look at both. They say nothing through the whole movie out. Most technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene where the protagonist sticks himself in a missile and fires 70 kilometers (it never showed how he landed) in the city. Before the scene, we saw a fire of a robotic fire with a cannon from 12 feet away and he missed multiple shots. We have also been told that political divisions between opponents and plays seem to be cyber-technology (machine-enhancing people) versus both biological technology (genetically advanced people) but both cyborgs or extended people. Told me that it was a bad movie in the rental shop which was a cover of a video game cover art and was just a copy, many new releases were found in the new releases.
