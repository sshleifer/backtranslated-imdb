I have seen Perry Mason movie of all post-1985 posts, this is my favorite favorite. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that I did not like Diana Muldaur as the actor. He thinks how to play only one character - Hard-Bitant Carrier woman with some undefined chip on his shoulder, which is why it is extremely difficult to express sympathy to anyone. This is not an exception - it's true as a form. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only thing that preserves this film, is a sincere performance as a Scott Bio Prosecutor - I've actually transformed myself into Joy, and the movie is valuable to him alone.
