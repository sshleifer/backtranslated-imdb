Another entry in the passino-a-mentor sub-render You know the drill: Hobarty's broken young hatshot (In this case, Matthew McConaughey, trying to pick a flashing carrier looking at the Quetellel of Posino - Hey, it worked for Kinu and Colin, did not?) Has been discovered glamorous and delightfully corrupt father's picture By (passino, dance). Young Hotshot may learn from his father's all-in-one out-of-a-nice but down-loaded career (this time, football handicapping). The father's image strengthens the meaning of money and young hotshts with hookah and strength, but we all know that these corrupting situations are going on in conflict with frustration and frustration. . . Until then, the young hotsht does not find his moral center by rejecting the father and all, or almost all, that he stood. (Clearly, Stone's * Wall Street * mostly sets ground rules for the sub-general of the passino-a-mentor. <br /> <br /> The next day we want to accept passino films parallel as a reality, again, you know the drill : The Living-Legend Actor shows superiority regardless of an influential Young Actor. The second can bear through the process Bong can be green, but he must admit that he is not going to get a good line, it will get the opportunity to chew in the main scene before denying it. Now it must be said that there are actually two good films in the passino-a-mentor cannon: * Women * and * Danny Brasco * * In the former case, this was a one-man show, however, the next time Casino was playing in a match of Jonny Depp. However, those two movies were serious psychological, not just showboating exercises for the procession. Passino confirmed that his small co-stars from Brasco * were not near charismatic like Depp. However, this living legend does not speak very well about the actor. Like his contemporary De Niro, Posino has been resting in his acting for the past 10 or 15 years. * Two for the money * Still the worst example is worse than * Advocate of the Devil *, at least one of the features of the nude Connie Nelsen and the quality of the release of this film over time. Well, when you get angry with the king, it just happens - just ask Marlon Brando. Honestly, I have seen more than one Al Pacino movie with the same plot - and the same study from the same star - now there will be charity. Did I say "none of them speak good?" In fact, it is insulting to everyone involved with paid visitors. Nobody is accusing Matthew McConaughey of being Shakespeare's actors, nor is he not eligible for the second failure of this helpless old show-off, he added that McConnagi does not measure the greatness that Al. <br /> <br /> I did not waste space on plot details. If you want a summary, IMDB provides a no-sense summary, although I think I have presented a fairly comprehensive summary of my opening paragraph. Basically, you've seen this movie before. Many times * Two special meanings for money * The worst world of sports handicapping (underworld, really). Passino "Bate Advisor" - that means between you and your wife - and even a cable TV handicapping show, co-hosted with some of its top sons. The film was absolutely right, such shows were lazy. . . But there was a description that the words "gambling" and "gambling" were constant use in the words they got dead wrong. If you have ever seen a proline or similar type of show, you can never hear the term "jubbo" by the Jim Feast and his assistants. They ask you to call their 1-900 number to get their preferences. . . But if you came from, say, good luck, you had no idea what you were supposed to do with any preference. "Gambling" is the F-word of sports-handicapping TV shows - strictly verboten. <br /> <br /> Against gambling law, you know. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars.
