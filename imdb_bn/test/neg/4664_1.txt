Two movies: "Fifth element", "Armageddon". Same topic: Save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis One difference: "Armageddon" is very inferior to Luke's film. Some spectacular special effects are not successful in hiding a working and worldwide traditional playpace. Several parts of the movie are showing it. I think of the President's speech, and especially Willis' relationship with his daughter, "Grace". At the beginning of the film, he continues to neglect and overpertect it and this makes him tired. Then, at the end of the film, the real love and perception that is burning in it. On the other hand, the film falls into the trap: Michael Bay takes the issue very seriously. Of course, the film tries to be fun, but the humor presented in the movie is often seen as a fair and nice low-level, but the "fifth element" was humorous, illogical and able to ignore it. Serious aspects of action The film suffers from other two disorders: it often falls on the ridiculously (Russian astronauts) and almost all actors are bad. Bruce Willis reverses the character of his "fifth element". He plays Hen-Man, he ham it and sometimes, he is unbearable. Other actors are solely credible in their own role, in particular, Willis Sinking crew. Looks like this crew is just here to have fun. One of them is taken for being very fit but he looks like a fool. And the poor live tyler! <br /> <br /> When the film was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed tiredness to save the world. His fatigue was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.
