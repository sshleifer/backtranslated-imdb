Tommy Lee Jones could be as much as possible with the script related to it as much as possible, and there were some decent action sequences that were really felt from outside because of their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Someone in the line thinks that if they can hire actresses for each individual workshop, unfortunately, it's really deeply talented actors like Goodman, Batie, Sarsagard, Gammon, Steinbergen, McDonald, Pretie Taylor Win, and we Do not forget Mr. Jones that it can not fix the wood dialogue, and can plot the progress that is not going anywhere. In fact, at one point I saw that the film was going on for the last two hours, I was 51 minutes in it. Perhaps the painful aspect of this movie was the mistress of geological soldiers who had little to no help. The story At the end of the film is a bit annoying from the confusing business. * If you do not ignore this past statement that this movie is not, then you can not understand it better after watching it. The most interesting thing about this <br /> <br /> This film can actually be a sequel to the film "Heaven's Prisoners" by Alam Beldwin in the same role Tommy Lee Jones directed. I can see it now, to see whether it is as bad as the electric miss, and the second reason I can not remember (I try hard as hard) my person crashes Alec Baldwin.
