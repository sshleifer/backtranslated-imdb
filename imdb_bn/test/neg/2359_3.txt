"Best Film of the 90s" "Welsh Trainings" ... Hey, OK! I went to this movie mostly with high expectations, and it was all fly away. <br /> <br /> This movie was considered to be the old film of drug culture at the beginning of the 90's, and we all see this scene and after the death of Leigh Betts in 1995, following the moral panic, the media's preconceptions shatter. Unfortunately it's been a long way short. <br /> <br /> While trainings were able to treat you as an adult and deal with potential problems around the drug, it was only able to provide us with some wonderful surprises of narcotics and how we might like it. I know, like completely open your mind. Bill Hicks, and Howard Marks's Nausea It's painfully bad at times. I mean, the last scene between Lulu and his ants actually laughs loudly to me. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I'm just a monk, but the zip shows us the way through this story. Acid frazed people talk to you about the one who once went to the house party, who has kept you "man" and how the acid was released from the modern society strain. You just want to wake up some ideas in him, and tell him to go to the premises. <br /> <br /> This script was a real problem for me, because the excellent book of Irvinne Wales was quoted in Transposing, written and directed by Justin Kerrigan. Words do not come to mind "Jack of all trades, none of the master" See where his inspiration is available, especially from the main character Zip (which is the main character in a social position where he speaks directly to the camera and is reflected in the outline of what is happening through his mind). This problem is something in the camera The speech is painful only. Mainly it comes down to the lack of sympathy for the zip, but they are so frustrated to hear the philosophical term until the end of the words like your average A-Level drama project. The direction is good, and the objectives are good, but it is a lack of integrity that you start thinking about what HYPE is about. <br /> <br /> Although it's not all bad. At the moment there are very funny, and entertaining moments. Murray is the highlight of the movie for me. For an independent film, it was able to attract a high-quality British actor / actress, which might reveal so much interest in the film. <br /> <br /> the best movie of 90? Not by a long shot, but if you are looking for a solid Sunday night movie, then this might just be your bag. Of course, the film is defective in the way it is circulated.
