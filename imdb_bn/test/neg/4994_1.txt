Horror acting, horror dialogue, bad comedy, sticky plot and horror movie. It has been seen as the worst movie of my life, and I find the bad movie. For effect, they did not spend time just throwing fake blood on people and things, creating wounds and having some special effects. By creating a low-budget horror flicker, most people at least create harmful things like tissues or shades. The dialogue was too decent and was without acting or effort. They threw some actors just a set and said it has. I swear that I saw good movies from my film I class at school. How did this get a DVD release?
