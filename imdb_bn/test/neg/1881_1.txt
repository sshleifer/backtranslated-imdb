What really surprised me about this picture was so falsely. First, at the end of the 80's (when the film was held) lived like this family? A college professor I did not earn enough money to support the lifestyle I saw in film. Therefore, he and his family may suffer financial loss due to financial damage, especially when he gets cancer. Second, the age of the strip is my experience, and most women, especially her class (educated, white, well-closed) experience feminist movement. Yet this woman seems unconscious of her immune behavior. I really thought that she was a very controlling woman, who kept her husband's mental child by taking care of her husband. <br /> <br /> This picture made so many people straightforward. I praised the film of Carl Franklin in the past, and I actually like Murlich Strip, but Gad, this is a manipulute and false film.
