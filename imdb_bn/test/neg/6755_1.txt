I was totally confused by the comments of this movie, mainly some people say they saw it on a movie festival and liked it every minute. I was deeply frustrated, hoping to run the American style of Pi Style. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the camera work was horrible, I do not think that the cameras can move around the scene. Stay still and the actors stop their own compromises and stay away far away <br /> <br /> Secondly visible! My God I saw more furniture in a bird's house. The club was completely unrestrained with almost 3 additional dances at the back ground. The flats were bare and lack of personality. <br /> <br /> the third actor. How nice. The director apparently went to set up the "Rupa" character, a grip did not give the character "I do a f ** k", which is the main character of a main character, which basically takes a shot of a shot. Everything was the main character and it was a joke, so it made me vinas. <br /> <br /> Overall plot, the theme of the proposed big retaliation, lasted for about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation. Characters do not seem irrational and have any real relationship with anyone else. There was no depth to any character, they may also be cut out on the static camera past walking cardboard. <br /> <br /> A really awesome piece, worse than the first year students, YouTube is short for 2 minutes. Advice to the director? Change your name and deny any company with the film, which will probably sell a copy of a yacht sale in Ohio.
