It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think there should be at least one comment in every movie ... so I just saw "the dare of crime suppression". It's a murder mystery with a common cast of letters and a few common suspects - with their own motives for each offense. The story starts suddenly, and the audience's character is thrown into plotting with the story of story or story. I guess this period is not too surprising for a B movie. There are moments that seem like pre-WWII and may seem like, but it is probably due to the background of the authors in radio shows. <br /> <br /> While visiting "crime doctor", some of his psychological practices on the east coast of California, He has been hugged with a mysterious novel friend, with whom it has been accompanied by one or more previous mystery solutions, Captain. The novelist sometimes fits the role of Sidekick as well as our sleuth (AKA Dr Watson) and occasionally lightens some things about comic relief (sorting). <br /> <br /> Here's a little easier, but most of the police is not Captain, who is sometimes annoyed due to narcotics. And then there are mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who is a dance artist at a night club. Dance is like an explanatory dance that can be one of the moments that feel more than 30 times more than 40. Although the location of the story is in California, although Bragas lives in a castle! <br /> <br /> There was a plot material that made me a little surprised, but I do not reveal much because I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, rather than the advance. (Even though I have many, many B movies that can be read at a higher rate and it is hard to believe that the time spent watching it is well spent) I have not seen any other film in the "Crimone Doctor" series, so I can not compare.
