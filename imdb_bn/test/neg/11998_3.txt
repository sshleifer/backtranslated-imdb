Wow ... I suspect this is bad ... but now I can find myself only for the loss of words ... Really, no sound of my words can judge this movie ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, Trying to say something ... <br /> <br /> This is a really unique jewel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I heard these conversations, people, accents ... and their conversations ... and acting itself ... I just could not '<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Milk! Yes, there is a tie! And the female ass! There is a garden of children in the bathroom, eating a beer ... <br /> <br /> The guy "stretched his face over his face" - The bullet was a bullet! A real brightness. <br /> <br /> The comedy-sides were just completely bonkers. I could not believe what I saw and heard. For a while, I thought that they were unaware, they put their head in disbelief. But almost half of the movie, I started to get big pictures. Half of my brain took half of the movie in the movie, finally get it. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing this movie ... but it's good, I think. It was a black chick walking up to a very small coolboard, opening it and then "Wooow, look at all the storage spaces!" Saying. And he said it like it meant. I mean, good conversations and good acting, okay? <br /> <br /> Oh, and probably do not need to say: Lash La Roure's whip-skill is the main donkey sucker of Dark Power. It is really sad and sad to see. Of course, all the parts of the comedy. Or wait, I could be wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash La Ruya was amazing with a whip! It was the editor's fault. She messed it up, cut her lashes together and all. Or wait, it can be camera operator. He impressed from the wrong angle ... then Phil Smoot did not say anything? It's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about it. However, I hope this brain will be restored from this experience, that there is nothing to say a little bit immediately ... soon after some time.
