* Spokela! * When I saw the preview for the first, it looked like an old fashnade hallmark movie. I love bluegrass music, so I could not wait to see it. When we rented movies, we read back and it sounded even better. This picture was quite annoying for the first half, now another song will play. Then (I'm feeling embarrassed) came to see a gay love. I was more than a friend of teachers, but I certainly do not expect nudity and did not want to create sessions for long. I was watching this with my mother and I was quite embarrassed, because I chose this movie. But besides that, it was a good movie. Acting was good, playing the actress Deladis was great. To be honest, soundtrack was the best part of the film. I did not want to see the movie again, but after the movie I saw the movie. And there are continuous discs that follow. If I was you, I would love to leave the movie and only get the music.
