How do two great actors film-goers foist a piece of junk like this? My only conclusion is that they and their directors believe that they have performed and starred in any star. <br /> <br /> In the picture - perhaps the worst "thriller" I have ever seen. Actors showed minimal emotions; The plot was reasonable for 1/2 hour slot (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost stupid parody - his partner was clearly stupid and did not say a word. To paraphrase Robert Redford, the arch was a big part! The film was drawn and meaningless - the only question was whether the hero would die. One really bizarre part of the story - the waiting family seemed to go for at least a few days; The hero and anthroo take a day. <br /> <br /> always - time wasted
