First of all, I do not see any "best" list or how it won a prize. Compared to La Pianast, which is in the "best" list, La Pionosta Gold This movie lacks many different levels, but I can not explain why I have so slighted it. The main actor was annoying, I felt as if I did not know what was going on, and I suffered !! Although there was some variable life in the beginning of Pierre, but I want to finish it ... as soon as possible. Why should she be his sister and cousin? Disgust And why do you mean the thumble? He turned just turned bilateral. And, was it I, or did I miss the whole man's black motive? Who were the people who played music in the big basement of the big warehouse? Why did they make strange equipment and guns and people who live in extra rooms? I mean all this seriousness, but will lawlessness happen a lot in French culture? European Culture? I have studied culture for 5 years and I have not heard anything about it!
