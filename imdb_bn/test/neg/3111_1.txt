I bought this movie for about $ 2,5 in a local flea market. I thought that with Cast in this movie (Ice T, Rob Loay and Mario Van Paibel is all right), it would be great. Boy, I was wrong. This picture bothered me from hell. Almost every view drags too long. The scene where Rob Loay sees this girl repeatedly singing and dancing forever! This is one of the worst scenes I have ever seen in a movie. There are no picknick left. I think, when they finished the film, they had 30 minutes of film, so they all finished 3x more. Conclusion: The current rating of IDDB here is 9.9. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to see some good films in this movie, look at 'Mune Gun' (with Christopher Lambert and Ice T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Shin) .
