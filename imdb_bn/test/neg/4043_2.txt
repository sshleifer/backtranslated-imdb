This movie was so stupid that I could not believe what I saw, I saw it, it was like a huge train debris - I could not look away because it was very dangerous! I can honestly say that I have not seen this bad thing in my life. It was very impressive and the act was so disrespectful that I was thinking "It should be just a curiosity, is not it? No one really will use this movie, will not it?" I really hope this is a bad joke and these folks do not really expect that they can see this face right away, and I really hope that those who are acting terribly with their motives in this movie and do not really believe they are good actors? It is quite funny to see the drag rays, though, and Chess has a special effect directly from the 80's scientific-fee movie. <br /> <br /> If you have already seen all the other movies then check it out. The first existence and there is no left to see! If it is possible I will give it a "0".
