This movie was pathetically terrible. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effect was boring. If you do not see this movie you have a life, because you want to kill yourself. This movie completely closes the blood (which is undoubtedly a really good film ... or trilogy that I want to tell). <br /> <br /> I do not see the actor, this film is very awesome. I watched it 10 minutes and came to my computer and how badly it was to comment on this movie. I do not really know why my family is still watching this ... oh wait, yes i do. They are stupid actions, conversations and almost non-stop laughing about acting.
