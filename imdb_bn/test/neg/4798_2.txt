Just saw the carnada ... Here they sold almost the same line "FX team after Independence Day". I think that's a great deal. There is no word about authors, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful little story of the Central Republic of Central America, but the story is thin. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about how much of this film I see as a visual scene from a computer war game. Although FXs are beautiful, they're all often visible. Signal-like cut scenes are like 'n' coco-style. <br /> <br /> You will often find that certain trucks, backdrops, bridges, castles, or jet fighters never existed. The appearance is smooth and beautiful, but until the criteria we have not come to expect action adventures today. There are a lot of pictures in the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting, the story below is average and FX is excellent but not the feature of the movie map. I'm not surprised this thing went straight to the video / DVD. <br /> <br />
