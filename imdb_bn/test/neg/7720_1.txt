How bad can you make a film A good question that has been successful in the death of the House of the Dead 2. I could not believe the dead could be worse than the first house, but surprisingly the director was successful. The only feeling you get from the film is that its bad, just bad. Overacting, what is with the bad FX and a stupid story Its such movies that generally give bad names in Z-movies. Why did not they learn lessons from the first house of the dead picture? Anyway, I guess you will now realize that you will not see this movie. It's a waste of time. If you want to see some good zombies then see "Bad taste" or "Dawn of the dead".
