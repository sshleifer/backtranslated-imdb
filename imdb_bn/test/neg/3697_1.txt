I saw this movie because it was a giant person and was labeled as a giant movie. I do not understand why it is called a giant movie. A drama in the movie. I was expecting much destruction, but what can I get? Most movie relationships had problems and people thought that a woman was frustrating because she saw a spaceship crash inside a monster for a vague reason. Start a few minutes towards the end of the action. Since the woman was killed, is not it? Could not do anything except killing him? If you have seen it because it seems to have its action because it is labeled as a giant film, but do not see it. This is not a giant movie. This is a drama.
