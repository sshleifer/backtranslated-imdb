Although cheaply created, bad work, and unpredictably directed, the flight to Mars is still going on against it, despite the fact that it is entertaining. A flight planned on Tuesday with five people (three gentle gentlemen, Cameron Mitchell Newspapman and a female scientist / express love interest) on board. The spaceship comes in and shows that Martians like human beings live there and the advancement of technology that will make the earth gradually. But not all Martian's underground cities (shown here as some caves and some rooms) are not pink. The Martians are a mortal planet and a group wants that the world just wants to fix the ship, to take it away at the last moment and then to gather for the attack on the earth and other groups want to talk peace and they do not want to see the world refusing to give them their accommodation. Here are special effects for the 50-science-fix values ​​of rocket ships, pestle / neon alien gardens, in which women wear shorts which must be made of many shrubs (of course without men) and less less. Cameron Mitchell is a journalist and nothing else is appropriate for him. It adds beautiful but little acting range in Chapman's very short shorts. The rest of the customs are doing some old science-return veterans fulfilling jobs like Arthur Franz and Maurice Ankrum. This is not a standardized Saifai film from a standard Golden Age, but it is very frequent and gypsus at very fast
