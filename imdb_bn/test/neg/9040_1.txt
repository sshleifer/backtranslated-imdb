The only reason I checked this image was the "primary" Kim Bunger. That is true, and my TV guide was that it was a "secret mystery", and it was rated three stars. The rating has come from the person who wrote this drill because I am not sure if this movie will be the only mystery. Robert Culp turned into a favorable "disaster" in his career, which became credible as a policeman. At one stage, the suspect, with a weak elderly woman, above all. If you want to see a badly written, badly managed, poorly performed movie ... then go for it. By comparing it you may appreciate fine movies. I had that hour and thirty-six minutes back.
