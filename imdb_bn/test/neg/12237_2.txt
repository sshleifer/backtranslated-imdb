Sometimes, things should not be made. And when set up looks good enough, it only earns the audience to gasp the audience in horror. But the problem is, this is not another movie. It's just so bad that you've been punished by Jason Bhouhish. <br /> <br /> I've lost much of the sports and cinema in the movie. And generally, it flopped in its efforts. Indeed, telling his team that they will make every issue of real players fail, but at first it was fun, but fatigue was increased to see it. That and the joke about "radio" and "ipod". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not stand to see this movie again. Even Trantasia is more valuable than this. "D-"
