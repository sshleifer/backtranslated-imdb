An old VHS version of this movie was found in my parents' house, so I thought I would leave it. From the beginning I was not expecting much from this picture and I was happy because the film was not good overall. <br /> <br /> The acting for Nicholas Cage was a whole lot worse. One scene with a radio controller is so kind that I did not cut this scene that stands out as delightful. The first 30 minutes of the film was almost no developed plot and I did not know what I knew. <br /> <br /> The story itself was likely to be honest, but the director was just bad or trying to make a unique appearance in the style of the film is very difficult. I saw the whole thing but probably this image will not be seen again.
