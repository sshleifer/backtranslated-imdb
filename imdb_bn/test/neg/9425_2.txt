First of all, I make it clear that I love aircrafts, and usually it's worth watching any movie with them - and I'm sitting through some frustrating things. However, this film is not true. James Stewart is a wonderful actor, but he has lost this strategic Air Command promotional film. Acting medium, and direction weak I was off watching this terrible trash about this half way through. This was some really good, even the best, despite the aerial photography. Despite the hardship, even the pilot like me, something comes out of the amazing Biman (B-36 and B-47) features that are very much on the nervous system. When B-22 appeared, it was shameful to create the film, then the supernaturalists used for this film became legitimate. Then I could be able to sit through it. Perhaps I am spoiling the point of the film, which may endanger the loved ones while performing their active duties. In any case, it can be done very well. Recommend? Good missing price
