This movie is just bad. All stories are first weird and it is not well written. When you're finished it leaves you with questions. Sometimes that's OK, but this is not the case. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to write about anything acting. Adults do a good job, but to consider the kids, they are kids, do a good job. I think the main role, Ian Costello was the worst as Mickey. Well, I'm not sure that the main role was to be honest. There was no idea about this movie. Mickey or Pitt <br /> <br /> There were some shots that were standing, but not everything went out of cinematography. The word, however, was good. There was a nice score. A little adventure type, though it does not see me an adventure film. It was some element of a adventure film, but it was more of a drama. However, it was difficult to tell the film to explain. Children? Hardly There is too much language and violence for that. The stars? I do not know. This was a lot of children's films. It was like an adult movie wrapped in a baby movie. <br /> <br /> The story was weird. I have no idea what it actually was. If you did not know anything, you had thrown it out, but some of the things you noticed were always referenced. For example, the children's parents have died and Mickey blames the stomach for her. Expected to know what happened to you, but you never got it. <br /> <br /> This movie was always bad and time was lost. There was no drive in it. Nothing really moves forward to the story. This is not what you spend on your Saturday night.
