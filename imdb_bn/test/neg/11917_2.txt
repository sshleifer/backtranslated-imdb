A review is not worth it, but I think it is your responsibility to warn all of you - especially since this Canadian bomber has some fantastic reviews that are going out ... bad acting and running slowly, in the story of the worst kind of annoying 'Age of Arrival' The boy travels in the opposite direction, while the runner man shows them in the woods in the Cloudhouse. Boys at Firs make well with infiltrators and at one point even see him as a role model ... albeit all this change ... and you still will not care. You'll know Chris Pen, the biggest movie of the artist, Karki Romano, and the young Devon Sawa, whose career 'Kaspers' topped. I look forward to '12 and holding ',' the war ', or' l 'and all I got was wasted all the time. This film struggles to attract viewers and does not make any impact or remotely remembers something interesting.
