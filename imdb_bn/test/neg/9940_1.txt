Hefajat and Begistret (intense and enthusiastic) In Norway north of Northern Ireland, a documentary story in a male church in Barlow, where the weather is cold and hostile, dark in the winter and face of the city, young people are moving to more populated areas in the south of Norway, where the climate is warmer and more likely. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this movie is the man himself. Among the 30 to 95 year old singers, everyone is unique, colorful life and very enjoyable people. They are characterized by harsh climate and depression and adapted to the way of living. Throughout the movie, we learn something about a lot of people in the church and follow some of the events of songs, songs and shelter, and in the end, a tour of Murmansk <br /> <br /> Outside the movie is characterized by very beautiful and Norwegian nature. The scenery is also normal and directly from churches and we meet directly with people. The house of the house, bathroom, kettle on the oven; There is no artificial film in this movie, nor is it human, not the environment, their music and their feelings. Everything can be as practical as possible. <br /> <br /> It's all lost when giving a story. It is very nice and real, but why can we see it? Is it because of the song? What is the reason for nature? Or do they just see a story about their life and about some of the travels about Burlabeg Mens-Kouer. If this is the message, then this small society competes with life through churches such as social events. Singers kept people together for many years. <br /> <br /> It's all beautiful, but about 200,000 views in Norway that it's popular, so some mistakes. It does not start or end. Nobody loses or loses, no one publishes any message or tries to please the audience that it is good or great for life. Why is this movie made? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a great movie about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian, or Norwegian movies - it's not 9 for 10. It's closer to 4 in 10, and I'll give it. <<br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a theater then the average age of viewers will be 55-60. It has been reported to be consistently high in all the theaters. Perhaps it is so much appreciated in the news and good quality of AOMDB, because it is a film for elders, a film for the elders. It says a movie of "I do not regret anybody in my life" and tells a story that living in a small town like Bellevard might also be a beautiful life.
