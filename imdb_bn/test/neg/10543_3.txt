I enjoyed the first "poisonous avenger", but the novel did not work. There are some funny rumors in the opening ceremony, which involve members of the house for the blind, but at that point I was just bored. Siegel is also filled with many quirky, less cool filling. Just not funny at this time! Most gags rolling around crusty Japanese stereotypes. Almost every Japanese character seems to cut fish. Everyone in Japan cut the fish? Trompo movies are more familiar than being overwhelming, but if you want to use ridicule associated with ethnic stereoipes, at least make it fun. I can not laugh if I gave it to the same wand, I have seen a million times before! One thing I must pay is gratuitous nudity. There is more gratuitous nudity than the first. But I was totally frustrated, and the film ended with a tedious chat scene, which gave me huffing and blown, running in black for the movie. There is at least one sunny line, which made me fool by smiling. After villains say a line to one of Shakespeare's local citizens, the citizen (an old woman) says, "You're F.a. - it's David's maternity." <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (in 10)
