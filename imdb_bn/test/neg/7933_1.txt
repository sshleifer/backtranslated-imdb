** Maybe annoyed ** ** to make this thing worse ** It is difficult, but in this case ** I do not see how anyone can love this rebuild !! It was a "made for T.V" show and still was like very hair for that. Lots of fake ice, bad acting by the top star, bad work and the crazy forest forest that Detroit. Whats the hack ?? !! I do not really think it would be a great movie but I had the pleasure of entertaining. No, we were half asleep and we had to finish it the next day. I could have left the rest easily (but then I did not find that wonderful to miss the forest!) I am so happy that I miss the theater! Damage to $ 3.50 in the video store is bad enough. And I'm a lover of police, action and drama movies. It was one of the 10 sticky ones. The day i got a real day !!
