Director / Chief actor Ducer has played in the alphabet movie, where he tried to get recognition worldwide for the destruction of the very young world of the Mormon missionaries. Some of the acting is fair. But some of the roles are unrealistic, i.e. evil (instead of parent) mission president etc. The film gives a fair perspective of how some missionaries can fight with their beliefs, but it is encouraged, enthusiastic, integrated, and inspired far beyond the idea of ​​representing the actual missionary program. In this film I see inspiration Duchar's self-inspiration. The film is slowly and annoying, and shooting and screenplay look like a college student project.
