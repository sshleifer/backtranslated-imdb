A full-length movie carrot top, enough to say. This is not the only one with only one of my 1 and one 10 personal voting system, and this is not the absolute displacement. Horrible terrible God Some movies that are so bad, they are weirdly funny, then there are some movies that make you sick physically and then have serious thoughts about suicide.
