All right, I admit that I still associate Sophie Marsau with LaBouem. The main reason I am going to see this image was the main reason. But it was very annoying, I felt almost asleep. Sorry, but his talent as an actress is not very believable. In addition, this film is presented as having outstanding special effects and CGI. Yes, this is not bad for B-Movie. A few years ago I saw "Marquis" (later a very unclear film), I thought he would play it more firmly. But La Bauem (and James Bond "the world is not enough") seems to be the only good movie with him. Does he have a bad taste when it's picking up his "talent", his movie or easy loneliness?
