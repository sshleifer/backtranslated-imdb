I was looking at Donate's contribution to this fantastic horror math series from the time of the weekend, but it was easily the worst of the bunch. It's really really bad. This part can be due to the poor, if weird, the source material choice. Why Joe does not just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we've got this subbox episode where the "message" script, character, staging, everything, and finally I'm amazed that it might be worse, and I'm not looting it ... it's getting worse. What a stinker by such a talented creative team? Leave this one and buy John Carpets instead. It manages the balance of all the components: horror, humor, character, vision, and it's fun. A bear at bedtime is like having a dump on your house as fun.
