Perhaps the best part of the show is that fans of Canaan O'Brien and Lite Knight suddenly hit it after showing a cursory show. Carson Daley Lenno, Letterman, O'Brien, or any other night, can not catch a candle at the talk show host and the last call can feel more than this injury and injury to Miss Style. The show is only redeeming the quality that it is very small. However, I would not call it crap. Corson Daly is not sincere and his show is not great (the honesty is actually helpful here), although the skits of the last call and some of the material seems to be stolen, they sometimes find the mark. In fact, some of Curseon's montages have been quite entertaining and skits are occasionally at a modest comedy moment. <br /> <br /> As an interview, Carson is OK, even with a guest, even if not finished at night, still at the level achieved by a high school AV team. However, he does not have quick intelligence that makes Canaan so pleasing. I do not like his musical guest, but more than that because I'm not a supporter of that kind of music, so I'm not holding it against him. <br /> <br /> In the band of the house. I do not know the Joe Fremmans band and will not compare with the Tonyot show band with CBS Orchestra, Kevin Ebanks or Max Weinberg. Even Clayton and Clayton are also good. But, firstman band companion in my opinion still shows. Especially the Ultra Sax Player that sometimes shows (it has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register), if there is anything, see the show for it. <br /> <br /> In essence, this show is not even worth a full bag of kibble n bits. But it has an audience, and the small "MTV generation" appeal more. If you do not have cable and are up to 1:37, then there is not much to select and surprising, there is something worse in that frame. So, if you wait for the Pok√©r of the Dark to arrive, you will not kill yourself while waiting for 30 minutes of the last call.
