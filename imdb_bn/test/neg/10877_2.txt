Quantin Tarantino once said that in order to be successful in the film industry, you have to create your own Pope Fiston or Reservoir Dog. লেখক / অভিনেতা / পরিচালক ল্যারি বিশপ হেল রাইডের সাথে খুব বেশি আক্ষরিক অর্থে এই পরামর্শটি গ্রহণ করেছেন বলে মনে করেন এবং তার ভিজ্যুয়াল, সঙ্গীত, ক্যামেরা-কাজ এবং সময়-পরিবর্তনের কাহিনীতে অত্যধিক জোরালোভাবে বিরক্ত একটি নোংরা শ্রদ্ধা বজায় রেখেছিলেন। But there is a scintillation for creating creative conversations in order to accurately screen the Tarantino film; দুর্ভাগ্যবশত হেল রাইডের প্রাথমিক অভিব্যক্তি উপাদানটি তার অত্যাচারী ramblings এবং vulgar monologues যা শুধুমাত্র দর্শকদের জন্য ঘৃণা এবং বিভ্রান্তিকর কাজ করে এবং একসাথে জড়িত থাকার জন্য অভিনেতাদের জন্য দু: খ প্রকাশ করে। <br /> <br /> Hero anti-hero drama gang, many of the Victors, are the seized caretaker who bring their brand of bloody justice to illegal roads. Leader, pistolero (Larry Bishop), putting fire and fire for revenge. The Szent (Michael myadasena) next to his boss to lead anyone to the unexpected, psychologists try to maintain Symphony, and kamanca (Eric Balfour) followed with a fierce loyalty and mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Stray front, dyusa (David kyaradaina) is the mustiyantra aracaretasa from a distance, even though it is not far enough, and Billy Wings (Vincent Jones) and general abnormal gun while throwing his hyatapuna poison for his tattoos and Poisonous explanation. Life. However, these characters can be attractive on paper, once they are forced to strengthen terribly corrupt conversation, the Bishop of funds for the next film to disappear faster than <br /> <br /> <br /> All the symbols are /> <br <br /> <br /> Incompleteness and miss opportunities, its basic aspect of reducing lies lies in poorly designed dialogue. And because the main effects of the bishop are Tarantino's Tucker movies, they have many. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost unclear and probably more muted. Certain sentences of pistilora's main constriction are introduced and vomiting is used more and more, you pray for both death and the ability to stop the word. Even Dennis Hooper also had problems staying cold while closing such kind of silly conversations. <br /> <br /> Have you ever repeated a word or phrase with yourself? The bishop begins there and then continues the madness until you are jealous of the screen characters to cut their heads. And when the dialogue finally took a break, we are treated nude female oil wrestling and slotats being slotted interspersed shots. I'm not sure what the bishop could achieve, but I suspect he found it. <br /> <br /> The Hell Raid Quintin Tarantino film, Robert Rodriguez, wants to pay tribute to the movie, the devil-maybe-care attitude of the bikes. But its purpose can be enthusiastic, hyper-stylized timeline so terribly krinye worthy conversation and hard-of-Manning editing generic audience with the characters prevents investment. As long as we find the mystery about the objectives of letters (and it can be a while before it can be understood, there is some mystery to be solved), it is very difficult to take care of it now. And on the screen everyone is clearly having fun, they are completely ignored to translate any entertainment to the viewer. <br /> <br /> - Joel Macey
