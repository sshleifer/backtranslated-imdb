It hurts me to tell me about the Australian movie but I have seen Mr. Accident as the worst movie. Even more tragic that it does not fit into the 'It's pretty good it' section. My most annoying meaning about this movie is fairly meaningless, inexhaustible, unused, inactive, on screenplay, a fair amount of money. Foolish Performance (Gary McDonald and Elisabeth Gore's Lawyer Eli McFist are doing this trash?), The inadequate instruction, a conspiracy and absurdity of the general idea completely move away from the attractive production designs and gives a truly awesome taste to your face. . Comedy! Haha Make yourself a favor and stay away!
