The movie came with a claim that it was like a left-hand series. I know it will not be a bible-thropping movie. I could really have a movie about aliens kidnapping for UFOs and for the sake of entertainment. As is the opinion of past critics, it is not ok to show up in a church, but not in a public theater, at least not without the previous knowledge of consumers, it does not fall in love with the movie. I felt cheated from my $$ spent for this movie, because nothing of the essence does not mean its religious overtones. If you go to church, perhaps it will be shown for free for a while. Except for the cover of the real content, the film was as fine as it was about acting and script. But I said, I watched the movie for an hour, when I saw which side was sweating and I'm not going to entertain, but it was broadcast.
