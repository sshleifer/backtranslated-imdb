This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a thriller with a ridiculous ending. I have watched the movie waiting for the best and found a little worse instead. The film has played two actors, which I like very much, Rebecca Demoren and Antonio Banderas. Surely they had decent chemistry together but for what? It was bad to start at the beginning of the movie and executing the execution made it worse. <br /> <br /> In Miss Dimna, a personality expert, Sarah Taylor, who is trying to analyze the culprit to kill a criminal, whose defense is more than one personality disorder. That's mostly going to give you an indication of where going to the movie and the killer's identity. At the beginning of the film, he received unexpected visits from his father. In the 1990s, when Halivius had a bad father, it was another source of the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mr. Bendarus plays Tony Ramirez, a mysterious person who came into Sarah's life. The first meeting and the first meeting between Tony and Sarah has happened so badly and so disrespectful it makes you wonder how it shot you. And here's a sequence where two of them asked each other to know that it is so sad that it does not seem related here. One thing I would have admitted was that it was a sexual scene that was very hot. As he suddenly came, coming after the strange package is coming, the tragedy of breaking the wall that could kill Sarah, which does not seem to be normal. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Another thing to make me fancy about this movie was playing the whole orchestral music background. More fine musical scores have been better. I would like to say, how bad it was at last, Miss Depth was very good in that sequence. It is unfortunate that the first-rate instrument was found in his career. She is the rare combination of talent and beauty.
