Karen and her boyfriend Jerry went to their new Los Angeles apartment. They discover an old brass bed that Karen likes, unfortunately it has a truly terrible history associated with strange sex. "Death" tries to be a wonderful supernatural title, but unfortunately fails. The action is gradual, the acting is nothing special and there is no mystery. Sex scenes are also furry Claymax is very nice and violent, so Splatters fans should be happy. Anyway, "the first hour of death" is deadly dull and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares. Of course one should avoid. My rating: 10 out of 4 and that is being generous Instead see "Re-Animation" or "Casual Freak".
