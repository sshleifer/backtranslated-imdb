Some friends and I have really strange and completely unclear (for a good reason) there are strange hummies to find the horror of Flickr and later on under the influence of their mind - expanding consumer products like alcohol and / or soft medicines. Of course, many people do this, but they show a movie like "Godzilla" remix, when we torment our eyes and brain with stuff like "Loch Ness Horror." And, Eureka, it's a prototype bad movie! We open the traditional credit opening, with the bag pipe music. Of course, we need to emphasize the pointless viewers that this story is not believed to be in Scotland's highlights and director Larry Buchanan's birthplace in Texas. For exactly the same reason, cast members are apparently instructed to overact and talk with talk with shocking accents. American Marine Biologist Professor George Sanders brings some new and very sophisticated gold tools to explore the new legendary monster of Lake Lake. Meanwhile, there are many groups hanging around the lake, such as a group of kids in a science camp (the annoying way to spend your vacation), the retired army generals failed to find a Lufthof plane in the lake during WWII and the scientist failed to steal a bunch of thieves and giant eggs. You think that these numerous sub-plots can bring some diversity and excitement to the plot, but unfortunately this is not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is an overall annoying attack with just a few notable elements. For example, the monster creates cheeses with lovely eyes and a smoky breathing. His teeth are also burning in the darkness, which is quite useful if you are fool enough to go in the middle of the night. At the end of the film, the rest of the cast members were more interested in the lost Lufthaffe plane than the giant, so it was almost time to wrap. "Loch Ness Horror" is carefully recommended for fanfare of 80 bad films, but suggest that it has an overload of intelligent dialogues and a bizarre ending ending that seems like running out of the budget is out of the budget.
