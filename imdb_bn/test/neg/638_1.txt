Iron Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corpin, with bad hats and all the parasites in the train will you get? You will find a very bad movie called "Alien Express" or "Dead Rail", which will be even more entertaining in Comedy Central's old series "Mystery Science Theater 3000". You enjoy this horror movie in name, acting, plot, story, and special effects areas. Actually the exterior passenger train shots seem like production workers have used a normal scale scale model in front of a common background! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a good smile and movie "B movie" party, check it out; Otherwise, the "Alien Express" station is far ahead of the exit!
