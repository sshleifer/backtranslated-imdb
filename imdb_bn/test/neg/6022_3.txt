This movie was an absolute waste during the time. It does not want anything to be a gangster movie. This is a very expected plot. My feelings are disrespectful to the characters, and the conversation is always moderate. Half the time you are looking for something else, because the movie is annoying, since you already know what's going on. You answer that half of the time is that the hero ends his life by pairing a pair or simply closing a bridge or something. Also, secondary letters are mostly one-dimensional in most cases. There is no character in this movie! No depth!
