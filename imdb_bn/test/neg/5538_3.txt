Artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his partner Laura Peters (Laura Clancy) were invited to an old house in Great Cornwall, Great Britain, by her childhood wealthy friend, Natasha Carlton (Carol Kantish). Daniel, who is a hesitant man about his sensitive life, has atrocities on him. Alone in the house, strange things happen and Laura is surprised and scared. When Laura meets the old madman Gabriel Norton (Brian Sucre) on the street, he is advised that the temple is staying there. But the couple remain and have to face tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What is this "devil's crop" is a dirty screen and awesome and sugar film! Cinematography and camera work is not completely bad, but I'm making worse with Chris John and Carol Kantish's amateur acting and James Shanks' direction, together with horror stories, funny situations and dialogues. I have occasionally seen few shorts from the movie college on YouTube which are better than the useless and horrible "devil's crop". Ultimately, this is not a horror film, but the horrors of the film. My vote is three <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Calling Diablo" ("The Devil's Crop")
