This film has great production value, good lighting, clothing, set, cinematography and acting. But someone has accepted the script anywhere, and has replaced all the conversations with just a written text of the grade-school level. I have experienced my IQ drop points when talking about any character. <br /> <br /> Did they work for this purpose? Was this just an accident in the brain dead studio executive? At this moment, we do not know. <br /> <br /> I know that this movie was a big mistake starting from the end. We do not even see how the squads become police, so instead of developing any character, we feel like more than 60 TV-movies. Or whenever <br /> <br /> Find screenshots, beat them with a shock full of quadruple. Everyone else, excellent work, but the next time you read your script. <br /> <br /> 3/10
