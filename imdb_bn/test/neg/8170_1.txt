This film really shows the craziness and hypocrisy of Indian society. This is the only aspect of the story trying to show you this. On the other side of the story, the secret of mental and emotional abuse of children of Indian children, which does not show this film. <br /> <br /> "Indian guardians" convicted for the following: a. Children are completely dependent on parents and mothers at a very young age to destroy the uniqueness of children. Such children are only adults to be adults in physical beauty but mind remember the children. Since everything is provided by their great Indian parents, so children can not learn basic things of human contact with other people without working hard or independently of their parents. <br /> <br /> I can show you many Indian parents who prevent their children from making friends, go out of the house, or stop them from doing something that starts growing among their adults. <br /> <br /> Why they do the same. Selfishness Indian parents "hope" of caring for their children as they grow older. They do not store themselves for themselves and after reaching the age of 50 ... they cry ... we are old and we are dependent on your children, because we have done a great service to bring you. In this world and to take care of yourself and make you weak. <br /> <br /> Indian parents under the age of 50 make the body and health harmful and financially completely insecure. Most feel that there is no need to care for themselves because they are "expected" to care for their children. <br /> <br /> The opposite happens in the opposite of the west. People started planning for retirement at the age of 20 and once they retired, they are financially safe. <br /> <br /> Indian parents do not do anything because I said that they have brought the kids to the world and what is good <br /> <br /> I am a victim of my Indian parents (I'm sure there are countless other Indian kids like me), who have grown up physically but still struggling with their life. And they are continuing to shout aloud to help those who are 50 years old. <br /> <br /> This movie shows only part of the story ..... pieces of June
