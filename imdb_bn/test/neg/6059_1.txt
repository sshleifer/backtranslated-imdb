Hey I see this movie in class because someone has tapped it up and brought it. I was hoping half a heartfelt effort to illustrate Heracles myths and commercial advertisements seemed to be serious, I was expecting something that was half decent. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes of the movie, I realized that it was a complete caps. The only thing in the film that is half true in mythology is that it is the minimum (and I am the minimum). Parents, half brothers, and labors correctly named. Other, the rest of the image seems to be a giant mistake. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie was not better than the Disney version. The Disney version was made for small kids, so it was not very serious. This film, with all the sexuality, violence and nudity, was clearly for the old audience, but the story presented in it was almost as wrong as the Disney movie.
