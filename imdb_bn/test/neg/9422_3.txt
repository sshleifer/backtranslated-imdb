Solo is an action movie about Android which is created and military-trained like a Terminator. When an error is detected, he is issued deprogrammed. Instead of facing death, he likes to flee to Central America's jungle, where he takes refuge in a village. The military threw him behind, it went on a big celebration. <br /> <br /> Mario Van Pablo Android is a great performance. Its mechanisms and mechanical look to complete the gesture. The real scientific reality is to abandon a real worker hero. And it works; Action scenes are not that spectacular, but they are not all too bad. Acting from other characters is quite bad, but I did not expect anything very well. Special effects were good as well. <br /> <br /> Solo is as modest as an action flick, but too forgotten. It lacks most of the films that are in the film. But if you want to spend a few hours without much thought but that will end the job.
