Stay FAR AWAY from this film. Saying that the truth of you reading the reviews may have been tainted by the horrors you already bear. This is a real horror film ... So let's look at the problems. Writing and Direction: It will not surprise me if these are managed by a group of impressive students who see 'scream' and 'I know what you did last summer' several times. Giant Gapping Plot Holes Massive; Although I can not congratulate this movie, it was astonishingly aware that they were finally trained. Actor (or lack of): Only the best for this movie ... to satisfy the best pissy of all time, now the acting of his lecture! As a waiver, I remember that I was only able to see and enjoy something. I recognize it to be a good movie, but I can still billet the boy (hall folk, its true) during the time of guilt and smirk; So when I say something to avoid, you know I'm not kidding.
