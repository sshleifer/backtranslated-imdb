I read the comments of other users and I am happy that anyone compared it to the original by Perumarjakalam, a 2003 published in Kamal. <br /> <br /> The original story was a harsh story and no flaws about the Indian government. Correct record, or even worse shoots and bloopers do not. <br /> <br /> The story is a great and sensitive one and is well described by others. But sadly, taking a credit for Nausesh as its own story is nothing more than a tragedy and a practice of theft. <br /> <br /> I think he was influenced by the so-called "inspired" syndrome of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> /> Here is a link to IMDB for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend recommending everyone to recommend for everyone, even know about class direction and what to know about class acting.
