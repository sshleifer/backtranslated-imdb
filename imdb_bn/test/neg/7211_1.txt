"Direct-to-video" is a phrase that does not promise to the customer unless it is a direct-to-video video that goes directly to the video in the first place. Despite this, the studios have emphasized on the release of numerous live video-video series for a number of consecutive hits. I do not think that it should be mentioned that these sequels always rank among the worst titles, including Hitachter 2, Starship Tropper 2 and Cruel Intentions. 3. It is true that the Road House 2 Scott Jihal was in charge of destroying the Cruel Intentions series. Like his entry in the Cruel Intentions Trilogy, Jihal has adopted the elements that make the flick of a great man in the first street house and reshares without any success. This is no signal, this is all a remake. Different lines are reproduced from the original, plot points are cut and pasted and the scenes are copied from almost the first shot-shot. One thing that could not be duplicated was the amazing battle scene, which was what it was in the Road House. Here, we indicate a sequence of battles very short or very long and seemingly designed and shot in an hour. Compare the fight scenes of its predecessors, which seem like they took months and months of preparation. He did a good job with the rebuilding of Earth VS in 2001, as well as able to handle the jihal works. Spider, but the talent shown does come through in this mess. This is not entirely his fault, such as the plaque too, very badly written and incognito. I do not go directly to the video, but a good script is still not needed. This low budget, straight-to-DVD movies can continue to slow down and keep someone in mind. Ignore it completely. 1/10
