Why this movie sucks, does this people even read a Bible? Everything about the movie was about Moses, God was coming out of it. That did not happen! God instructed everything, telling them where to go and what to do. They also betrayed God again after reaching Kanan for 40 years! They did not roam for 40 years, then suddenly found it, it was their suspicion. Perhaps if the filmmakers actually choose a Bible, they will say, oh no, we have tried all the mistakes again and again. This movie about Moses was everything. They saw God as a thick twist, who hated Moses wholeheartedly. Do not nor do not !!!!!! God wanted them to see that they were full time and he was cared for to see them. Do not dare to tell how brave they even say otherwise. And Moses was kept out because he was angry with the people and blatantly disobeyed God! He sinned badly and was told that he would not be allowed to enter. Moses ran away to do everything in the Bible? Ever !!!!!! Please read your story before creating what you think. This whole God also gave it up in most parts and it is not true to do it yourself! Allah has done everything for the people, He has made all arrangements for them and Allah tells them where to go. She was full time. All we have to do is do it in some ways, but then how does it work! Yes, today he does not work directly to see everyone, but then he actually killed the golden calves after killing people! God works directly with people. The Bible does not refer to Echo Bridge or other Bible Movies next!
