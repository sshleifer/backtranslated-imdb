God, I am not so humiliated in my whole life with this shit. There are many ways to describe this section of this shit, I think that if I think that everything seems to be, then I will be banned by this site. <br /> <br /> How do I start? Well, for one, it does not accept the original series knowledge that it encounters people who have seen this movie. The biggest slaughterhouse of a theme song has been made here, from a metallic version, in a scary RAP version, what do they think? How to match underdog and electronic heavy heavy style? The story is so basic, I'll do something that I do not usually do and I do not even summarize. Just think of this: a dog gets superpowers, fill the rest. That's how this movie is predictable. And then the joke comes ... now kill me. This style of sunny may not even smile kids, it is that bad, good, hope to punch line after pores. <br /> <br /> But am I surprised at everything here by Jason Lee (New Name Yearle), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's new Groove) and Jim Belushi (according to Jim). In the shows / movies I mentioned, in my opinion, actors do well and exclude Lee, the best actor of the film, but very few say. The rest deserve Golden Raspberry nomination for this bad. I am very sad to see these good actors guilty by this disaster. <br /> <br /> All of this, just as bad as the Duval, which I reviewed again, and again, my head would burst if I saw something worse than this.
