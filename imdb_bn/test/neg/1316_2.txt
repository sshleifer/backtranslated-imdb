It looks like this picture might be really good - it's not. <br /> <br /> Cast is quite good, but most of them feel embarrassed by the whole thing. The real disaster in this movie is not flood, but the script. It tries to include every cliche in the book, all done incredibly badly. The end is very sudden, but this is a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope they pay a lot of cash, because their respect is not of any benefit. <br /> <br /> Special effects are good, but the same thing was done to make a better impact tomorrow. <br /> <br /> <br /> A small exercise. Do not waste your time.
