This DVD is not called as Heineken Coster. Why is it that nobody ever wants to see a different director / author than the real movie? Two hours of this turkey begging me for Exorcist 2 rewards. <br /> <br /> There is no legitimate smile. Do not be afraid of one. The script was just a mess and I thought it was bad for the actors (they were home or giant coke habits or some sick relatives). <br /> <br /> The original was a makeup effect landmark. So naturally, the signal producers feel that it is a great idea to scrap makeup FX and change the CGI vegolves. This CGI Behoda smiled much more than me "comedy" It just missed a total. If you want the night's entertainment then rent it again. Or take a film class and go to make your own horror film. You're forced to do better than this fool.
