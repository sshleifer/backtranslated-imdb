After being born and raised in Odessa and by the end of the 70s, Odessa High School, graduated from "other" high school, had mixed feelings of this film. I'm no longer alive to Odessa, but always the heart will be a Texan. I did not like the way that the 80,000 plus this town has been portrayed as a dirty poor small town. If I am not wrong about this, please make me free, but I believe that the OHS is also shown at the stadium of the city and the "Permian Panther's Home" marking practice stadium, which was used in practice, the Permian Every year I saw little recognition about the big game cross-town challenge in the city, OHS vs Permian Although I have changed the outcome of the game, I think, if the actual result is illustrated it would only become dramatic. Overall, the movie was okay, making me a little room, remembered MOJO's "old days".
