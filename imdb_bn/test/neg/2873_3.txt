Wow ... I just saw this movie ... This is the stereotypical view of American films, such as all Indian films have dances, songs and love stories .... This is far from the truth. This image easily expresses the stereotypical Western view of Hindi films. Terrible acting, horror, awesome cinematography And this is all by a Hollywood director. Today most of the Indian films are more content driven, realistic, sensitive and meaningful than this segment. Indian cinemas (not just Hindi) also cover a variety of different topics. Like most other Hollywood movies these days, it shows a realistic view of another country, where the truth comes out of the window. This is not a highly recommended movie. Instead of looking at a good Hindi film like Black Friday, Ekalvya, Omkar, Khaki, Averapon, Gangster, Dawn, Zakham, Door, Sholay, Ma India, love ... are these films about real Indian movies?
