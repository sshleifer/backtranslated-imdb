The "chairman of the board" of the top of the cow and its AT & T businesses are living proofs which are available in flyo-flop flower color orange. As for the HBO charge for garbage, though, it is not available for free. Blehhh! The savings of COTB must have filled suicidal hot lines throughout the country, probably providing jobs for thousands of telephone therapists who lose their jobs during the recovery of memory treatments, although sadly the carrot top probably contributed below its sponsor AT & T to an increased phone from devastating HBO viewers. Line with traffic. I can visualize tramjoted TV viewers, phones on the one hand and fully loaded .45 autos on the other hand, to face the orange-haired giant echo of COTB, dialing the last minute depression before walking on the rails of life, searing in their synapses, pain like the outgoing meningeal rash.
