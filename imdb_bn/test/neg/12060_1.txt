First seen 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10 (DR-Brad Sykes): Witchly hairy 3D movie, which is mostly followed by slash flickers plots of 80 tin. Fools go to a familiar killer camp site, get caught by unknown masked people, and then we try to determine who, if someone is going to live. We do not really watch anyone behind the mask, but if you've seen such a movie, it's also not difficult to understand. Despite a somewhat modest 3D effect, a 3D viewer is a waste.
