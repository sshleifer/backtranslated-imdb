According to the budget information provided by the Dark Harvest website, there was an estimated $ 130,000 budget. I am not sure where this money is spent. Let me see ... dress ... no ... location and set ... hmm, do not think .... special f / x ... no ... acting text ... uh, no. Dark Harvest tells the epic story of a young man inherited from a family farm in Western Virginia Hills. Talk to her friends to take her friends to find her. Once our cruel hero knows that his grandfather has used a unique method to increase his crop and now it is time for retaliation. Scarecrows for the killer revenge !!! E.E Awesome No, not really. We all know that there are some great movies made with very little money, but this is not one of them. This movie I've ever seen has some of the worst performances and several of the dialogues. Horrible clich√©s with terrible delivery. All half will not be fooled by modest cover and avoid all costs. I want to make at least one of the movie makers - but I'm afraid they did not do well with that. Grade: F.
