Anyone who read the Baroness Orakis books and watched most of the movies based on them, I must say that the 1980 version was better than Anthony Andrews and Jane Simmur. It was stuck more than good writing and the soul of the story, which seemed to go out of its way to shoot the man. This new adaptation is less light-hearted, yet there is not much depth. Although there are some good acting, there was not much to work with the actor. Beautiful clothes, though.
