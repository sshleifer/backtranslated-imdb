I was pleasantly happy with the end I saw this movie yesterday, and I'm going to stop it, but my mind has changed. I did not think the story was about to end. Thats all about positive I can say about this film. All actors are particularly nobodious, nobodys. Although she is an attractive young girl, she will not make it big. Writing, direction and acting are like wood, what you can see in the soaps of the day. The filming positions were very shiny where you can think that it could be anywhere, instead it was turned off in Canada. I think it was a complete Canadian because it was shot entirely in Canada, which is not quite as bad as some of the recent Canadian TV productions: "Cold Squad", "Stone; Underworld" has done quite well.
