This movie must have seen when it entered the development phase and getting Redgrav and Jacobby on the board must mean the person to get excited. I can say that they were definitely not something that week. Jacobi is the only camp that Jackby can do and I think he thought the actor had more to think that he had played his camio role in Fraser several years ago. Vinnie Jones is not exactly bad, he is definitely clear from its depth as a leading man. He was a pilot for the entire TV series, really it could be sorted around. However, the work of science and camera was uncomfortable. Why this "jounalist" and met a press officer will never work together to explain. This can not be the cause of sexual chemistry, of which there is no one. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and carrying plot that you can pass as the original, but the whole thing is so intimate that the two stories do not even get it in the least. Two stories were written misleadingly for two hours. For some hours go some dry dry paint. You will be more full than life watching this garbage
