This is a great example of a great movie and a great idea, but the process may be really bad. I was tempted to get it due to the DVD cover, stupid me, but I was blown away, and I was a bad sense. This movie is mainly about El Capacobra's destruction of the ruins around Los Angeles, and it is a local animal policeman and a writer to save the day, before bringing them back two corrupt police and two evil scientist. The main reason I was enjoying this movie was that it was not hard to notice due to the major flaws. With some bad acting, just lighting and nothing scary, this movie is probably as it does not hit me. However, compared to other silent movies, it is very easy on the chart. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the continuation of this movie has been closed and I mean shoulder and dig. Characters were many points that had said or did and then in the next shot, they did not do it or the change did not happen. In the case of the case: The main character has a gun, a slip attack, he is nowhere in a place somewhere and missing the gun. She runs with the mystery flair here while defending it and she did not have any guns, the main character is walking with her and having guns. Where did the gun come from? The time is screwed up during the day. One minute it sets the sun and you can still see the sun and next minute it looks like midnight. There were holes in some of the plot, why were they silent, what was the scientists doing, what happened to this man, and why did he shoot the beast and still survive? This thing is bugged hacked from me and no questions are answered. <br /> <br /> Next star in the list. Boy it was wood and bad. Naveiro, the original character driven by Ari al Algeria, seems a bit quiet and kills some dogs and is very devoted to find out if a tragedy hits, his emotions were not there only. Alina Madison, who played Starlina, had a fairly poor job. He was the author of a book bearing book about Chupkabar and he did not just think of his role or performance. Her acting was ridiculous and a poor kind. Even for a writer, he knows very much about that thing and knows how to disable a high protection defense system in hidden laboratories. Tony Chris was okay, but he got a little quiet to do some stuff. The movie reminds me of the bad behavior of killing me for hearing some criminal solutions, where actors and actresses are not really committed to their work. <br /> <br /> I rarely get this ass when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie, I could not help but be hard in light. It took me many times from the movie because the light was so weak. There was a time when they were trying to become creative by adding visible color filters so that it could create "comic bookies", but it was restored. When the bad part is black outside it is visible at night, but the scene is so sensitive to the light, it seems like its day. They continue switching from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes and the lights seem so brilliant that actors were skinning. It does not have to be that bright dark shade. When the light was perfect during sunset, the light was good when it was terrible. On the other hand, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no fear in this picture. There was only one time where I jumped but the other one was horrible. Perhaps the points were scary but it was a great light, you could communicate with people in silence, but if it is dark, it would have been better. Even the animal design for the cats was poor, it looked good, but it was a little or a kid who jumped. They were not hiding their face; They showed him in no sense of mystery or with any mysterious appearance. Gore had a fair amount, but it seemed irrelevant. This movie was not only scary, it's all about. <br /> <br /> Overall, they did a great South American legend Americanization among bloody human consumers, which is not silly. Actually, it was a fear of man and it killed only goats, sheep, dogs and deer because it was said that it hated human odor. But, then what would be the story? I did not enjoy this picture for some reason, but I would give credit for trying to make a good movie with good intentions. I do not recommend this image to a horrible fan, but if you like Indie or B-movie, you have to test it. Also, if you are easily tempted by religious-classics, then you will enjoy this movie. I'm not, I can not see it again, but in some deep way I enjoy this kind of movie just to see what the other side of Hollywood is doing.
