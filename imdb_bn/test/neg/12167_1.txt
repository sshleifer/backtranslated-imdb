I really hated this movie and this was the first movie I ever written about Stephen King that I did not finish. I was really frustrated, was the worst shit I've ever seen. Are you thinking out three hours out of thinking? Could it be a pretty good story, but the actor? No Suspense? No Romance? No, awesome? No It was not something. <br /> <br /> This weird, crazy scientist has got classic things with people Einstein-Hair. Not all right And a man is always young. It seems that they used the name of Stephen King so that they could not make an exciting, long movie. <br /> <br /> I call this image "1 (terrible)". If they liked the -5, then I would probably accept it instead. It was a total waste of time.
