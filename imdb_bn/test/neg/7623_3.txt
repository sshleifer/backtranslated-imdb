I bought a DVD of this movie for a dollar in a big drop store. This is probably the best and best comment I have. At least it does not cheat me from lunch costs. <br /> <br /> "Chillar" problem is Crawain's problem as director. People claim that his apologologists claim his travel papers, he is a really smart guy and sharp thinkers around. But it is not a secret that as a director, he is never visible to Hitco, and does not contain one of the concept of story-wisdom. Strongly certified by "Chilar", he is very close to the legendary flat-foot Hartsch Gordon Lewis. Krevin is the main element that lacks as a director, who can lift him from the director to hire him for a higher cinematic film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Let's specify. The transition time of this film is smooth Established shot give it a quality production feeling. The film is professionally united, in the way of a movie shot by a TV commercial director. (A notion: movies are only visual differences, these transitions that are conducted at least professionally can very well be the work of other second unit directors.) Bridges and parts of smooth transitions - drama - which are flat. <br /> <br /> The core of the proceeding is always effectively operated. Critical shot (later, the departure vehicle goes to the good camera, then we are fast distributed out of the hospital night, then waiting area and on the hallway, then the phone booth in the corner which is cut and the next bit of action) we can get early and next part . Craven does not come anywhere near the explosion of dramatic or visual possibilities at any moment. The wrong reflective aspect in at least important parts, and the things running slow on the world, it is a film that looks like the work of new artists who sharpen its new pencils, ups, all its colored grinds, stretches and primes its canvas ... and Then there is nothing to say Craven, like an art student, never comes to exercise meat. <br /> <br /> I would say Spielberg's "Duel" and I will not say that Craven's forgiving people will make this movie for TV.
