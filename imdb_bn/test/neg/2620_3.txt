Now this is a movie I really dislike. This is one of the most annoying horror films of the 90s, basically it starts slow and centers in a slow environment. The settings are not even eye-catching and do not serve for film purposes. <br /> <br /> The puppy doll is not as good as the master's 80's flip, it sounds silent. What are they our favorite toys?! <br /> <br /> The story is not hairy, attractive and never explains the sinful source of dolls. There is no death scene like previous movies and f / x terrible. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep for the first time, so I can recommend it for insomnia.
