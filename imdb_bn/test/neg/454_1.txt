For the week and week of the campaign, ABC's "The" American "Idol" was considered "American World". We had to perform these singers, compete and see how they lived together at home. Drama! Worried! <br /> <br /> Where does anyone start with this torture? Let's start the "judges" who were known as "music experts" in this program. "Experts" refers to their skills. AndrÃ© Harrell was at least a descendant. He was in charge of Motown Records for a time. The other two ... Ah. Kate Hodson's uncle, who labeled Weatherbird. She dyed three different distinct fluorescent colors in her face hair. Wonder wonder, he was with black light! And Palla Abdul Wanabe, I did something I could not remember: she was even more blurred and closing than the rocks! Then he corrected and became rigorous critical after the first episode. These three proposed "criticism" titles were not the process of finding a true singer, but rather to viewers who are now very knowledgeable, they have already done this many times in Fox. /> <br /> The host was there. George Stroumbulchulos was not Ryan Sequester. In fact, he was lazy as he could. He sucked little energy in what was actually absorbed in the program. The second biggest mystery of the show is how he saw it. <br /> <br /> How did you choose 11 contestants for this program? It was literally a talent free genius show. OK. Perhaps that's a hug. And allowed, actors have to be relatively close to the competency, because if they do not, then "competition" will not be. If only one person is "good", then there will be no "mystery". So, I get that they all need comparable. But they can all * have some chop! In addition, the judge was running a "Singing Academy", so the program "Fame," was part of the side as well. Clearly these actors strictly need those lessons. But you need some highly talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented. And that was definitely not happening here. <br /> <br /> Shock started, the "Homiilife" element was a priority, because all the players were very interesting to look the same. How badly they are vocalized is the part. But the pictures of their home were so cut and cut, you could not get the stories that started from the beginning, so the event did not catch the events there. <br /> <br /> As badly as all that was designed, "one" was an incredible, incredible, deadly design error created in the results that made it completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The listener for those who prefer their best vote, just like "AI." However, following the publication of the voters' votes, the three contestants were forced to sing the final song below. Based on that performance "music expert," selected a person from three for the following week. And then, the safest competitors who wanted to send the remaining residency residents wanted to vote for them. <br /> <br /> "Design Errors" was the final word for the contestants. I mean, if you were in a music competition and you want to go as far as possible, would you vote to vote for a good singer, or would you try to get rid of your tough opponent? CBS's "Survivor" can answer the audience of the first season! And that's exactly what happened in the program. The good prospect was, that the person lost, and the talent who had no vote for those competitors who returned "genius"! Above, the contestant who survived only by "experts", was allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete Farce! <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if they first vote for the contestants, at least "experts" will save two temples better. But this promotion is not ready for broadcast, to make sure that the whole process is dissatisfied and dissatisfied with how the producers tried it.
