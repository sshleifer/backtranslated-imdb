Eat The poor Jane must be done in the old rolling-in-the-grave thing. Even for the time being, for the poor production price (1971) and the format (some small series) allowed to be, this is Baida. Even with what you want to do with Austin, the dialogue should also be bright (even perhaps its most serious work) and melodram should be strictly out of bounds. Well, this is not the case of production. When you go to Anne's "Frédéric, Frederick, Frederick," you'll laugh or cry. If you can not "collect" all the existing movies in Austen's work, you can skip it. But if you look at it, there is a little comfort: Playing an actress Anne's sister does a great job about their role.
