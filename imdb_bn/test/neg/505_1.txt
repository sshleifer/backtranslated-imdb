Now that the infamous West (its time) was the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I was "lucky" enough to see the entire 220-minute version in a theater in 1990. It was really amazing how the BAD film was! <br /> <br /> One of their real events, (the fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), fantastic scenery ... So what's wrong? Three words - Director Michael Simino He completed himself so much after "Deer Hunter" and he made this god a terrible western. He is not totally blame. His earlier film "Dir Hunter" was considered an excellent composition and artists in the United States gave independent rule to do something for him. They gave him alone ... and everything went wrong. Cost control went outside to barreling and Cimino emphasized again on repeat sequences until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First off, sound terrible. Go through the entire sequence and you can not create a word saying the letter. For example, Jeff Bridges's character is presented in the order of a dance, but I still do not know who he was! The dialogue is unknown in its opening scene! That's the fault of the director - he should be sure the conversation was not heard. Some scenes are shot with flying near very dust, you can barely do whatever it is going to do. The story line does not make full sense, and Simino achieves great independence with the truth - only one person is murdered in the real story - Simino makes it a genocide. There are some beautiful sequences of completely contained here by the lack of stories and incomplete dialogue. There was also no bad fault in the theater - all the prints sound like that. <br /> <br /> This garbage was effectively blocked by the United Artists and Simineiro's career ended. A reader of a text written by a director does not understand what he is doing. Jeff Bridges says this is the worst movie he has ever done. This guy who created "tron"! <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A beautiful book, "The Final Cut", which gives details of the complete disaster. It gets one 1. I want the negative number of IMDB - it claims!
