I liked the action movie. I have a softspot for "B" flicks with bad conversations and wood acting. So, I was worse off this blockbuster to get my guilty pleasure from inside my blog. I can not afford to force you to combine this larger part of CR * p than this Bruce Willis car. <br /> <br /> The story "Armgradon" (and I use that word for a little less) "Super drillers" "It's flying to destroy an asteroid before destroying the world, realistically ?, but who is it? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image starts with a few scenes designed to introduce threats and letters. Bruce Willis is the leader of the party's strongest leader, and sleep with her daughter In the absence of unreasonable work, Ben spent the first bit of screen around Ben Affleck, for some reason, I did not smile. It was all forcibly like this movie. <br /> <br /> This group is called because they are the only people in the whole world It can drill asteroids - Well, when I'm ready to take this firmness, it will take action for us - the supposedly meat of the film. In the endeavor, every character is going to do some crazy things before the explosion, and again, lam, finally they stop, here the movie is really close to me ** they stop rock, and set the work. And everything has a suspicious count !!! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... One - oh, surprise surprise, we saved that day again !! <br /> <br /> And do not let me start at Jersey Camerawar too. When I saw in the theater, I thought I was going to get sick. I was trying to cover the left side holes by the performance inspired by moving away from just a few seconds (and away from someone at MTV - during a short concentration time). <br /> <br /> Just when I thought it might not be too bad ... wait - a built-in tier maker has ended, which used it so much that it cain the rest of the movie as a virtual citizen. <br /> <br /> Overview: Witticisms were not crap. Plot - Well, I said I let him go. The acting was bad. Really bad. Billy Bob could not even rise above the script, which was bad. Camerawork - Again, bad. (I did not even mention the most cruel love scene in motion picture history - in the mind of animal crackers). <br /> <br /> Ratings: 1 out of 10 (I'm giving half points for Steve Bussy, who makes me smile against my wishes, and another half point for the time I try to see the beautiful animated Tillar and try to ignore his acting performance) The worst movie to watch in the theater which went away .. Ever.
