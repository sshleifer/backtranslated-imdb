I have never written a comment on IMDB before, but this movie was so bad that it liked me but warned me not to waste my life two hours. As a WWII historian, I do not even know how this movie was historically wrong. Korean War bayonet luge, Carabines with carcin absent clear rods and sight hood, German uniforms were not present, the list could go on forever. It has been added that it has been loaded with errors, there is literally no plot or climax, and played equivalent to your local high school theater. Epitome of sugar <br /> <br /> Please ... there are many good WWII movies there to waste your time on this junk.
