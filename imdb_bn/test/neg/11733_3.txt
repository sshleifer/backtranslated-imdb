Really, how hard is it to do better remix? Of course it is quite difficult! Because I was very excited to see seeing because I love the real, and my friends go and tell me that it really sucks. Well, I finally see it and I was soap disapointed. All right, the shower scene was more realistic ... so I gave it a 3. So, it sucked. Vince von Norman plays a terrible job, he's just too dense or something. I do not know, it was just terrible. Do not look at it!
