Recently I was looking for a project in the Department of Sociology and thought that this was the worst movie I could ever sit. It was like a bad cinematic movie that all "good bits" were taken. Bad acting, fake documentary set-up, nonsensical plot, and ruthless aspects all combine to make a terrible, terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. Consider this exchange: "He's hot." "There are his girlfriend." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "Number" * Girl takes the boys hands and leads her to some bush. The boy came out and sat next to another son, closed the girl. * "Did you hit it?" "No, I do not want to stop my pants." "You're a fool." When the boys are going to Beverly Hills, the other girl shows, gets on the trunk with the boys, and when they drag by a police, you see the car above and below the bomb. <br /> <br /> <br /> A gay distorted, a trigger-happy Clint Eastwood looks the same, and any Luchado mask seems to be associated with all mourning. One of the boys is taken away by the police, nobody is worried. One of the boys was shot dead, no one thought. <br /> <br /> Some people said the dialogue was mostly reformated, and it shows. Just awful I would not recommend this film to anyone.
