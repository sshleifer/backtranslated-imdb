<br /> <br /> This movie is actually nothing to do. Philippe Symur Hoffman has played with Reverend on the horror of his constriction and other toilets in the 25-hour film, you know that they did not leave any shuts and were dropped off convincingly. It's a waste of good talent, and total embarrassment. Awesome! <br /> <br />
