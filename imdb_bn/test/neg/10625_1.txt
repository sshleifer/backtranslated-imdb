I found this movie as a birthday gift because all my friends knew I was a low budget, big fan of Flickr. The Kaufman studio has always made that Chess created gory flicks. I like to watch my movie with my family in the rainy night at home ... until I saw the buggy ... what happened? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie started with a beautiful idea about changing the bug and even adding some chic comedy but overall the text is bad and it's a wrong number one. Ronald K. Before becoming a filmmaker, Armstrong will have to first learn to be a good writer. After reading the credit we discovered that he gave himself the most important role in the film !! The director of the two words "acting lessons" is okay? Mr. Armstrong joined the post of other writers / managers who cast their own films and the wrong number two. <br /> <br /> The only thing I believed was that this image has been preserved for artistic camera work and musical scores, (listen to this cry!) At the beginning of this act, other actors have cast a look. Bits are cold, really warmer and warmed up towards the end of this production. Everyone pulled together and helped pull this film off. Ronald Armstrong can never be a suitable director or actor, but I will tell him - he seems to know how to combine people and organize people to stop his production. <br /> <br> This film should tell me that a young filmmaker who dreams of making his own film, because if Mr. Armstrong is able to stop it then anyone else can do it. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, see it in the future to be inspired to do "good". Bigger and better horoscope for Hollywood to come back from his grave
