Directors / producers / preachers want to promote a film based on "real facts" and create a movie that is meant to inspire and have meaning, but at the beginning, you want to maintain any kind of accountability and honesty <br/> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Any half-intelligent person will know that "All Blacks" is the National Rugby Union of New Zealand Law and black jumper cables and a traditional Maori dance as part of the Haka is performed by them. <br /> <br /> In addition to maintaining such stupidity in the film, the credibility of the film has been reduced and denies the message and inspiration the film is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> Why is the question "Why"? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that the author or director or producer watched it on TV before the International Rugby Union match and thought, "Wow, that will be great in our movies, nobody will know that it has never happened, they are all new NZ and all black is too stupid for me to know, it would be great. <br /> <br /> How a American American American dress and a manga wearing warp paint To respond to a film wearing raccoon Indian dress and warp painted national anthem and warp paint, an American American dances in Indian war, shouting shouting, "Oh oh ohoo, oh oh ohu?" Reaction? <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> For some reason the industry thinks that they can "fool all people all the time". <br /> <br /> It's just stupid!
