Meh, it's really all up for me. Boring stories, silent dialogue, slow action scenes (how do you make something like a war or a shootout boring? Do you really try to make it?), No real characters etc just dull. Snipes is a gifted actor and physicist but none of his DTV work has come to a page, when the audience has the opportunity to supply the most superior products. Imagine a decent script that you have taken care of some tough characters and some great explosive steps, fights, shootouts, etc. How can it be difficult to manage? My personal opinion does not just care for the primary players of the production. There is no evidence of encouragement for what they are doing. See the first 2 Blade Snipes, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man etc? Surprising by the wonderful, intense performance complementary (always not outstanding) scripts, well-suppressed cast and mischievous steps. <br /> <br /> There is no expression of these which is far extraordinary shame. The debaters dragged Wesley's face into Dhaka, the audience knew that they would roam them because they still could not understand that they had not seen him in the theater for nearly two years. <br /> <br /> I want to work with someone like Snipes Isaac Florentine who really works most of the DTV production and works with Alpha stunts that only have some of the best crews. Together they will create awesome teams and a snipes action vehicle, we're all proud to see. <br /> <br /> Explosives suck. As the Marksman chews it which is not bad, but it still sucks really well.
