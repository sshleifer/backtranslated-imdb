I could not wait for the end. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. If you thought that only someone could make a watch movie, these people proved that the minimum skill set required. It is a film with a freedom fighter. This is a zero score in each section. The audience is not given any consideration or consideration only these 'amateur' ones. There is no serious effort to work or entertain. Storyline is pointless, meaningless and stupid. Throw very uncomfortable look and lack of complete direction. The technical aspects of the film are poor. <br /> <br /> As a DVD, it creates a good beverage coaster.
