I really like Salman Kaahan, so I was really frustrated to see this movie. It was not a lot of a plot and they were not that interesting. But it is good for the film that Salman looked at the young and refreshing but the value of this DVD was worth it. Music was not bad, it was pretty cool. Usually Indian cinema is at least two to three hours long, but it was a very small film for an Indian film. American actress Television hit series heroes from the movie, Ali came from Larter. Her performance may be of much interest. But she looked good in the Indian dress she was wearing. Not everything was good for the movie and I hope Salman will do a lot in his next movie. Thank you.
