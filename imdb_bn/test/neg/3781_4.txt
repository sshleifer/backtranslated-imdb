Toast, roast, fly, and otherwise it's easy to burn this movie for a lot of flaws. It was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community; It shows! Of course, I could test the script which is just ridiculous. A growing creature made from a growing California city garbage began to eat garbage and garbage cans across the city. Immediately, this huge creature starts destroying the building at low cost and even plays a small high school girl, playing "beauty and animals". Fortunately for her a gang, her ex-boyfriend's nickname "Penguin", and the city drunk to help her The direction is horrific, the production value is just awesome, the acting does not exist, and the speed is lazy. The film is difficult to sit through. However, it is said that this is a miracle of a movie, when you feel that it was created by the entire community. You can see all the collective attempts from actors, actual mayors and actual firemen and policemen, who use location shots in the area. Along with helping to contribute or contribute towards any movie, I was surprised at all the local businesses. If you look at the film from that perspective, it's really a achievement. I sat and saw it before I knew nothing about it. Now I've found something about it, I'm impressed. But do not make any mistake - I do not ... do not ... again want to sit through it.
