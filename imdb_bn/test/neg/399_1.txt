I saw here that some reviews were at the top with ** ** Spiller. The rage of my family that the only part of the film that was not given behind the box was given away. The title Perhaps I'm just a 17-year-old American who did not know the art, if it bit in my foot, but I like movies that have at least some words. This photo makes the second half of 2001: A space ODC right below the conversation. This film is not so slow, even artistic, it is just boring. Following this vague guy we are following this boy around Venice. Finally, I could not read the end of the book. Should a movie you do not read back to the book, it will be able to stand alone. There is no way to stand on this movie. It does not have even bones of bones on a plot.
