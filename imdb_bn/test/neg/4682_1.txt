I write this user's comments, Tim Burton's interpretation of the Semi Todd story is making big money in the box office, and if it is not a mistake, then even the Oscars are nominated for the film. I have not seen it yet, but I sincerely hope Burtton will not look for the inspiration and / or stylish trademarks of the old Andy Millington's "Vampire Butcher". Yes, although the title specifies the slaughterhouse, but the main characters of the plot are a sailor (infamous Swine Todd) and female baker. Together they form a cruel alliance where they kill the customers of their shop and they process them in their famous London meat pies. In other words, an Andy Millington is the most common, derivative, stimulant and amateur. I think the IMDB rating for this movie is called itself. Although the worst story I've ever seen is the worst, Milligan has somehow attracted uninterruptedly unknowingly. Production is a giant mess, an inconsistent storyline, really awful photography, poor light, hateful acting and instruction, ridiculous ego and membrane tension or atmosphere. False padding and more than half of the footage fails to describe how the film is handled, even during the 80 minute running time. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Matthi; Andy Milligan no one else will not be afraid ?? Hand down ?? The worst director ever, but I think he does not care. Perhaps if you really set high level of tolerance, then "vampire kids" is worth a visit.
