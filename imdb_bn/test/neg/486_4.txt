Okul "school" is a result of a new trend in Turkish movies. Again the same story is being used and new generation directors came up with different ideas. Of course, this does not mean that they are all grand. I think okul is one of them. It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not. It does not succeed to be awesome. So what is that The actors are so annoying with the average, especially Deniz Akkaya teacher role. If I was trying hard it would have been better to be sure Maybe it's a subject to consider as a scary or reverse. But the director missed the target this time. ** Out of *****
