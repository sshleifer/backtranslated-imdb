After I saw this I conclude that it was likely to flush a chick; Later, I found that Keirah's mother wrote Scrappple so that most of the time was sure. However, a chick rush may appeal to some of the men; Do not think that this is one and really women that do not appeal well (look at the dishonor box office receipt). An item which I believe convinces both the gender is the stupidity of the scene, in the film, where the baby is enclosed in pain and disturbed with organs. Although male child does not suffer from birth, we realize that it is a painful process. Yet it is a natural pain, certainly not a separation! Women even realize this good I suspect some women are trying to give feminist statements on poor taste. Actually, many movies in this movie are very poor taste. Although movies are known for the weak taste these days, in this section it is really "Excelsus". This can be a good movie that shows the struggles of Dylan Thomas during WWII; And how strong that attitude was against the man, since he was somehow managed to avoid the military service. Career trying to show screen writing about how this idea was used against Dillon, but it is actually a disgusting one. Instead we get a chick flick together to bond two young mothers; Type, type A way Probably. Same. Note that after serving in the war, the soldier (Dillon's wife and husband's husband) was sent back home; Even when the war is over, it is not clear! Much of the movie is a bit unclear; And even though I have already said that this central motif of this mess seems to be doing it again.
