My overall feeling about this movie is that it is a slow, drawn-out, fragmented world with really unfortunate circumstances, isolation and a clear message. This movie is composed of roughly crazy video footage of countries visited with mostly bad reactions, all slowly and steadily steamrolling the music in slow motion. Of course, some materials and interviews contain some interesting stories, but unlike how the rewinding description indicates it is not like the story of the hunter, it is referred to as the director, Mr. Ripper and he does not say it's good. This picture can include their own storytelling, better interview with people with themselves. Instead, Mr. Ripper has taken this story on his own, and unfortunately it does not end up being too many. I have never felt the feeling of any development about what he has discovered, and he never mentions how he brought the matter to the first place. He simply took us from one place to another, brushing on the situation and letters lightly, walking around the streets to show the very unreasonable slow footage of the people walking on the street, then went to his next destination. He works on this, and over, and without any real development. I think this image can be cut in 45 minutes, but it can move closer to 2 slow hours. We are morally obliged to take care of the matter, but the director's self-motivated, frightening, unexpected delivery of his journey has broken you a while later.
