Peter Island's six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) with Heather (Iris McKillan-Grace), Kim (Aina Baker) and Denis (Melissa Robi) Kevin (Michael Ryan) invites for a while. The father's boat opened in the open sea. What could be a super ideas idea? A big green weather for good start may crash in the ocean near your boat and an external life-energy can originate from it and you can try to kill everyone, then again it is a ridiculously stupid concept, is not it? <Br /> <br /> Attached, written and managed by Steven Castle I thought the predator island was painful and it's really easy and straightforward. The script is the worst kind, you know such a horror that is involved with the extremely annoying teenage characters and tells the most stupid things, it is totally embarrassing and completely anticipated, it does not give any idea later, only things will happen suddenly without a build up or explanation, it even happens 70 odd minutes even annoying and it has virtually no entertainment value, even in Do not recognize the value of laughter. The film is not actually going to be a plot, I do not have much of it, there is no explanation about why or why this external person can choose the way in the mind, or why it can be selectable at this time that the person is next to 'normal', when the story is over Called for it and for a clear reason, then suddenly they got green eyes and canned sticks Gets a sudden desire to do. There is not enough intimidation, so-called action scenes are unfortunate and I do not really want to waste another second thought about Pride Island, by typing these words to ruin my precious energy ... <br /> <br /> Director Castle does not do anything to see this thing, and 'special effects' are absolutely terrible, this alien creature does not even have the dude even 50-science-fai film. Filmmakers can play some blueprase footage on even the last credits, but this should be a fun collection of the wrong mistakes, I mean, if they misunderstood, what I mean! As you do not forget about a suitable cow, there are some areas of cannabalism and unfortunate actor stomachs have intestines, so other unfortunate actors can choose and eat them. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the estimated budget of $ 150,000 is that filmmakers are working in a less expensive budget, it is still not an excuse for creating a poor movie. The whole thing looks very cheap and the act is quite bad. <br /> <br /> Predator Island is painful, I'm sorry, but this is the way and I failed to see who would find out from it. My modest opinion is to avoid this one probably.
