Jod Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renes Jellyvigher. They're all terrible. Especially star, Jude Law. <br /> <br /> It was directed by a man who was an English patient and based on the best-selling novel of a risky person going back to his boyfriend, but unlike the wonderful English Patent, the film was damaged. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> The worst dialogue "But we know each other for a moment" "But they're like a thousand minutes, like a diamond in a bag" <br /> <br /> <br /> "In some cultures you are just me I'm asking you to marry 3 times and you have got married "Lover-Dove-" I married you, I married you, married you, I married you ... <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed of it <br /> <br /> The whole movie is awful, Vio Was anaka .... ug, there is no word, I'm sick. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (one really loud sounds of bullets, sound crew did a good job)
