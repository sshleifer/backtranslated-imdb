Like the terrible cancer from the sky, I used to roam the cross in some movie channels on the other night. Being fanciful of bad movies and being involved in the bad movie shopping and actively engaging with the view, I was excited by the idea of ​​the upcoming real horror detective movie in modern times. Even then, after that I wandered my hands against me, grabbed anything in the range and put it on my head and neck. The tapes were a bit awkward ... wrong ... where I was ... However, the images that I crossed out badly worse. William ForSmith can not play multiple characters, and the character is always the joke to walk. Even when a angle is set in the background and is given for doing something and says that it is considered funny (Ala disse Biglogo), he is mistakenly ridiculous. Erica Elienac has played in her fair share of many similar, horror movies, and has done terrible things among all of them, she failed to help her take it away. The classic B-movie villain Andrew Andrew Devf has a respectful job but barely even the chin has no scenery. Even the reliable standby Daniel Bernardt failed to provide some entertainment grounds for the B-Movie Action. For the film's own competence, like plots, scripts, actions and plot movements, both are vague and ... good, fool, for lack of a good adjective (Lord knows what they did not keep <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, you enjoy until the worst movie is one of the tolerant and simply feel your metal test felt as so However, Before doing so, take it from me, even not terribly terrible to enjoy it (saying ... some more exciting Italian junky films). A fan of B-Movie Action can see any of the pictures of Barnhardt's other films or It's better than ever to test anything that has been kept in film at any given time. America simply thinks that the tax There is not a place to go for, especially now. If you have a desire, find something from the ocean, the heroic duo or a little less normal haqidar (including some of the awesome Katya Ammiya's canvas) movies are more fun and effective than your suitability. Will supply. Elsewhere, especially here.
