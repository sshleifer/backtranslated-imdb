Harmony Korrine - Hate him or hate him? In this proof, hatred can be a good word. Of course not only does he do everything. But it could have been so different, because the first ten minutes of this film, Michael Jackson's unarmed Marilyn Monroe promised a lot of love in the love with the neighbor. Fantastic And set to Paris! This can be great. But unfortunately, Korin can spark an amazingly beautiful concept, but he is a horror writer, because the story fails at every stage and I've seen the walkout of an hour-long viewer positively prove that he is making the most annoying and provocative films. Apparently last year, his premiere run out rate was quite threatening to the ear festival. Rather than focusing on two plays, he took the story to the border of Chattu, stupidly, so that he introduced a bunch of other experiences so that the whole experience is tedious and brutally brutal. When will the independent movie begin this initial fund?
