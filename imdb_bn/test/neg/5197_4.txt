I'm confronted with this movie - it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen, and provides insightful beauty of lost cultures. Caps and torches were an early scene of men, serving a woman, and playing an Accordion, which brought tears to my eyes, because it was the way of life that was unknown to many today. It has officially tied the life of the character with the life of the village, one of the most lost concepts in today's world. The symbol is always funny but it looked a little date. To me, the movie's fatal error is the lack of an impossible dramatic drive and a total lack of humor. I never felt that I did not know any character outside of the tragic public things like losing a loved one, etc. There were people in the table of managers involved in natural disasters, war, etc. Others include tragic scenes, no fiction threads and no humanity. As a result, it seems irrelevant, very abstract in real life. In the end, I was very annoyed to see it.
