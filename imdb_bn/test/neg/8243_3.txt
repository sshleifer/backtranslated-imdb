I usually prefer to carry on movies but this is actually quite awesome. There are so many smiles because the whole thing is so strong. The screen has a lot of talent and some are better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hattie Jacks and Peter Butterworth fined, but Barbara Windsor got tired and Sid James fit. Joan Sims comes off well but is generally just plain sad in case of the wonderful Charles Hawtrey. When you think of the tragic end of his career, the movie is very sad to see. Homophobia of the movie is nasty and it's a very unpleasant experience. This set is very cheap and sets the film very clearly in England in contrast to other films in the series. The sea side looks cold and there is little effort to create a delusion here. It looks like a cheap product. Especially if you like the series, you would be sad to see how this became observer.
