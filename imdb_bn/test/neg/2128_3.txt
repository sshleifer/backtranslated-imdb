A man (Gafredo Unzar) found floating in the debris of the debris of his flight coast beneath the ocean. A helicopter wins only him expressing both legs missing on his knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine's Monirai) and her associate Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgan) is conducting research on some types of marine biologists and dolphins in the sea. Hogan sounds a strange sound outside the sea. Encouraged he and Stella Peter (Michael Sozkyi) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Pendo) are searching for the source and looking for a source to create a device, or in any way it is made specifically without cleaning. Meanwhile, Florida scientist (Cynthia Stuart named Sinzia de Ponti), who worked in a rival organization called 'West Sessions International', was brutally murdered when he threatened to release anyone in the organization. More people are attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Jiaan Garco as John Garcos) in this case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra set all over the ocean. Soon they have found evidence that some giant and very unreasonable may hide under the surface. Together with rival scientists Professor Donald West (William Bager), Sheriff Gordon and the United States Army, he was ready to destroy the giant, but there is another general force because the genetically engineered animal can not be released at any time. Cost! Directed by Lamberto Bava as John Old Junior. This is the 70's and 80's classic Italian horror and much tears from splatters films. JainFrakka Clerici, Herow Pikini and Dardando Sleep can be slowly and slowly as slowly as slowly as possible to sleep slowly and slowly. The giant is rarely used, the large parts of this movie are made of boats and helicopter footage. The big part of the first half does not pay attention to the mysterious 'who is behind it' in the story. There is really no cow talk, his legs are closed, and there are people with one hand. The special effect on the giant is usually poor and it appears very frustrating, flashes. The virtual counter cast does not help it to fit any easily. There really is not much to recommend this film so I do not. Do not bother, you can do much better.
