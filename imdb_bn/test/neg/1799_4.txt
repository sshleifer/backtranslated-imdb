Based on Joseph Conrad's 1899 book, there is no short description of the film 'Heart of Darkness' and it is almost like the league line of schizophrenic If you have read the book, you know that no important scene has been minimized to "create stories" in the movie. There is so much left to the imagination in the book and I think it is a part that creates the book. For example, Marlow had spent hours and hours indefinitely, even for a few months even waiting for rivets and that the whole scene was left out of the movie. Again, if you read the book, you will know that the book's description of this theme is almost original, basically the theme of vainness. Finally I think the movies were very chopped and dry. It is not enough to be kept in the original text and how it has made today's story. <br /> <br /> If you do not read the book, 'Heart of Darkness' (in particular, Norton Critical Edition) then do not waive your time on film rent or purchase. But if you have read the book, then I think you will appreciate the book more by deciding to watch the movie <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
