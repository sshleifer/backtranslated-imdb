A British teen movie that accidentally creates its dream man (Jake) using a virtual reality machine around a girl (Justin), there is only one problem (not only one?) She is actually a real man trapped inside and He is the only person who can trust his body with a singer. It seems to be worse than it is, because Laura Fraser seems to be more visible to the film than it is, especially when she wore red lacquer costume clothes to impress Jack, she looked stunning, WOW !! Only if I have a virtual reality machine ?????
