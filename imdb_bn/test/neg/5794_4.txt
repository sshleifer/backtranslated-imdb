Even after the thunderstorm success of The Love Bag in 1968, Disney is guilty of cash cows, but even the mouse house is cached with the Herbie Rids anne, Harvey goes to Monte Carlo and Harvey Gay's bananas. To enter Herbie in the Make Carlo Rally, we found the love driver Jim Douglas and his Sidekick Wheelty Applegate, the impressive and unreasonable appeal of this love bug did not return at 68. Naturally, things began to take precedence beyond the nation, they merged with diamond robbery and Harbe fell in love with another car! The car stunts are certainly attractive and easy to see, and it is frustrating for me to poison toxic depression by breaking into such a friendly piece, it's just that the film does not go anywhere faster and now I can personally see it for the currency. It is an inspired piece of work. You'll still see Harbie taking a bath, watching dance for Baddies and the lady of his life, so I think something for everyone ....................4 / 10.
