Remember when Rick Mercer was fun? 22 minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer was on it and made in Canada was a very good show. Talking to Americans was very fun. But like my friend "Rick Marsar once woke up and was no longer fun" I think that was the day when Rick Mercer's report went to the wind. What is the point of this show? Rick Mareser's vacuum reads the fake titles, shows the bad shad photos of the people, and is going somewhere in about 20 minutes of the 30-minute show and someone is hoping to say something clever or clever on the TV, someone smiles somewhere We are interested in seeing Rick Mars's gymnastics team and then interested in trying to take some steps, and then interested in suiciting it while trying to "be funny". Rick Mercer is not old or just lost or just funny. Even his classic rant bits have lost all their bites and humor. You can usually talk about CBC Comedy, even though they have been trapped for the same kind of junk for Air France on TV?
