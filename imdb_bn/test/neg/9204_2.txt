In some uncertain future a spaceship where people are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, the land of a strange young planet disaster where the dinosaurs are compiled and not just disappeared in this world. About ten blue characters fighting the survival of the crash, blue, white, and yellow suit, fight for survival against lazy prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> "A Dinosaur Planet" is an extraordinary movie. I have said above in my summary, the film's stop-motion animated dinosaurs are the only colorful actors. The model is crude, but effectively animated. And they are much more impressive and inspiring than those characters, which are written by inexperienced actors and speech lines more than a character, which is written overnight without single corrections. Clearly, most of the budget was inserted into dinosaurs and although there is a fair share among them, it is not nearly enough to protect us from the annoyance. These human characters only scream, roam, and ridicule about this poorly written and words about living. And unfortunately, dinosaurs will not eat enough of them. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Dinosaur Planet" is not a movie that I'm planning to watch again. Some people will easily love it for so cheap and so badly created. Sometimes, I enjoy movies like this. But this particular film is very long, very annoying, and the mind is very tiring.
