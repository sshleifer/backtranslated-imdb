I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I got that fission. He was lovely in the romantic scene; Very bad Bill Paxton was flying autopilot for the whole effort. I often lost my midday meal when he said that his big fat white pop outside his flight suit, we would say 'involved' with Julia. <br /> <br /> I realized that Julia was very skilled at seeing her in Sabrina. '. Julia saw 'Sabrina' with French soundtrack to see if Julia wakes her own conversation. They use anyone else. In any case, Julian was chosen enough English to communicate with the American Flyer on behalf of French French Speaker for this French language. Perhaps they wanted at least a familiar name for the British / American market. In my unknown eyes, Julia's attributes could pass for the Belgian. <br /> <br /> The whole picture had a diverse nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium in the First World War. I want to think that the German invaders needed a theme of heroic Dutch resistance for national pride. Belgians were much more passive during the time of occupation than the French or Norwegian. The most barbaric war of all came to the Balkans where the Teotor Communist Partition favored the Germans. <br /> <br /> I saw another review that 'Doubodontil' believed that Julia Ormond had become a real American instead of British nationality. Perhaps Julia's acting skills were enough to convey that impression. <br /> <br /> After watching this film several times, how suddenly I felt, how much of the film is On 16 October 1944, American aircraft crashed in Belgian farmland. The trees become abundant and the weather becomes warm. People walk about light clothing and grass is still green. There is no small trace of snow or ice. This can be the least winter winter in Belgium. <br /> <br /> The actual plot of the movie was a mess. Where to start? Anyone interested in the history of World War II, the film came so far. The reconnaissance plane used was a huge 4-engine converted bombs. Such airplanes exist, but they will need massive fighter companions to have any chance of survival. In fact, small and fast flights were easily available and more suitable for work. The essential code of the film will not be carried on the plane plane. The crew did not require this information to complete their mission, this information has been a huge detective defeat of compromise. Even if the premiere of the movie is given, the first item from the aircraft will be the code book. They could go on the way to Berlin in 10 minutes on the arrival of German troops on the crash site. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the house of Dausysis, where Major Bris took refuge, there was no one. At least the interest of cultivation At this time food in Belgium was very low. Germans needed a lot of locally produced food to support their energy. Prior to the arrival of American trucks, family trucks were expelled for a long time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She knew all about the resistance to allow her to stay alive, would have to reveal. He had to work twice as an agent to frustrate an effective opposition. The woman who did not live in the war on secret radio. <br /> <br /> 'Major Bris' was caught in civilian clothes at the end of the film. As a result, he was subjected to war crimes and executed without any defense. He did not humbly surrender to face interrogation, regardless of Geneva Convention. Compel him to kill him and make his friends better if possible. <br /> <br /> I did not read novels based on this novel. If this movie is a true adaptation, then there is an unimaginable lack of novel development. In spite of the novel, screenlines can easily create a higher script that will not waste the chance of providing many good movies.
