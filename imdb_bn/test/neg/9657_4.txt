I found it amazing that many people (probably Pauls) voted for this movie, as it gives class (mostly ten). All right, the movie was subtle, fun, but on the other hand it was nothing special. The only good thing about Kailar is not comprehensive, but dialogue, for non-polls. Screenplay is primitive, acting (excluding Jerzy Stewah as Ryba) - awful. It's too much ado about - luckily it does not include the Top 250. Ps The "Kilo 2-och" ("2-kilometer") series is going on and it's the same story
