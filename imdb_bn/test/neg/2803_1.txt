If you are laughing this movie (for stupidity), highlight it, because this movie will not fear the bunch of kindergarters in the Halloween party! The problem is too much for Kiddies, so do not explicitly keep this in your VCR for kids. It starts with a little commitment, gives you the idea that the box cover artist actually begins to see this film before covering the cover, but then quickly fall into epic stupidity. The "killer horror" is strange oh that is awesome, but not quite smart like the Wizard of Oz. If they were just a brain ...? I found this movie at the local discount / close-out store for $ 1.20 and even I feel a bit. If I think with all other comments posted here, if you actually want to see this, you can only blame yourself.
