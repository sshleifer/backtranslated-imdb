If the following entices you look at your local blockbuster and post this movie quickly: <br /> <br /> 1. Dready 60's hairstyle, Dody Decktails from Petal Parmes. <br /> <br /> 2. The worst child actor in the world, who does nothing except crying and says the most annoying voice of a daddy <br /> <br /> 3 Lots of ally and monkey stock footage that do not mix with the film. <br /> <br /> 4. Striototype Indians who use Bloppip and GobleGeek Oh, and it's not saying they roam around Campfire. <br /> <br /> 5. Hillaryly fake Fuel Crash Mechanics, where cast actually put the corner of the cardboard set. <br /> <br /> 6. 5 external shots, which look suspiciously like a toy jet in a string, are lit with blue light around the studio. <br /> <br /> 7. Compared to the terrible special effects of those used in the first Star Trek series, the cutting edge shows. (Specifications: The little boy's blonde hair is burning. Oh dear ..) <br /> <br /> 8. The ridiculous editing and continuity, where the background item disappears, the soundtrack completely changes without any warning. <br /> <br /> 9 Do not have enough money to hire a professional dancer? Tell the girl out of the street to make a fool! Anyone will notice the difference! ER .. <br /> <br /> 10. A 'thrilling' mountain accelerated, snake (more things from the archives) and one ton of fake blood involved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was intended to see it in the spirit. This is not unforward to mention .. unforgettable in any other means obtained from crap. So do not try it. 0/10
