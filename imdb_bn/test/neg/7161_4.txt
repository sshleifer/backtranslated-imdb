After watching this book, I was very sad when I was watching movies. I agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel, but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> 1) Why the lines differ (for example L. Dystal instead of the sergeant) <br /> <br /> The ultimate screen is very poor and the Diastolic soldier who fades himself up and wants to die. But it's not 100% true. Just read the book. He was a bull-dog in the last second. He destroys guns and does not want to die on Michael and Noah. <br /> <br /> <br /> So the end of this happiness is not suitable for this movie in any way.
