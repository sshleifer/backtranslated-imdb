The film began with a footage of the massive drought that returned to the United States in the 30's. Then a small story shows the farmer Elijah, who made an agreement with Satan to get good grains. Elisa rented a young man to work in his garden, killed them, and used them in the crowd. He fed the soil with their blood. After a while the police came to see him. One of them shot by Elisa, killing another farmer ... the next day was shown, and some people called Shan are told that their old farm is deprived of inheritance. She decided to go there with some friends to see what up. Shortly thereafter, Shan knew that "Pyaikab Knight" was the next night ... <br /> <br /> This picture was a good story for me, but low budget and poor special effects have just been destroyed. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of making lazy films. For example, we follow a girl (a common man wearing a funny, cheap mask). When he stretches his hand, we see skin of normal human under his glove, instead of some rubbing meat. Gore is not very impressive as well. There are some nasty killings by our "lovely" scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Wonderful acting is somewhat okay in this glimpse, or I say its reliable too. Some nude scenes are also presented for fans (even a lesbian scene), but those scenes do not save. Ray: Good music, good story, strong acting. But the horrific effects, cheap gore and plot holes slow down this movie. Not really recommended.
