Just saw it ... story, plot, script makes the ultimate sense! With its help, bold part 2 (without ring), its characters are blue (for any reason), its Hercules hates everyone (no one knows why), Shoboski shows her true talents (two of them), her unclear special effect, Some of his good actors are devastating their talents (I mention Lleigh's two talents ??)? I would say more ... Even it's effective for NBC-TV standards! It's just the minimum .... what a waste! By the way: How can you give this mini series so big ????? It's out of me! Shame on you! 10 lines must be created, so this is my final word: AVOID, AVOID, if you are considering purchasing it!
