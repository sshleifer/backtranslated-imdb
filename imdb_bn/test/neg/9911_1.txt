This movie is something terrible. I had laugh all the time. I was forced to stop for a while because my mother's folks are not happy when they are dead, but even death in this movie seems ridiculous. Especially when the tornado Tommy gets torn into a tornado. <br /> <br /> The explosions of vehicles equipped with air force by the force of the air begin from the side scroller game in the old school and called R-Type. The dialogues are very bad and I'm interested in how they managed to manage some actors to act in this movie. It is simply amazing how this bad movie can make it on TV. <br /> <br /> The only real reason to watch this movie is folly and irrationality.
