I say "flick" because it is not worthy of the title of "cinema" and certainly not "movies". I am sorry for paying for rent, and even though I have never been able to play in a movie before, but it was, I saw it in a theater. A future underground society (oh, it's original), lots of burn drums, invisible ambient light circulating through windows, an ungrateful woman and her shock-silent son ... list is underway. C. Thomas Hawk influences the sculptor's stereototype loner; You know that the death of Eastwood has been completed. To remember his wife and child, he needs special sunglasses, but in flashbacks, he is the same age! Talk about a poor memory! Little boy Abe randomly pushed a code in a door and I saw it incredibly when it opened! No tension, pithy religious (what religion?) Under / overtones ... all the saddest: I hope good from Roddy Piper; <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst movie experience in my life.
