"The Secret Life" begins with the worst possible descriptive article: "It's very horrific to create a film about crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahler ...". Okay, what are you suggesting? Since the film is not right or bloody, can we not continue to watch? And they were right! At least the bit of film is not amazing and contains almost no blood or gore. Although I think this is largely due to low budget production standards and Dahmar's crime is so horrific. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmar" is just a sequence repeat. Young, compassionate and mentally confused Jeffrey hunts (always male, as he was a lesbian), killed them, and then he discusses how to hurt them and what his purpose was about his loneliness. This gets really annoying and even unknown actors can not save this movie to be a complete bud of pretty performance by Karl Crew. Still, this version was released in 2002, much disproportionate and frustrating than "Dhamma".
