Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mr Scoutmaster is not one of his best. The role of its patent curmudgeon feels forced and even unpleasant than fun. The film itself is overflowing with the feeling of Makkese. In addition, the religious beliefs of the audience and patriotism in the United States are presented in many ham-handed references which come as genuine rather over-respectful. Clifton Webb does her good job with a poor script. Edmund Gavne is yet another jovial cleric and has nothing to do with him. Child Actor Lead is played by a shameless infant who influences the whole of the film. The only claim to achieve his fame as an actor is clearly a low voice like a bullfold for someone of his age. However, once you heard it, you heard it and you would not have to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is the majority of film's scenes. I find this child so annoying that whenever he sees me I will go faster. Since there are so many scenes in this movie, that means that I will go ahead with a lot of pictures. There were many talented child actors there; It's a sad that this picture does not have any of them. Still, a sight to see the Clifton Webb in the traditional wide cap and shorts.
