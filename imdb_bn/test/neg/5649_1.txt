What more can I add? It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, a waiver script, gradually slowing - even the visible microphone dangling from the top of the screen. I could go, but I can not really be bothered. I have seen it for 90 minutes to see that I have grown too much to lose my desired life. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the first set of voting and the first set of votes was from those involved in the promotion of British film making. <br /> <br /> And still worse, I had to buy Melbourne to get it Sunday :-) The only reason that the DVD was not rebuilt as a coaster is that it is now proud of collecting at the top 10 worst movies ever. <br /> <br /> One must definitely avoid.
