Predictable story lines and tee-beddling poisonous pest of a poor pc clich√©s ad nausam (works together races, beautiful as a beautiful hero, a person dedicates himself to saving another life, father / daughter relationship etc). The film looks like something made for network television and probably can be there. Even talented Tommy Lee Jones does not manage to rescue this BOMB. I am requesting you not to waste time or time from the time of this cottage destruction when threats of Hollywood movies roam around. <br /> <br /> Two star-only CGI-people and PR-people get even a movie-gear sitting by it.
