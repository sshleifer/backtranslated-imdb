With such a promising cast and a director that I heard great things, I was completely frustrated by this film. It started with the signs of a great epic gangster story and turned into a completely annoying world with many inappropriate questions and some completely ridiculous and uninterrupted scenes. (And yes I saw full-length version). I love Robert Deanroo and naturally he has done a good acting, but in his other gangster movies, whether he was the one who killed so many people, I always respected his character, but in this movie he was a bad drug addict, but himself The rapist with care for someone without Also, James Woods, another fine actor, wrote some of his ridiculous scenes for him. I thought Robert Denarro called his crazy and he came out completely from the left field and finally the author died in his father's flesh's house, and for this reason James Woods did not leave the random comment on what he did. Being called crazy is like that. So much of this movie was left unused. Also, we never found people trying to kill the noodles, and we could not find anything more about Joe Pacey's character. It seems that writers have thrown five different stories together and have never fully explained them. The only release of the movie was the story of the story when the characters were young children. The story is running smoothly in this part of the story and the kids have done a great acting job. Overall, I was totally disappointed with this movie and I do not see anyone who compares this with Godfather 1 and 2, even Goodfellas. I was sad because I watched this picture for four hours
