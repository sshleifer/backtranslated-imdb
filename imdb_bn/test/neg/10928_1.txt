It seems that people associated with this film are stuffing ballot boxes to promote their ratings. It is a clear news that apparently 18 people have seen it. I think that makes me 19th. I have no involvement with this flicker and I am not acquainted with anyone and I have long been an IMDB user (see my vote records and reviews over the last seven years), so I promised that I am honest and impartial opinion. It's coming to you from a 30-year tremendous fan, who himself has appeared on a few low budget flicks. <br /> <br /> In addition to some interesting video effects, "Frankenstein's Bloody Nightmare" is incompatible, annoying, and technically malfunctioning due to all reasons. It is definitely shot on silent stock and the audio is then dubbed; Since it is recorded with a piece of a tin and string, it sounds anyway. More than three-fourths of the error occurred. <br /> <br /> I saw it from the beginning to the end and I did not even know what the story was, even if I was there. It seems that the director has printed himself for most of the time, punching table corner shots and dead black spaces which do not pad out the film. This is really a problem if someone actually develops a plot and creates a movie that gives some sense of pensing. In this case, though, the rules do not apply. It does not matter how the scenes can be shot because no stories are associated with it. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is practicing uselessness at every level. Those who have worked on it are writing and although they are trying to influence ratings on IMDB, it is just a bad, tedious thing. <br /> <br /> This is really true. If you are thinking of spending your money or time on this topic, think again. It's easier to find something better because you will not get even worse. <br /> <br /> And it's neutral, unclear truth.
