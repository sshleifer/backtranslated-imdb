This was a decent movie for the first half. Many cheaper bu! The moment but builds the tension, the bad guys seem to be vague and everything sets up nicely myself. Kids are not particularly proficient but hey, that works for teens. <br /> <br /> Then it becomes ridiculous and tries very hard - "Why would he / she do it on earth?" Momentum strengthening the power for suspension of the moment, there are many ridiculous events in the Twist, and the title comes in the philosophical form of a film that does not go anywhere and moves quickly. Laughing laughing at the theater laughs laughing <br /> <br /> Great primes but not only badly written and do not hold together. Some very nice shots but they are hard to enjoy when you rolling your eyes.
