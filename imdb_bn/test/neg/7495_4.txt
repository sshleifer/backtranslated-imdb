Of course, it is difficult gay, especially in the south. We get it. Again again ... again <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What stood was that filmmakers paid full attention to more "extreme" characters in gay bars in this small town; The film's focus was on the relationship between drag queens, the painful sledge of the long closed band, and the cruelty to be homosexual, that the bar had nothing to do with anything in the bars. <br /> <br /> Other people had snippets of interviews, people might be related to the audience. But they were impressive, have been virtually excluded, probably shown a glance in the background. <br /> <br /> It was more interesting to me, at least small men and women who are experienced in the experience of the small bar of gay bar and / or the absence of those communities are otherwise rich or otherwise.
