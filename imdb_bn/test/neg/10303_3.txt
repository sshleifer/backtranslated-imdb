Recommending from a friend and paying respect to Philip Baqar Hall, I paid the loop's first season disc. It is a common TV comedy with all the styles that "Walkie" skimming brother (Sully), "Dita" blonde (Lizzy), token unrequited love interest (piper), rhetorical Asian helper (Darcy, which reminds me of Arliss, such as someone who Remind you of the show). The plot is related to various misfortunes (usually by Sully), which attacks Sam, which puts his employer at risk on the aircraft, only to save him the day, 'Happiness Hijins' in the middle. I was not a specific part descibe. I have described them all in one. In this way the problem seems to be false, it may be the first time the kind of entertainment that can be sent, which will see the episodes in the row and will become indifferent beyond the belief in an uninterrupted repetition. Sully will do some 'brittle', Mimi Rogers will say a little sex sex, Russ will tell her gay son, Sandra Oh on Darcy Arliss Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah will unmask her. The lack of a boring smile on the positive only. But it does not let any fool feel that you fool. Go a very good comedy watch. Arrested development, Fieldlefia always sunny, two names on my head. Wondered that this one is still in the air. Oh okay that Fox just canceled the good show, I forgot. Not saying that I do not trust my friend's taste anymore. <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
