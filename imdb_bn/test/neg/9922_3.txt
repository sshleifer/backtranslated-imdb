Let's fix the heart ... it's a terrible movie. The story is confusing, supporting cast is ridiculous, and the lead actor seems to be forced to stay in it. The story seems to us believe in an undergraduate lesbian sex culture where members are killed by their psychiatrists, which can only be a transvestite. Elen Barkin investigated this crime, developed a crash on PETA Wilson, whose work seems to be a pastoral recruiter. Sex scenes are similar to bad pornography and while Barkin and Wilson kiss, poor Alan looks like he is having pain. Barkin's talent is totally out of hijacking this B-grade sex, and I hope he gave pink slip to his agent after landing his film.
