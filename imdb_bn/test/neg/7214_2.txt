Stop making man signals from great movie. The original was a great film that was top, gender, and the screen was one of the coolest characters in the 90's. The story is trustworthy, as you knew repeatedly in the outer bar of the south. But here comes the last call to the Junk Roadhouse 2 piece. I hope they will not make serious headlines and sometimes make another roadhouse. It is not the main character character and the story is not really reliable. Steven Segal's type action is even more, though Roadhouse 2 is a B-movie but it is not yet clicked because some B movie action still sells the movie, but it does not matter. The only reason to rent this movie is to buy a question from the original roadhouse. Patrick Soze's character is Dalton, Dalton's first name or last name? Well I'll save you the $ 4.00 rental fee. Dalton's first name as Dalton Tanner Never do another road !!!!!!!!!!!
