This show is not my opinion, well, then again I did not enjoy any cartoon from Disney Channel. Apart from the "proud family", since it is about a normal female teenage, this show is similar to Lilo and Stitch series, similar to me. It was a mistake to turn the film into a cartoon because the movie was fantastic, the cartoon is terrible. The David Channel is working fine with Dave the Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whistle, Lilo and Stitch series, the American Dragon Jake is taller and before adding these stupid cartoons. They became better in Playhouse Disney! For this special event, Kujko will not be out of school, as Dave the Barbarian's parents do not return home, and Brandy and Mr Whiskers will never be out of the jungle.
