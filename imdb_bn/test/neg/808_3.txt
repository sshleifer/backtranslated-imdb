In South Africa, after living in the United States after 32 years and living in South Africa, I'm sorry to say this great disappointment. My three major problems with the movie were a) Why Swing and Ezifor - an American and Nigerian - for leadership. This country is bursting with talent and does not need to import ... b) Gilani Slovo has now been struggling to crush his struggles for years. He is a very medium writer and even his novel. Hyper's misinformation does not show up ... and c) Hellenic Swan is proven to be a million dollar baby (but also Eastwood child), such as a great actor, wearing the costume here in the contemporary New York style Curuou roams freely around Currie. Where was the valuable consideration and the sensitivity of the director? Yes, the picture continues till now - how can not it? But the overall mood in the conclusion is one of the greatest drawbacks. The heart needs the right place but a speed maker.
