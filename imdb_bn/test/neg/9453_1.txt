I often get to see low budget stuff like this because a friend of mine loves the strong horror films. This is the first time I have been compelled to write a review ... <br /> <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br/> <br /> The only good thing to say about it is that it is a bit of beer (but for all the wrong reasons) Was fun.
