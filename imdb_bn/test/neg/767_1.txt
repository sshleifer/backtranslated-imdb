Even though Tom and Jerry are submitted as cartoons, it is not the cat and the mouse team, but the former Mut-o-Jeff is going to the Rip of Africa and in an attempt to mix them, the stereotypical barracks cork makeup itself disguises itself. Although dialect humor mostly wool, there is a short musical order that was involved in the "black skeleton" which was entertaining. But I have to ask, how can Tom and Jerry continue their makeup even after tearing the water several times? Before signing contract with RCA's Disney, many entries produced by Van Bear Corporation for the distribution of RCO radio. If you look at an animation buff, you are interested in how stereotyped a specific nation is as a valuable entertainment.
