It is tempting to see this film as a brave avant-garde test. I want to think that the director is trying to see if the comedy can accept all the conventions of the film and that it can create something entirely, completely, completely irrational. <br /> <br /> The answer is "Venus", a fan 'yes'. It may not be the worst film I've ever seen, but my brain seems to have repressed the memories of others. This horrible membrane just raises from the border: Bad thoughts still cause pain, but not too bad that my internal sensors have removed it from my consciousness. <br /> <br /> I imagine what a tough director and cast they thought that when they were making it, or why they went forward and they published it after creating it. I suspect involved anyone involved in it, but certainly among them they could all get enough money to buy and burn the prints. <br /> <br /> This is a movie which has nothing to recommend. It's not even usable bad. It's just a non-movie which is not very interesting. I thought seriously about taking it back and taking back my money, which I have never done before. <br /> <br /> Do not even think of paying (very few purchases!) This awesome non-movie!
