I feel really bad to review this movie because I hope only saw it as a production idea. It seems like it may be an actual part of the agreement, but sadly they lose a great idea in translation on the screen. <br /> <br /> The story follows fourteen children who are descendants of families who start the salami witch trial in the city of Ipswich. They also happen to be part of the secret constitution called "the contract". Their strength must be used at least because it destroys their lives in small amounts and highly addictive. According to theory it will create a superb well-crafted Saifai movie? Or at least a striking naughty spark. <br /> <br /> But it is too much of a jolassani that the film does not allow its plot to reach. Full potential That was not good at acting, the word track was intercepted and we found a lot of unnecessary sync problems. Definitely the biggest problem is poor editing work. There is no balanced stream in the movie and a fight to keep a feeling of emotional timeline or pensing. <br /> <br /> There is a moment for the movie, but overall disappointing. <br /> <br /> A witchy 4/10
