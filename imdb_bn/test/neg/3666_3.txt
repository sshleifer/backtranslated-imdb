Dark Reality looks like a movie that is slightly reducing. Although the plot and the story are good, there are unnecessary nudity. Although I think the film was technically done well, the performance was great, while watching it was very dark for my mood. IT basically says that there are many missing people who can not be found and probably being tortured by the sick whacks. I think some information about the prisoners and the reason being so sick has helped them. It came as a snap film, made just for violent content. If you want to beat, torture and kill women, it is for you. If you're looking for something lighter and more expressive and reasonable, skip it.
