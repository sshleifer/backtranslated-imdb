Only if the title does not go away - this movie is garbage. <br /> <br /> Overview? Yes <br /> <br /> I decided to spend a lot of time writing this review because Hollywood probably decided to write the script. I doubt how it will weaken it after I say everything, but if it is and someone can read it - stay tuning the first sandalat movie. It completely exceeds its predecessor in a single way. Are not consistently bought or viewable and everyone involved in creating them should be ashamed to destroy one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.
