I stayed around ninety minutes through this horrible movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or anything else! Did filmmakers make it? It is an old female limited genius who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill a story without a point, we can get some things about her throat, her puppy's help, and, of course, her ten cats! Do not see these pictures. And there's something more with anyone who likes it - they do not have a twist. There are interesting people in this world of sharing insights and insights into sharing wonderful stories - but Marta Beckett is not one of them. The people I took in this movie said they forgave me - but they would never have fun about it.
