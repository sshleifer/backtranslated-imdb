Give me a break. How can someone say that this is a "good hockey movie"? I know that the movies are beautiful choices ************************************************************************************************ And yes, at the moment when our sport was not accepted in today's USA, it was still made. I played hockey all my life and saw more, and this is my friend cruel lunacy. The snowy scenes were sure to win ... The special example I mentioned is "sword fighting", that means "stick war" at the end of the film ... in which all of them are standing and, in fact, it is actually happening that observers with charm, But in the wonder who will win the conflict between the Youngblood and his generosity Rakkie. Yes the story of ice is a little better, I put a little pressure. <br /> <br /> I do not know, there is no point in progress ... I mean, let's face it: The film is okay. Hockey is the only big battle for ice ... oh yeah, often wandering around a small portion of the walnizzard rubber - sometimes which is considered to be "round". Youngblood is either unrestrained or raunchy, I could not think ... maybe someone else would have more luck.
