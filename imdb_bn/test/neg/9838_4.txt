It is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90% that ultimately there was no reason to be so challenging and frustrating. Did the director decide to suddenly become complacent, making this movie 80%? Yeesh Spear alert usually starts out enough for the youth of the 50's gone wild; Drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, please have old diner managers, and city creepas. Approximately 15 minutes before the end of the event followed the expected path, when the only preference character closes and the opposition is responsible for the hero (this was the main plot of the film but it will not be unexpected ... the staff is having the final rail time and the unraveling begins! Curve ball). Then things get weird; Please form a crowd of old codger and beats the hero from bloody pulp. The only presence of a Hero friend is a confession from a real murderer - Learing, a strange city nut (in any real universe, he will be the main suspect from the beginning, even if the anti-hero is not available <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> This strange film is more strange than confiscation of neighboring homosexuals Perhaps this was the purpose - perhaps the resistance of Bux to sit with her was because of her sex (which should have been suppressed in the 50's, and thus did not discuss or even accepted it). There was more "Drifter." If the director's objective was to spin it as sexual yarn - that drifter drifts because he thinks that he is out of sex   হয়; যে ড্যানির প্রতি তার পিতামাতাকে প্রকৃতপক্ষে পিতামাতার না কিন্তু স্বামীবান্ধব নয়; যে তার ক্যারিয়ারের সাথে থাকা অসম্ভব একটি যৌন বিদ্রোহের মূল কারণ যা তিনি পুরোপুরি বুঝতে পারছেন না - এটি আরও স্পষ্ট হয়ে উঠতে পারে। Instead, we consider this very strange teenager and behavior of homeostaticism to be completely discriminatory. <br /> <br /> These youths can sleep beside each other, even when they can spread. When Danny is recommended (and sometimes even in bed with a woman), then Vikas goes away and takes her away. Danny carries the way of Bix (sure, there is another explanation for this, but it is always worth buying a diner for lunch). They eventually end up living together. Homosexuality was not as vague as "ropes" but it was not denied. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> MST 3 has done the right thing with it. Apart from Jack Elam, there is nothing to compliment the film.
