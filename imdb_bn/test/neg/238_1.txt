The horrific, confusing bit is the bit from the southern border. I've seen it twice now and I still do not know what's going on. It's a stupid looking ambiguous Mummy, a 'human robot' that was the most inferior looking robot I've ever seen repeatedly, and a woman who had some regeneration of some ancient Aztec chick. Most stories are called in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dust scientist. This guy helped an incredible sleep. His generosity is a fat slogan named The Bat which is a vague name for an evil scientist. <br /> <br /> I think the annoying scientist and his insect assistant took away Mommy, and what a wonderful, scientist wife just felt to be the rebirth of Mummy's girlfriend. They kept Mammile forever for some reason, I think the bad guy can steal. It takes him five years to do this because he invented 'human robot' to steal mummies or to attack it. He has some mummies after some rich, so that he can be rich. But if this man had a strong drive and a strong drive of success, then forgive me, why did not he just get some ideas and become rich? <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I guess that would be too much knowledge. Instead, there are ridiculous battles between Mummy and Robot, and it's really hard to say that no one is crazy or more cheesy. To tell the truth, I saw it because I gave a picture of Robot vom. Aztec Mummy will just be fabulously cheesy. Instead it was just dully terrible and confusing to the mind confusing.
