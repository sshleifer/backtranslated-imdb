This remix is ​​titled "The Dwarf Cat", but D.C. The cat has a lot more symptom than the main character. Patrick Randall was not very fond of this remake. He reminded me about the high school Goth Jhankhukta that he had been angry since birth, so they started to open fire on schools one day. Federal police, Kelso was just right, but not as original as well. I think Disney is trying to create Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (her dark name) in a star, but they do not basically hold a candle to Haily Mills and Dean Jones. I am an animal lover and a cat lover and I do not blame the DC because the remake is even worse than the original movie. After all, they almost cut him off from the whole movie. All in all, a very poor rebuild.
