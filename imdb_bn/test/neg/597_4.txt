I've given this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons. First of all, I felt that this film must have clearly proclaimed and I hate it. Yet, it is my own fault to see a Christian movie in the first place. <br /> <br /> My friend and I rented this movie because it was interesting. Some say, like a spiritual war, behind the case, some tried to open the boundaries which make the monster in our world and the same way. I'm really interested in something. This movie almost hit the target. It was more like the goal, more than the target of the tree ... <br /> <br /> The main plot of this movie is that two couples have been abducted by a group of terrorists in the examination of abduction. However, because of their experimental ceramism, a scientific research has emerged from those who have claimed that couples can feel, smell, hear and demons to be able to maintain the distinction between physical and spiritual areas, and in the spiritual world For that. Clearly, there is no sense of taste in that state. <br /> <br /> This movie is very clean. They take this title seriously as men, when disciplined in bed, their women claim to look behind them because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Although it was a good effort, I think special effects are very good. Looked at that woman, in a word, sunny The wife was as obnoxious as hell, and everyone in the room died when she died. We hope that he will be beaten with a chair in the chair, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The message is one that I do not want to comment, So I gave four stars, because the movie is not blame, I am not a Christian and do not like such messages, and I came out. Leave a comment. My friend and I saw this movie similar to an episode of MST3.
