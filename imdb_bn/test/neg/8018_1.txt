Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. Some of his novels have made some truly amazing films ("Far from the Mading Crowd," "Tess of the Urbervilles", "Mayor of the Castries"), and I had such a high expectation. Hallmark-Hall of Off-Fame-Equivalent "Native of Return" has completely destroyed it. Cast was nice, photography was nice, but the script was frustrating and the direction was positively destructive. People said to the people, went to the people, went away. Clive Wayne and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very nice) were very excited to exchange some meat, but Clive, who was an outstanding actor, could not save it. This was horrible with the background music of "normal" romantic "string" strings and pretending plot exposition bappins, and dynamite could be terrible. The above three films were missing in the absence of prosperity.
