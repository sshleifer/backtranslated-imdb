And you want to be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as 'chain in women', is similar to Trashy and Koppi B-Movie, which offers the proof. Palm Gray has been jailed on a small island with many other women, and this place has created a summer camp where Martha Stewart is locked, now it's like a maximum security prison. The movie does not have five minutes that the hottie guards are the line 'Strip' and 'we go' and then we are introduced to a prison life, which is the imagination of the young man of a college, like the inside of the hometown. <br /> <br /> The prisoners are soaked with soap, rubbed and fired together each other in the wild wild shoots of such girls, then they will be the best way to escape the open smoking vessels and open blocks in which they will discuss a large group . I have never been myself in prison, but I think the escape plans are something that you want as little as possible people, prisoners or guardians or any other matter. The biggest difference between the life of this prison and the life of some fantasy sorority is that women of this film have all the orange cardigan (and no pants. General prison teams for prison can not afford valuable things like their prison name or jail number. <br /> <br /> And it is hoped that a prison can not give the detainees behind the uniform, the detectors may not be able to find the guards who are interested in protecting the prisoners as much as they are in a sexual relationship with the prisoners. <br /> <br /> The headline of the conflict movie is that Karl Daniels (Pam Greyer) spent most of the time handling a blonde prisoner named Keane, as he escaped from the police after escaping from prison. I do not know the details of how I will run away, saying that you may have seen something that could not survive the collapse of a train at Foggitre, and it follows the counterfeit story of the conflicting interests, because of these two women. Both Karen and Lee are in the hope of finding their detained captives in their own gang, and the police are soon after both of them. <br /> <br /> Because the hippies involved in a bunch that they knew wanted to revolutionize life. Meanwhile, Karen just wanted to close the island, which she has been trying for a few years, and is it just not perfect that they have to go to the full opposite of each island to meet their goals. So we put together this weird couple and, because they are a strange couple, it is not hard to predict that they hate each other and hate each other, but eventually fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> It is not unreasonable to expect a climactic moment associated with rival gangs, in a film about many contradictory interests, especially when those conflicting interests do not promote two main characters in the opposite direction to follow their goals. Some point in the movie. Anyone who is not going to be dissatisfied, they throw a stupid gang at the end of the movie at the end of the movie, where each of them shoots machine guns, killing each other, when two women paddle safely and quietly across the river in a small boat. I'm glad Even better, at the end of the film, after the massive massacre, many people shot and spread bright red all over the place, the police captain watched the dead crowd, criminals covered with horror, horrifying special effects. , And we learn that he'll be a Major before dinner. Ending the film is not a bad way, criminals kill each other and the police gets all the credit, but what is the last line of the film here? 'Like to win, is not it?' <br /> <br /> Why is Captain promoted to the rank of Major? Because he figured that ???
