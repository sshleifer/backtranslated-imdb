I thought it was an incredible boring movie! I can not say Director Director French and so he does not say what his actors want ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is as great as normal, but I can not say the same to another actor. They do not have a lot to say, especially the Bruno Tuschinese. <br /> <br /> They all seem very tired, one of the film's plot: living abroad, tired of being tired, their lives in general; So they spent half of the movie sleeping in a hotel room. After a while I felt myself asleep ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4 for the last 4 beautiful scenes.
