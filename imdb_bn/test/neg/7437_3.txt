This was okay, but really a little disappointing because I expect more smiles. Considering the storyline and the main actor (Bill Murray), it should have been much more fun than it was. The only part of that really made me laugh, as when Murray lost control of his half-control and increased speed on the corner of the strange corner. (You will see it, it is grateful.) <br /> <br /> There was something other than supporting cast. Just look at the names sample: Matthew McConaughey, Genne Garpholo and Linda Fioranto. Yecch! McCokone's role here as "tip money" was simply a bit annoying. She was the worst. <br /> <br /> There were some charming moments in the movies that others did but it is not recommended as a whole. This is another Disney Flop.
