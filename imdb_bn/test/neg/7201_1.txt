If this is possible, I could give sorry for this moment for a zero star. It was by far worse than I saw. It was a movie movie that some annoying high schoolgirl decided to mock. "Acting" was horrible. "Actors" do not even react to the fact that they are being killed. <br /> <br /> True, I bought this movie by mistake. Spanish title jeeps crypts 3, so I thought I was okay it would be right. Wrong It was honestly the worst. I did not get the stupid movie last 20 minutes. I ran through the chapters and never seem to be somewhat interesting. <br /> <br /> Cameraman was also terrible. It was like a home movie. I will not recommend anyone watching this. Terrible terrible moronic movie.
