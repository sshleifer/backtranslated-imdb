This is not a comedy - I do not know how it was marketed. As a serious movie, it lacks any kind of substance. If you need to fix your Sunday or if you need to fix your Noah Sunday school, you may get annoyed with tears. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lorraine Graham plays an empty housewife without any real depth. His kids really do not add anything to the movie. They initially seem to be completely annoyed with their missing parent. Jonah Hill is not a wonderful internet addiction that comes off as funny. <br /> <br /> I found the original movie. Frustrated that this one does not really go anywhere.
