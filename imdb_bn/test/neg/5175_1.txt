I'm generally a big fan of British movies but especially gangster movies. Unfortunately this picture was suddenly bad. I feel that this film has received no good customer reviews, its superbly depressing. The idea is that this image is reti and realistic funny. I've read and heard the handwritten hand on real life events shown in this movie and almost everyone has been glorified with leading violence. The only real life of life in the whole film life was truly the Range Rover killer, where some overbown bouncers got out to rub for messing with the people they could not manage. This movie is disrespect to British movie! It does not have any plot and no suitable acting and it depends on the violent (reliable and realistic as some people want it to be). Such filmmakers should not allow people like this to be like budget or movie cameras, no consequence regarding this image should not be given the opportunity to say this kind of violent little story.
