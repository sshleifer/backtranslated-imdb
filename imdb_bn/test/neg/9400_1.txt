Yes I really found this film boring. <br /> <br /> I do not like the character of Sandra Oh, he really bothered me. Because of the miraculous truth, it will not be acceptable in rural Italian life. This PC was a bit of a surprise. <br /> <br /> The Italian men are also invasive. For example, a man (Deeen Lane) becomes a hog associated with him. But guess: Ultimately, you usually become a lot of American brick-heads, all the chessy white smiles and tones, and finally she searches for what she wants: a real American man, and now she has colonized the other part of the world. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is quite racist in the imagery of the Italian, and in the same way, they love each other as deceitful Lutherius or backward peasants. <br /> <br /> Photography was good but the film and its attitude was trash.
