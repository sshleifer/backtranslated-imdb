<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the worst English in English (in recent years the English movies were all terrible) Ireland made at least commitment, with Bravehart and Trentspotting 2 Films took place and Twin Town of Wales, Zulu, in the last day, Dolwin, Torchwood, Doctor K, and Milk Wood. <br /> <br /> The comedy is drawn by numbers, the actors walk dead people because there is no characteristic and there is no originality and it is so lazy <br /> <br> England is not giving any answer what the Northwestern answers are! This is an old class system that destroys English movies. The unbroken clinched scripts make clear that the Oxbridge graduates did not live with the working class. It's kinda. Monty Python was not funny, there was nothing from oxygen. <br /> <br /> Give people Johnny Vegas and Peter K, Rob Brian, Billy Connely or enter your own conversation and forget to work out the old failed class system. The class genius and the system take the writing accurately through the system, and how will the British and English film industries reopen next to the Prince Edward's modern day Oliver Twist?
