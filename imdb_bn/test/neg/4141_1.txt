After the disaster after 1988, GJS Amitabh's films have lost the quality before them. <br /> <br /> Apart from being the main Azad released in 1989, which was a great movie rest, all the pictures were Humayan (1991) In 1991 [b. <br /> <br /> This picture is about 90 people in Amitabh's film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> This picture made Shashi Kapoor as a friend, who did the film and did not take a penny. Rishi and Dimple (again not competing against each other after Ranbaam) <br /> <br /> The film came in 1991 when 4 children were released and 3 flops among them were Indrajit, Ekla, Abhoba. Both Tahawafan and Jagadogar were denied, which came to Azua after two years. This is another kind of shit. The child wears a mask and a crisp garment and can change the witch to 1 donkey instead of donkey. Special effects but very bad to watch the film <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor's direction is not good Mussi is bad <br /> <br /> Among actors, Amitabh grew very old since 1991 and looked tired, But it is not compatible with her best sage, Dimple is right, the rest forget
