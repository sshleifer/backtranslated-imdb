After a long night detachment in Islington's Walkout, I needed a pick-up. My throat was hurt, my pattern was empty, and I tried to sell some gasoline, chatting with drug addiction at a bus stop. Today, I have seen "red gold" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than yesterday. Brigitte Nielsen led a bunch of assassin-kick fighters in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queens not fully explained from some evil queens. Yes, it's good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, before the "Lord of the Rings", the best sword-and-magic film Thinking of George Lucas' kiddie-friendly "willow" Probably, in this film, this film will be a little easier. But I can not do it - it has been written badly, has worked badly (except for the exception of Paul Smith, which is only average) and terribly united Confirmed, dress and visible scenes, like an episode of Film Flintons, were taken straight out of Bedrock. Considering the comic book source element, it is easy to forgive different plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja stresses to save the most annoying child, in this world or one of the rebels. His personality seems blurred from the humble gentleman to the spoiled brat at the flick of a switch. Schwarzenegger shows less charisma than a full-grown field and moves through motion, a perfect actor for his successful role in "The Terminator". <br /> <br /> It's easy to take a look at a movie when you're down. Actually imagine that this is not a good movie, but by any side of imagination. When Nilsen expressed condolences for his sister and Schwarzenegger's death, to comfort his arm on his shoulder and then in Germany, "he is dead", differently, then you know that you are on a rough ride. While sending a rush to death in a hole in the field, the priests of the temple raised some laughs in inappropriate things, they began to experience - at least, judging from the fierce moon which was almost reflection the place. If you do not have the screen, you will see eight fantasy movies, but see "Willow" (but do not accept it as a ringing induction). For the real thing, go to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson a great job with "Lord of the Rings". Believe me, 11 Oscar really means it's a great movie - bloody "Titanic".
