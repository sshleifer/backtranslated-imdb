Like other comments, it might be a surprise to those who did not see the work of Junkett and somebody or Amir Casturkica. But you have already seen Delicatessen, there is nothing new in this film. I thought Delicatessen was great when it was great, but this film would be too late to reach any interest. I do not think it's a bad movie than Delicatessen but now it's a sister to see, as it would be to see Delicatessen again. There really is no point in film, nothing that really matters or with you. There is a remote connection with Kushturika movies, but she is actually in different leagues, so you have to watch movies instead of spending her time in the movie.
