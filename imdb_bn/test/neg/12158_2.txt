I saw this photo a few nights ago and it was awful! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Some actions have been chosen to cut away and unknown parts of the picture! <br /> <br /> The terrible mistake - the whole 'spiritual' aspect of this movie was a joke, and last time I did not see Guinness Khan, really nice guy! <br /> <br /> Actively played - I have found several letters to believe, they were two-dimensional and lack and depth! <br /> <br /> There was a favorable preservation of cinema photography. That's why I gave this photo a little more than 2 star ratings! However, if you want to see something nice I would recommend buying a picture instead! <br /> <br /> In these pictures, I waste time and money! Please feel free to yourself and miss this Mongolian turkey!
