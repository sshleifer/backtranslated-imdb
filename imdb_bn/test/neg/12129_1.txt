John Waters gives back my life 2 hours. I saw a snack preview screening in this way back in 1990, and I still have pain. Do not burn before or after the terrible pieces of cinematic waste spread over the screen. I can not say anything about this picture Acting - Awful; Plot - ridiculous; Music - Cruelty. Following the movie, my friends and I wanted to get back the money from the manager of the theater. He explained, because it was a free screening, so he could not give us anything, we could not endure any kind of pain. How to escape Johnny Depp's career?
