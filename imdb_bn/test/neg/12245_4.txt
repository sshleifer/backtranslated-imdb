Spuff films have come so far that Mail Brooks' producer (1968) said, "Do not be fooled, do not be fooled, come and join Nazi party." This is our 'Young Frankenstein', 'Airplane!' And even came with fun movies such as 'Cash Music'. But the good young man died. Thankfully, this section was able to handle it until the end of the 90's. And then ... Wayan's Brothers Unleashed The Apocalypse: 'Scary Movies'. Suddenly the sound sphoff was an innuendo for the weird sex jokes. Since then, most of the films have been claimed to have been spoofed, 'Dick Movie 2', 'Data Movie' and the movie followed suit with the film to stop 'Epic Movie'. Of course, there has been some relief. There was 'Shawn of the Dead' and 'Hot Faj'. Ferell became spoofing a vehicle near every sport imaginable. Also, Wayan Brothers gave up 'horror movies' and they were created by reliable Zucker Brothers. Although these films are somewhat valuable in the rescue, this genre is sadly terminated solely by the former men's films, who have discovered that what an emerson is. Those who do not explore the word 'spoof' and cut and paste movies together for quick laugh No heart, no brain, just cheap glue. Sadly, 'The Comebacks' has been added to the list. Dave leads a team to win against Cochrane (who played in the Farrell as well as 'Ancharman'), against the coach (Carl Weeders 'Happy Gilmour' fame), who brought him back to coaching. Koechner has shown commitment as a supporter actor, but as a lead to this photo, he just skips the words. He's passionately doing a cold reading like he sounds too much. Also, Jokes about smoking comedy, which encourages the team to fail in the school's school failures and is then performed by the underworld police, it has been done before. Yes, this is a wonderful movie. But remember that even spoofs can have quality Give a dignified and sophisticated view of the characters in modern society. Also, reliance on stereotypes does not make us smile (who knows a movie with people in the gym-conversation gangster stereotypes (but not really, but you see), although I agree to laugh at least several times ... it was not the same. Among the football teams most of the stereotype was, including a Mexican, a kaki joke, a greasy guy, a scary nerd, and a mental Even the only woman in the group, who suddenly become tired and uninterrupted, has diminished to stereotyptical female humor, in fact, her character, as well as most of the others, has never been better, it is a sad issue for this film, if it is only dependent on silly sexual jokes. It was not, it could create something for yourself. Actually, this movie is probably 'Epic Movie' bespash The script of the script is generally great, even the championship named 'toilet bow', so the blast movie is dying. There is a movie called 'Meet the Spartans' (Stay away from this trend, now Boycott!) That comes out Britney Spears is a fool in the break. So those kids keep getting erections ... but people grow up. We need nutrition. One day, they will learn spoofing spoofing and restoring them. Hopefully, one of the heroes will be Master Mel Brooks, who is coming out next year, 'Gate Smart'. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 stars
