When you make a film with a killer-child firmly, there are two effective ways to contact it; You can make it as realistic as possible, build trustworthy letters and situations, or you can make fun by using it to laugh (something that is made of "Silent Night, Deadly Night", for example, equally controversial issues: a Killer Santa). Those who have created "bloody birthday" do not even do them; They simply depend on the shock quality of a gun (or knife, or graver or an arrow) of the goat in his hand. The results are both objectionable and stupid. The whole movie looks like a bad idea that ran through production (and then there is going to be free for several years). It has recovered a small bit through good performance from the kids, but it is made very sloppily. (* 1/2)
