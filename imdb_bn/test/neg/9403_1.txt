It probably could possibly star in the worst movie Al Pacino star. The film was not a real plot. It kind of careens in 24 different aspects. It seems that the aim of this movie is to see the Anonymous people from Anonymous. McConaughey's character is not quite believable in the passino premiere. So he won a few bits for an isolated client for a Shiite job recording of 900 services. Is that supposed to automatically satisfy an audience of his skills? It was just plain stupid to think. The trailer promises to show us how he likes the sure shot, but after going through the whole film, I still have not seen any skill. If you want skill, try to see the character of Robert De Niro in the casino, which is now a pity. At some time in the film, Matt's character chooses his winning team at a flip of currency. Anyone could do that. Al Pacino seems to talk a lot and Blabber's mouth is in your mouth conversation. I think the style started with a woman's graduation and worked for her because eventually she won an Oscar, but now I think it's just boring. She always seems to be sermonizing. He has done an average job of portraying a man with unstable angina (an upcoming heart rate), which makes it memorable for acting on Goddard Part 3, which he can eat in the elderly, diabetic mafia don Corleone, but other than the genius of passino, this film. Ren Rousseau Only simple eye candy for this movie. She keeps the shape and she shows off it in tight clothes across. This image is a plain shit. Do not waste your money on it. It is worse than the maternal love of gambling in the film.
