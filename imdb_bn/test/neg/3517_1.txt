This film is a very bad example of a fairytale story that tries to hide behind an "artfilm" mask, which strives to shock the audience with emotional depth and lack of internal conflicts (against women) for the lack of internal conflict. Everything in this movie is encouraging, from begining to Bell Tor to photography, acting, music, stories and editing. Suddenly, without any reason, you are forced to see the close ups of people in the countries of the "Charitable" aircraft on their boats, soundtracks are trying to convince you that this is a dramatic moment, though they are only on the way the local drunken funeral, one thing. Putting fully unmotivated rape scenes as a shock is a different thing, for which I absolutely have no understanding. This film is trying really hard to enter the artistic (Eastern European dramatic) films in a specific way, but there is a lack of neutrality, observation skills, and other directors' "souls".
