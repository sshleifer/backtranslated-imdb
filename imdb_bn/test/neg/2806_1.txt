If you are on the eastern side of Europe (or even in their armed forces), then you can think of this movie as interesting. I do not know why it's a comedy (sure, there are some funny moments), but this is not a good movie, if a growing official talks about the achievement of socialism in Christmas dinner for 15 minutes, and more than half the fun, officers are going to meet the girls at night at the office. Civilians are running, and amazed, one of the girls is a girl commander's daughter. The East German army was known for its offensive and humiliating service of collective men, and the comedy was originally portrayed with equipment or equipment for the production of a good film by the East German army and their time has gone. Despite this, the actors and actors tried to do some good work, but it only came to known introductions for East German TV and some small films. I will not recommend this movie to anyone, it was originally boring and very cheap.
