A paronid scientist makes a spirits by transforming the wolf into wolves, quiet, but very big gardener, to prove a hypothesis. So the ground starts at night and the scientist tries to use it to recover his credentials, but his disguise with nature is revolted by his former colleagues. Dr. Moureau, Frankenstein and the islands of many different Wolfman films combined together with a terrible date, folly, morality play. <br /> <br /> Although the film is good and thrilling, this film is not made very badly, and its time to watch as a horror film-making agent is interesting. The most crazy scientist is like a movie, it is a weak warning against fooling the maternal nature. It does not have Frankenstein's ability or intellectual challenge, but it does not extend its reach in any way. Acting as cinematography, is passable, and the film moves along an entertaining clip. Some conversations are completely ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and it's a b minus one. A wolf has some beautiful shots, and humor touches a smattering-from the film itself seems to take very seriously - this is always a plus for this genre.
