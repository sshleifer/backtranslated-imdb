Thankfully, I did not see this movie on a movie, Big Screen, just on a small screen video. I could sit through the film in film and see all the violence present in the film. After seeing the first 30 minutes, I became both frustrated and enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> The line of the story, very less understanding screen, frustrated due to the massive work of aggression - I still do not know why I saw Desu (the main character) in a raw raw piece of another person, its creature on women, He's gonna spend his tongue. To see how the picture will be said in conclusion, and this strange, what is the last summary of all these cruelty? Unfortunately, even though the movie is not annoying, I did not get any answers to the cruelty that I see from the beginning to the end. My opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh then there is Kill Bill 1-2, if you want more money with blood, then you can take a recent fight movie and if you want the previous movie there is a better title. . Then I will take more careful ratings from the Cannes Film Festival, when the old boy received lots of praise from the jury, I had nothing to say and only 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <br> I'm hungry to see something beautiful, consistent with real feelings and clear messages.
