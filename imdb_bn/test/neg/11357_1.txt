If you want to sit in front of this predictable junky film in a small part of your life. It fails in the first post by not being awesome or funny. It's a dust gray movie which I've guessed went directly to the video. Hamly in the acting of the cheek and leave an envelope taste in the face of the tongue. You would like to see a poor but still watchable recent gambling film clock diary. Poor special effects, school level scripts. Zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point. There is nothing in this movie, zombification underscores are not a worthy point. As a thriller and credible as a Republican convention, observers watching the Republican Convention will be a good example of a zombie movie.
