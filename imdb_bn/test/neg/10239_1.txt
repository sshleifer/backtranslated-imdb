I've seen different levels and film adaptation of Alice in Wonderland and it's going to take a really bad cake. My family bought the DVD uncertainly and even could not make it through the first half. I went back later and forced myself to see the whole thing (it was a Christmas gift for me) and was just scared. <br /> <br /> The only redemption factor (and it is fairly free to save the whole show) is Mark Lynne-Baker playing a moch turtle with a Jesus accent. It is a few moments in pieces that have some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously. Apart from that, the songs do not look good in half-songs, tunes, half-tone and even Meryl Strip.
