Positive reviews on this page are planted by filmmakers and their friends. This picture is actually every aspect direction, acting. If IMDB allows filmmakers to indicate what their films are about, it is a very sad issue. This movie has a marketable compound, but it has been made terribly terrible. <br /> <br /> The movie is intelligent so everyone has their own opinions. But this image is similar to Ed Wood's work, but without any charm. Otherwise it looks like the bad taste of the highest order. <br /> <br /> This is not a personal thing. I do not know anyone associated with the film. I'm just a film lover who thinks the reviews of this page are completely wrong and so I felt the need to balance balance and gave the film more correct views. It is made very badly and the direction is also below the filmmaking by numbers. Actually bad to be committed to film. The best thing about this movie is the poster and DVD cover art. It's not worth it.
