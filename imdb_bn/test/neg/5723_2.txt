Repetition: The warrior queen Graden raised and murdered most of the Sonaza family, so he trained in the war of the sword. Now, Grader has taken a very strong training, which threatens to destroy the world without destroying, killing Sona Sohan in this process. Now for gold vengeance, and out to save the world. Alongside the road, she also meets King's daughter-in-law Turner and her bodyguard Falcon with very similar to Kanai-like (but Canaan, no!) Kalidore. At first, Sonja reduced everyone, but later she was forced to take it, and together they went to save the world. <br /> <br /> Comment: When you see a movie like this and you think it's the story that is the best element in this movie, the movie is big problem. Because 1) Such a movie will draw his strength on the good sword and effect, and 2) the story is really, really bad. It's simple, and complicated and really provides nothing in the way of character development or even mysteries. It is predictable and annoying, and obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidar, there is no chemistry. And the child is just boring. And most of the scenes are painted so long that they become annoying. Although the movie is not too long, it does not have enough material to fill its time. And so back point 1). The war is slow, uneventful and really bad. It clearly shows that most fighters are clearly blocking the opponents, far ahead of the opposition, even the strike has started. According to my honesty, I believe that most of the kids fight with a stick, fighting nightmares rather than fighting the film. After all, it's a really bad spin off, which should be avoided by choosing the Conn-movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
