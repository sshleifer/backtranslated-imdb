(Be careful: several spoilers) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once, somewhere, a post is not created that is going to be a post apocalyptic movie. Unfortunately, postman is not that movie, although I have to give credit to try it. <br /> <br /> Kevin Coster credited as "Postman" only. He is not actually a postman, a treasure hunter on a farm in a devastating Western American devastated by some uncertain catastrophe. He performed Shakespeare and did business with isolated villages. Suddenly a pack called the Hostistes came down to a Westward self-proclaimed Wardards, a village of Castner's inspection and drafted their evil leader General Bethlehem (Will Paton) the Consensus. After many attempts to break a lot of trouble and the soul of Castner, he escaped, thus completing a long stretch of the movie which could be better called the three-minute flashback. <br /> <br /> We finally go to the head of the sanctuary: The fledged Coast ner has found a abandoned mail truck and sent a letter to the nearest city, hoping to get some food by pretending to be a postman. Several villages in the village, led by the young Ford (Lornez Tate), want to join the postman act, which can not sit well with Bethlehem and its bandits, and Cast Ner feels himself a reluctant and unintentional leader of Postman's band in the war. With Holnists <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Holnists depend on their livelihood that the villages they hunt were separated from each other; Holnists can destroy any village, but all their prey can not stand against it. To unify, the villages should contact each other and thus a mailing system would be a big step in keeping the holistie out of business. So it really makes a lot of sense that our heroic mail career will get medieval. Unfortunately, the last defeat of Bethlehem is not the result of the villages that come together against it, but your old standby cliche, one-on-one contradiction between him and Castner. Communities have no real effort to use mail to work together to solve their problems; All Mail Standard "Hi, Auntie Debbie" seems to be playing stuff for the most sensitive values. <br /> <br /> One of the most anticipated movies shot, shot for the shot, which I have ever seen. Now, I do not try to break the movie for myself by straining to identify what's going on deliberately. But here we are talking about predictions that have no effort; I knew whether or not I knew what was going to happen next. After the lion was specifically shown to feed the man, a Holistist bandit went into the bush after searching for a fleeing fort, and we were "frustrated" when the lion was feeding him. A bunch of abducted villagers were rounded up and shot in a firing squad, and the villagers heard some famous last words before shooting a shot due to a surprising lack. A covered figure was revealed exactly what everyone knew that was going there: To condemn Castro's letter taking a letter from the child of a vessel that we saw in the movie earlier. A man tells Bethlehem that no sir, you can not just take my wife; Bethlehem performs great mourning, though he is the only person in the theater who is helpless. <br /> <br /> But this is the status, closing feeling that actually hinders postman. Olivia Williams, playing Astie Abby of Costa√±ar, is the worst performer. She gives her very good efforts to pour into her heart's material and make it natural, natural and sincere. He tried very hard, it broke the heart. But no one could ever make the line "I have a gift to you, postman ... you expect that it is like candy in your pocket", but they are nothing like the syruppap. Another example, where a mounted castner roars in front of a little boy, ignoring his proposed letter, just rotates, looking at him for five minutes, and then returning to take the letter. Why not just choose Constanta for the first time? No real reason; It's just an artifaff that tries to make us feel happy by reducing the expectations of the kids and then retrieving them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Coming back with it, of course it is very sinister, even for this movie is very clear. " Even then, the music grew, and we started to laugh a little boy, because his letter was blurred to his first aunt, and I grabbed my head in my arms and thought, "Someone shot me." I think in my mind that my throat was broken twenty-three pounds of apple pie. <br /> <br /> General. Bethlehem is more humble than usual. Your value-issue post-apocalyptic villain is medium, hardest S.O.B. In valley. In Bethlehem a little bit of a person is not shown, who is trying to beat himself and think himself important. Although some dangers are thus sacrificed, Bethlehem is not credible for most revolutionaries. Unfortunately, Will Patton overacts And although it was initially said that Bethlehem had completely destroyed its last rival in the war, then the actual fighting skills of Bethlehem appearing at the end of the movie were absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> acting otherwise pretty good. Costner did well, but his Razzie was an overreaction. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larrynz Tate as Ford does a sincere and credible job. James Newton was able to score Howard's score, though the film was less for epic maps. But this image is not enough to save. <br /> <br /> Rating: * **** of 1/2
