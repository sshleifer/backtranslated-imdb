I own this movie. And it's very hard to find. It's a unique low-budget low caliber fix about a doctor seeking a perfect companion. It really feels fun less budget, and Gore looks nicely for a $ 500 budget. The director is demanding to be the master of Gore. I would not go that far, but perhaps during his time he was. Overall 6/10 Gore Chart
