There is a point in the film where the female boss of "death machine" (I think everyone is happy to say that this day is called a multi-ethnic trio for everyone) talks about the use of leveraging on a businessman. Just like her "leathers" sounds without her delivery. At this point these viewers began to wonder that this dull picture became a new corner. But it's not. The lady of Boss used to say that "Death Machines" do not say a word during the whole film and she speaks. Endlessly There is action in the film, but it is not exciting and one plot is another plot plot. Three silent "death instruments" survive to survive the other day at the end of the film. Hopefully there was not a signal.
