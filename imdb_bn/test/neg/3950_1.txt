Talk about false advertising! I saw an hour or twenty-five hour break and there was no retirement suit, there was no platform shoe, there was no dirty-finger dance, not a single discos ball. I saw it on Saturday night, and ended up with a horrific fever, but it was nothing to do with music. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie sucked with or without John Travolta. <br /> <br /> From the beginning scene, you will ask yourself the question, "Where does the rope come from, and will it leak me too?" From the unreasonable bias against the driving powers of Pennsylvania, driving from Alienware Laptop Battery's Unexpected Permanent Exposure to Expedited Campaigns, in the worst-case scenario, the worst movie to hit theaters from The Grudge.
