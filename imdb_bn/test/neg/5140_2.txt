Like the previous poster, I came from North Vermont, and I was interested to like this picture. However, from the "Red Zone Cuba" I have not seen such a delusional plot. There is no sense of things bootleg people do. Around the border, the gang pedal sent across two car covers. Um, why? Then they meet the two, and in the night, the luxurious packard goes to the secret place of the bad guys. - Does a flatbed truck just make two people more sense? Then, the target park parked outside the garage, four fell asleep! When they wake up and whiskey out in the morning, they must see and shoot them, and in the process, they lose some valuable things. Then the two runners keep the whiskey in a boat and float it on the border. Why again? I told someone whose big uncle was really smuggling in this area, all had to drive more than the US Canada Border Patrol, which was now part of the organization. <br /> <br /> Do not start me in the last half hour, which does not make sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
