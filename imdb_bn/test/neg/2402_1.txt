Spinner - This film gives away plot points and last discussions. I hate this movie - mostly due to political reasons, but also due to moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film has glorified war and military technology - made things real good. We composed music around music and the Afghans used our weapons to make Raski bits. And no US soldier did not put their lives in line - so this is a fun fight. Aesthetically, the real human emotion of the film can not be touched, it is only being drunk, privileged people do ironless, higher feelings, and results regardless of what they want to do. And to talk about the results, this movie only created few minor hits towards Afghan surgery. I read a previous draft of this script, and it ended at 9/11 - Charlie Wilson realized that things got worse. But the audience will not feel good. This is a good movie about killing Ruskies. And it made me sick.
