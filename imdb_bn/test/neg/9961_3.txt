A scientist (George Zuko) wants to create wolf men for wolf wars in the war against the Nazis, but branded as crazy. He used an extraction soil (Glen Strange) to test his blood mixed with a purple blood. Curious, continuing his conversation with Chaney Jr. of the "Mouse and Men" loan, there is no idea what is going on, only to sleep. Hunting began to start suddenly (including a little girl, which could be rather annoying to modern viewers, and Junker's rivals). It should not be messed up with human nature (it is common today) and God has some good dialogue about playing. The purpose of Zucco can be respectful, but his method is most suspicious. And then her daughter, Anna Nagel, who was weirdly beautiful, still has no idea of ​​her father's work. Johnny Downs is a journalist who has been asked by Zakko's bad side, but won the heart of Nagel, thus creating a normal and always uninterrupted romantic theorem in classic horror movies. In 77 minutes, it's about 15 minutes for a horror movie about 40's first horror (especially it releases one from the PRC), so the romantic story can be pruned for expenses and can increase slightly. . Zucco, fortunately, is not hammy; He went to Lagosi (who always panicked in a delicious theatrical approach) and went to Todd Slater in England. But while working in Jacob, do not try to think of "The Morrors of Brand" laboratory, or now some of Lagosi's conversations in classic culture films. There is a lack of "mad slow" worship as it is not pleasantly bad, there are fewer pens than just a few spots. For PRC and Monogram lovers, I would recommend "Corps Vanishes" or "Fug Island" compared to this
