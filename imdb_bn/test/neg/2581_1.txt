"The Patriot" of Steven Segal's late 90's Thriller / Action movie, which is not really an adventure and is not really an action movie; Instead, Steven Segal is playing Steven Segal in another name, but this time he is an American American doctor who once again knocks the butt. The obvious plot line hole barring, blatant disregard conditions for the character devolvement of the film itself is absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> From a marketing perspective, I went to ask myself, "What were they seeing in the world?" The Bio-Thriller plot-line for Central America's crowd and seagull is not like the way the ray cowboy will sell to anyone, even if you grind him deeply and keep it in a cryptic-cream donut. The whole movie is only for Seagal fans, because it does not provide any level.
