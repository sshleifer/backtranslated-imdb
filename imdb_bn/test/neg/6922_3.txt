There are dramatic releases anywhere in the world, it only serves as a reminder of the talent-free women's Dennis Richards and Milan Jovvitch career. This is a special grouting film, which thinks that they are smart, fun and original, though poor in every aspect. The whole blame could be written by Brian Barnes, who wrote and managed this potboiler. His script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes right nowhere with it. Without a terrible scriptwriter in situations, develop entirely without any internal argument. Characters are thin, stupid behavior and no real motivation compared to cardboard cutouts. Not far more than Mrs. Richards's inclusion. We do not believe in his relationship with David Krumhals' character for one minute, and after an hour's mark, he is brought back on the way to the game, especially unfortunate. Why is anyone an egocentric, self-obsessed, arrogant b ** f, read this for the first time like this, much less second time? Especially after receiving his ... true love? And if this film is not sufficient enough to sink this movie, then more than the central couple. The pair of Krumhalts and Jovvich is a bit more trustworthy than Richards, but it's not a good idea. There is no chemistry, there is no spark, which we can not accept as a trustworthy couple. Worse, viewers have no interest at the end of these two central characters, especially annoying and annoying, annoying and annoying. <br /> <br /> Overall, looks very bad. Even the hard-hearted Rom-less fans can achieve this, because dozens of movies have been created with more skill or more charm.
