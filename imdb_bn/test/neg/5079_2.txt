I went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honesty, Chaos terrible. There is absolutely no need for this movie - it should not be done. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to read the spoilers, do not read this review because I'm going to give you many addresses here. <br /> <br /> First of all - opening scene. This is a big event that made two half-lead characters (Steatham and Snippets). But it's annoying and disgusting. Just to the end we see what actually happened and till that time you will not take any more care. Also - this whole incident, where a bad guy and his hostage die, is not enough news to register a significant number of films in the film. <br /> <br /> Then working in the bank - it's' get off ground for any second. Bank robbery creates some essential references to chaos theory (which has nothing to do with the whole story). The way of calling Statham very desperately 'desperate', but more annoying. Then what is happening in the bank is strange and meaningless. - Have a security deposit box. There seems to be some plot, but it is not. Why do two people have to go through the difficulties of strings, when it goes? It involves a lot of preparation and it is used for nothing! - Why does not he hear the responsibility of the swat leader in charge of standing? <br /> <br /> <br /> And it's just 10 minutes. It keeps getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> - The whole romantic / romantic love story ('he was not just a good cop, a good man to finish it' comments) is painful to see. This is just why - Statham's character refers to the change in location of the footage camera reviewed by the bank. It basically finds 'Virus' which will get all its money. Why do some people have to go through difficulties to sign and kill, but then do not kill the person who can identify you. <br /> <br /> I can go for ages (truthfully), but it's like this movie ... unmatched. The whole script is a mess. The 'smart' references to chaos theory are really ridiculous and quite kind. The plot 'twist' is seen from miles away and main characters seem to be wrong all the time. It is really painful to watch a movie where audiences are accepted for the Crocking People, in which the director hopes they will not see all the plot holes and extra ridiculous scripts. At the end the 'interpretation scene' only adds insults. It really is not really a good movie. Anyway <br /> <br /> Those who come to see an action film do not get what comes for them. Those who come to watch a cop-friend movie do not get it. Those who come to watch the smart thriller do not get it. Basically, everyone gets the same - a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. Make yourself a favor and avoid this one.
