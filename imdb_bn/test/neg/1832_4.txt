First shown 6/24/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): Well the thriller, but a little guessable. This story is based in Germany, where the movie is made. It comes to seeing a young medical student getting a shot to go to a Premier School in Heidelberg and to see some strange events happening. Anyone who visits the train there in there and save it, shows on the school's test table and she is suspected to play foul play. He investigates some and the invisibility of his friend leads him to a secret society called AAA (and it is not Alcoholic Anonymous), which has something to do with the Hippocratic Anti-oath and is used to test live people which the doctor wishes. T will generally be able to. He found out his grandfather (who was a dean in school) and it was a big part of the establishment and it is very easy to fill up by the school's members. This is a funny story, but the problem of this movie is how fast it is to tell the audience what is happening and then it beat the bad boy of the heroin group, which is taken to the next psychological level. Although the film was made in Europe, it focuses on the firmness of gender, sex and horror films (which is a really big fall) in a play to a young American audience and explains why it probably made good money and made a signal But did the 'essential for a good movie.
