I was looking forward to seeing Bruce Willis, especially since I was younger when I was young <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take very good stories, and it's an inexpensive American law enforcement system / Unmute it until another campaign of military VISA is in the camouflage campaign. (Russians .... no sad cold war ends, create it with Russia) VS TERRORISTS, perhaps more than 50 other movies. In addition to <br /> <br />, it treats its audience like a bunch of idiots. The choice of weapons is good, ridiculous, do we believe that the world's most horrific and experienced victims / terrorists will choose to elect this election? <br /> <br /> The whole point of the original story was the dual dual responsibility of the intellectuals among the general intelligence and the professionals who run a ruthless but elegant plan to reach its goal and then go away. Survive anyone We all exhausted American American CIA / FBI / Army vs. terrorist terrorist plot, we all saw 1000 times before. <br /> <br /> But certainly the MBA of the Film Institute has realized that here a new intellectual angle will lose their earnings from the gang during a little attention, so the answer is ...... Bruce Willis, a blast and a rural plot. American Americans will not be able to associate a foreign president with threat (where the map is later in France) so it is American! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
