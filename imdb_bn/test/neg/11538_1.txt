This movie can not determine what - a soft porn or an SF movie. There is not enough plot for a real movie, but there's a lot more way for a porn. <br /> <br /> In a galaxy far away, a good prince (we know that he is good because he has long blonde hair, white white, when we see him first, the godly and fascinating moon about his maternal death is impressive) Sister, who is evil, has got the kingdom over (and we know because she has dark hair and she's wearing too much makeup, her male sorceress has abused her, sneers and Lip curls all the time, and she discusses horribly when she will quench the queen). The evil princess gets upset and tries to make a coup, but the good sister gets away in the world. Of course, she materializes nude nude at a bar during a wet T-shirt competition. It really goes downhill from there. Acting strange, like the words of the document it was written for a porno, and the general story is ridiculous. It does not even have enough skin to make the type of person want to see it for the skin. I love the "good" bad movie, and it's not even enjoyable at a "bad movie" level.
