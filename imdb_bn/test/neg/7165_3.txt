I like some of the characters, but our lead relies heavily on a ridiculous smile. I do not care about her two whits. I do not really care because he likes the bad and does not really feel like he does. She looked rather senseless. In some moments, some people were given the opportunity to have insight (Vell's view was interesting), but they were lost in the general ridicule of the film. Love interests were acceptable and other different characters were lightly attracted, but the plot continued to spin too much and allowed me to neglect many points of the film. In the end, I was amazed why I have lived so long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I could not fathom the higher rating of the film. 3 of 10
