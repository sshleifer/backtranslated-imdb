Geoffrey Wright, director of "Romer Stormer", planted "Macbeth" of Shakespeare's contemporary, criminal underworld at Shakespeare. The result is a semi-terrible piece of movie Sam is Worthington Macbeth, and very self-aware and walk around looking for bored. Written by Wright, Writes Victoria Hill, Lady Macbeth, and she's not terrible, well. Macduff is the acting actor of Lachi Hulm, the only actor to extend any authority. The rest of Gary, including sweet, are wasted and misdirected. Late Will Gibson has no shot in HD, film scenes. Everything is very clear and very deliberately ignited. Wright's direction is uninspired in the extreme and the sequence of actions is confusing and inactive. Falsely marketed as "The Greatest Felonious Film of All Time", the film is violent and rationally bloody several times, but it fails to have an effect. Slowly moving and horrifyingly inspired, the nineteenth silver screen version of the classic game is a mis-title personality.
