This is just one of the movies that cries you and I want it to end. A lot of problems and a few good points. I think the main issue of this film is the amount of a Chess Plot and it is trying to create it as an epic film, which is not a epic epic about super evil monkeys and smart sings, it is not epic. Cheese When you have cheese you make movies more fun. The final scene with the supposed, monkey and laser was very nice to see and there was a need for some more of that nature. Instead the actors are doing serious things that you think this movie is just a serious plot trying to set up the film. The plot wanders around a woman who tries to find out what happened to her missing ex-husband, and searches for some kind of legendary diamond. He used these two people who gave an app training to sign language and now want to return to the flood to enter the country and start the medieval adventure of life. To make this film a bit tolerant, only the character of Hodson and the laser attack at the end.
