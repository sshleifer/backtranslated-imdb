This picture has some flaws and most of the errors are happening. Perhaps the greatest movie to show the horror in the fly-over country, "Rolling Kansas" is a movie that will not happen, and you are not worried about anyone. Life is like, it starts, it moves, and then it ends. Curiosity is made some efforts, but everything is very flat. Occasionally, Kyoma reminds the viewer that they can not do anything other than a rock song bought by this movie, and can use it with each single event. Please <br /> <br /> for yourself and see good pictures. It's free and frequently in a comedy center because no one can see it, nobody wants to see it, and it is a little better than dead air. Do not duplicate with unexpected praise, but the movie's worth listening to a rock song. Very bad movie observers are not worth it.
