All right, this movie, I've seen the worst show for several years. The actor was not bad (I did it a B-movie so they are acting in B movie). Anyway, I saw this movie, thinking, oh cole is a UFO sci-fi film. Wrong It was an excuse for the Christians primarily to push a message on the people. The last scene was highly messed up. It's a terrific thing with a person to believe in something. Does anyone believe in opinion is a matter of fact. This movie only shows how contaminated religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a B-movie, it's not. If you want to see a movie that tries to block the public in the brain Well this kid is sorted out. Go right for it. If you're going to publish a message, do it, it does not force it. Wicked, people will abuse the degree media such as. Especially, Christians.
