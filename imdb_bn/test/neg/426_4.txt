Jeff Spacman has really made it look like martial-artist-acting-actresses (not less than Don "dragon" Wilson) and "The Expert" did not make it with the vehicles, so you can see why. There are three main problems with this movie: 1) Plot - or I can say plots - there are all the characters, which sometimes get screen time but serve a little purpose, 2) There are only 4 battle scenes, at least some of them The main plot and is not entirely related to some space in the dark, 3) Music scores are excessive and overbearing. It seems strange, this is really the most annoying thing about this movie: The score tries to convince you that instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are actually watching, what type of grand episode you are watching. That said, at least James Brolin has a touch loan of credibility closer. * 1/2 out 4
