Jack Bender's "The Tempest" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". During the American Civil War, Bender transferred from Medieval Italy to Mississippi. He included the role of revenge on slavery and war. <br /> <br /> Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper, is not the Duke of Milan but Mississippi is a landowner. She learned the Voodoo magic from a female slave, Mamla Azaley. He rescues his son Ariel, who thus takes her into exile. The island is located in the sea but is not situated on the bottom of the Mississippi river. There is a friendly hunter, the so-called "Gator-Man", who later tried to rape Prospero's daughter Miranda. During the civil war, Ariel wants to join the Union Army to help fight the slaves. Prospero does not care about fighting. He is only interested in his personal revenge for his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookstore Wiley Gonzo (Gonzalo) tried to cross the river, Prospero raised a storm. Union soldier Frederick swims and finally comes to the island. She and Miranda fall in love with each other but Prospero will not accept that. Meanwhile, Ariel Prospero became a hot, he found that Antony insisted to cooperate with the union, but he planned to betray them. Anthony and Gonso met Gator Man in the swim and swore against him against Prospero. They kidnapped Miranda and Airlle, but Prospero made them feel secure and helped the Union defeat the South Army. Eventually Ariel Free, Frederick and Miranda are bound to get married, Prospero comes back to planting and Gator Man returns to the island. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper firmly and firmly. Rather flat. The background of civil war was not a bad idea before tempeast, but the director was probably too much risky. Some parts seem to be stories or ridiculous in the story. For example, Gator Man is displayed only without any explanation. Prospero needs to be kidnapped to bring him to his mind and has lost confidence in his power that Bender tried to make Prospero more human, but only made him a weak elder without magic. Prospero's key authority and knowledge are not clear. <br /> <br /> ------------- Part ends 1 --------------- ----------- -
