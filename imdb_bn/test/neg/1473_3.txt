I love the documentary They are in my favorite style of film. Before looking at this picture, I did not see what I did not like. <br /> <br /> The basic principle of this movie is a great one. The execution was executed. I was laughing and smile some time ago. Still the film has become more tedious and excited. This thing could have been so special that the matter was so neutral, child, unknowable. I appreciate his passion for the film, but your whining exits. If you are short on the fund, you may not have many children, or you will not have to spend so much money. Maybe you went to the film school, or at least graduated from high school. Maybe you should live life and attitudes and experiences that should add to your vision. <br /> <br /> There are many people who are interesting, funny and shocked. Nothing less than the crass to see this guy selected on any of them. If you want to make a documentary on a filmmaker, do not you have a movie maker China or Iran with real problems? <br /> <br /> Two final questions <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
