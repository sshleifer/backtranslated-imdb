I have actually been very bad to write this review - bad films always do it to me - but my liability, as my citizen's duty, anyone can warn about purchasing or watching this dangerous mess - a picture. Please, please only accept my word: It would have to stay away from one. It is so annoying and lazy, so timeless and unidentified, no known talent gathering such a poor excuse. Bart Reynolds? Destruction (despite his best efforts) Ice is rarely in the film, and when it appears on screen, its performance is so moderate and silent that it becomes crystal clear that the director, perhaps afraid of the Ax's strong determination, did not know what to do with him. Rob Lowe as the title character, so little screen does not appear in the Colisema. Mario Van Paibel must be ashamed of himself; Its performance, potentially in the saddest sense, is a joke. Of course, Satan himself has signed Mario's check for this photo. The plot involves all the music as weak, semi-baked and annoying (seems completely annoying club songs, literally, the movie continues to be the third third). The appearance of the film will make a person wonder if the director of the film is forced to wash the crack from his deck-taped pipe in one of the forgotten female characters, but it will also be strengthened. And if you are looking for at least, style, shoot-up-type violence, but no one here will find it. This movie, I assure you, I promise you, there is absolutely no freedom fighter! Please, I request you to, avoid this flick! Do not enter it and believe that its speed will increase, it will become better, it will become better and become a decent condemnation. It will not be. It's not It will not be! It sucks! Now, you have been warned, and now I can go to bed (this is 3rd - please forgive any flaws in this advice) - It is clear to know my conscience, because I have been my cousin to my colleagues!
