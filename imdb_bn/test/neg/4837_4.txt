And a wonderful start, a real quick start. It keeps you almost shy and waiting about. Unfortunately high adrenaline dries fast, but most of the movies are finished after the course. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame because these movies really have good ideas and many of them explores thoroughly. But that's one of the faults of that. Seeks a lot of things, it blends into a lot of things, so eventually you are confused to follow a plot or letter. It's very dark and moody, but it does not help a lot, if it's trying to fit anyway, everything in its story!
