Where I started, I saw it among its most frustrating movies, because it made a lot of money in terms of the point, but it was severely stuttered as stupid. Living in bed about a ghost spring ?? The first 2 minutes of the movie Fiction hidden in the competition, a strange detector of Dabmetics on a fabiene shows a black and white flashback of obese children and beat her with her tie. The bed in this story is supposed to set up because of how it is set up. Still, if you wanted to open an interest to keep people interested or send them away, but behind it is a way. Fast forward today, a married couple moved into an apartment with a friendly landlord and started unpacking their things, as far as everything is normal. Then, while hippie dip in a mattress one night, they realized that they needed a bed frame. The things here are harmful, why did not they bring or buy a G * D great bed frame before reaching there? We learn that the gate door opened in the first 2 minutes is not open, but once the couple realizes that they need a bed frame, the door opens spellbound. They go up to it and discover the old bed frame and decide to go down and their romantic days are stored ... or so they thought. The rest of the movie is surrounded by surroundings and is inspired by the bed frame. The woman is an artist, she begins to draw the dream she dreamed of, and the male is a photographer, so she starts working on her models as they are tortured or tied up. (Which has a gray hair and appears 50 years old, Yak), women are increasingly scared and discovering that she lives in that house once she is a serial killer and a murderer that brings to the end of the film. They kill friendly landlords (who do not give any idea to get the form of man to kill ghosts) and decide to leave Dos. At the time of packing, the husband aggravated the atta, where she was attacked by crazy fat dad and the woman started to open her head and the police saw her and took her to the mental ward where she killed some children who tried to hit her. <br /> <br /> If you read so far then you have to think a thing ....... why not just go out of bed ???? Actually, they did not say anything about the actual house to roam, so only the bed ... why not get rid of this evil thing? That is why the movie is so frustrating because it is a good plot and the actors follow the suit accordingly but there are more holes in the toll booth than the Sony Corleone. The couple tried to flush the city into all other movies, where the project "Oh, give this place a sweet opportunity" project is underway, so support for this is. Still, my friend and my friends who saw this film said every 5 minutes ... why they did not just leave the bed? Especially once they found out that it was frustrating a good time to set fire or something. <br /> <br /> It has one of the closest films in it, with plenty of bed scenes and a credible plot at a level) but the solution is so simple that you are sharpening your head at the end of the movie, how stupid married couples are? When the film's highlights spreads her legs to 50 years old model and her assistant tells her that she can not shoot like her. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 4 (low budget) porn people will love shows)
