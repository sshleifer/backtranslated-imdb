A mockery of this movie is a terrible attempt. Her attempts to parody different sports movies are half-baked and not all fun. <br /> <br /> Some things that should be funny - like the female ciker in India who always wear traditional dresses on her uniform - not really fun. The football team is doing research and gets good quality which makes the trainer crazy. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy to be a traditional harmful team was more likely through high school football training, as a spoof was really possible. This is a classic and trite sports theme. But lazy, the screenplay was very weak to stop it from casting a cast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />, it will not be.
