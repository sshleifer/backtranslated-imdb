What can you say after watching this movie? That is, if you have the interest and density to see it at the end. Surprising lazy stories, in annoying situations, where an American is equal to one-fifth or more Iraqi and boring dialogue. I think if this film is something to learn, then perhaps it's "Do not screw in the United States, or we'll come and grab your boots". Plus, this film really encourages and voted to kill foreign people in the name of war, and voted. I got the picture tackling chess pieces out of the playing board. Except, now it's fast and not so much thinking. And above that there is no soul to have any character; Then, you can care for them all that will happen to them. With no tastes left to fight movie fans, I would not recommend this to anyone. There should always be something more interesting
