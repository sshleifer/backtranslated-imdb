I have seen Cesi Kung Fu fight film. Taiwanese residents came from America instead of Sitkom. I have seen films making fun of myself, but this movie is in a fierce battle film that tries very hard with terrible actors, terrible suggestions and terrible music. I am deeply relieved for the music composer for this movie. It would be sad to be a composer who should confiscate the headline "Generic Ninja Feet Scene, Op 1" and when a Girl Head Verification was a back-up corner of a Girl "or Brave" helicopter flight, then the battle was over the scene. And the credit rolled. Those who actually used to laugh at me. If "special effects" were not substantially proven that it was a low budget, still only two Or maybe three crew members, probably locals who were needed for the Filipino economy, although probably good for saving money, movies have never been from this series, they even rented out the sequel for this movie, which was very interesting. It was not the music (which I hoped for half of an animated sergeant slaster from the pop-up from the GI Joe), but it ended It's ... I think it's really a plundering plot, but when the American Ninja girl throws it on Jackson's instrument and then unmasks her mask, I wanted to see him jump on the roof and Jackson threw him out to catch the girl. <br /> <br /> I think a movie has been the perfect punchline for this joke.
