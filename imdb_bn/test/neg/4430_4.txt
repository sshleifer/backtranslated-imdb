Through the Dickens wonderful book plot, this instant play adaptation naturally spreads, replacing an exotic location with emotional effects and drawings with early transits. This is certainly not the fault of the budget and the production team's fault, but you have to first do the question when doing it when there is no time or money to do justice. Michael Hardard's screw is very comforting at the start, he lacks the transformation ability, and he does not help by the lack of feedback by seeing the viewpoint. Other actors seem to have forgotten their line (John Le Mesurier) from non-committal (Bernard Lee) to be acceptable (Clive Marison, Paul Koppley). It does not even score points for effort, to be honest.
