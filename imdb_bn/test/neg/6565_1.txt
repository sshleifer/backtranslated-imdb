I am aware that some fans may like this movie. I am aware that the concept of 'searching for God' may be something interesting, but it is really annoying to me. <br /> <br /> The movie is just boring. When it gets a little bit interesting, it gets stupid. Come on ... Kirk fight against God? How do we get less? The first 5-minute camping scene is the only good part of the film, which is really great, but then, the film became annoying, annoying and nothing more than good music. <br /> <br /> Thank God we have Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk Marlow him).
