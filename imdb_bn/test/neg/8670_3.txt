Why bothered, ITV? The most difficult "profit" of the Manchief Park novels, and the Fannis must be the toughest of choice, but ... if someone goes with it, then the courage to reduce the authenticity of the book and rather the intricate soul. And for Heaven, there is the courage to throw Fannie, as he wrote: a famous, hearty, sweet, ridiculous! She should be as Mrs. Norris was not nearly as terrible. And what happened to portsmouth hack? Instead of Fannie, the disagreement between Henry's Fannie, the rejection of Henry's fame, the convergence of Henry's being a better person, etc., between the family and the family home and Mansfield heights. The complexity and challenges of the novel, why are they bored? It's out of me
