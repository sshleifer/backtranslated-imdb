You know, I was very surprised to see this movie. It was broadcast in a day when it was ill and I had nothing to do, I see it continuously. This is the greatest movie ever! But I saw my surprise. I sat there and said, this is terrible, but the channel did not change because I was so bad that it was so bad. Maybe it was a person who looked like survival or survival torch and Big Tom from the big guys, these letters looked at me, which was watching me. However, half of the girls were not bad, but if you want to, that's a lot better. Oh, and there are "Nigasas" and "Pajama Age!" <br /> <br /> So if you watch Nigger, bad acting, ridiculous (and terrible) dialogue, and two pairs of five legs tall and everything in between them, then this movie is for you. It's very good it's bad. However, I just want to give 1 out of 10. I did not keep 10 with the Lord of the Rings there. <br /> <br /> <br />! :)
