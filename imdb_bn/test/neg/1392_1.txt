Nowadays, do minority comedians expect their minorities to accuse and stay away with them? <br /> <br /> Carlos Menezia is not a George Lopez. There are differences. Seeing Comedian Carlos Mensia, I think he hates his own people. And even more, I think he was forced to pattern his show as the "Hispanic / Latino / Spanish" version of Dave Chapel's show. What a terrible mistake (Note in MENSIIA: Please do not make a "Block Party" movie, as much as I would like to see the cast reunion of Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Auveria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and "Zikica da Silva". br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is. Carroll Mensia also said, "If you get annoyed then very bad". It is not a crime, which is said to be taken to protect it and be accepted. <br /> <br /> Carole's Mensia goes further - he insulted what he estimate as a comedy. It's not funny, it's not funny. To look at yourself and laughing at the comedy, laughing laughing laughing laughing, laughing, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Find out what's funny and what speeds and more prejudices will not set - it's Until then, the show, a pass of Minden's mind.
