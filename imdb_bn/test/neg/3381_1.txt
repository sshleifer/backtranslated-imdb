This "space snippet" was stupid kind. I thought it was supposed to be an endless shocker end, but IMHO it was just a huge letdown. Joseph Campanella and one of the world's leading actors did a great job; Their performance is not such justice even though such a stupid end. How can it be finished by any review of the producers? The other comment here is not correct, the tongue of the tongue Vaghett came only in the second season, it should be taken seriously! Producers and authors could have been less creative with the end of the trial.
