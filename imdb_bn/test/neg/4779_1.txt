I want to say that this movie was not what I expected. Although I did not read the book that the plants could strike one whistle and then wait for the murder to take the dead body for the dead, this is the worst case with anyone. With the title of the ruins you think that in 3000 years any kind of deity or ancient creature or god will be criminal. This is like another movie Privilege, where you think it is the villain's biggest fear, but something like chicken was not strange. Just like the movie was, it made you wake up about the ruins of Mayan or Inka folk art, which led to the awakening and the old gods or people had no other agenda for this Quran or Quran. But the plants? Come on, can not any other producer bring the crowd? This movie will hit the 'B' list sometime for this movie. I would say that Gore was nice to see something, but it was not made for the rest of the film. And imitating the voice of a cell phone or a cell phone is too much to believe in a plant. I'm a fan of horror films, but I'm not a stereo typed fan, which only depends on gorget or mechanical effects. I'm going to depend on the great mystery and the next scene is going to bring for more mystery. Things were a good story line than this. Even the ring jumped me more, but the ruins were ... the use of a tree destroyed for planting trees to kill or kill the villagers. The villagers were just in the compound for keeping it in the air with salt and just can make a trick to end this pesky tree easily with a simple blow torch and many infertile meat-eating disorders.
