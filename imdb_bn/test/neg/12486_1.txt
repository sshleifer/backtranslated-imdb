I was a huge Jack Allan fan and he was disappointed that he only got a scene in the movie. This was my favorite scene where he seized a character's arms and pointed it down below. Unfortunately, on the opposite side of the ThirdSpace and the river of the soul, most of the workstation stopped the station. I do not care much for the poor people after the first three seasons and Sheridan is OK but Sinclair does not think so. I loved Lochley but he was limited only to screen time. If you like crusades or space wars, you have to enjoy it. Personally I can only give 1/10.
