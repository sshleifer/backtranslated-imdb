My wife and I saw it in the theater when it came first. <br /> <br /> there were only 3 couples, and we all went to the same time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It did not happen or if you did not rent it, you would really regret it. I'm really convinced by the vote summary that maybe there is something to do with personal taste.
