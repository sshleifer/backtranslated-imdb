The show is at least partially faked (pretending to be a reality, not a reality), which believes in me that anyone who encounters without a face at least is a fake part. <br /> <br /> Proof there where he is already in the boat, where the crew of hell rushing in the ship, before reaching there, it can be seen while reaching his boat. <br /> <br /> Playing an "ambulance officer" does not remove or release its shirt. However, they work in the way they work, which will not really happen. <br /> <br /> They parked the car park ambulance and did not run until the emergency gateway (which does not give any sense, unless it is not fake and is not allowed to go there)
