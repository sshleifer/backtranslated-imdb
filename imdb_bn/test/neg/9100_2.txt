Alain Renaissance has three parallel stories which are in the adult world with imagination and imagination. One of them is the operative Birdlow story, which a reputed architect tries to exploit people in the happiness of a group of people - their efforts only target its goal, after which she pins. He built in the same incomplete chateau, a group of teachers searching for love in more modern tales, such as the role of a female romance believes in the absurd beliefs and the cynical anthropoligist set up with his biggest quarrel to try to teach him a lesson. Meanwhile, a bunch of kids conceals the courage of Georgie Melis, like a prince, who protects a girl in the plight of the butterfly creatures and then brings the kingdom of love to killing the evil king. Two Primary Themes? Life is a fairy tale, and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> which actually sounds better than the movie Renaissance is such a director that often the idea is good or bad, but what is important is the exhibition; Here, the idea is superb but painful to watch the movie. Extremely off-the-lyrics, without an ounce of chest character, backdoors of glue patella - Instead of coneing your inner child's ice cream, Rannish Cakes enters the bucket of frosting. Add some French philosophy and you will get a strange diabetes Bru, which bubbles bubbles and does not bubble hard, but you do not have anything wrong in your stomach unless you want to regurgitate it again. <br /> <br /> Resnais is a risk-director-director, even at its worst, you can see that he is trying to do something that can not work with full clarity of action. I want to go home, he shows some real changes and manages to pull past pieces of boring characters and ditzy pieces by staying calm for a few moments to catch his breath. Here he reflects fantasy not only submerges directly into a fantasy, only reference to his baby room wallpaper. The biggest problem is that, in some way, she managed to make the movie more fun than the 80's pop videos, and Golden Era was even more popular than Hollywood music. The fantasies are beyond child rearing and stupidity, but the film (with nudity and prejudice) is definitely a target for adults, a goal he undoubtedly missed. <br /> <br /> However, he stuck closely with his theme and never got a backpadal. If there is anything, this movie is only impressive due to the ambiguity. <br /> <br /> - Polaris DiB
