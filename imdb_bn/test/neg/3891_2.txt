Lovely music Beautiful photography, some of the scenes are breathtaking and impressed. But the dramatic tension is lost in such a film which is so badly edited that it is difficult to know exactly what is going on. At the time, the dialogue is unconscious. Then there's Richard Gere. He gets into trouble who will be a factory worker and gets a farm job. We see dozens of sweaty and dirty farmhands of hot sun. Then we looked at the cord, and he just stepped away from Calvin Klein advertising. Another glamor guy, Sam Shepard, is finally supposed to be sick. But he looks great. Nice try, but it does not work. Brooke Adams works hard but he is lost in the scene. Real star girl.
