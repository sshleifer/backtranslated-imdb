If you do not like bad acting, poor editing, funny dialogs and incredible characters, you will hate this movie. If you like all of the above, you would like Mulholland Drive if you're a Lynch fan. This is probably the worst movie that is rated above the IMDB above 7.0. <br /> <br /> Outside Naomi Watts, you will be stern to find an active role in Muhland. Another woman went to the leadership school acting "Do not make your chops when your hands hide your face". This script was supposed to work with them. It is a wonderful fact that not all actors hold their heads in their hands. <br /> <br /> The images go inside and out without doing anything to advance the letters. You are a Hitman, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife and her cleated Pulman lover, a mafiiao type picture sitting in a dark room who speaks through an external voice box and referring to another host countless and tiring. <br/> <br /> It is not so bad that it can be managed for a considerable amount of time. However, the viewers confuse the viewer with no visual plot. You wait and wait for all the loose threads to come together and ultimately you will be disappointed. One of the most difficult things for a writer is to bring everything together in a believable fashion at the end of the movie so everyone can feel. One of the simplest things for a writer is to create strange characters and put them in a scene so that the movie is not fully connected and then there is a less coherent thread to accept it and end it eventually. Ask for surprise Lynch guesses which way SURRIRISE !! <br /> <br /> You know that you have a bad script while using dream sequences to create a feeling for you. After all, a dream sequence covers all sin. Do not dream about dreams. Something can happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> Editing isolated alike. Let's not just focus on good editing yourself. Most of this edited appearance seems to have the sole purpose of drawing attention to editing. "Look at me ... you see my edit ... I'm not gifted?" Oh, well ... no! This movie contains all the images of the worst and most spontaneous French movies. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so popular? My theory is another sign of the loss of our culture. Melodies are hard to compose so let's hear rap. It is difficult to follow the plot, so let's get upset with them. Let's pee in a cup so hard to paint the picture and it's a crucified stick. This is another part of our time signs and hardships of Mulholland Drive.
