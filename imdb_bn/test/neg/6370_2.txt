I was 6th grade and this movie was circulated in PBS during a series called Wonderworks. I definitely remember sitting on a sofa with the movie running down my face with tears. In the film Jesse, the main character, formed an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. One of the pairs died due to a very simple, but unintended mistake. At that time, I think this story is very powerful, because a serious mistake is a mistake in a child's fault, and so it will be very easy to identify a child to see the movie and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that hurriedly hurts. <br /> <br /> <br /> Last year, I finally tracked VHS copy of the show. I should probably get stuck with my memories. Seeing the show as an adult I was absolutely shocked by what this film was a casualty. My Girlfriend had a similar memory to the movie, and it was too bad how bad the movie was compared to her memory. <br /> <br /> Many adults probably thought that they were kids when watching this movie. I strongly advise that these people will keep their memory intact and avoid showing this film as an adult.
