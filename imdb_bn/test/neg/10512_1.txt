I hired to hope to suck this movie, and it has not been given to me. I rent it with some friends as a joke. But, what was worse was more than what we got. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is like a blade rip-off, Not available. His name is Vampire Assassin, but is not anyone killed in the tenant? Well, this man kills his own wish so that he is not a killer. <br /> <br /> Then, when you actually keep the disc, it gets worse. The first menu animation is off the hair. However, when you start the film from the set design, every thing in the light (or lack thereof) is terrible. The credit even suck when you know a movie bad. Acting funny The action is pillow. The text is elementary. And the worst of directions
