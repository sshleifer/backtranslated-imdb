I did not go out of a movie before this one. I will give this idea a few more times, but this time I did it, I entered the end to another movie, but while waiting for my friends, I returned and saw the end of the rage. They told me, I missed a lot when I left. I was generally offended by the whole film, in a huge way that I can not even describe it. My gosh asked me to come out of the theater. It was a gluey reaction to a terrible movie. Near the brutal action of some overwhelmingly adolescent youth around poor and disturbed people. There was no ray of light, there was no reactive or preferred person to provide reverse. I have seen that the "good boys" of the film did nothing for me, silly, stupid, white, or just plain ineffective. <br /> <br /> Repetitive, graphic suicide imagery overdone, unnecessary, and disgusting. (A "I have not found it easy" way, but more in respect to the way of humanity). And without the repetition of that scene, slowly, from many angles, other visual aspects, (attractive camera work etc) were possible, but sometimes it became annoying. I am a person who likes movies and tries to find good things about them. Usually I can find some good things for a movie helplessness. I'm not saying that this film was not good, but I'm saying that whatever might be, I can not remember it with another crazy that made me crazy. I'm really sorry about that. Perhaps the best part was the clip from the classic origin.
