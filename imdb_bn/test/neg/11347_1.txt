The first season of Hons is playing in Finland and I can not believe the bully on this belief - the letter is shallow, poorly guided and painful. <br /> <br /> This is a poor man 'CSI. Or in fact, the CSI without the added plot. Although Hoans have the potential, but failed due to the lack of managers, who are not able to find the summary of the show from the actors. It is really tragic that when throwing a program completely, it can be an enthusiastic event with only a thrilling thought. Get started to feel how painful you are from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Long story short - Do not waste your time in the bone.
