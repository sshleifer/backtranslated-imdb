It does not accept force to make the neutral people fun. After listening to Mencia, he claimed to be "boring" Jokes, brave to be brave. Also, it does not accept the ball to cut off the Chapel show. Ethnic sports, ethnic Olympics, it seems that many skits have reconsidered only the Chapel show show skits, which are just less fun. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about the event is his strong suggestion that he is moving towards his drum beat, when he actually does a lot of work, excessive beat drums. That has been drummed many times. <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate that it presents itself as a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And no Carlos, I'm not trying to annoy you. If people like it, then keep it. But I personally think it's a bad show.
