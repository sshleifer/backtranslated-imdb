The "experts" (adventurers, divers and scientists) took part in the underground role of a mile, and went on far more distant places under water more than 2.4 miles away, where they found Salamander, Giant Albino Moles (??) and some big, Fonded, winged, computer creation hidden about animals. The cave was sealed by a rockslide and then attacked the monsters and they started to stop killing everyone as they searched for exit. And this is that he wrote with this neutral effort that even failed to combine action, science fiction and horror at the earliest level. Imagine if anyone gives people to make the $ 30 million giant movie of Saipi Channel. That's exactly what happened; Almost surprising in its incompetence, the clich√©s are full and almost completely dependent on the special effects of the impact. The only difference was that they had more money to set up, those who terrible performance, however anyhow renowned professional actors donated and donated more money money more money Otherwise, it's business as usual. Some of these movies are still fun. This is the one and why not loaded: <br /> <br /> 1.) It takes itself very seriously and there is no humor in it. So you will find a completely irrational and predictable movie, which can not even recognize how unreasonable and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence does not use any purpose other than more than a few minutes of murder and is associated with unnecessaryity. <br /> <br /> 3.) Universal looking CGI creatures are not affecting anyone this day and age. <br /> <br /> 4.) Using Shakikam and quick-cut editing for your scary scenes will make you simply lazy, unimaginable movies. And why do some darker and blurred action by adding boring confusions such as fire and explosions of bubbles? It is not difficult to see these scenes, even on a non-Breeder action level it is impossible to enjoy <br /> <br /> 5.) Although it wants you to take it seriously, the script is not perfect for example, dialogue is awful and characterization. Bright scientist and serious experienced investigators can offer some eye candy to the scandal in 25-year-old model models, but it completely kills the credibility of a film that is otherwise completely operated dramatically. Sorry, you can not get it both ways. <br /> <br /> 6. Model rules had two exceptions, they decided to throw an old guy and Joe looking average. This is the first two letters were killed off. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a little variety, they shrink into a black guy and a Chinese man. Curiously, no voice is given in this film, and it basically stands in the background as its next step will discuss what is white. Insulting. <br /> <br /> 8.) In addition, when the white white female lead and the hot white male lead end up in the end, it becomes certain that the black character ultimately sacrifices his life? Disgust Let me have a break already. <br /> <br /> 9.) Most of the acting was superb. The performance of the Coal Hauser was completely ridiculous. Looking at the other man, he seemed to have gone out of the Soya opera set, and patents are looking at the ocean using the Deblebed-Smile-made-all-the-render-swine technique, which is equivalent to PG-13 gender-switches-equivalent to large breast-made- All-boys-incognito techniques are often used by women in R-rated films. Daniel Dae Kim (from the TV series "Lost") and Piper Perebo also tear the room out of their styled and monotonous line delivery. <br /> <br /> 10.) End a joke? Absolutely terrible Please God, we do not need a junk of this garbage. <br /> <br /> So basically I will not be disturbed, unless you have ever seen a giant movie before or if you are really frustrated and only the other thing is "simple life." The set was good, blue-colored photography is fine, and some of the actors (Lena Haydy, Marcel Areas ...) tried their best, so I decided to upgrade the rating to a "2".
