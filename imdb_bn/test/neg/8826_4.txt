It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but love the underlying message. Jaffrey tried to drag Shakespeare's Othello into Sax's modern day context. However, the actors were not quite confident enough to pull this off. There was an additional agency to protect everything from perspective, but Jon Othello, played by Imonn Walker, reacted a lot in the film, which caused the Kelly House, Daisie Brabant, and eventually the death of Desse died. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eicleston has played the main character of the film, Ben Jago. Dethin did not give enough evidence to cheat Othello, with Michael Kaiser operated by Richard Koel. Instead he congratulated only one person and gave him a reason why he "cheated". In the game, Ohelo was even more convincing than Ego to suspect anything. This change made this movie more about anger for the wrong reasons, which kept the book closed. However, there were some good points in the movie. This makes the scene of the army more black against the blacks, where Othello is the head of the police squad. These scenes are raging by crowds, and fire burning is credible. You understand the extent of racism in movies, more than books. This book uploads modern day scenes with a simpler understanding than Shakespeare Bar. Ego (Jago) gets tortured to the end, but in the film she gets her satisfaction and Othello's position. He never gets what he deserves, and even if Othello is not caught for lying, he is too late. I saw this film as a fall, because I think that villain has been given the treasure to promote false propaganda, and in the book, he has been found by Rodrigo. Overall, the movie can work better based on this play. I think some important portions of the film-directed drama have been omitted which have made play or play flow or it has done more to a tragedy. I would say that to understand all the events that happen in the movie you will have to read the book first, otherwise you may lose yourself and become distracted.
