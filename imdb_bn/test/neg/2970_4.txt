42/100. Often referred to as "Tarzan with cloth," but it is not in the same league as its superior Tarzan series. Originally, the jungle gym series became a Tarzan replacement for Jonny Wesculler, later he became very shaped for Lincolm. In the jungle gym, he is fully dressed. It can not be compared to the Tarzan series in any way, not acting, screenplaces or production quality. It's superb hokey stuff. This is the first of the series, and that's not saying much. Many more stock footage is used, and it is so obvious. The score is overdone, and the plot is tall and the production makes it so difficult to watch at times so poor.
