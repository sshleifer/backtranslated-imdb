Actually, I can not imagine what anyone can say about this movie alone, to find the one interesting thing, it will find it hard to find itself to write a warm congratulations in this comment section. How many methamphetamine Bogognivich was at the time of filming this film? Does he give the actor a bonus that will spread his lines at maximum speed and with minimal change or thought? The conversation is bad, even the plot of plot for "scrawl" comedy, and claims that this movie is a tribute to the classic film comedy which I have ever heard about the most incredible thing about Cinematography is the worst performance and innovation performed by TV films made by the worst movies, the act is terrible (though I feel that its fault is at risk at the beginning of the director) and who is saying, is the command that I am so illusive and unknown that the definition of this word denies it? The whole thing is very awesome (even worse-of-funny-fun clunkers), soul-sucking, waste of two hours of your life that you will not get back. Be afraid, be very scared ...
