I'm a huge Robert Taylor fan and I have been trying to find out all his movies. It was not mine, but recently I saw it in the FOX movie channel, and was very disappointed. I know that he was a contractual player with little control over his scripts, but the performance was as bad as the script. Victor McLaughlin was even worse, and Brian Donley was almost unrecognized. Considering the relation between closed bonds between Taylor and Stanwak, it is astonishing that the two of them were chemistry. But the fundamental principles of the film were so ridiculous that the US President had secretly instructed the National Left to search for bank robbers and only reported to the President that it was difficult to appreciate about something else. Movies. The death row view was completely unmoving. Stanwick's singer was one of Taylor's's worst things to do. He thanked the well off-of-fire thanks to heaven.
