This film is a compulsory, third attempt by the Moody Thriller and unfortunately fails in three numbers. It was only managed to keep my attention because the hero saw it slowly and broke all the lifestyles that set itself well in the beginning of the future. <br /> <br /> But in the last 25 minutes that thing really starts spiraling. Suddenly new characters are not seen anywhere, and random and surprising events are never explained. <br /> <br /> If it is scripting it will not be too bad. So very sugar, so acting wood (despite a strong British molding) and so uninspiring in the direction. This is not an example of a British film making, and yet its tenantino should not bat the eye pattern, at least not earlier than its previous work. <br /> <br /> If this is difficult to keep my advice in this case, do not waste the effort. If you're a brit like me and it's in your local video store, run it well. Perhaps the head of the video titled "American Beauty" - now it is an example of Great Britain.
