Creating a movie based on the real story, especially the incredible and terrifying 1972 Adi√°n air crash, even for the best filmmakers, it is difficult. But Mexican folks do not even try to fix this forgotten and cheap exploitation! The survival and survival of the Uruguayan air disaster, and the real names of the victims have all changed, the crash itself is visible in the slip-shaw method, and the cancer perspective has been played unnecessarily and minorly. Suddenly, a tonne rupee ticket was made on both sides of the border. Thankfully, they forgot forgiving, thinking. But the same person will also give us a similar rebellion: Rape victim! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This cheap horror exploitation rose almost 15 years later. That film was a wonderful composition. Be careful! It's light, not.
