I turned it off for about 50 minutes! Someone has decided to steal the idea of ​​someone's book (war royal) and it has been able to turn into a merciful reality TV show scene, it is worth shooting! <br /> <br /> It's a film industry. Better turn though. Now directors like William Malone (Fear dot com) can say, "At least it's better than Series 7". This series pieces and Dracula 3000 times are among the worst 100 movies! <br /> <br /> This should not be avoided 'so bad it's good' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a disgrace for filmmakers everywhere! <br /> <br /> I never see this movie!
