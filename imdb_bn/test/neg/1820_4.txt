Finding Jude Kisses in VHS is not easy (it is not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this movie to my Allan Rickman movie collection. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how gifted Mr. Does Rickman get into this middle-class films? Judas Kises boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and curiosity twists, but ruined what could be a great crime drama editing his weird visual wanderings and cutting. Many scenes seem to be missing important information to explain the character's action: Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his captain? Why did he trust the intelligence he replaced? There was a time when I could not tell the director whether director director Judas Kies would be a legitimate crime drama or a campfi spoof. Why would he toss in a helpless / alien / lesbian screen in the other two minutes (the slightest surprise that my kids were playing from the course certainly make me scramble for the remote!)? Did he intentionally refer to two prominent English actors (Allan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use the utterances of New Orleans so awkward? As Alan Freak, I acknowledge that I still thought Rickman was sexy: tired, tired, "taking him home and dragging him away". <br /> <br /> Judas Kies is not a great movie, but it has some great moments, but I do not recommend it if you do not try to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.
