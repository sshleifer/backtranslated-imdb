This is one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Eliot, Munro and Emile have been enhanced nicely and their interactions are exciting, complex and fast in this great novel. <br /> <br /> and 99.8 percent of them lost the movie. Seriously, screenplay and direction were awesome and clearly by those people who were not good at the novel. I can not blame the actors because the fact is, they have never had the chance to save this Turkish trick to the original work of Crickton. I have good novels, especially those who are familiar with science fiction, they are difficult to bring to life like a real screen. But this novel and screen adaptation can never be in absolute worst disparity between quality. The book is really really good. The movie is just horrible.
