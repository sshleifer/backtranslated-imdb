I experienced a loss to find the words to express how bad this picture is. Primary education was committed, but after all cases it was completely awkward. Let's run through the main points. Plot - good initial idea but really terrible development. When I thought that there were many points, "no, nobody would do such a fool". The last wondrous was anticlimactic. Characterization - Characters were all completely soft or diverse caricatures. I tried to think of a person who was probably not - perhaps mother, but that's it. Music - Insulation, inappropriate and usually terrible. Direction - complete amateur Cinematography - They have heard it. Camera angle / durability / zoom levels are often bad. I'm completely confused about how this film has scored so high. It was the worst movie ever seen in the movie, if not ever.
