When my girlfriend was away I rented this picture, hoping to see some serious military / expert steps. <br /> <br /> After all 10 minutes of watching this "movie" I was very scared and frightened and sick. In this photo I was ready to destroy the rent disc with a flame thrower. Thankfully, I can not find one. I've seen many bad films. But it's not even bad, it's a total waste and it's not even worth measuring as a movie on IMDB. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the people involved in making these total humiliation. Hopefully some Oscars won though:
