Two years after the film was created, "The Joure" came out. Do not waste your time on this one. See "Juror" instead. The "Jury" basically plays the same story as "jury by trial" with better acting, more good guidance and more trembling comfort about it. William Hurt was not convinced as a copper-bad, and if the Arman assent was wearing her dress, she could not be as ordinary as the public. You are not involved in the character of Joan Hallley, who will be annoyed with what's happening to him. Also, the way he communicated with the jury was not compulsory or interesting in any way. The role of Klelin Quinnlan as a hooker / killer was not enough to be wasted and it was not unnecessary for the plot.
