O God, why did I waste my precious time in this movie? It's unfortunate, Wamayee OTTi and Unreal, and one of the worst movies in my life. Yes, my life. I am feeling embarrassed for the film Yash Raj, the poor people want to survive with horrific news that yes, they have created this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I have never seen pictures of this far, greatest, trashy, sexual, eyebrow, Yash Raj Films. I cringe for them, what I really do Terrible acting by Ulli Chopra (or no acting), "Look at my book" meets the lack of talent talent, Blue N 'Nikki has no good things about this. Even the music does not leave the standard left by YRF. Director, Arjuna Sabalok, has done an embarrassing bad job here. <br /> <br /> True, I expected more. Many, much more
