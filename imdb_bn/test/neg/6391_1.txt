I did not want to write a review of this movie. Actually I just want to see the name of the movie star and then I started to read reviews ... I guess I will never learn. This movie is awesome! I'm not going to justify my comments with specific reasons because I really believe that anyone who likes it is really like that. A guilty pleasure? Okay, I'm guessing. But this bad movie that made the genius very well (Kain, Galbert, and Donne) is not a reason to mourn, but this is not a nice package. Probably a low point for anyone involved in Bogot√°, who would have to sit in the night to identify a bomb, the bomb of his career.
