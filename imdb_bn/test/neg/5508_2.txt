I'm Jess Franco's wicked style, and even his tryasiyara a film lover, and my personal opinion is that, its quite a few recreational films in addition to a few nice composition has been created, such as the brilliant "pyaraksijamasa" uka "Venus, for example, 1969's" Fars in ". However, it is an incredible fact that this highly artificial filmmaker is seen in 1805 films in his career. It's been a great time since 1981's "Sodomania" is certainly one of these stingers, with only a completely bad and uncontrollable film that can slow you down slowly and with nudity. <br /> < <br /> <br /> Nude gives you 20 minutes of entertainment, but it continues and like this it gets bored after a short time. This is what made me look at things kamatra snijera intensity, generously said, a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some of the islands of the bride, were lost in the wilderness, they stopped them. Gunman women's bodies, the local prison camp Warden Expelled from the island, but the husband, the wife was kept in prison, torture and sexual abuse of space, sad and disfigured myagada district is governed by the governor. The prisoners, of course, completely hot girl, mostly blondes among them, Woman women completely rifles carry women unhappy. <br /> <br /> The plot, if anyone can call it, is extremely stupid, but whatever is going to watch this for a good plot. The interesting thing about "Sodomania" (only) is the high level of absorption, even for the movie 'Women in Prison'. There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we are actually seen wearing a top woman, rape has all forms of sexual intercourse with rape, and some torture scenes are really bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is amazing that this extreme level film, however, can still be annoying. Sludge you see at the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes I did not get to fall asleep. It makes me wonder why, out of all parnographarera, Jess Franco ajita chose Wilson, who was born a man, according to most sources (well, perhaps because). If you really want to see it, make sure you have enough beer to sit in your house and look for it only for the puzzle and exploitation (and maybe a little unusual for fun factor). Expect not too entertaining, however, it's almost unbelievable how a movie with a high sleaze level that can be so annoying. I'm a Jess Franco fan and I will always be there, but "Sadomania" is just bad. 2/10
