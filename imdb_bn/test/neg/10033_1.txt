Thank God, I bought this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it from perfect curiosity, and of course it seems to be rewarding! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I understand that they could not spend most of the budget, but I swear that I can make such a better film than my pets! The acting was horrible, so was the performance, dialogue, everything was! It was so bad that when I saw it, it makes me serious! I look forward to the real movie about coming to this story so that people are not interested to see this curiosity!
