The essence was committed but the movie observer was a huge disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. Plot is linear and surprising. By the end of the film, normal letters are normal, strange characters are weird until the end of the film. To make the viewer fool, even the single instant is not that the bad guy is the most obvious candidate, except for someone else. In a positive light, the actor plays well and there is a small atmosphere in the film, but something very important can be. <br /> <br /> Those who voted for this movie also did not have 10 votes. See it, or a member of the film production team! 4 is given well.
