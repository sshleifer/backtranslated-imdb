I can not believe how bad this "film" is. For beginners, the film is related to the Big Foot legend and a group of close encounters with the animal. The foundation is interesting and gave a positive view of "helpless" caste (alliance) to the Last Henriken. Unfortunately it gets as interesting as that. It looks like a direct DVD release ... or so I guess. This is basically the worst edit (with a constant "black to fade" in each scene) a production-related relationship.) I saw and acted in my life which will convince you. Why this sort of Lancel Henrikinee is completely fathomless. And the movie takes quotes from "Blair Witch Project" (Video View) and "Predator" to "Alive" any other movie movie. It is based on the supposed facts, but only here is how the film is found in BAD. I'm not a strict critic and believe me, I tried to enjoy this trash but did not do it at all. Make yourself a favor and run clear from this DVD. I will try to keep it lightly: this movie is a real waste and it wants me to take my gun and fire the neighbors ... or ask blockbuster to return !!! <br /> <br /> More lenses, shame on you! 1 * 10 * out *
