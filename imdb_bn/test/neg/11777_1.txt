The type of description of ONDEMAND saw this piece was kind of weird. This movie picks up cocaine, only open scenes will cost at least five films in movie theaters. This is a racist, Homopo-stomach fragment which plods well with 1hr and 22mins well in no direction. I am a little confused about how this good review here. I will not bother telling you the plot line, because as far as I can say there is no plot. I'm sure every set has shown in the daily giant lines, as much as possible to show flapjack breaststands and necklaces to show wolf action; Letting the cast improvise into a cocaine frenzy. Like this real beer, this picture almost failed half way through my liver. Save your money, and instead see 'strange bru'.
