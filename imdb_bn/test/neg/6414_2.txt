I wanted to know how tragic and intelligent I was and 2) how refined the European / Asian movie is more sophisticated than its American counterparts. <br /> <br /> I saw this interactive psychological "thriller". Night after watching a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. Walter Sparrow's happy little family camera enjoys some quality around prison room inspection room tables (not to mention sponsorship voices to appreciate the attributes of "the right thing"), I was suddenly an epiphany. I just saw a movie that made me feel like I really wanted a beer when I was a glass of water. My thirsty was sated, but it was strictly utilitarian. This generation was mildly interesting, but the story itself has many "coincidences" (how do we explain to find her book? We just say, "... or did she find her?" They "buy"), grafting plot hole (Why does the winker take the skeleton?), Predictability, and mandatory happy ending, another Hollywood hack is going to work. Also, Jim Carrie's welding was just right?

I read some comments from the audience and were amazed at it 1) Others got insights from this movie and 2) I totally missed the full point of this movie. I realized that I was so used to feeding "messages" from Hollywood that when there was a film that was actually needed for audience participation? Actually, I thought, I was completely incapable. I seem to "test my brain at the door" of the theater. <br /> <br /> Am I saying that the suicide movie is the best movie ever? Of course not. It has errors, which have been reported unexpectedly by many IMDB critics. I'm saying that all American movies are bad and all foreign movies are good? Again? Of course not.

Movies that do not twists the telegraph plot, follow a strict linear sequence, and above all, do not insult the intelligence of the person watching. I look forward to expanding my mind while exploring this new world, which "does not think for me".
