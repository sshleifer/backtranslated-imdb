Previous war, as the Germans mentioned the WW2's Soviet-Nazi conflict, there was a war of destruction in the part of Germany. 90% of the German army was in the war of the Soviet Union. Their ultimate goal was to settle the so-called "subcontinent" (gigantic) Russian population and colonization after the colonization of the mainly country with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Read "Hitler's Willing Executions". <BR> <br /> Here we present the German army as innocent victims and not like the Nazi massacre. Are the modern German filmmakers ever to be honest and face the past? <br /> <br /> See well Russian movie "Come and See"!
