In spite of the early films of John Cusack and Demi Moore, even this one even the hardcore fans can not miss, until they can complete the collection. It's a rare moment for me, where I can manage the better dead, but this movie is ultimately bad. I'm not just Savage Steve Holland's fan, and he made both films. So if you do not like Chess, random comedy and amateur animations, make it clear. FYI even for Demi Moore fans: She can not sing and 80's synthesizers did not save her. There are many expected twists and jokes too easy. I think if you want to skip the psychological entertainment or something that you want to leave in the background and do something productive, then go for it. Otherwise, do not see this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) could not save it, you got to get worse. The only reason I'm not 1 of this movie.
