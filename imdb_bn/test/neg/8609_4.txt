I saw the world premiere on the Starz action channel. They call it vampire: turning The plot was a little confusing. There is a voice over an 800 year war, and I did not quite understand. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (probably in China, I do not think the film is specific). The couple has an argument and Meridian Monroe runs out and Vampires is abducted by a biking gang. Boyfriend finds a group of terrible vampires, and enters into a fight with bikers. A group of murderers are somehow involved and the sequence of final war takes place during the solar eclipse. This film is not about vampires: Los Muertos Confusing, but decent actions. Four out of 10.
