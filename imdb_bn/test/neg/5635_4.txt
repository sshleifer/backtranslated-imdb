This film was distributed free of charge with a specific national newspaper, which I did not take care of, stopped watching it from a degree, but when I came across a copy that a local charity store is not giving me anything, it is clear conscience I can monitor with <br /> <br /> The image is at its moment, the rise of the Thameside location has been done nicely, but I think, from a few errors. Firstly, Vini Jones is not a believer as a journalist. Vinei himself is a characteristic character, the fact that he does not have the ability to play such a role. <br /> <br /> Who, if they carry a missing manuscript with them, are aware that they are "invaluable"? It seemed that Mr. Jones went there with this manuscript everywhere! Thirdly, the entire Dickens view of the story seems to be important, which can be found as an attractive movie of high places. Maybe I'm a little thicker, but I could not really see the story of a story-of-Dickens style story. This film has nothing to add, and only the issues have been confused by the things in the modern story line. <br /> <br /> I would give a lot of praise to filmmakers that at least they tried a little differently. I am looking for British independent films that are 'out of the left ground' but this is not a 'red road' or 'it is England'. It's a bit of a mess, and that's a long one over. Yes, it entertains in part, but eventually it is completely mixed together and feels like two movies and it does both fail by doing this. (Also, I can not remember that I recently saw something on Yan Banks TV, which has been set up in Edinburgh with a story about Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Dowell).
