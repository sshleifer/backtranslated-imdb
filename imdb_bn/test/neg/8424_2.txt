Forget the scary documentary! This film is about a 40 year old porn star really out and comedy, whose goal is to sing jockey circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can not sing! And whenever he is ready to break the song, the film is cut off. Yet Ford and equally vapid boyfriend Black Harper whine and primp and run around their tank top, the dreams are scheduled to come true. Even the fun "manager" Kyle looks like IQ. A solid and whose collagen-injected lip look stung to him like a bee. How can adolescents become so confusing? Ha ha ha As a documentary, filmmakers do not seem to present a POV, and the film is weakly formed and wildly disrespected. Very little background information provides about three leads. Such an inclusion might seem like something other than the rise of three West Hollywood stereotypes.
