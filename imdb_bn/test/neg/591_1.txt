I and I lost half of my life that I would never be able to return. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what critics and fans can see in this movie. And that's because I can not appreciate the "art". I love a good movie with deep messages, bright cinematography, and great instructions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is not just about them. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about this picture is that it is so intense slow, boring point in the death of its listeners. On the other hand, the sequences of dialogue go quickly, and there is not enough exposure to tell the people who can not read the book, to know what is happening (my mother expressed mercy to me and explained everything before seeing it). Will they be killed to appoint a narrator? At least for the least and last? <br /> <br /> I break it for you: (Spoolers across) <br /> <br /> For the first two minutes you are treated on black screen without any music, waiting for the original movie <br / > <br /> <br /> For the next one and a half minutes, you see Sunrise and Savanna landscapes. As the audience could not set the scene, they did not shoot three or four times. <br /> <br /> The next 11 minutes is occupied with the Granting Monkeys. They fight, see unity, fight something more, pommel things with a bone. It seems that they are being influenced by prehistoric men whose evolution sing singing. <br /> <br /> * Finally * you could not say if we did not get into space. Only Blue Danube Waltz (I'm a pretty quick-tempo-ed Waltz) who gradually ships on the ship for twelve minutes, yet it seems absolutely annoying). Finally, we got some innocent dialogues and the secret disclosure of the government about not giving land to the moon. We were surprised by the fact that for more fourteen minutes of stealth, blue dwarf and spinning vessels and anti-gravity fragrance camera tricks. <br /> <br /> A four-minute view arrives after traveling on the surface of the moon. Doc at a Space Station We get a little more exposition in a board room view that follows. Then we're back out of the mood at a snap speed on the moon. A second monolith is revealed, that again filled our ears with terrific ringing (I had no idea that I was not an actual piece of music!). It shows only loneliness and then the plot moves forward. <br /> <br /> * Seven minutes * minutes to see the ship on Jupiter Tour At this moment my brain turned into mash. Can it move at a slow pace? Maybe it is to be portrayed as "realistic," but to understand the concept of our "reality" we will not see five or six different shots of the same thing. Let me tell you about this "reality" thing; I'm glad when I miss the second astronaut character. Because I am not sad and people like to die, but after five minutes I was so annoyed by the breath of breathing his breath! I want to take care of this character, he seems to be dead! Instead, I went to see myself waiting for silence. <br /> <br /> However, we now get the most interesting part of the film - part of HLA. Forget Dave Wooden Drama The real star of the ceremony is cold, frustrating, terrible, ruthlessly bad guys of computers. He is great And open "pad bay door" is wonderful. But it's too small. Long ago the director did not go long again. <br /> <br /> <br /> And he died. Gradually, in pain, losing intelligence with every minute, lowering the voice and slowly, singing "Daisy, Daisies", the lowest and gradually, which becomes boring as heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Flying colors of the seven minutes enter the Dive Monolith. Seven. I can melt my brain and jump out of my ears! Around seven full minutes but some people have folded the cyclic version of the space travel, and with those three-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the beginning! Why drag so long? Unless he wants to go to LSD users' psychologists and create flashbacks. <br /> <br /> I will not try to explain at the end, because in most cases I did not find it myself. Guess he is in a laboratory laboratory and he is teaching him deep and deep things when he sees himself old and old, and then they send him some cosmic heavenly space in the world. None of these comes in the film. You know it is a sequence of pictures with a purpose or plot. This movie was felt a lot. <br /> <br /> For the first time I tried to watch this movie, I gave up half of it. The second time I was suffering from this sad pretext for a movie, it helped when I saw how long my sister had been walking. It's annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want, call this miserable picture "art." I do not I've seen more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I sometimes feel like this kind of pain is not under myself.
