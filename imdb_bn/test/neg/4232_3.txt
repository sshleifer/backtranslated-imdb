A threesome sitting on a table table and look silently on the spaces. Afterwards, they got stuck on the railway and ran across the England Channel. A man revolves round his garden, visible only on his head and above the screen. A man and a woman cry out against another stone wall. Each of these silent shots lasts for roughly one full minute. There is almost no information provided that can not be given to us in about a quarter. The editor must be half asleep. I know I was. <br /> <br /> The image must be open with a sticky shot of a dead body of raw cells. The emergence of one hole. But then the police exchanged some words with the neighbor (the shot) neighbor couple and later started tagging with them and forgot the case for the next half-hour, the shot and his friends insulted each other and insulted the strangers. Finally, the thread of the case is again selected, but gradually comes forward gradually, it follows the already established stylistic pattern. <br /> <br /> Sometimes in such movies, location shooting provides a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the softness of the story, but not here. The houses of French villages are connected to each other in a long row. House fronts closed the patent directly without any action. Front is virtually no decoration display and quite a lot different. Flat farms are featureless. One could be one of the more interesting episodes - a visit to the fort on the coast - until they start to behave like a snout and ask to leave. There is less acting then. <br />. Someone seems particularly concerned especially to say something. No joke is created. Nothing is fun. The face of the police is almost as interesting as Rondie Quaid Child, long blonde, like the shot potters on the stereoids, it seems that East Germans were fielding at the Olympic Games. <br /> <br /> I sat for more than an hour before giving it. Maybe I'll take a crack at other times. Unless I miss something or end up with the Monty Python routine, I do not think you'll find much to rent it.
