WESTEDED: I had two things to hate about the instructions and scripts. I know I'm opening myself for ridicule but Stephen TK's direction is too much .... .... An MTV pop video is good. It's an animated soundtrack in digital video (I think), often out of focus and quick cross cutting. If you are not a teenager, you will find many categories of WASTED due to the stylistic method. As bad as the instruction it was scripts that yanked my chain. The story is said through feudalism, a poor little rich girl who spent most of the film talking through voice (strangely that voice does not seem strange to come from the same character) telling us about her stress test, her life's stress, her social unity and All of this has led him to take drugs. Is it for the same reason that parents are annoying that his two male friends (I thought he was supposed to be lonely?) Started taking drugs. Hey poor Sammy is in her beautiful home and her problems, how my heart is burning for you and for your kisses. Which is not mentioned that no one is involved in addiction, drinking, drug, nicotine or chocolate that is to be involved in addiction, they are not subjected to external forces, they are free wills. Both traffic and train spots make this point very good because they want them to become addictive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
