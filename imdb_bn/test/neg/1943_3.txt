Overall I'd call this a frustrating performance. It tries out the old "horrible anthology" method, but unfortunately fails. The acting was bad, and the story was there. Any skin in the movie was apparently random, attracting R-rating for sex. Generally, I guess, but then worse. Take your $ 5 and instead rent a real movie!
