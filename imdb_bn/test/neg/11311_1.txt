I left the theater, and I was only 10 years old. That's how bad it sucked. The plot was horrific and the acting was even worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of herself and so should this person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even even the young man, the innocent age I did not smile once in the movie. We smile about (my and my friend) still the movies were bad. We ended up in my parents' movie. The bottom line - this flick has gone bad. Mr. Magu - mother is more than mother? This movie could make me mad for life, I saw the popular television cartoon as a child, but thankfully I have never seen it, so I got rid of the pain but I will never bring back the precious minutes of my life.
