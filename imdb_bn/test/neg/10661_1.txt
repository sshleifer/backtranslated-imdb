This picture should be the worst movie of 2007, it was really bad and I do not think I saw a movie which is so bad, I mean that they do not really make bad Hollywood movies ?? Hashish must sing instead of acting, because he can not do the same thing, he was not so bad, I mean that he is so bad in the film that he saw Mallika Sheratte as a better actress, as her acting, she did each Playing the same role in the movie, God is very boring to see him, I mean, what does the man see in this woman?, Yes He has the body of a god, but where the talent ???? I have not seen it yet and at this rate I will never think. However, Hamish loves Rear, now this 15-year-old girl can work, my God is the best actor in the film and she is not 15, she has seen me for 21 years, but her acting is bright in the film. Was there. She was really good to bless him, I hope to see her more in the future. So Riya falls in love with Himsh, but wants to marry her father to someone else, but whatever a common Bolwid film, here's a hikkup (can only happen in a Bollywood movie) and both get married. Well I would give the song 10/10, it was fantastic, which hit the movie, the songs were really amazing and brilliant. However, what I can say is not to go to music and watch the music.
