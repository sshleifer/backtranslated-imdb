I will not repeat what many people say about this film; I'll try to add a few new points. Kulio-A-Vampire is a bit agree with fans, who are familiar to him in the Blend song "No Excellent", in which he assumes the role of a racing vampire (it actually works as a musical concept and is actually a great song). Caspar Van Dean is worse than Brad Pitt and is actually more handsome. And really anyone else go to Brad Pitt's movie for another without eye candy? Here is the same, though it is badly portrayed (see "Starship truppers" instead). And of course, after playing Dracula in the film of Udo Kiey, Morris / Warhol, there is something more than a como. If you can enjoy it.
