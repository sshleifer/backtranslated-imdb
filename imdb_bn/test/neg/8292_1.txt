I could not think of the possible reason I wanted to do this film for a long time, the fan of fanatics (though we used to re-show the tray for dinner hours in the early 70's), whether I am for personal film. Business reason <br /> <br /> <br /> As a movie fan, I appreciate bad movies with adults. But "shooting or shot" is a flash or funny bit, unknown or not. There are no abuse scenes. <br /> <br /> There was no objectionable scene when blocked, or you will miss the nudity, Cartoonist gunfight, "violence" with endless bullet gunfight), so one is believed that the producers simply give it to MPA Wanted to save the required fees for. It only moves in the 10 seconds with the wire to the wire. <br /> <br /> Among the eight people in the theater with us, four of them went in mid-way, as "this stupid" <br /> <br /> Shetna has been released by a brain patient who is released, because He saw himself as a screenwriter. The test board has its request "INSANE" stamp. He went to a group of Z-grade moviemakers who "shoot in the video because it is 80% cheaper than the movie" and decided to force the script to shoot his script. There are some minor subpotts that develop some secondary characters, but in most cases it is a complete movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend 90 minutes on the film "Art" of Shatna, then instead see "Free Enterprise", this is a good movie.
