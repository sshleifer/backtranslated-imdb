I watched this photo in VHS a few days ago (January 27, 2003), because it's just covering the name of Paul Rudd. I like his performance in 'the object of my feeling' and I really hope to do a good job. However, I found this film a complete mess. The story is a very confusing plaque and the characters are not well developed. In addition, low budget special effects does not help a lot. General General General General General Generals General General General G. I do not think why I gave this grade (and I do not want to see this film again), but my vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Zen-e-Police is a Nova Giraco' ('Jane-e-Police The Next Generation')
