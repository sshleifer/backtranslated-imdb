Granny is definitely one of the worst horror films made in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> This script was scary, so honestly I often laughing about some things to cry. . Acting was almost bad, they were good at casting traffic cones to the role they played (they did a good job). The killers were ridiculous, the mystery did not exist, the camera work was not effective and at the end the "main" plot was unreasonable inappropriate, it became worse. <br /> <br /> "The granny" is perhaps one of the most dangerous "villains" in the film, he seems to be wearing a cheap mask from Supermark (due to sunny sunny nylon hair) and a frilly nightgown. Will you be scared by that ??? I was not. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch bad movies (see Manaus, Troll 2, Michael Bay Films) then it must be seen. Those who do not like bad movies and do not smile frustrating to smile bad talk, they can avoid the plague.
