While sitting in an isolated Colorado home, a teen girl was terrorized by telephone with an incarcerated murderer. <br /> <br /> The semi-classic horror movie of 1979 originally started and expanded to 20 minutes of original film. This is suitable for the 87-minute timeline! So this is very nice to say that Ramad's plot is quite thin. There is little to the originality or interest in this movie. A lot of people around Comilla Bell are wondering about the dark room who is calling him and facing all kinds of false fears. It gets repetitive and routine after the first 30 minutes and is not directed to do many things on a secret or cool way. This does not necessarily reach the intensity of the original film, in particular it mainly changes an important plot point and changes it. I guess thank you for rating PG-13. <br /> <br /> Plus there is an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere, unfortunately this remake is not there much to protect from it. Sub-par <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
