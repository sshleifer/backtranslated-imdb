Nothing more than the film's nudity. Has anyone noticed three main female characters appear naked? It seems that the only winner for Portuguese filmmakers is the nudity of local stars (if not much more), but together in Portuguese society, which is unexpectedly unexpected. If you see advertising for Portuguese movies on Portuguese TV, they all included the "hot" scene from the movie. I'm not saying that by any means the Portuguese society has been isolated; The film industry does not seem to be able to find another way to success in success. Returning to the movie ... There is nothing left of the book's soul, which is a wonderful composition. The film could have been good, the real idea of ​​the book (the reality at any time) was emphasized and not strictly part of the sex. It was almost all elements ... but the "chef" was awful ...
