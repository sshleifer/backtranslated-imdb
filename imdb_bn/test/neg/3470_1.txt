Sorry, if I disappoint someone about what I said about making a TV movie. However, I paid for the movie and this movie became a disaster. The directive really is really bad. But, after looking at his information here, I understand that there might be a poor direction and cause of production. Probably did not have their budget, however, and Li's sensitivity and sensitivity were very low money but it turned into a hit. The director of this film has done a really bad job in storytelling and the film can not have a consistent perspective within himself. It keeps pulling me out of the scene. Maybe someone will have to work hard on the story lines / boards. Doubled sound is also very bad. My god .... Generally, I would be grateful to every movie because behind it it is a person's idea and imagination lies. But, this time I'm just crazy, "I really want to hit something hard." ... if someone can not fill the best of it, then do not do that. Bad industry (its not even 'art, what is it?) Really hurt people.
