This is a big disappointment for a movie that is most visible in its main South Korea in most of 2004. It shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can create more emotional, composer movies. The film was 130 minutes long but did not actually happen a lot and what happened most likely was expected, that the plot was transparent. If someone thought of himself as a Korean, it probably would have got more in it, but it did not do much for me. Because of the suit in Korean film, this plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. In order to kill South Korea Chem Il-Sung, they decided to recruit and train an elite killer from prisoners of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> If the character is good, unfortunately it does not bother me with a boring plot. This time around the case. They seem to be stereotype and most of the acting is in medium and Korean movies. Many montages are spent much longer and characters are far away, one dimensional cardboard cut. They should spend more time in establishing letters and we have to give less time to train and show how tough and cruel the soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing reminds us that fewer mistakes are still wrong.
