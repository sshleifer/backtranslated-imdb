If Jack Black was listed as the main actor, I would have been away from this film directly. It's actually better than some of its movies. This film should be portrayed as a cartoon of 3-8 years old and it will be better. It's nothing but a bunch of stupid skating together to create a big mess in another mobile phone. The film shoots in almost a day without any thought like it. Something looks like where it may seem to be a bending point and the film will actually plot for the film or develop at least one storyline, but stupid skating will destroy the whole movie.
