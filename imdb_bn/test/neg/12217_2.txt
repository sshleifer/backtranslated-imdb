Assamese Kanak has become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey controversially. The series follows the series with consistently broken ratings records, with the unique artists of filming and visible method. Personally I do not agree with the performers of the singers (So, Ozcan Deniz - the main actor), but I guess that these figures will say for themselves. <br /> <br /> With the movie, how bad it can be to destroy such a plotline. Years to be created, this film was able to oversee the story of every descendant in the series. Not only this, cultural mistakes were unacceptable, there is no stupidity in Turkish culture in a stupid view of family dancing (Greek style) and broken plates. Some people argued that the film should not be taken as a continuation of the TV series, but a major fall in the theory of this theory, the way to go to the market is to leave the series where it will be released and once the series Will finish So keeping in mind that note, I and everyone I know could accept a return and admit to the other victims standing outside the theater.
