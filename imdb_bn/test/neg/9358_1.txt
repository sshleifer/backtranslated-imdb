This very modestly made movie is ineffective (which is damaging, giving the movie theme). No one knows what they are coming to this film. Worse yet, 3/4 of the film's way, there is no source for them yet, because everything is a different movie until the "moment". <br /> <br /> Duchess's frontline fan fan, easily competing for the best 2 Mormon films (competing with Sants and soldiers and now, New York Doll - watching that screening), Duchess wanted to see his film a very long time For I was there. I wanted to believe, believe that I will see the next great Mormon movie, which will hold Numero Yunor's spot for a long time. But not Three-fourths of the film takes sharp sharp left and dragged me with something that I never wanted to overcome. She takes on the mount. Everest of all moral issues, yes, both of them have a little time or mental ability to keep them far enough, but rather both of them close attention to Jesus so that they all fix. (It really is Jesus who does not believe that I can not believe it, it is not a problem of doves. <br /> <br /> The film has shot well? Actually the actors do not work? They play their pants off. Was it appropriate? Whatever was on all but off-the-credit. Everything about this image was fantastic, except for the story that was so bad and wrong, but nothing else. (New York Dall I learned "Dunk", a very nice show.) The third thing in this movie was not a favorite, delightful or credibility. I know Dunker jumped behind creating it, but at the moment I was moving away from the movie that nothing was Nothing could bring me back, the incredible incredible detail of the final minute details did not help, anyone who is in a mission What do I say to anyone in particular? Spooler warning? A person's moral and / or psychological reasons, primarily known about sending a mission to the house. It suddenly occurred to a parallel universe where the normal rules do not apply to sudden or behavior. About ten million things about this movie are good, but they have been created and decorated just to tramplide and "Yeah, this will really get them" elitism thrown into a knee-jug fit. Therefore, apologize. I can only hope that when Duchesr touches the end of his next film (apparently "Fall", apparently), he thinks that film critics can only buy such tickets and that fans of bills provide it. That is why the first army of God was such an unqualified success. <br /> <br /> Duchar's shocks and fears prove that in the case of big problems, he is on his head, not spiritual or creative maturity, or necessary business knowledge to take over them. I pray He learned his lesson and from those years he and we all looked back, cried, and glad that he did not shine the light where he pulled his head and those who really took it successfully and other things and it changed forever in the world.
