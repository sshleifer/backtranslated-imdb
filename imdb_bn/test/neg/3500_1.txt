Dreadful writing, "The-godder", who does not know anything about racial relations in the United States, is very controversial. Slowly positive reviews are a mystery to me - but only those who think that "good" objectives should be obscured on how shallow, upright and completely unrealistic results If you want to see a movie that is related to the reality of the modern day LA race issues - the movie can see (and probably already be seen) PUP Fiction The film has more honesty and realism in any two minutes of the film compared to 4 hours of this brutality (oh, sorry, it just feels like 4 hours). <br /> <br /> If someone needs proof that the way of hell is tied to good intentions - then this is the movie for you.
