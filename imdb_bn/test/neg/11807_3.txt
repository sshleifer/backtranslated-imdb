I just saw this movie and what I can say is, where is the drive in these days? It seems that this might be a great second feature in a drive in 1977 (perhaps playing it with one of the Joan Collins movies) but for 70 percent you think nostalgic, but it's still valuable. The silly plot that is full of holes, but it reminds one of the eras that was made. Melanie Griffith looks so young and Anne Lockhart is quite interesting, although not much of an actress. Actually, this film is not going to be too much. It is a Dukes of Hugger daring, without a twang or jumping on the 1969 Dodge Charger Woods stuff. But here a dirty comet has jumped this one junk dump!
