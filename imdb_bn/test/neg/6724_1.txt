I usually enjoy Steven Seagal movie really. They are generally very entertaining and, somewhat like the Icodo, include these martial art tricks in the continuation of the Steven War. <br /> <br /> But this film is an attempt to make a really bad movie and it seems obvious to me that there is no blame on the director and producers, who can certainly make a movie, straight direct ones like Steven Siegel To give and take advantage of his knowledge and skills. <br /> <br /> I did not see the end of this movie. I could not stand to see this bad movie anymore because I went before finally. I'm sure many people share my feelings.
