Yes, it is true that Jessica Alba took me to this movie, because without me I could never choose this. <br /> <br /> However, I find it long, neutral and above all, unreasonable. Along with all, I was full of story clich√©s and directions were very annoying. So the director and writer were one wonderful to see one and the same person. I remember to avoid all its next movies. <br /> <br /> It was a sad situation because all the good things were in hand: a beautiful jungle in Malaysia, it was the British Empire and Cast Wonder: Jessica knows how to open her soul and once she finds a suitable movie for her . Bob Hossins shows a great experience and he could win a prize for this role. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is to allow this island to let me open a world map because if you guess that it happens in South Asia, you just do not know where! Ah, a little air flight of the red line of the Indiana Jones movie !!!
