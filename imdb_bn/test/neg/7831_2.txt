When you see that Michael Madsen is leading a movie, you have to start worrying. I will not go to the list of shyness, her movie career. <br /> <br /> I saw 45 minutes and was not sure what was happening yet. Madsen and Argentine love affair in this movie, which in essence humiliated Maden, threatens violence and usually uses its dirt. She loves him on the other side, then he does not smile, then he wants, he wants him, then he loves him again ... what a wrong girl with you !!!! <br /> <br /> The script is horror, shy soundtrack and vicious aggressive and strange sexuality which I believe is added to entice some viewers because the film can offer something else. I could have given the movie 1, but it was a little excited in the last 20 minutes. It actually answers a question in the last few minutes, but I'm not going to divide it, I'll hurt you for the whole movie.
