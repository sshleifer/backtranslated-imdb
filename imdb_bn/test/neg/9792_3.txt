It is impossible to create a film based on this book, like "Brothers Karamjov". Dostojiejski <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Think of the book. In the end we have "guilty" Dimitrij Karamazov. Later, they sent him to Siberia. In the end, Dostozivsky's famous theorem, friends and family planned to save him. But that's it ... and now this movie is going two steps further and shows us the confusion of running away from Dimitri and Gruschainka (I think). Just morally I'm sure Dostojevsky will finish the book with an open end because he is not guilty on one hand (the real murderer) and so he must be a free man. But on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him, so he decided to commit crime ... This is a moral conflict and so the bottom point is an open end ... Well, for real, it is not completely open. <br /> <br /> William Shutner Aljoscha Carmamov ... I'm sorry! -> No !!! <br /> <br /> Other characters play well, as we have to expect from such great actors ... Of course, the great acting of Eul Brennar like Dimitrives in front of. I think there are not many good actors who can play this part better. <br /> <br /> I said at the beginning: This book is unexpected. It is impossible that the two-hour film will not be there. I think there are some longer films, so maybe they can do the right thing ... but I can only keep this opinion that this book can not be adapted. So <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br>> All the time: Dostojevsky
