This is all the time there as the worst movie there. Any research or thought went into this movie. Action scenes are thrown in random space without any sense in the film context. Items are displayed randomly and disappear, etc. It is clear that it was managed by a "stunt coordinator", who would have to go back to his old job. Skeleton Man rode a horse across the movie, which is amazing, could change color in will. That is, or somebody will not be the audience's diversity and notice. In one scene, bloody actors and later, will disappear miraculously, and then will appear again. It seems that everyone associated with this movie forgot to check inconsistency.
