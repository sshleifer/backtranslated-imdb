Did I waste my time. This very persuasive film. At the beginning you will think something is going on but with some 30 minutes you can not understand anything. I waited for another 20 minutes and then I was so disappointed that I started reading IMDB's reviews and realized that the director had ruined so many precious time. <br /> <br /> Unbelievably annoying film stay away. So much better soundtrack I will give a point to the police inspector joke because it worked for me. I'm sunny for a long time but otherwise a very bad film. Stay away.1.1.
