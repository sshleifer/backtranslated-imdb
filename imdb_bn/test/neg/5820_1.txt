Thanks, not renewed through this ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, though popular (God knows why) is very simple - 'See flowers / shrubs / any other body behind the trees they are working - the sixteenth time the plot of this series. The conversation is so easy that it has been written for children - to talk to visitors and to explain each plot point <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> and nobody gives their notice. <br /> <br /> Every time they investigate and investigate the murder of a person, they go on the way to everyone else - embracing everyone - those who are completely innocent. <br /> <br /> They break and enter people's homes, stole items and evidence (even firearms) and enter people's lives, spies on them and passes their belongings. They never apologize, are not arrested or arrested (and if they do so, they can speak from outside, even though the other character is in prison !!!). <br /> <br /> They always come up trump Now I know it's a simple series, but I think it should not have been made before it's the first few episodes! <br /> <br /> I think they have found enough body here on both sides of the continent (where they live each week), so I hope that it will never return. <br/> <br /> There should be some action on the screen instead of the hartram in ITV all year - 'Someone has been killed in village fairs - again' type series.
