Outstanding Australian comic genius Barry Humphries was a rare failure with this unusual and sometimes boring comedy, which was released a few days later. Drunk Australian diplomat Sir Les Patterson attacked the Arab ambassador in the United Nations and posted his small country as a punishment, just as a royal coup put a new leader on throne (American soap star Thao Penghalis). With the reluctance of Dame Edna Ivarez, Sir Les (operated by both hippies) often accidentally follow a new leader's project to release a deadly, disgusting, AIDS-like virus in the West. She has a cameo in the United States women's president on the Joan River, her desk plate "The President River" is reading! Snackstick and Hamfferies have a striking satirical cats that match with a bad taste that is more enjoyable in a fun part than it is completely collected. Dame Edner TV fans may be confused by the presence of other Aliceps, sadly, this role lacks Emily Perry's wonderful variety of comedy magic. Humphrey and his third wife Deane Millested wrote this picture and Mad Max Man himself directed George Miller. Late fans like half-brothers are as essential to me as well. All others, be careful.
