A friend of mine, who was in the movies of more than me in the 1970s, recommended this to me and in fact I saw it that I saw it. However, I was not as enthusiastic as the result she ?? Or Michael Elliot? Was there. This film is a hybrid compilation of the House of OXX (1953) and Texas Chain Submass (1974): In fact, I say that it was used as the basis for the previous version of 2005, which was 'original'! Therefore, our incredibly ruthless quetter (a hammy Chuck Connors) is an 'incredible living dummy' (asserted by the forced group of 'Tania Roberts') among them (guess why? What are his crazy brothers?) For PSYCHO's films (1960) for better measurements Including self-same twist ?? which is considered mechanical genius (a 'Polandist' is displayed which is the first murder Ne involved). The film, however, benefit from a pino donagioo score, so many derivatives and the boot is not especially good, basically just an overwhelming (and fairly lazy) efforts for the sake of the end.
