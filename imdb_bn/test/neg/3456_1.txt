A cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s, which is incredible to me, the best presentation of this amazing story, but it is true. Here's a confusing confusion of another irrational effort and a hostile spectator opposing them when reading the story successfully with spectacular impression. Evwing's original work is summarized by a measurement and a feature length film is confined to a challenge. Anyone can rewrite the whole story again in Time Burton, which can paddle with other details for the second time, or the old girl's sack-line with unexpected details. The next is what is tried here, and I can say, pitifully so. The character of Krane's religious tongue and the good old Bram Hones Vanderlest character, is unknowingly and thoroughly modern new aspects to the personality, destroys the intention of the story and believes hard work for filmmakers. While reaching the famous climax of the story, I was completely lost interest. This is such a movie where you see stagehand smoke in the background.
