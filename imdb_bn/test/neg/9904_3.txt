what is this!! It's too bad. Animation looks so terrible, it looks like a ps1 type game. Actors are awful, they just can not work to save their lives. I'm finally sitting in this photo, when I realized that I had lost 3 hours of my life. I have not heard of this movie, is actually coming in the movie or going straight to the DVD? A girl has been shot?! With that, it was a stupid film. They completely copy 'Tomorrow next day'. It got one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would definitely recommend people not to waste their time with this. You can spend your time looking after 'the day after tomorrow', it's a lot better. Well, I'm thinking of this picture. Actually why I was wasting my time, Ah dam! It's really annoying, it's 3 hours and 10 minutes now spoiled.
