Barricades find Alice Phai to flee to China and without any passport without any song as refugee. He is in trouble, I can not say right, even the American outsiders will not help him. <br /> <br /> I have complained that one of the complaints China attacking Chinese attackers was the American mission of this story deeply established in China's interior that the special agency where American citizens committed crimes, tried by American courts established by our consulates. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is the best in the film and I only give better story because I love her character. He is a widow and proud member of consular service appointed in William McKinley in 1900. He requested a transfer after ten years and from the end he heard that. As the assistant secretary of ambassador Jonathan Hall, he is a well-known creator, he really forgot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The heroism was more natural than heroism because the mission was interrupted And the bandits were resisted. <br /> <br /> <br /> Alice Fai was number one singing. Why are the songs of Alice cut, God and Father only know. One thing that I am still trying to understand, when the mission residents take the final shelter inside the house with the trap door, only to pull the hole over the top floor, who goes upstairs? <br /> <br /> There is a possibility of being much better than the barricades. But in the 20th Century Fox's project, vicious edits and lost faith completely free a project. Seeing barricades is like eating a badly cooked meal.
