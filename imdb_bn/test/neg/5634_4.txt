What was the shame of some good talent was wasted It's a tedious and very self-conscious movie, which can tell its story in half. Doing that beard under Derek Jacobi doing two roles? Gosh, who will guess. <br /> <br /> The emotional wage was a weak and dissatisfied. Of course, the padded length of the movie is not permanently worthless. I felt quite down here. <br /> <br /> The sound was awesome. First, they used stock music. Secondly, loudly and loudly aloud loudly aloud, only three sound crew, and a training? In the case of both accounting or legal, there were more people listed in the credit. <br /> <br /> Some cameras work well, and actors work well with medieval scripts. <br /> <br /> At least not good time to see time for me.
