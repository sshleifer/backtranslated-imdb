When I saw the trailer of this movie, it seems like a good romantic comedy. I hope some light fluffy fun Instead, I was bored and a little depressed. <br /> <br /> In fact, there was no chemistry between the Leads and the movie was a little bit, if anything, that was fun. The little girl was very good - when she shouted, I shouted - but thought that they could use a little bit more in the role. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film was full of long, neutral silence or formula opera music. I'm not an anti-opera, but I liked to spend those times who wanted to know our characters, who were all harsh and upheld. <br /> <br /> I was really frustrated in this movie. The whole time I saw it I kept thinking that it could be so good.
