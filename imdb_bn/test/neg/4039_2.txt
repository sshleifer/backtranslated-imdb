As you can say from other comments, this film is about the biggest film ever created. See how many different words I can use to show me: annoying, helpless, ridiculous, lucid, stupid, horror ..... <br /> <br /> I could go through such a description but perhaps you could get <br /> <br /> <br /> If I could make it possible - bad acting, bad directions, bad production, bad plot <br /> <br /> It was created in 2001 and it looks like more like 1965. Very low budget, annoying plot, awesome acting, really bad special effects, etc ... <br /> <br /> I can see very rarely a sound film, I think it's pretty bad. I mean this pure garbage. It's nothing going on. As far as a "B-movie" it's a lot below. <br /> <br /> I think I'll be more entertained by looking at the empty piece paper for 90 minutes. Junk like this gives good bad budget "B" movie a bad name. It looks like Ed Wood films <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br> DJ Perry is a horror actor and he has no traits that can stand him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Humanity!
