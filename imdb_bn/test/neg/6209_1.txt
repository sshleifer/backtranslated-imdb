The voting option did not have 0, so I was forced to use the next available image. <br /> <br /> This is a sad day for Bollywood, when star cast actors among such films do not have anything to do with a bunch of young actors and a scary script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is nowhere near to a cluster of hits. Salman Khan has his usual jump-off-shirt theme and Gobinda with his ridiculous smile. Someone said two decades ago that I would write a comment on Salman (after his success with Maine Piara Kiay), I stopped him.
