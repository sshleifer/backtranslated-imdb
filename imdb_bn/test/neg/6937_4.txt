In a sense, I liked this movie because of the 'stupid', positive atmosphere. I had a problem with an aspect of the plot, but more about that later. First, the letters were a little clever and one dimensional. 'Good man' was the property of the same physical and character and 'bad people' had the characteristics of similar physical and character ... HUMA. The basic story was right (quite simple and ideal) - nothing very exciting or abusive. The main attraction was, of course, the tiny dinosaur - kind of has a nice imagination element. However, they had very short attendance in the movie. Outside of <br /> <br />, the movie keeps moving very fast and does not get very cold anywhere. I liked it about the movie. <br /> <br /> My problem with the "steal" concept was. I think this movie was not enough - especially if it is a children's movie, then some mistakes. I will keep the next sentence from being a mock (if you're worried avoid it). 'Good folks' steal something and visitors do not have the same information - so it's just stolen and it's a bad thing for a kids movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, if your kids, because of a suspicious plot perspective I'd consider passing. However, whatever this whole movie is very basic, it can be a matter of no matter. If you have any other interesting choices this one pass.
