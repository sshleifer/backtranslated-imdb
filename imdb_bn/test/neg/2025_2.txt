Extensive effort by screen writer Steve Tescheck (based on wildly awful AWAY) Clichés, Coincidence, and Door Meldrum. Probably he lived some of this; If so, then I am sorry that he could not disable it dramatically in any way dramatically. <br /> <br /> Perfectly, here is Arthur Pen, who has done outstanding work in the past, a talented director did not help him. (Banani and Clyde, small big people), but failing to enter Tesi's account in any power or literal sense. <br /> <br /> Cast can fight as well as they are, but it is related to weak motivation and dialogue. Sympathies should be especially preserved for Craig Wasson, whose morose performance improves fast-fading in his leading man's career, as well as shamefully untethered Jodie Thalen, miscast as the film's highly unlikely 'femme fatale.' <br /> <br /> It seems to be the longest, and made no point heavy transfer and obvious. See Arthur Pen's 60th issue, Drill and Alias ​​Aast's Researcher issues; All of this is not the same.
