After the hearing, some people in low budget people "Tark in in Rock 'rolls sense" and "It came from outer space ... and things" was involved in making this movie, I decided to buy it invisible DVD. I was not interested. Other movies were funny, tongue-cheek and kinda stupid. Kraftverk 3714 is regardless of any humor at all. And it's so awful that I'm just angry about it. The worst actor possible, the worst script possible, provides the worst special effects. And the most unsexy sex scene ever. Uhhh And the whole thing goes for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please, do not have another movie.
