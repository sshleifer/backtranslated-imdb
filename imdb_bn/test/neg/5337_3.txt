Oh no, one of the attacks of Japanese ghost girls, these movies ... I do not even remember how much I saw. Maybe it sells ... but not me. Not always scary. Japanese horror movie has been very similar to this one first ... also pulled the kid. I saw that many horror movie movies pulled so much time. The cellphone scene is nothing new ... The person's dramatization was hurt by buying a train ... I mean, I lacked all the drama ... okay for these kids 14-16 who hear the Japanese rock and they think it's so unique ... we tell you Dev. You have one million = D it's one of them. 3/10 I saw bad but you do not lose anything from it!
