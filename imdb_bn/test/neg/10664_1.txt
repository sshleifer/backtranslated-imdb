Bollywood films hit the theaters, spread good films and did not grow good actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His songs have been hit, that means he has become an actor later <br /> <br /> The producers were sure that the film would probably work, the songs were also hit, and of course Himes <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While he is in the car <br /> <br /> Direction protects the poor, the creator of music, though most of the songs do the same sound. <br /> <br /> Heesh tried hard but sadly his emotional scenery is a joke, lack of expressions, he is suitable for his music director and some songs. He has a sorry picture. Hansika awful Malika is ok, Sachin Khaddekar is right, Dars Han Jhawarla Ham
