I all sat through 2 hours. I did not know what was bad, the horrific plot, the character of Lum or the Hawaiian hattie that edsi 11 year old child and 80 year old grandfather created relative sexual orientation. The money spent on this was just flushed down the throne. Matty Simmons will be ashamed. The original concept of this movie was "A Swiss Family Griswold" and it has turned into this zombie anyway. The only bright spot that its rating was so bad that we will not see it on TV anymore. Avoid all costs ... hire ERNEST XMAS or anything else.
