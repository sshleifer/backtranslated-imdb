I really enjoyed "Condensed Cameras" with Dame Deluge and I was surprised to see that Susan Somers became co-stars for years. But the only positive aspect of the show was - full studio, essay, host - the words "Pumpus" gave new meaning. <br /> <br /> Well, if the materials were not so cr * PPI - I mean, the best you can do, the problem of getting the ketchup from the bottle is seen, Suzanne Somers walking with the Halloween basket in July, Ice cream is the place which sells vanilla only ...? I saw a few episodes and every time it was terrible. They were posting like it's greatest show and then filled the time with the scenery so that I really feel embarrassed to see. Even among them people looked bored and that could not be just good.
