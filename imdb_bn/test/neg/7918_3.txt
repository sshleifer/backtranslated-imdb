If you only see all the dogs going to heaven and learn that there is a signal, do not see it. It's horrible It's terrible They push the letters to develop. For example, Sasha, started singing about how you can calculate her for love. And ultimately, it seems like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy-adventure film. They drop the character out of his character and change him, soft, but with his rebel version. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is a completely different dog. She does not have any cold voice, she is not the hate that you like to hate, she calls only because she does not have any other than Spiroz than Mary. Voice actors say <br /> <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And even if it's not awesome, I do not like it. For the character of the first film, it is terrible that Burt Reynolds is an excellent performer. Dome DeLuise is wonderful as always, as wonderful. That character is true, and for this reason the film gets 3/10. Actually because of the fact that Dame Deluge is still doing the voice of Itchi. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my last complaint. I know Anne-Marie's movie has ended, now she has her parents, but what did Charlie forget about her, or did she? There is no mention in the second film. I mean, a small mention from Ichchi was also acceptable. (Formerly, "Charlie, we have to go back. You can not take care of all the children you want to rescue.) Or something like that, I mean, he has died living with her, there are some examples. <br /> If you are looking for a wonderful seagull then do not see it.
