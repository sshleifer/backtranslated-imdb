All right, I'm not saying that this is not a horror film in any way. It's not just good. I'm not saying the poster is a recapture camp, it's just nuanced. No I saw Japanese Japanese and Asian acting. I'm sorry, you're wrong. This camp <br /> <br /> The letters are completely disrespectful, the death is completely random and completely meaningless. Writing is bad. I am fine with suspending suspicion, with the transfer of everything in terms of plots I am fine. But this movie has no plot. According to a study, "This movie is set in a small town where people are going crazy on people who are admitted and spiral." That's not a blurb, that's the full freaking film. Congratulations, I saved you almost a half hour. It's nothing else. No character development, no plot development, no explanation, no resolution And even there is a lack of "recognized among the J-Hor state" resolutions. Just <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cognitive dissonance is one thing and well done it may be good (see Dark Water), but here it seems that the score is designed to go together with another movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It just fell flat. It's awful except J-Awesome.
