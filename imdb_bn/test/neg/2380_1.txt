This picture almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I was recovering from apprentices a few years ago, I started studying at the secondary school. The whole teaching business was somewhat annoying for an apprentice, but I agreed to see some rather awful movies to prepare myself mentally to return to the classroom. Flintons I chose a movie, and then I put "King of the Streets" (UK title 'Allian Warrior'). Just before I finished it, I saw myself tears of perfect waste ... my life, film stock, Â£ 2 I paid for it in Blockbuster Pre-Rental section a few weeks ago, it will be time to print slieve art, editors and musicians involved in soundtrack (Negligent as their efforts) ... the list has gone. <br /> <br /> I like bad movies. Let me clear this perfectly - I love to watch Koppi movies from Blockbuster. I and my partner sat down and used many, many cheapjack horrors to watch and used their smiles. But this was a different kind of pornographic picture. I do not think that anything comes to it, even Tob Hooper's "Death Trap" (which is probably not the worst movie in my second world). A car from the abandoned part department almost killed me; Regardless of the music on any available scope, regardless of on-screen events; Whole .... AgargahHahaha !!!!! I can not continue with this 'critical' separation, because my Gog reflex has started. Even after three years of watching it for the first and last time, the innocence of that movie still makes me stupid (but I'm still able to type). I was thinking of terrible things in the whole "Awesome part of a car" section. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching this movie then I request you to, keep an eye on the cover of the video and imagine the worst. The version behind synopsis is possible version. I'm almost sure that this film will not be even half as bad as actually. In any case, do not worry about seeing it for any reason, for any reason. If you are not a Christian and you want to see a Christ's metaphor; You are not a bad movie afictionado and you do not want to experience the real nadir of the trash; Even if you do not want to think more of your life (and believe me, this movie looks like at least one minute per second). Do not make any mistake about it, this film is unclean. It is antichrist in the form of video. Bow Catlet in Gate Shrey said: "I saw a good movie in the tooth".
