Just to judge a movie for landscape, decor, costume .... It's not right, you're missing the original: Story <br /> <br /> There's a movie to say something, a story has something to say that impresses you. Yes, I was more satisfied with the sea, the arch, the clear water and its ... there are plots? More interesting movies with crazy people, such as: Flight on CUCKOO "s nost ... etc ... etc .. This is a crazy woman who is more attached to the dog than her or her husband. Just a clear psychological case !!!! Nothing unusual. Unfortunately, the time wasted. All the rage coming from? The smell of fish? The sea?
