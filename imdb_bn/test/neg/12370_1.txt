This was the worst movie of all time without any doubt. Take 5 wooden actors out of the acting school, because they seemed to be so much wood that they were on the bench. <br /> <br /> then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost Â£ 20 on eBay. Add a horrible story line with no effect and yes you have this film. It was a shocker what it was. They could not save it by having an appropriate girl. She was fat and ugly and all was worst. I really saw this because I could not believe that this shit never financed. <br /> <br /> All costs
