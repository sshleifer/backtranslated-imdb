I share the same opinion with Underwire as a previous opinion. <br /> <br /> I've been sitting for this movie for 1.5 hours, and this is what was more important because the author and / or director made some decisions. For the plot. Completely I think the film is unsupported, there are strange sub-plots (IMHO) in reality there was nothing to do with the movie. In addition, when writing a thrill I say you want to be surprised about the story of your audience and not how the story is illustrated ...
