This is for the first time, a commendable effort from filmmaker Ham Tran, offering a little perspective to the victims of the Vietnam War struggling for liberation war, but glorious history plays a special role. This sizzling life will not sit with the inconsistent, self-aware informative dialog and sub-performance, even with a careful budget, even though historically qualified, melodrama. Do not give any occasion to disconnect the confusing connection with the actors in reality with the reality of the screen, and you should be left informally if you have some spontaneous learning lessons in Vietnam's post-history history.
