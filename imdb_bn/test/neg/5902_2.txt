I'm not usually used to review movies that I hate from any degree. However, one or two times a year, I temporarily left my rules only for comments that I would like to give a warning message. I can love it more than shooting in some bad movies and enjoy more in improving it. But some "movies" crying for razors. <br /> <br /> is one of the elements. Cinematography is not the only aspect that focuses only on focus and out. A nearly non-fiction plot (certainly unintended, even if one) played bad, Chess script and awful pacing. Who are its main problem I understand, I firmly believe that all movies are not equal and movies should be judged according to their category. Against the beach, the beach Blanket Bingo trials, is not advisable. I judge Bilitis against her weight class other movies. Measuring against movies like Emmanuelle or a Chambermaid Secrets, it really comes off very badly. Even the eye candy is also not clear for the entertainment and the volatility.
