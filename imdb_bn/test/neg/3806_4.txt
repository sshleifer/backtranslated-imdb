Stoody playing a journalist who blew up Pad O'Brien, who had asked for money for his son's Operation Fund in his former boss's house, only found him dead on the floor. Since O'Brien knows the identity of the offender, he proposes to take the rope to return for the necessary money. In such a movie, great scenes are destroyed that it has surprises, twists and turns, even though it is not really. The performance is torn apart from the board, the film worships itself as a tough, high American silent but the combination of interpreting pronunciation does not work, and the story is shaking very rarely. And it probably always has at least interesting screen kisses.
