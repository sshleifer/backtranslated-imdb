Staten Island's filmmaker Andy Millingen is well-known among the awful communities to become a worse director than Ed Wood. And its output is a slow example as I agree with them. In "The Gastli Ones" we have three reckless couples who travel to their childhood home (located on a conveniently exclusive island) and collect succession. There they kill each other and add events to the murder / mystery fashion by throwing you into a loop with a harmful retard hunchback butler. The film is in a bad shape that seems to have run it through a Dishwasher, the word is terrible, the dialog is one of the worst, some primitive manager Gore (plus some isolation and hat) and it can be technically disabled in every possible way. But is it kind of a bad movie kind of enjoyable? Type, type This is a train debris fashion funny entertainment but hateful. Perspectives with caution If you are not a fan of horror movies this deep deep six.
