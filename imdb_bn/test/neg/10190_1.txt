I thought I was going to watch a UFO movie. Instead, I have seen a movie that is trying to take the audience (my) decision to accept Christ in my life, or to risk going to hell. The whole UFO thing was a big red deer !!! It was quite kind of acting. Actually, it seems that some people of the Evangelical Church have joined together and decided that they want to make a movie. All the churches speak as though they are conversing with other church members of the church. It was not a real-life dialogue. I want to read some reviews before watching this movie, so I could not waste my money on it. On the other hand, if you see the whole church scene bigger and want to see a demonstration of how to move your views (otherwise there is no restriction), then go to see it, above all.
