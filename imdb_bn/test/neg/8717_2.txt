Definitely one of the Lamast Shows produced on these shades and some saying. Even the lead actor was not nearly stuck for a long time. It ran for eight years, a sad complication on the ASEAN viewer's average intelligence and cultural light. It went round round and round round, with repeat gags and weakly painted characters. Arthur MacArthur, for God's sake. Did they actually give this show author? I wonder if someone checks their eligibility. There was a tiring incident in the situation of the rural population and the second tragedy, which was a bad imitation of thousands of English and American Citicus. I think that I hate it so much, it seems that none of the people involved in this is a memorable, genuine, or clever, and does not like the minimum universal number.
