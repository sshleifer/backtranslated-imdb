I was looking forward to this glimpse. An old Robert E. Howard fan, mainly from the corner stand-point. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting a big deal and they could not be disturbed too much ... Oh dear - I was so wrong <br /> <br /> The error is fairly dull Was there. It will be zipped in a beautiful way, such as a sword-fighting, with the advent of the supernatural. <br /> <br /> You got some beef, but everything else was a very nice life. The middle section seems to be associated with slow carriage carriage and slow dialogue and character development in slow forest 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Plus side = clothing and effects were good, but were not enough to keep your interest. <br /> <br /> I think it's good to pull the gorillas, and get 12A ratings. As a ten-year-old boy, I could have liked this movie. Probably about the age I was reading enough fun in the first fairy tale. Perhaps there is a lot to say about my expectations of this picture? <br /> <br /> or ....... Tones, directions, etc. really go to the "Art House", but it is concerned about fairly high risk box office. <br /> <br /> Well ... maybe the next Canaan film will be made for him?
