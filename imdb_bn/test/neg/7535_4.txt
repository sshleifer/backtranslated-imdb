Very weird But meant to be. This director is his own man. Polanski, Bergman, and Kafka are at least part 6, peeping Tom one if there's a strain there. It's so weird, and makes three of the top artists memorable that it went everywhere, you never knew where it was and that it could end and eventually it could end. The finishing is very rare, no one can tell you what these two letters will do in the next frame. Another thing about the director should be to say: It is not surprising that Kubrick is considered attractive to him. In any way, in the direct method of this character, there are many Aizaw wide shots between the realistic fantasy components of both. Without a dominant effect, a kubrick placement of the camera is not washed, it is too rubbish, and does not rush. That said, back to the beginning, these people still have their own things and say good to them. Yet, for some reason, I do not want to see any scenes. But at least once it does not feel ripped off watching. But I could hold three or four other directors feeling that the ghost was going to the park, everything became obscure. Cavite was only six episodes: the other nine could completely separate me. But since this episode revolves around Pipang, seeing the absolute domain of the film, I would say that he did not take any routine route, but he followed his way while carrying a good manager's hand behind him.
