I do not understand how this image was allowed to be created. This is mostly not complete, but it is so wrong that how the history shows him physically is not the same as the main character. This movie has taken me to the Internet and definitely need to go through my books to remember Nero's personality correctly. For God, I have a book that shows Nero as the worst person in the world, and the film feels bad for me. I must say that Aggregity's character was close to my understanding both physically and mentally. Although, the actor did all the best, the film was terrible and I'm sure I will not see any other made by this sorry team.
