Acolytes present a striking mix of the original idea in the "Shocking teen" clichÃ© horror with a more thriller-like pacing. In some ways the aquilites have been very successful, but in other ways the film was weakly failed. /> <br /> Overall ekalayetaguli offerings and cabin Flower <br endless horror films like the young people to avoid nirdosata, Texas cenaso genocide, and countless other movies where the unexpected and relatively naive and innocent teenagers are sexual, crying and one- Running in one-in-one, some are stuck by the monster. Instead of this innocence is replaced with pride, revenge, and arrogance. Characters had different opportunities to save themselves from uninterrupted death and frustration, but failed to do so because of personal giants. Finally you felt that there was no innocent (and possibly innocent) innocent victim. <br /> <br /> As the name implies, the film touches extensively in pursuit of a leader or authority. The main character becomes like a serial killer and is used directly within the film. After a centralized image, a refreshing theme across the whole movie.

The methods used to solve climax are inexpensive and ill-prepared, motivations are regularly vague, and at the end the main plot points remain unchanged. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film's relative originality, theme and thesis had been lost in poor technical execution, medhabisista imagery, unclear objectives, lack of stimulation and unnecessary symbols or completely incorrect information into and managed by the twist. <br /> <br /> It's nice if the movie is edited better. However, in my opinion, only two stars get.
