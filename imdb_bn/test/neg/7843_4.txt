This film must have worked well at the box office to give a suitable budget to the gate. This movie did not have any budget, a script would require rewriting, and a good finish. There is flashing brightness in this movie. Boat ride scenes, driving a boot average machine, and chatting with her dad. You can say boots are a Southerner, not the actor. This movie shows how the gator will be, Best of Bert film. Too bad, this film was not the same fund and was completed in the races. 4/10
