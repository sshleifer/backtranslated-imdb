This movie has everything: it's a thriller, a Chase movie, a romance story, a public story, a comedy, a road movie ... In fact, it's not really any of it. <br /> <br /> You are waiting for something interesting anytime, but no, you are still seeing the same silly, untouchable and patronizing a movie with a very sound soundtrack. Even star cast is lacking credibility. Her humor is an injured person, a girl who is becoming difficult, the crowd is rigid and incapable of police, Javan ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not want to see the backtrack. If you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor, see Tommy Lee Jones's 'The Three Bodies of Melquidas Astrada'. Now, that's the call I value watching.
