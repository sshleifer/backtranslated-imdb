All right ... so you have a barrage, plenty of water (which seems to sound really slow) and a small town in the bottom right of the dam on the road to destruction. Adding a profitable glutton, a seemingly mentally troubled and dissatisfied architect and his son, and then spice up the things you add to a weak plot and bad acting. After all, when you watch this movie from the perspective of these paid customers ... If it was a per-view-per-view movie, I would be very annoyed. If you want to laugh ... you must see this movie.
