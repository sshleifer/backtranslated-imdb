For any reason, anyone who remembers the steam pressure pressure because it was scored by Pink Floyd. (Or they were then known as "The Pink Floyd.") Stefan, a really annoying Eurotrash Hitachiker, hooks up with the American model Estel and they become high and naked throughout the movie ... <br /> <br /> What is this point, right? That drug is bad? Or just heroin (horse)? The problem is that you do not give a shit about the characters, and in that case, even Pink Floyd did not have to do their best work. When Stephen finally ended, you were almost happy to get rid of him because he was so annoying.
