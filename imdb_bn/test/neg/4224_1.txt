A great effort to create a "film-silent" science-fusion thriller, but the film is short. This is not a credible plot, some of the main actors were a joke (not Lars Bomb, he's cool!). Although I like the "limitation of access by maximizing bandwidth". I ended it in principle, but I went home with the feeling of losing two hours of my life ...
