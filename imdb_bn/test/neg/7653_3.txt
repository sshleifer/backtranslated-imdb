I saw this film with a bunch of friends at a Halloween party last night. I said that the rhetorical comments did not end and I should say that they were very good. Although I thought that the order was well done, crazyness in their conversations was too much cheese. I think I took about an hour to this moment, even I realized that it was that they were trying to run home. You're quick to assume that this whole family is quite playful and has nothing to stop them, it's just slow. This movie can be around 45 minutes and it's a lot better. The only thing that makes it portable was two bottles of wine that I took in the middle of the Fickle. Bring people to Slasher films, because at least I know what to expect from them. It was not my case, there was too much dark humor, and the content of the content of cancer was a bit clearer and gross. I want to say that Randy Quaid has also played the part as it may be, and I usually see him as a drunken golffucker or a warrior pilot who likes to kill Alien. <Br/> <br /> In conclusion I give this horror / comedy movie very generous to 3 out of 10 people.
