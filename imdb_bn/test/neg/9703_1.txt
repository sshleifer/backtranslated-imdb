From the first shot of the film - like Elizabeth Bennett, like somebody pretends to read through a field inside nightly nightmare, thus all the clich√©s are invited to the film, in the drama of the generation, the strong mind has developed to deal with the incident of rebellious female characters - I knew that I killed myself Want to do <br /> <br /> Joe Wright just could not read the book, but the tragic mistake he had made was not a fine, aesthetic comedy of Jane Genie Austen. The 18th-century English drawing room, but the kind of modesty managed by the superb social communication in the height of Wuthering U-certificate. In this way, we were replaced by a scene in Elizabeth and Dressea due to any reason, inappropriately in the worst scenery and often outside the pouring rain. Note that Jane Austen, and especially P & P, is not about passion, sexual passion or love. It is about the various strategies for discussing the excellence of society in the eighteenth century. Which was completely ignored, so that Bennett's House is a violent, chaotic place where everyone shouted, walked around, abandoned their underwear on the chair, and wandered the dry houses; Society ball is a step away from a matrix reloaded style dance-orgy, a terrible country; <br /> <br /> Genius Austen's talent lies in the inefficient exploration of society, some of which do not say what they think or mean by meaninglessness? For selfish reasons, and the sad predictions of its characters arise from misunderstandings and misuse by that stupid gaps. So Jane Austen's brilliance and its plots, especially in this movie - all its platforms have been completely erased to make it functional. General Sublet was not somewhere intimate in his film, favorified for an overwrought drama which fully jarred with material and performance. <br /> <br /> It was probably trying to be a serious * movie. Both Austin's method and its appeal were pride and prejudice - these were mostly suppressed for the happy melodylm, and when it was approved, it was so sudden that it was conducted suddenly. Pride and Prejudice is a serious story that creates serious points, yes, but those serious points and important themes are not only associated with humor, they are also involved in it. You can not lose Jane Austen's tactics, just leave the bare bones of the story and keep the themes. Even when your own heavily handed mysterious-numerical Fauxbrow replaces his technique with cinematography. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennet is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and intelligent and clear sight. Keira played the first half of the film as a girl in an empty-headed hairstyle, and the second half is a schoolgirl of the school, who thinks she is a sad heroine. His impressive characteristic of Elizabeth's intellect, her forced vowel exchange, her own character, her strength and stamina, and being able to laugh and laugh with everyone, is completely lost and replaced ... What? A lot of romp and staring in the distance? Instead of holding on to his head, when he was losing everything, he started crying and shouted with furious tears - and did not really get angry; No, this was petulant hersy fit. And where Austen had the power to maintain his integrity and respect for Elizabeth's power (at least in Austin's eyes) to remain within the boundaries of society and maintain unreasonable recognition, there was no concession in Elizabeth's congress in Knightley. Moreover, he thought that in the eighteenth century, he was known as a confident and convincing person, traveling around the rocks in the haystack, and therefore, nothing like the character was written to maintain or maintain it. An amazingly unsubtle and soft performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Relation that makes Mr. Bennet so captivating and unfortunate. His special ties with Leijee, the only two sensible people of the world of fools, were completely lost, because at least the fools were not fools in the world, and they were completely deprived of psychological effects. Mr. Bingley was no more tragic and meaningful towards silence and silence, but acted as a complete obstacle to cheerful humor, and Jane-generated woman was so inconsistent that he did not even try to do anything. All the characters. This script has been wildly spread among Jane Austen's verbs - has been delivered with extraordinary ambiguity - and the most contemporary language that will not be available in modern day romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Just get BBC adaptation in DVD and save yourself heart disease.
