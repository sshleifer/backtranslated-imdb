I like a good innovation song. No, I take that back. I love a good novelty song. I absolutely hate GGROBAR, and I have ever heard from the first note. When I made a cartoon based on it, my head almost exploded. Now I saw it because my kids were begging me, I want my head to explode. It could have saved me from this small tragedy. First, it's a ridiculous idea to create an hour long show based on a three-minute novel song. To stretch a song like this, which had pads like crazy for long time, full hours, even more ridiculous. It was badly written, cheaply animated, has been played badly ... the list is underway. Dear God, all this is bad.
