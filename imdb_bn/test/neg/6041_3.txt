Chicago: Four electric electronics, Dean (Richard Greco), Ray (Richard Yarud), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior Johnson Jones are going to disconnect electrical connections with an unused building scheduled to be destroyed. As they search the relevant cables and stuff, they come across a set of doors that should not be there regardless of the blue-print, the nasal being and the doors to which they compose are open and a room is full. Computer and scientific equipment. They open up a portal for a parallel universe with some buttons, Dean and Jr. read soon after their friends and read 'fall' with Sheldon. Unfortunately, they all end up in a parallel spider world, which has taken a mutant spider that man eats or converts it with mutant soldiers, which he uses for his protection and wants to do what he wants. To survive survival lives, they are the original inventor of the portal. Richard Morrelli (Colin Fox) joins the last few people, who says that with the help of our electric boys, he may be able to (yes) be able to help him. <br/> <br /> Edited and managed by David Wow I thought that the web is quite shaky It was really simple and straightforward. The scripts written by Grenville Case and Robinson Young are troubled to say the least and there is a hole in the plot through which you can drive a tank, for example this film is really trying to suggest that some mutant spiders are not bigger than the two. Accepts an entire world of size? How did they do it? This parallel world was like ours, where the army was? Police? All our weapons? Some funny looking spider things literally millions of people?! The whole faulty, stupid and impartial Nafs concept continually bugged me around the world. Most parallel on the foundation of the house has a parallel portal in the world, which is seated for decades and is in perfect order, right? Then there is a briefcase-sized nuclear reactor, actually an electrician can work it completely purely accidentally because he has pressed several buttons in a room randomly which probably has more than 100 equipment equipment spread and surprisingly thinking that someone is talking about an explosive Bobby trap leaked on his base , If one of his companions closes it Bang into pieces by their husbands at home? Will not you be happy Food arrangements? Do they grow their own little vegetable patch? I can not be disturbed for a long time about how bad, ill and poorly written websites are all day long. This character is cluttered and annoying, which is completely movie that does not help. The half-decent thing I can say about the web is that it is short and it goes along with a fair speed, but when it's all said and done, it's frustrating. <br /> <br /> The director will have to take a big bang in Wu, to blame here, the movie looks cheap and the achievement of editing is terrible. There are lots of annoying inappropriate slow shots coming from somewhere, the action scene will be almost identical and incredibly very annoying. He used the very annoying quick cut strategy, which was a little older with the current flashing camera movement, now I do not know about anyone else but I hate this editing style because it only shows a totally inconsistent mess. Actually I do not know a person who likes such things and I wonder why filmmakers think of people. Forget about a cow, some of the spider zombie soldiers have a serious wound and their blood is not red since it is not related to reality in my mind. <br /> <br /> Made on the web-TV, I think in American psychedelic and it looks like every budget like cheap, low budget and hurries as much as you expect. It's all so soft, forgotten, flat and dull. The lack of imagination when special effects and spider objects are finally released from the end. Acting was just right to be considered so bad than all else and I can not believe I was wearing sweater Grieco yet. <br /> <br /> painful on the web, I can not really say good about anything other than it. I am sitting in bad movies and only because I am not giving it 1 star and for a quick glimpse of IMDB user ratings, I am sure that it already knew that there is no other than 1 vote and there are very good reasons why ...
