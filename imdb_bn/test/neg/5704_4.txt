So much for the jury and jury, which remains till his dirty title. What's good The light is fierce fog! Another horror movie you ask? Well, that's perfectly understandable. David Keith actually works quite well in the disguise of virgin, chef, and other Cenanagans, when he protected the killer from the death row. But overall, despite some new twists, it's reasonably stupid. Unapix has recently been putting some ridiculous productions, and this one only means so. We, the jury, feel guilty for the film's disrespectful exposure, many of us believe that this is the total waste of our time!
