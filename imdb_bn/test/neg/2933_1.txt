Maybe I hope this photo is too much, but at least one comedy will be fun, and it has a little fun moments. It leads to humiliation of homosexual, discriminatory, women, obese, and possibly many other groups. Graduation scene where _everyone_ gay is being called, one of the most annoying ones I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tom Seleck and Matt Dillon have ironically expressed hypocrisy and Kevin Kline seems confused most of the time. <Br /> <br /> Other critics compare the film with "Will and Grace", but at least "Will and Grace" _is_ are funny.
