After joining IMDB, I was compelled to write about this movie because I think it was the time I was writing this very bad script. <br /> <br /> Movie acting / direction / other parts are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. Cat taunt was still from the first movie. My question is how did they drop this script out of the drafting process? I thought that the plot did not develop just like a slog racing at the end of the road, but that package? (I can call it) is so incredible that I wanted to claim a return from the ticket booth. I have played so much and used it in my whole life. Here I am hoping something like the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good aspects, amazing plots), they only accept my $ 8 and create a humor in it. <br /> <br /> The part I still get is that this movie now earns more than $ 125 million. <br /> <br /> In summary, I felt that this film has insulted my intelligence. I still feel like the only part of the author that was a little bit of that with Julia Roberts acting like Julie Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
