Crash was considered a film about racism in Lash Angels. But in reality, it is one of the few major cities in the world that only a few of the different letters connecting each other in one day Who is going to believe? There are unrealistic situations, one after another. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism among Asian, Iranian, Latin, Black and Sada. But the big flaw is based on a pre-established racism coming from the author. Mainly because the white characters in this movie are generally portrayed with better socio-economic conditions than other nations. Iranians are poor, just like the Asian And portraits as a work of very little profile, like Latins, always, housekeepers, police officers, or Lackkitha. Jesus !!! Do not you think it's time to change the stereootype? Apart from the Black TV director, the picture was the only new character for me as a member of Black with Black. This movie has become so difficult, which made me so disappointed about the kind of outflow of Hollywood this day. Always with stereotype characters. Whatever the reality, no matter what. Nothing to recognize. This is simply a big waste because it can be a great opportunity to show Latinos, Korean, Iranian and black from a different perspective.
