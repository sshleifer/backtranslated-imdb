This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I might have been awake too. The acting and the plot were horrific. I like B-movies, but there is nothing in this movie that can make me laugh or think. Well, there were two or three funny moments at the beginning, so I have to give this movie 2 out of 10. If you really want to see it, see the first 10 minutes. You will be more disappointed during the movie.
