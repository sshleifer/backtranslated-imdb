Whatever the producer was going, he missed it completely. The Lone Ranger is not a camp, but "Eye" icons for good work around the world. And the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, that was completely violating the spirit of this character was forbidden to wear his mask while releasing this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the year that I had the only saving grace of this overall (and badly completed) distortion, I was in Columbus Ohio. I got the honor to meet Moore, Mr. As part of the tour due to bad news about Moore's treatment Not saying, Mr. Moore's character, honesty and presence have made this movie more prominent. <br /> <br /> Something can not be done well. There is only one lone rover.
