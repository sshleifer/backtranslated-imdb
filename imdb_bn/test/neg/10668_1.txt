If you think Rashmiya thinks that the singer has more pain in watching TV, then try to watch her live in the film for two hours. His face is fascinated throughout the movie, and it is ridiculous to claim him and act in a strong scene. It is far from a real love story (get spelling rights, Reshammiya - it is not louve or rial), and Mithun saw dance, autorickshaw war scene, Himesh is taken to jail, killed Himesh, killed, he escapes from prison etc. There is nothing like this if you want to laugh, especially the scenes where she weeps in Mehbooba If you want to know nauseous twangs, and curiosity Reshmiya can do with you two hours, then do not miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not stop the smile from the beginning, too late. Cinematography, location, and some songs contain only saving grace on this movie. Yet, you should avoid this movie until you die in a season with a fable at Rashmiya.
