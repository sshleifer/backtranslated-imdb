Imagine viewing a slide show that each slide in the projector is enough for you to remember it over three times. Now imagine that the slideshow images are completely made up of the Mundane scene ?? A small park; And the tennis court is empty; A piano. Now imagine that the people running the slide show are frustrating, semi-explicit conversations that are temporarily related to the slides they show you. Great ?? You just imagined the entirety of the movie 'India song' <br /> <br /> This picture is a gradually full montage of images which only do nothing except shouting 'Look at me! I am profound! Just as images and films completely do not completely prevent hypocrisy from being hypocritical, similarly with the vaguely self-importance, due to the savagery of self-confidence. Visuals can easily be replaced by a series of static images described above, because it is rarely on screen people have and even when they are, people are actually moved only slightly more than the furniture. Do they talk in a meaningful way or do not interact? They just stood by looking at each other, and sometimes crying. The most energetic moment of the first hour of the film is when three slow walks across a parking lot. In fact, the scene can be completely excluded, because the story has been fully described. The story is about a woman who hates India because it is hot and hates, because they do not hate because it is very hot (this point covered several times). It is also a person who thinks he is able to sleep with the aforementioned woman, since he asks him to sleep with someone, but never asks him to sleep with him, and he is very upset about this. So look at her as she runs her cheeks deeply in a single tears. Later, he looked at his bicycle, because the single tears run down his cheeks. Indeed, when you look at his bicycle, the single tear will not see him running deeply in his cheeks, but you know that as it is there, that's why it's such a movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Only a complete step of determination to be aware of the completeness of this film will be needed. It brings a serious and meaningful idea about viewing and actually being guessed about it, which will propel the same kind of migraine to try to read long technical documents in the dark. This image may sometimes be the most pseudo-artistic trend most people ever know.
