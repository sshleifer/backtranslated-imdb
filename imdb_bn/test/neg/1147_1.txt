Oh why they tried to sag one of the best christmas movies of all time. At each stage of the film was not a train debris and should ever be made. Ready Quaid's cousin, Eddie's script, is the top of his previous street as his cousin Eddie. Also, Eddie character is not quite interesting enough to carry a complete film. Even "eye candy" Sung Hei Lee can not recover this crack in the holiday holidays. Do not waste your time on this step, just watch the original again.
