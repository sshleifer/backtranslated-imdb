I knew what to do in a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts - action sequences and personal plays. It follows Ashton Kusher via surviving swimming school, by the direction of Master Chief Kevin Costner, then in Alaska where there are few spectacular finds, which eventually lead to death. <br /> <br /> I must say that the scenes have made the beach so tight that they should be so much cabbage. A general bar room battle ("Padma pirates") between the Navy and Coast Guardman. Experienced adult timer Coster, who told him as an old bar tender, "Married with Coast Guard." The old chief who is trying to prove himself "that he is still nineteen years." Costanera's exchanging partner is neglected former wife. All of the apparently sad sighs swim by the coach, to achieve a high goal. The gifted young man is bound by a boring past. <br /> <br /> The problem is we have already seen it. If it is Kevin Coster, then it is Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosette Jr. or Vigo Montaigne or Robert Deanro elsewhere. And in the climatic scene, there are shameless elements from "Perfect Storm" and "Dead Kalma". None of this is fresh and does not conform to any originality of the old stereotyped character and circumstances. <br /> <br /> It works best as a documentary about what's going on in swimming school and what can happen later. Even a little weaker because we do not get much in the direction of instruction. This is mostly about personal conflict, romance and smoking. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the US Coast Guard is rather a great team, its official mission is "sea life and property security". During the war it moved to the navy and played the role of war. In World War II, the Coast Guard was able to achieve a medal in his medals. <br /> <br /> However, we do not learn much about it again. We do not really learn a lot about anything. The film's visual display devolves into a succession and not too much. A disappointment.
