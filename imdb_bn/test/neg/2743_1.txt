With the lives of adolescents in the age of adolescence, the acquisition of well-known adult film classics and beloved ones, George Lucas' American graffiti, we have Cooley High. A type of adaptation by Cricinfo's Good Times, co-creator of the 1970s by Eric Mont. <br /> <br /> Coolie High saw a black version of American graffiti. Instead of Central California, in American Graffiti, there are black objects in Chicago's Camburina Green, which are here as a backdrop for the story. In 1962, instead of the United States, Kuolie High was located in 1964. As the main character of the film, and starring as the lead character, the movie star welcomed back coator, Lawrence Hilton Jackbox and Glenn Terman. Garrett Morris is playing a major player who tried to keep Jacob and Toum√°n's characters in the cassys and Priyach, which was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> You know, Cooley is a worthy comparison piece from High American Graffiti or it's a great film of its own, but I can not. The problem is that movie producers can hide or hide the sad signs of black life in America. The film does not help to save the film in Chicago's Cabarine Green area. <br /> <br /> Here humor tries to make a total of crass here. When Cox's College is looking for a letter, he saw his younger brother throw it in the toilet. When the gang visits the Chicago Zoo, a group called Putea pauses with one of its ropes. When the character, promotion, chaos of Tuhrmann is being chased by two hoodlums (at school, there is a dirty and sad place to eat food to show less), when the girls open the bathroom door, when a girl releases herself, she escapes through the window of the same bathroom! High school, character rooms, bathrooms, almost all of the movie shows urban erosion and the unfortunate appearance of poverty. <br /> <br /> If this was not enough, there was a rough display of humor in the film. Violence and prejudice use in the film. Coolie may be a high-quality film, but it's a tough and rough old film that is not very intelligent and likes to use nostalgia which makes American graffiti a lot better and appreciates. <br /> <br /> Mutown Records had a hand in making films. The company's music was part of the soundtrack of the film. But here even you have got the same old age as one who heard this song millions of times. They were not black music, but black music, they were more than just Motown. Especially in Chicago At the end of the movie, the song was spinner G. C. Cameron, not all that was impressive. Better than the Cameron, Motown artists have a good Motown Ballad without any questions. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film shows that the images pay homage to Coolie Haiyy where the image ends with American Graffiti It shows that Preach, an intelligent but under-student student went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Mont himself has shaped himself as a character of Turing. The last shot of the movie is going on away from the funeral of Kossis, the dark rain is held in the afternoon, and all the chaos that the Kuleai High represents. Through Priyach and the final scene, there was a small lesson for all of us to see Eric Monte Coolie High and to fall in love with the past. Do not look back.
