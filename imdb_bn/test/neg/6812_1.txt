When did not sleep, and what was the tube to see? How do I run across this tripe. For myself, I worked well to bend and bend for 97 minutes of this spoiled film. <br /> <br /> In the attempt of "to be true", the story of this film, such as gangsta stereotype, should have been premiered for a Wayans Brother movie. The dialog? Please! It was just like a white guy who tried very hard to write this image. <br /> <br /> The edit was awesome. In my "favorite" scene a car involved in the back down a bunch of narrow alleys. Although the characters are behind the back, they are driving through a park with baseball fields in the background. <br /> <br /> When any of us "housewives" are shot in this movie, then there is no hole in the blood that they shed miraculously through the clothes, which I can say more for this expected load .... baking soda's plot. <br /> <br /> Even if they can be big in the films of the Indies, they are low in budget and impact, but they still have some cinematic integrity. If I could give it a 0, I would like to. If you see it, I hope it's on the wire, because even cheap fares will be paid too much. In fact, 97 minutes is too much to pay ...
