Well, how to start? I saw Italian jobs for the first time a few years ago and I was visiting the rental rental shop, why I felt bad in my mind. Now I do. <br /> <br /> I saw the statistics after voting for rating this picture. Apparently this picture appeals to girls below 18 years of age. No wonder. They did not pay enough for Charlie to flash, and I think Mark Wahlbers has given a "great" rating to some girls magazine. More than this, the film is completely predictable, mainly for the B-stars and even the good people being misused abruptly, the film is full of obvious product place and imagine it: it's even a signal Without being motivated to repeat itself! The first 15 minutes is the best part of the film and it has moved away from it and once they find out this concept they again decided to use the last hour after repeating their best gold. <br /> <br /> I think Charliez Theron is good and Ed Norton could be much more than ever. With Donald Sutherland's "Appearance, I'm Here" at the beginning, I say that if the film is "over 18" then it should be passed.
