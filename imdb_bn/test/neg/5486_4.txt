I have now seen several movies by Pedro Almodovar, but this will be far most frustrating. This film began to feel the lack of power in his movies everywhere, and the story never made me interested. Many Almodovar were shown regularly in this film, so it was not like the on-screen talent deficit, but this film seemed more serious than just the other films. If this movie had a comedic edge, I could not find it, and it was made for a wonderful weak film.
