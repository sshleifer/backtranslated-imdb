Today, President's Day is, my wife and my "notebook" were DVD, checked out at our local library. This was a 2004 film that was released under our radar because we are big movie singers. A published author with the hope of playing my first book game. I noticed the references to "notebooks" in the reviews of other movies, which is why I brought it to us and gave it a perfect opportunity this morning. We both really like it. It is my wife to cry; We can be very involved in this with our own, continuous love and even I roam around. <br /> <br /> After doing so many work, yards and work this afternoon, we really metin When we came to the theater, after watching the ongoing batch of most films, we were selected to watch "Victoria Day" because there was no reason in the theater, although both of the IMDB and my phone films showed it. So instead, we saw the poster of "Dear John" and it was written by the same author as "the same notebook", we liked it as the 'individual' designation. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or sympathy; 'TN'; And we all keep commenting - two dozen or more - there was nothing else to understand this movie quickly, another critic commented, "Notebook for a poor man!" It was a real 'cash cow' feeling, which means throwing a story based on the correct template of 'TN' to spark the pieces easily. Not only that, 'bug-eyed' trollop is unlikely for wing cancer patients after 'dear John' - we later mocked the movie with each other, so that ultimately the most stupid fool crossed the line. On Monday 4:45 pm, there were only six of us in the theater and my wife asked me to keep it, so I will not destroy it for others ... it was so bad. <br /> <br> On the Tien Hill's hills it has been ensured that separate hugs are recognized separately and sparks are vague, and the cheap efforts of writing templates are painfully obvious. We just want to show that we could instead of "Victoria Day" ... no matter how bad it might be after seeing this poor entry in the movie. And oh ..., for the last 30 minutes, I was saying "... do not give the cow a cow ... do not give it to the cow?"
