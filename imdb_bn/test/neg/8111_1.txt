For many years, Stephen King likes novels and short stories, I, like most critics, have constantly been disappointed with the adaptation of the film from his printed works. There are a few notable exceptions from "The Body", "Carey" and "Rita Hairstyle and Shashank Redemption" from "The Showcount Redemption" from the same notable novels. This movie is a bad thing that has ever been made by Stephen King in any way. It is not surprising that Mr. Raja has neglected any relationship with him. I think that making me the worst for this bad job, cheaply portrayed, garbage truncated secretly, they did not ruin your time or money in this amazing demonstration of a tragedy completely! !
