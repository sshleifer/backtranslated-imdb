Naturally, another great composition in the Vice Academy series ('ahahah) ' I do not know why they are annoyed to create this trash. Police acted slutty in another series. The character of Anger Lynn Allen (Holy Wales) and Elizabeth Kitan's character (candy), under their lab coats, tried to induce the scientist to do nothing except their bra and underwear. Just a wonderful view (h) One character I did not like was the commissioner. She was very annoying and unconscious. He should have been arrested. Mrs. Devonshawyer was quite annoying, as well. After this movie they will have to close this series.
