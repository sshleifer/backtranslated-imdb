Plankton, or bird species, I am positive, it is commonly discovered and emerged as the headline title, appearances are displayed as moving images and the rest of the size of the same font, which begins with five 20 children, Mike (Clay Rogers) her girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Tomami), sister Julie (Anne Wolf) and Dorothy (Lorraine Dipalm) and Bobby (Michael Forest) Ame a boring stupid. Near the sea, why do not you know why I do not know. Oh and totally stupid Bobby had left the PETA and never thought to tell anyone that it was not surprising that they would leave the ocean out of the ocean without any patrol and make it worse and they were trapped in the thunderstorm storm. Floating water explores a dead body. Soon, when a fate and possible security change in their fate, a flash yacht board and start exploring. Firstly, they find a scientific lab with different fish specimens and computer equipment, then they find the fully equipped and luxurious cabin below. They found a chemist (Daryan Sarfian) who is crazy and can not speak. They eat fish from the fridge, which makes the blonde vomiting, beat and slogs warm to Dorothy. They know that this fish has been contaminated by poisonous waste of 1000 years of fossil fossils and submerged in the ocean and they fly away, change, bite and are usually almost unpleasant. I will not be disturbed when I go with this plot outline, so I will not go, what I think is not here ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was originally developed and operated through Messmileaniano Sancery, al-Paseeri's alias. (If I make this picture worse, I'll hide in another name) and I think Plankton is simply one of the worst movies, with many of these things wrong with this movie where it can be started, it is difficult to know. The total shit of script by First Richard Baumann, it makes no sense and was so slow and dull to torture it to sit for me. Why five can swim only in the middle of the ocean on rubber dung? They had plans to fix? Why we can often get point-of-view shots from animals of this fish, but they seem completely invisible because they do not appear on any screen, even if they are not on the screen, and how this fish is very close. Why do not they have water for swimming in the boat? People's actions and responses are all wrong, they are constantly divided, they make strange decisions, which give no idea what they are experiencing, and some of the conversations that I have heard are horrific. I could go about all the holes and ridiculous goings throughout the day, but I will run out of space if I do. Fishes appear to be terrible, rubber wastes and ultimately bad stopping motion animations, the scenes where they interact with human cast, they also feel terrible with some bad super emotions. I have heard many comments that Plankton is poor, do not make me laugh! Any blood or cow in Plankton is not forgotten, while Bobby is a fish turned into a monster during a sexual relationship with Julia, but there are some thin scenes, but it is very short and does not kill him, he just dried up on it, some The tentacles rise and comes to the head of a fish from its mouth. After Julia's cell began to sprinkle a little bit of bread, but it does not really see what will happen to it and what's going on. Dorothy is behind her, out of the screen, and has a fish animal in her control, but again we do not see what happens to her during Margaret's suicide, a short shot of a plastic strapped on her forehead. Easily the greatest view when the dori looks like big objects and slugs like beetles and slugs. This is the only person who died on the screen, and in most cases Plankton was thrilled to look very clear and colorful, and I was almost asleep. It was very annoying. I can not see whoever likes this total pain, I can not fix it. Awful acting, dubbing awful, characters horror and I hate them all. Instantly Plankton is predictably cats as well, the estimated budget is only $ 250,000 which I can say, where did the money go? The sets are exclusively and dull, special effects with one lab and several cabins, below the barrel staff with the most explosive boats, the cinematography is destroyed, the music is absorbed, the zero atmosphere is completely absorbed, and the plankton fully plastered, its name is eaten, it is low in food chains, which is probably It could be I hate Plankton, it's awful for a single view of more than 86 minutes. Do yourself good and you can avoid it until your brain is uncertain or uncertain.
