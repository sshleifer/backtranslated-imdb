Background info - Film octopus and sometimes it is made in the same year again, 1983, and naturally people compare them. Moore v Connery Bond v bonds <br /> <br /> I have heard that "official film" octopaci is much more senior. Well, I just saw Octopis. To force the plane to land the plane, 100 miles per 100 miles per hour (impossible --- wind will blow him), and then travel around 60 miles per hour (again impossible - try jumping from your car --- You will end up with an isolated body). How is the sound of that octopussy scene supposed "good" in any sense? Suddenly Bond's director general and Titanium have a body. And at the age of 56, he did all these stunts ??? Full shit. Incredible Fars <br /> <br /> - Now, contrary to the above scenario, with Kanori's "disallowed" sometimes not to say again: It's not the same Polish because of its independent film status (low meaning) but at least you can believe that Connery is a real danger A real spy. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with showing its age (after 50 years) and being sent for restoration. Completely trustworthy. But, of course, there is no such thing as "world shutting down" for spying on the world, and bonds quickly target themselves even in hospital. From that point on, the story has spread among other boldness, trying to identify the wanted killers with bonds, and ultimately trying to steal nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Shan Kanani has done a brilliant job and is avoiding them. - Top / incredible stunts. This movie looks like a natural heir to the last movie of the bride, the heroes of 1971, forever ... the old style of bonds ... before the franchise's fool becomes <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
