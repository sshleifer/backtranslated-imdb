This thriller is a few of the most amazing films I've done several times. Everyone - and I understand the meaning of everything - when I said in the theater it was awful ... but then began to think ... no one can understand the horror / thriller film or metallic rock - so why not? I have heard from their first place ????? This film kicks the ass - but only if you understand and enjoy such entertainment. Short (very late) - see it with an open mind and it can open your mind. ... very good soundtrack ...
