I saw this movie yesterday and can not stop thinking about it. I went to Norway four months ago, and I've never tried to find weird empty sources. When I saw this picture, I saw the bright snapshot of this society. Yes, all this is true !!! I also got a great job with very good pay, and I live in my friendly cozy apartment with my Norwegian lover. But, as far as I have met, the film is about the foolish, empty feeling that I have never had before - this movie is about this. Diner parties are nothing to talk to each other, but emotive comments, long silence, no stress, strange calm, and frozen smiles of beauty. This scandinavian nightmare is completely render in Den Brysomme Mannen. Watch this movie !!!
