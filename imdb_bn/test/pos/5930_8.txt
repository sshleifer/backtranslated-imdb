This year's Royal Rumble was not really bad, but last year the course was definitely the best way. <br /> <br /> First match - Shaun Michaels VS EDGE Although this match took too long, it was OK. Edge winner after using the rope to pin Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Second match - Under-glow In a Cassette match in Headencr√©, I really do not like the cassette match, the match was boring and sloppy, but eventually it increased its pace, because Undertaker nailed Tombbaston and pulled Hydeneric for a win in the casket. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Third Match - JBL VS. KURT ANGLE V. Not a bad triple-threatening match to appear big in a Triple-Threat match for WWE Woman's Championships. JBL has won the win for Klostlene from Hell on Angle. 5/10 <br /> <br /> In the fourth match - Randy Orton VS. Tipple H to win the World Cup title, the match was a bit sloppy, but it was still good and it was fantastic. Although Orton is defeated in the match, it is quick and fast in the end. HHH nailed the padgies in Orton to maintain its title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> Fifth match - Royal Rumble It is a cool royal rumble {good for each royal rumble}. After the entry of 30 men, the last four remaining superstar in the rumble was Sina, Edge, Mastiero and Battista. Edge was able to spearhead the brain, and after the Batista and the soldiers dressed in a dressed suit. It was now up to the Army and Batista. After returning the F-UK, Batista went for Battista bombs, but suddenly they collapsed on the outside at the same time. After a controversial decision and on the way to the ring for Mac McMon's issue settlement. Batista and the army again started the match again, but Batista became better from Sina, nailed the spine belt, and the 2005 Royal Rumble defeated the army to win and won by Raselmania 21 runs. . 10/10 It was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year always keep every royal rumble in history. <br /> <br /> Overall: I'm 8/10 and B +
