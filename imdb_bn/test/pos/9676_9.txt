Best show on family Guy TV Never It has achieved such a great achievement that no animated sitcom or even a show has even reached near. <br /> <br /> In terms of animated sitcoms, this period should be referred to as "the era of animated siticom". Because many of them are there, and almost all of them have been released from fantasy DVDs. There are some good things (such as South Park, Phuturama, and Simpson). Each animated sitcom has its own style / strategy made fun. For example, Phuturama is funny because it always commentes on or works on what happened to the touch of humor. Simpson is also a great show because it uses the same curiosity technique and style that Phuturama uses, but Simpsons is credited for it, because it was on the wind path before Phutura and still using the technique is in the air. South Park, in my mind, is the most fun show next to Family Guy, because it uses humorous techniques as a combination of dissonance and impressiveness. <br /> <br /> but enough about other animated shows. I tell you the family folks makes it so fun. Family Guy uses such a humorous style that no other show has ever been used before. It uses a technique of having flashbacks after every joke. This does not just strengthen the mood, but it seems fun. It moves at a very fast pace. These two criteria make it fun on TV. You will see the show to believe it, but once you see it, you will probably agree. (FYI, there were two fun moments to sing the family: 1) 5 minutes chicken fight "breathless", and 2) Dick van Dyke "in a holy copy".) Also, I think family Guy is very modest ceremony because other shows have their shots / routines And the characters become familiar with the humor, but most of the Family Guy's jokes are based on the current event and the silliness of pop culture. It also shows that the Family Guy is also intelligent, modest, because it shows that the show has insight. And this strategy is very effective because they relate their pop culture references to the special plot of the episode. <br /> <br /> Family Guy can be enjoyed by all ages, because younger children can not understand the pop culture references, they will be amused by colorful, stupid antics of letters, especially Peter. However, the show is a little more obscene than Simpsons and Futurama, but it is less pornographic than South Park. So, in the absence of irrationality, the family Guy will look at the top, somewhere in the middle, but it will be ranked as Medal for threat and intelligence! <br /> <br /> Sadly, it was canceled, the year was not popular because Fox changed its slot during its time, so it never knew. Fortunately, we got the DVD box set (which, by the way, is sold like crazy) and restored us on the adult swimming swim in the cartoon network available to us.
