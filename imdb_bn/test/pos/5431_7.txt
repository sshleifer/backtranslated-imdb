It was an interesting movie ... half comedy, semi-political thriller. It was a little prediction even though it was a lot better element. <br /> <br /> Popular actresses like Robin Williams Tom Dubbs, who gave popular political commentary on a hit show. Think daily show with John Stewart. During a tapping of his listen, a woman in the audience told him that he should resign the president. That was followed by some serious attention, the ball rolling and Dobbs needed to start the political career. <br /> <br /> He runs independently and equally opposes the democracy and the Constituent Assembly. He can become straightforward and honest, and growing popular - but actually is not quite popular enough to win. He is definitely the misery in this election. Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program for quick and easy voting for ordinary people - but there is an error. This error was discovered by a young lady named Allan (Linley), which seems to be false by the software developer after fixing errors before the upcoming election. <br /> <br /> The election day comes, and I see that the debbons are winning. (Big surprise!) Allan knows that he is not the President - he did not win legally - he decided to tell the president ... but the complexity arose. His companion was poisoned to keep him quiet. Aside from her, she quickly takes a choice of Dobbs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> But, it is not annoying. Robin was as good as normal, and Christopher Walken often stole as Dubbed's director-politician-adviser and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a recreational movie, and it has a good message. If you are in the mood for dark satire, or something that you think, then I recommend it. Overall I give it a 7/10.
