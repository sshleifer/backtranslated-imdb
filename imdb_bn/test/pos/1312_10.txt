This movie is a hunting story of writer and poet, Mishima's life. It moves through its past, through its last day and through some of its stories, but it is specially created because it is moved from the department to the division. It's the taste of man, his work and his bar ... ... the hard work of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful part (literally "full of surprises") quotes from his work. Set (especially designed to work with cameras) Amazing ... Stylized, beautiful and effective. They can be used as an example for any set designer. I woke up in the dream of the Golden Pagoda night. <br /> <br /> The stories were powerful searches of the nature of human and art. After watching this picture, I wanted to know more about the artist's work. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.
