Sorry about the phrase "very cute". I did not know what I was thinking, but I could not really help myself. <br /> <br /> I have come to look for a 'bloody birthday' for a long time and I must say that it was accidentally and this is a wonderful surprise to find a copy of this movie for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen. It's a real shame that some 'gems' of the 80's have almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of the movies which is surprisingly good enough to be observable nowadays. Not a nice composition to make sure, but still entertaining and guess what? ... it's not really funny funny scenes. I think this is a shocking thing if we remember that it is a low-budget flashlight about a group of evil children who killed people since the beginning of the 80's. But believe that the film mostly guides to be respectful and observable. <br /> <br /> The story 'Birth of Blood' gives birth to three children during their lifetime earnings. According to astrology, when receiving, the Sun and the Moon block the Saturn, which regulates emotions. As a result, the three children who were born that day were eventually unknowingly bad. Since they do not feel the feeling of remorse, these 10-year-old children are mainly standing in their way and standing against them, with their parents and siblings ... and killing them! The number of bodies increases day by day and the police authorities believe that it has hidden psychopaths around it. Already, Debbie, Curtis and Steven, do not hesitate to keep people in mind, because someone can not face those sweet angels? <br /> <br /> I was saying before, 'bloody birthday' is not surprisingly funny. I know I said before, but I'm really surprised by this. I was expecting some sunny bad scenes, but the movies proved me wrong. Indeed, most people will not consider a 'serious' horror movie, but if I want to be fair, then I would say that the story has been effectively implemented. One of the most important reasons one hopes for in a humorous situation (as I've done) is one of the most important reasons, because the main villains are children of young children, young actors are very scary and they make the whole thing laughable. Let's face it: The kids are becoming terrible actors, which are understood and we can not blame them. But to my surprise, these three young actors who played ruthless killers in this film were very shocked and not at all fun time. The rest of the actor is also good and if you are George Clooney fan then you can see his uncle with a doctor in this movie. Yes, I know right? Who are you? Also, a brilliant actress, singer, comedy and gay icon pair Brown, gives strong performance as a naughty big sister, and if someone is interested in nudity, then she holds one in the scene and she looks very nude. Very bad though she did not have more time on screen! Julie 'absolutely fantastic': P <br /> <br /> So, in the middle of the '80's, some moody mood is in the mood, this movie is good. My only objection to 'bloody birthday' will be the way to justify the children's objectives. This is probably one of the lowest points in the film. Let's see: If a child born at the onset of a planet is a desperate killer, then how did these three actually kill people? I'm sure there were other children who were born on the same day ... and during the other planets on the planet, hello! Overall, no big deal, it's just a simple observation, that's all. I saw bad, trust me. For example, 'The Children' (1980), in which the poisonous killer gets their evil after the toxic cloud turned into a corpse. No, believe me, 'bloody birthday' is a lot more decent and if you enjoy easy slashers, you are going to enjoy it too. So, now you know: the birthday party you invite is ... and the hosts will provide a delicious toxic cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come, you can not miss it;)
