Somehow, this image burrowed in the soft spot of my heart. Do not ask me how it happened, but I think the feature of the film is "I'll Sponsor" McMahon was a little bit to do with a tail-pitchers crack hustler. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was frustrated with Slutter's first outing in 1972. There was nothing more than to speed up to follow Shafts-Mania. How to get away from this sequel? Big Jim Brown thinks as strong as a slaughter here than the first. Perhaps it was some "work-like" instead of doing it a year later than her. The most outstanding part of this picture is the soundtrack. Pink-Daddy number one, James Brown. Almost every scene is graced with a touch of fan by Godfather. A great time movie for music, clothing, vehicles, lingo and hair. Jim Brown and Ed McMahon can actually grow GRO hair when I want to mention this film also a great time movie to present a time in the history of film history. <br /> <br /> Double the girls, double the blow, triple the triple body count, and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You have a hell of a 70 second action flick, and will not leave any kind of pre-predecessor borders. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip Off can play ball with any Blaxploitation film ever made. Even shafts. The chances are you will disagree, but off of the Butcher's big rip it has its own distinct feelings. There was some lack of origin.
