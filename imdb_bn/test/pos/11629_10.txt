I can understand how Barney might be annoying, but the hatred he has received is very ridiculous. Barney was created just right from the beginning and the simplicity is not bad, especially for young people. I personally find this show very intra-time. Bern and Friends, a very educational show of my opinion and 17 years after his debut (and nearly 21 years after his debut on the career home video), he repeatedly proved that he still appealed to kids. Perhaps less than the 1990s, where Barney was Hannah Montana, but she is still classic As a fan of Barney, I think he should be protected in a way that does not seem to be spam. The way to teach vulgar people can be very simple and unreal, but do you want to hear about their fight? Be grateful to some (a decorated dinosaur, but still) to comfort the kids and make them easy to have kids At this day and age, I think we push our kids to grow up and Barney says that you can still be a child in the heart. In addition, the lessons of the burning of the current episode about musical instruments can be many, honest, and yes ... even death, even their targets, not only for the audience, but also to everyone. At the same time, we need to learn to be kind to our children and respect others, and he helps them to do so. In short, Barney might be annoying for some people and I fully understand why, but pushed him a little. He and his friends (HIT Entertainment, including its production agency) are trying to try not only to learn the skills needed by the kids, but to focus on the fun and positive aspects of life. If more people listen to their children's favorite character and see him with their eyes, then perhaps we will not be so negative about him and perhaps life.
