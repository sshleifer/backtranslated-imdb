Dick Barthelless is a very good "precoder", which in a way reminds me of Hawks' "Angels We Wings" (1939), among which Barthelems also acted. This film was directed by William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark Aviation Silent picture "Wings". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " See and fall, who participates as a part of a law in a traveling air circus; But when Bartholomas' brother approaches the scene, a triangle relationship is established. <br /> <br /> There are many thrilling moments of "Central Airport" and some moving and sensitive scenes, thanks to the development of chemicals between Bartheme and Yale. Who, in my opinion, is very similar to actress Dorothy McLean in this movie). Tom Brown is as good as Berthelmus Brother, fresh from the success of Willer's "Tom Brown of Calvar". <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying stunts, fast film depicting; All, very entertaining. Do not miss it when TCM winds it again.
