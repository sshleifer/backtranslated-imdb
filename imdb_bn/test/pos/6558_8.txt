Anyone who enjoys Twin Pix's Lynchie curiosity, or enjoys any fan of HP Lovefriend, who knows that the most awesome thing is known, will really enjoy this movie. Do not see this as a horror movie in the "traditional" Western sense, but more like a fairy tale of Grimm. This is cool and definitely for 16+, but once you start watching it, you will also drag yourself to the vaurex. Certainly some movies that you hold for a few days (I will not see my snapshots in the same way!)
