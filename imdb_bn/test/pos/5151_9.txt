After being presented at the Rome Film Festival in Rome, it has been dubbed in Italian language (it does not appear to be as bad), an artist film and a festival movie which guarantees its attractiveness to attract and delight for its uniqueness. Style, drill humor; The ability to draw comedy from others; Offensive, cheery music; Spot-on acting; Overriding sweets and humanity - but lacking in the lines of his curiosity and a compulsory story, but respectful, the average audience is watching what they are watching and why nobody admires it, even to wonder how it is made <br /> Our dried skits give almost a series. Various themes running through them. Meaning: A person in the next table (Waldemar Nauk) takes a rich bore pattern while talking on a cellphone in a restaurant on a brand brand, then indicates a set of posh suits made of order. A son of death brings away his elderly father from a larger gathering to request a loan. Depression: A primary teacher (Jessica Nilsson) broke up in class because her husband was lying on her bed because of her call. "Witch"; The anger salesman spouse (Pär Fredriksson) collapsed before the client because he called him. Some men have sad dreams. But hey - this is Sweden. Not everyone is disappointed? Love affair: A fat Bohemian couple breaks forever; There is a girl groupie imagination about a lead guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). The wives started to practice their husbands habits when the husband slam door. (The music is also clearly a unified theme, as well as a Tuber and Drum Player in the Dixiereland band, which is also on stage and funerals. Each scene has a sum from the music, which only links to a sequence with others.) A huge storm outside the scene of many scenes , Violent rain, people in it, thunder thru it all over it Ibite sounds like a war. It combines the tone and impresses that similar scenes are happening on very rare snowy days. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Anderson Unveils a Swedish winter toxicity, but it sparkles with the intelligent, delicate fine-grained color of the director, which ends with each smile. One almost never knew piercing could be so beautiful. (Or perhaps one: Alex Socraur has sometimes made such an impact in different perspectives.) There is a kind of stability between visual and completely visible styles in film, visual pacing and individual humanism, which is the overall view. Quiet, assured that there is something completely about master style. <br /> <br /> Not everything works equally. Someone may feel indifferent to the succession of related scenes, which can sometimes be read more like Saturday Night Live authors' work for Peyke's needs. Since some scenes make you move or laugh easily, it is clear that others fall in a little flat. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are a definitive winning dream of a real jigger, and clear magic - and another important thread of the dream is fantastic), among which the girl group has favored herself inside the married dress inside her married dress. Married to his Fayette Guitarist ideals, who played a blue series series and praised the crowd The big windows are gathered outside. The aspect switches outwards and the window slides go slowly so that the dream bride looks out of the building, leaving a train to take her honeymoon from a station. This is a fresh, delicate, and rather glorious influence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, everything seems to be in you (Leventon) is a dream, where Barren always strikes a bronze bell. The last order is announced, where all the torpedad customers come from their table and go to drink more. <br /> <br /> An Italian critic called it "a small, great movie" and it's right. It is limited in a dozen ways itself, but it has greatness. Roy Anderson is a small master (like some medieval mini-experts) in the Scandinavian Gloom comedy, and it is a film opposite another film. This year, an ear is shown as a "non-Seren Reese" selection, it is also the Swedish entry for Best Foreign Oscar in 2007. It's hard to say what Bergman thought, but Anderson worked with him; Famous for its widely-produced TV commercial, one of which can see YouTube. Bergman called them "the best advertising in the world". It would be interesting to see that this director, whose craftsmanship is fine as his vision, will start working in some time. Meanwhile, a good movie buff must see it. <br /> <br /> "Shadowfread" is not quite correct words. That means the pleasure of others suffering. Anderson is giving us all the pleasure to be sad.
