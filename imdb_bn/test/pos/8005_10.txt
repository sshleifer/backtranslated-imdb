Many of us can accept art only when superiority touches deep inside us. That is, the completed creations are only acceptable and can be appreciated if we personally are related to it. It was winter, here in Australia in 1992, I saw Batman returns in movies and it blows me off. Both "mine". I was supposed to belong to a standard, a value, but at the same time I had another life. Tim Burton was the first film producer, it is called dark for a comic movie and it's okay that darkness can happen to all of us. After Batman's explanations of Tim Burton, many other dark comic books and floods of anti-heroogy films are flooded. For decades, comic book folk talked friendly, well-liked heroes to the spectacular sunny and magical superstar flying in the sky, and toured from their wrists on a powerful web and used to wear red boots and had the power of an engine. But what happens when you are ten years old and your parents see the death penalty in front of your eyes? You snap Somewhere in your mentality, your young gentle soft breaks break up. The only way to manage pain and injury is to create an alternative personality. You are a promise Your other self will be strong, use all the rage that all the offenses can be used in any way to make your parents' innocent person guilty of criminal, criminal, offender. This life is seen through the eye of Bruce Wayne. Both pairs. He sees the darkness of the world, depressed, and cold. Although he rolls on the street and people hear him cruise, they do not go to the street to get his signature. He is not the winner of their Savior, a personality contest. About losing Batman Returns. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains "the only man in the city". Bruce Wayne legally arrested Max Shrek did not get arrested. Penguin can not express the pain of withdrawing Gotham's citizens from his parents, and Selina Kyl is permanently lost for being psychologically divided and fatal. And the hero does not get a girl or a cat. This movie is confused among the wishes of all of us so that they want to be so involved in a lot of hardships, such as Bruce Wayne and Oswald Koblopt. All of us are listening, respected and not ignored by Selina Kyle, Oswald and certainly Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all suppressing one way or the other, to behave in a certain standard, we are called to be an ideal. Finally until we snap. We hope that at the end of the film, there will be a catamon in the sky at night. But can we all wish for good wishes to men and women? For me, I can not say that I will reach a point where I believe that my problem will be reconciled with duality. But okay. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of Batman films, it is an amazing parody of true storytelling.
