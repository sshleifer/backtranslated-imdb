It took me about a year after writing about this image. The Lord knows that I wanted to, after witnessing, I knew I saw something that I had not seen before but was not sure why. After being reflected for a while now, I know that I still can not think of these characters yet. <br /> <br /> In a short time the story from a relative (Yusuf) gradually describes. Raulal town photographer (Mahmut) hopes to find a job and live very well. But it becomes clear that after understanding the idea of ​​Yusuf a sailor and his employment prospects, he is really looking for something else, some purpose of his life. <br /> <br /> Through all these souls we are doing a search very well that the season is taken through the neighborhood. The context in which they happen will be visible in 2 special cases when the girl following Yusuf will suddenly meet his significant other and in the face of Yusuf's face he will see a basket of fish and shots and light. His torture face reflected off. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is not actually trying to find a job and forced to tell her to leave The scene is very simple but there is a sense of true heartache. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Each of these two people can see a piece of their reflection and reflections.
