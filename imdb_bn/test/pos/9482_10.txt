Since the Beatles Anthology has finally been released, these two DVD sets can be one of the best music DVDs ever, starting from the last song "Hole Gown Grove" hit "Hole Lota Gawa" at the beginning of this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this DVD is the disc 1, a complete concert and many television presentations. For example, Royal Albert is in the concert DVD, as well as some of the best performance of the last concert in Kenworth Band. <br /> <br /> For example, at the Royal Albert Hall Concert, there was a lot of room to improve the band. Jimmeyer's guitar solos has created a huge rock-power ballad "Dr azed and confused", it was in Led Zeppelin Eye. A promotional video for it. Led Zeppelin third song "immigrant songs" hit. One of Zeppelin's most difficult rocking songs is similar to Sketchy as a pre-MTV video, but by Jimi Page it shows a lot more guitars, it was taken from live performance. After the video is over, we're filling up the seats in Madison Square Garden with a small picture of the character. The following performance was supposed to be as part of "The song remains the same", but not cut. The songs were both appearing as "Black Dogs" and "The Ocean" nice rock. <br /> <br /> After Madison's performance, we were treated with the Earl Court. The coating has played mostly part of the Japelin Square, as is Zeppelin's most popular song, "Stereo to Henen". It's always brighter, always more than the fourth version. Finally, for the end of 5+ hours of live elements, the final concert of Laban Zepelin in Cabaret in August 1979. Seeing it as a spectator, they acknowledge that the voice of Robert Plant is becoming deeper and deeper than all the screams of the past and it is clear here. Like songs like "Kashmiri" and "In the Snunning", the old voice of the plant does not increase, yet, in "Full Lota Love", it comes back for another song. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best musical DVD releases, next to the set of "Beatles Anthology" box, which was released earlier in 2003. Like the Beatles DVD, 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital both give you a feeling of standing on their side with actors on-the-stage, as you will feel in Beatles DVD while doing jamming in the studio. Although the Beatles and the Led Zeppelin variety bands, however, each of them got different DVDs. Although this set comes in only two disks compared to the five disc beetles set, but after the content it has gone, it fills the audience very much. Sunlight starts singing when the joy of seeing it again and again due to uninterrupted power on the stage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
