I love 17, and favorable Muppet fan, and Treasure Island, Christmas Carroll and Great Muppet Sipper, The Muppets Movie is absolutely worth it to stay there with the best. It's very entertaining, thanks to the Jerry Zodiac snap script, and the film looks pretty beautiful with the number of protected songs. While talking about the songs, I really liked them, sure they were not the best song score of the Muppate franchise, but they were very nice to hear, especially never before. The first of my favorite Muppate songs ever before is First Time It's Happens and Professional Pirates. As usual the muppets were sparkling, chemistry between the happy moms Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie was particularly great. And from Steve Martin to Richard Priyor, from Claudius Lichmann, from Madeline Kane (what's the same wonderful actress who has made a guest appearance, in which a memorable guest appearance is made, if you do not scuttle the muppets in a superb movie, be careful.
