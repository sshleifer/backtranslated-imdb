People criticize the NSNA because it is the low point of bonding of the bond god Shan Connery and it is unauthorized. *** Spoiler may be * First, this movie is better than any other bonded film with any other actor, than any other bond film, all the sub paramanges in my book. Shaun Connie is the only real bond, nobody came closer to his strengths, good looks and sexual appeal. Yes, this film is a low point in Konari's bond carrier, but it is still the 80th highest serial film of Bond. San Connie is the only bond actor who is good at old age. She did not become a bag-like mess like Moore, but kept her good looks and strength, but got some gray hair. So what? hes still still 007 real, and he is as cool, and hard as ever. Shan Connie is one and only 007. And this movie is worth watching, no matter what someone is saying. No gun barrel is open, but you can not have everything, you? Great theme songs, though.
