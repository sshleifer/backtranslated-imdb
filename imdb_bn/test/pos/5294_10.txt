I heard news from Anime legendary Haibo Miyazaki about this movie, and I also wanted to see it. But I was lucky in the online image of YouTube; After watching the film, I knew it was another Miyazaki / studio Ghibli Classic. <br /> <br /> My favorite fairy-tale "The Little Mermaid" was an inspiration film named after the 5-year-old son Sosuke and his relationship with Sonarfish Prince, whose name is Ponyo, who was a man and lived with Sosuke. I will not tell you more details, you will see the film for yourself. So one of the best animated movies of all time, with imagination, courage and humor ... I like it!
