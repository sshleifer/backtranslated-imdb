* Spoiler can contain, read only after the last episode season 2 * Think about it. The answer is on the pole? The center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They said something about: "Did we miss it again?" So there was another abnormality? Of course when the plain crashes! I think this whole island is a setup. Set up by his parents. She found out about it and was looking for her Desmond. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's all fake. There are all the signs. Fake beads, fake doors, fake medicines, fake monitoring stations, fake air shafts, which can be nothing. This is actually a project, and because of the final scene of the season 2, I know it's Desmond, her chick and her father (and probably Liby, she is weird, maybe she has something to do with her, she's probably going to have something to do with the disaster, okay now Going away). <br /> <br /> Also in this episode, Henry Gail told Michael to go to some coordinates, and he would be saved. This is probably some sort of door in magnetic shield. "Once you leave, there is no other way." <br /> <br /> I think it's still quite clear, though I still have many questions and hope to get the answer for next season. If you think about what you learned in the 1st and 2nd season, I am sure we will load the answers in the season. <br /> <br /> You can not wait <br /> <br /> Can you agree on this theory? Hope to hear from you ...
