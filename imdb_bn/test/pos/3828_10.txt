I just thought I would add another observation, thinking. There is a couple of visible sub-references in this episode, due to the possibility of an improper feeling between Jim Kirk and Yevon Jones Rand; In the end there is a special, physically tender, moment. When the potentially deadly Romulan Plasma ball of the enterprise is upset at the speed of emergency, trying to end Janice seriously, they are likely to come to a dramatic end in life, they want to seek their comfort by keeping their head on sympathetic shoulder towards Jim, and their upcoming ruins at the main viewer . I was sweet (and Janice, of course, gorgeous!). <br /> <br /> (ps guff: - Most of the time, when firing the supposed phasors, the film shows the photon torpedo being introduced)
