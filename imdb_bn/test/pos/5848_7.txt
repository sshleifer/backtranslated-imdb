Not bad but loads can be good, also seems to follow a major diet for crime drama. You've got Sandra Bullock, who feels it is difficult for the police to work with others, you have kept him with a new partner. There is a closed case, but any police work on it, and there are lines in the film's many corners that you want to scream. <br /> <br /> But if you can see the past of the formulaic elements then the secret below the good films. It's gripping and subplots work for me. Well worth a rental but probably not a purchase.
