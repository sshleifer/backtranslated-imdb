TV newscaster Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and his radical cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are in a nuclear power plant when a serious accident occurs. The plants managers play it down but Adams has filmed it all. Wells and Adams try to get it in the air but the plants running plants prevent it. Plant executive Jack Goodle (Jack Lemon) understands that there are serious problems and the tests prove to be false. He tries to get the officer to believe in him - only they know it. Wells, Adams, and Godel are in danger all their lives. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a movie theater in 1979. I was only 17 years old and I got scared to be stupid. To make matters worse, the three-mile island island accident makes the movie more realistic at this time. It does not scare me for more than 20 years, but it is still an excellent film - it acts as a mystery, a playful play and the publication of nuclear energy industry. One of his best roles, such as the wool (with red hair) - is that he fully expresses his character's growing doubts and horrors when he realizes that nuclear disasters can happen. Lemon (always as) is excellent. She started out to believe in her company and work and she starts to discover things starts to slowly discover. He was nominated for the Academy Award for this. Douglas is well but has a small part of it and it is completely shaded by Lemon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> A truly awesome movie - the best of 70's. Do not miss this one!
