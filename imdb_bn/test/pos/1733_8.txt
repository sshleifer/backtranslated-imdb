As a child I was never in a situation where I could have been introduced to Dr. and although I heard about this series, I really did not understand what it was like. Then, I was a little hesitant that I was sitting at the ninth doctor and his antics watching that he was Arthur Dent (from Hitachi's Guide to Galaxy) but cool things were said. I can not believe what I was missing, seriously, why did not anyone tell me about this before? My entire childhood doctor who was deprived; I'm having an extraordinary fan of the most sci-fi and fantastic events. Frankly, I've enjoyed it perfectly and look forward to a future episode. <br /> <br /> I would like to admit that Billy Piper will be the best actress but I'm happy to say it so well, I thought, and added a very realistic touch of the series. I think, in fact, the series was one of my favorite aspects; The contrast between the great contradiction scenes in contrast with the terrible naturalness of the estate life of the South London Council. I am always interested in events where the ideas of the people of the world are widely challenged and how people can take a situation and edit it in their mind so that it matches their old life. I like Christopher Eccleston. I did not see most of his films and I never said Hu did not see another actor, but I think the doctor's screenplay is bright, very favorite, and still dark enough to be surprised. I tend to be a bit bi-dimensional of many other characters with its sort of history of its character; They all have the right emotions and actions, but they always feel a little shallow. On the other hand, this doctor, to achieve my loyalty with her laminated personality. I agree with other comments that special effects, a high budget for aliens and ketot, may be somewhat effective. But then again, it is about special effects (though they help) which I have read and which have been for a long time. It really is that the whole thing is the soul of the count. And I do not think they did bad things with them. I liked all aliens but my favorite would be Delix; If you see the series before. Before that I knew something, it was such that there was something like dust dipped in the wheels. Before I could see, I suspected the existence of humanity as a threat to humanity, but there were some scary among them! Which I love, of course. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good show. I look forward to future episodes with joy. Doctors have a new fan.
