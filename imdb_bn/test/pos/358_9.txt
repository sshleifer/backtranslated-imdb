One of Chaplin's longest films, Carmen Boules, is a cute and wonderful parody of the famous story "Prosper Marymeyer" about the story "Karsen". I was a little confused about the difference between Carmen and the 1915 edition of IMDB's 1915 Burkeske. Based on the current time, I suppose I saw the 1915 edition, since I am 20 minutes better since 1916, and 20 unnecessary and overwhelming minutes from what I read. Very quick, it is clear that Carmen's one of the most complex and ambitious efforts of Broom's Chaplin, beginning with a long story, tells the story of tragic love through inter-title, Karmen's <br /> <br / > Carmen is sent by a band of GPCs ("A band who holds GPPP in GPP."), To lure the Spanish officer in order to lure him Could manage to stop the smuggling. It is a clever, chaplain's band of the perpetrators, whose leader, Lilas Pasia, has learned to steal for 50 years, thinking that she could offer "a job in politics". <br /> <br /> <br /> In the past, I saw some superstitious messages and jokes in the past, but it is probably not enough like this. At the beginning of the film, during the trip to the Gypsy band, a scene where mules and women are being loaded and an inter-title explains that "archways have long ears." If you could not say, I guess. <br /> <br /> Chosen by Chaplin Karmen, the owner of the Haps Officer Dawn Josh. She is described as "a brave soldier and woman lover". Not quite right for Chaplin, who, after a few years, expressed doubts about the ability to play a playful anime in bright shoulder surgery. And of course, she does not have to be working women's lovers. <br /> <br /> Here's what is different, its polished military uniform and straight background punitive methods, of course interspersed, of course, with some of its traditional slap-stick moves. He strikes me as a small man in the positions of the authorities, struggling to maintain respect to his subordinates by a cow, firm outflow. <br /> <br /> Soon Carmen enters ("96% of love by all men under the age of ??"), and he immediately started flirting with Charlie. I should mention that for the majority of this movie, it was surprisingly loyal to the original story, which was full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is incredibly believable as a jealous boyfriend, I am able to evoked a shocking emotion that I have never seen from him. At least one scene where he really is a little scary. <br /> <br /> There are some great scenes in Chaplin's films, such as a sunny table dance and some classic swords that are fighting in the end. And the charm of his youth and the role of a soldier must definitely be the winning combination, although there is another strange stunt that is a huge door associated with a group of men, which was not very effective at the beginning, but only continued and perhaps more than five times There was more value. Although it was interesting that when it finally fell on it, it was clearly revealed as a movie prop. I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie set. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is the most powerful part of it. It feels like Romeo and Juliet to be interesting, but when you think that Chaplin is going away from his traditional style and going to conduct a major content test, I have found that there is a sunny package like the wine chaplin. Excellent work!
