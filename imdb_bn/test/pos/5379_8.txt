One wonderful underlying gem with this cool performance and a fantastic finish! All the letters are great, and the stories were awesome, plus I was really cool last! The plot was great, and it does not disturb me, plus when child actor was bad, they gave me the cripps! It happened a while ago on the space channel, so I agreed to tap it and check it out, I read some good reviews from fellow fans, I must agree with them, it is very unclear and suspicious, plus St Martin other, as the worshiper of Satan, his The role was fantastic. It has a lot of wonderful atmosphere and it keeps you guessing throughout life, and all the characters were very favorite and you really started to root for Ben and his family! It has a lot of annoying moments, and the film has disappointed me sometimes, plus it is very good at low budget! It's a terrific underlying gem, with cool performance and a fantastic finish! I highly recommend this one! Directions are very good! Bernard McKeetty works very well here, works great cameras, creates a very terrific environment and holds the movie at a fast pace! Thar blood and a little bit of gore. We get a mud foot, many bloody bodies, bloody throat, slicing and dicing, decapitation, and an impaling. Nice acting! Strother Martin is fantastic here! As the worshiper of Satan, he was extremely vague, very believable, quite cold, was extremely intense, looked to enjoy himself, and did a fantastic job as a whole! Charles Butman is great as a father, he is very careful, very liked, and gave a good show !, I liked him a lot. L.Q. Just like Jones Sheriff, he was funny, on things, very young, was a great character, and just did a great job! Ahna Capri was as good as girlfriend and she was quite good at what she did. Charles Robinson practiced as a prist and could not convince me! And her smile was particularly bad. Geri Reischl was actually modest as a girl, she was somewhat liked, and got only a few times on my nervous, I rather liked her. Alvy Moore was a fool, but as a very favorite star in his role, I dug him! Cast is not good. Overall I highly recommend! *** 1/2 out 5
