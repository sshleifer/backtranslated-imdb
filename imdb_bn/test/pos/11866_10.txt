A very funny movie. If Michael Douglas is eligible to show this "Dosage" for any other reason. I would like to see more of this less life role. <br /> <br /> This image stopped me like a rosemone in America, because it was American and did not need any stain subtitles! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~ said, "I had to smile on my face." The visual show is not he smile and clearly a guy who does not smile, but probably does not know it. 2. The last scene in Goodman, his cop was perfect for the uniform on the uniform and was related to the La Raised Reaper who was jumping on the table ... and two of them were not homosexual for the other characters. Who will happen in the scene - this alone alone deserve a special comedy Academy Award.
