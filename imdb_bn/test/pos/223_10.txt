Two years later, 'Biman!' Lesnie Nilssen, starring Jim Abraham, Jerry and David Zucker, is one of the stars in this starring series, a grand offing of old American detective groups as 'Drugnate'. Nilson played Frank Drebin, the answer to the American answer 'Inspector Clausau'. It was the same style of humor as 'Biman'! Junk characters such as cute visual gags, strangers, absurdities, and Johnny shoes shoes in the background seem to know everything about everything. The guest-star (along with William Shutner!) Was killed in opening credits. The 'Police Squad' was the first US city of 'Batman' for the lack of Hat track. Many have expressed regret that only six episodes have been made, but I think it was correct. This concept could not survive the entire 24-phase run. Five years later, 'Police Squad' was successfully transferred to the big screen, when the 'nude gun' triangle was first released. Jim, Jerry, David, and Leslie had the last smile.
