Completed on the top budget of the twentieth century, this cheap quarter-minute minute delightful Parody George Lucas legendary '77 Stee-fi blockbuster 'Star Wars' is the most contagious fool-proof imaginable. Writer / director Arnie Fossilas winner and often combinations of humorous sound effects, continuous action scenes, freak (away from) special effects (you only love Chess scraped-on-film lasers, tinfil asteroid and family ... I mean , Spaceships roam towards a clear wire), poorly doped into dialogue, shame Ajanakabhabe be played, and Richard Wagner, classical music, "bhyalakarisera journey." Characters are properly presented in a wide stroke; My favorite honey whimp flake Starbaker, respected JD Knight Aggi "Ben" cookie, and the hated arch-bear Darf Nader (who does not understand anything but unknown laziness). Moreover, the 4-queen-3 is clearly based on the tin man from "The Wizard of Oz", but the Art Deco must be the perfect vacuum cleaner. The true masterstroke of this film describes the story of legendary voice actor Supreme Paul Fries; Fries' deliciously rich and sticky hatric tones connect with significantly stupid, but tongue-in-cheek marriages (favorite lines: "You will laugh! You will kiss three coins!") Total hoot
