I like this movie. Many people refer to it as "feminist of Sabrina teenager". They work with Melissa Joan Heart's most movies. Yet he surprised me in this movie because he was wonderful in Maryam's part when his roommate got raped and fought for justice. You can say that the heart was very strong in this film and it was shown. I liked Lisa Dewan Ryan as Mary Roommate. She was very effective to feel sorry for her character after the rape. Josh Hopkins was as violent and arrogant rapist as well. Lochlin Munro played her character firmly. The performance of this movie is better than most of the TV movies, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> While the movie was quite predictable. Also, I expected more from the end, it was very casual. Delivery may have been better. But performance and overall plot made for this problem.
