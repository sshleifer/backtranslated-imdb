This was my late wife's favorite film. I'm sorry he did not live long enough for the video because I'm sure he left it. What can we say Pushing off a great romantic story and two great men, Raisuli and Teddy Rex. In this role Shan Connery and Brian Keith are great. But while Connie was in her normal sexual relationship, it was late Brian Keith who gave strong performance to our monarchy Teddy Roosevelt. The abducting American widow, is giving back-up with Candy Bergen, gorgeous among her early 30's. The great back-up also came from John Haystown, Teddy's helpless secretary, John Hey; Jaffrey Lewis, as hesitant US ambassador to Clint Eastwood films, is like Gammeye. The cane's Vladimir Schwabal is much too big with a physically ill view, and much more is given by Steve Connley and Ray Jensen, in the face of which we have seen in many backgrounds. After all, it is a movie filled with a wonderful romance that has long been an attention centre. Stupid story definitely no. Things like pushing for their own selfish interests are often the same as that of older people today. Too much romantic? Not really - certainly no sense maudlin Have fun to see? You bet I own the video and it will meet again and again. I advise to do the same thing.
