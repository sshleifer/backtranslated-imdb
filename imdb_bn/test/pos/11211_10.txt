I am very grateful that in the little college Abingdon, V.V. - Bristol, TN. And at the famous Bert Theater house where Gregory Pack once played - an art festival festival was directed to the madman and there to show the film there. Aubidon is where I live for two hours and an hour, but it was worth the travel in every sense of travel. UZAK / DISTANT is a wonderful, bright, blurry, emotional, captivating film. As a Turkish-American, this image was not as much a witness as in life like in Turkey; But on the larger scale it wants to be in Turkey, whether it is Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York, or Omaha, whether it wants to be in the world. It can be two hours long in contrast to five minutes, but it's effectively our Bob Marley song. There are many wonderful scenes in this movie. It's very hard to choose a random few. But, for me, a visible scene is held in a bayogulu (downtown istanbul) movie. Mehmet Emin Toprak's acting title character, who died shortly after the film's completion, follows a very interesting young woman under the head of the film's main auditorium. He sees "Vanilla Sky." The image of Tom Cruise is reflected from a glass, we think that Turkish men are competing against their Tom Cruise to defend their own women, although the Tom Cruise is not available in the bioglot. Bosphorous shot scenes across the coast are very revealing as they symbolize beauty, still frustrated on the empty farm, in which Turkey is a painful reality. In this picture, the bay separates lovers and families. Sassmun (Turkish brand) A simple, empty packet of cigarettes and a dead mouse jump outside the screen, in 1982 serif goren-eelmaz song "Yol" directed the tricks. Many of the music films, including "Yol", "Sue-The Herd" (completed by 1978-Jackie Oken) and "Father-Father" (1971), have been considered as best Turkish films. Occasionally sometimes without social-political anger (especially in his last film, the 1983 prison drama "Duauer-the-Wall"), "distance" significantly captures the essence of Turkish life. This is a major success for a director who can be declared as Turkic equivalents in my view, like Turkic, Bresnan and Ozu. I can not wait to see her other movies!
