I do not think there really are any spoilers here, but if I describe some fun scenery, I'll check the box that 'spoiler might be' for staying on the safe side 'says. Now ... <br /> <br /> I know where to start. Till now you know the basic framework of the story - horse trader Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Junior), a Mormon Wagon train operates their 'promised land' in the west and also faces various types of side. Trial and interesting characters, most notably the Outlaw Clegg family. <br /> <br /> Anyone can enjoy this movie. You do not have to be like a fan of Western one this one. One thing, Johnson and Kerry are the fastest two characters you can see. Especially the worm animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - Johnson is a little quiet and intelligent, like an old brother. I'm out of the scene where they sell their 'gentle horse' for ten dollars for Sheriff; Then tell him that there is some specialty of the horse "- you can talk about failure" ... Trasie put Sandy on the shoulder, who stays with the new horse on the shoulder of the sheriff, on the wild flood. His face, like a horse, eventually pushed him away and went away. <br /> <br /> Attention to the song ... Even if you never thought you would be a fan of Pianor's children, listen to "Shade in the dust" because the wagon train was shown at the speed of some people walking between the wagons. This is really a beautiful song - it is very bad in just half a minute or more movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Six groups of horses climbed the top of the mountain, they were not easy and easy movies. It will be risky for actors, stunt people and animals as well. Streaming the rivers also, there are plenty of effective steps involved in the movement of the wagon train in this movie. It should be noted that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were both highly skilled riders, have been doing many years of experience, riding, and all types of cowboy-type things. Carey grew up on a farm where his family appointed many Navajo Indians and actually he learned to speak Naho before learning to speak English. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the mouth ... starts bucking the horse, finally throwing him off. Denver told Travis to see the face of Sandy's face, 'I'm sorry your horse is closed.' Harry Care Junior (Sandy) joins with Mormons when another favorite scene in my mine is mine. They are working back to prepare their gear, and after scandal with Sandy another colleague, both of them get in a rear-end bumping match which moves fast rolling. Even after the Elder (Ward Bond) standing and separating them, the two fighters are trying to get to each other. Mormon (known as 'Jackson' in the movie) Sandie received a final kick that hit her shoulder. It's a really fun scene from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I do not know about any other good stories, very compelling characters, beautiful scenery and lots of entertainment that are compatible with entertainment, and some plays, besides what I can say about this movie. Oh, it's colorful, at least I have seen the version; The most beautiful color film you'll ever see but I like it black and white. I give this one ten and I do not give out 10 lots. Without doubt is one of my favorite movies. And, judging by other comments, I have a lot of companies in that assessment.
