The film was a remake of an "Mitra Friend Charles" series in the BBC series of 1956, and in such a short time, such violence took place through elements. I think it is fast, fun, enjoyable and neutral. Does anyone else view the scenes? Where is John Mills being awake? - The producers apparently decided to remove the censorship? But, when he sits beside the flat window, watch after the deep breathing with a similar window with the same window. Francis Doobridge's serials lived in the same universe, which is unclear, people who do not seem to be and anyone close to villain heroes / victims. In some ways an expected universe, but with its own rules and regulations.
