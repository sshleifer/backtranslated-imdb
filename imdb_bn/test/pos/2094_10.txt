What I found was even better. <br /> <br /> I have been waiting for this time as much as I have commented recently. Especially after that I saw another film by Tusiakia Twoddar, "Blue Spring" which is easily available on my best 20 favorite movies. I liked the trailer for "9 souls", and I sounded it very well. I do not hear anything bad about it. Now I know why <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie starts as a comedy, then in the last half of the film it becomes something else faster. It became more dramatic as each character faces their own tragedy. Each character gets enough screen time, and you care about what happens to each of them. Although there are 9 characters, we only have to learn within two hours and take care, Tashihaki Toyoda shuts it brightly. <br /> <br /> I saw "blue spring" and I hope at soundtrack it is a little better, as it was in that picture. I got my wish, because the "9 Souls" soundtrack was incredible. The music used in each scene, more specifically, more dramatic ones, is simply simply surprising. I love it every second. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that I want to see another Tusi Ki Tododa film, "Pornostar", but after seeing it, I'm going. Clearly. Also, because I read the plot for it, and I think it's really good. I'm expecting it. On R1 DVD of "9Soul", Twoddar has two interviews. She said she completed another movie, and she would like to start writing screenplay for her next. I can not wait for both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this picture. You certainly see it. now.
