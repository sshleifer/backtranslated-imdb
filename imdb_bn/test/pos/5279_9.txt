Miazaki has done her mosaic since the 70s and recently her movies have become the coast of America through Disney, and fans are excited about her great talent. Ponyo no exception. Although some of his other films were somewhat more accessible to the American audience, its presentation could be a bit of a trip to something like "Japanese". For the same reason, POM Poko does not give too much knowledge to "Japanese" and US audiences, so there are some elements of Pinoy. This growth, hope, and friendship should not be separated from you by seeing this funny movie. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki is very broad and magical animations and stories which contain elements of wonder and fiction. Uses its characteristic characteristic and often uses it as the main character of girls and girls. He moved away from his zone with Pioneer because the main character is a small boy who lives with his mother in a small village in the sea, when his father is working on the ocean. Although not alone, Sasu is like any other enthusiastic boy who likes the adventure and attraction of the sea. As disappearing, we can see the world and the world of the sea, and I think that Miyazaki can try to attract the attention of the spectators of the vast and invisible nature of living under the sea, and that we and our recognitions are different. <br /> <br /> I managed to see this past year's subtitle version and was pleased by the story and plot. Miyazaki claims that "this is my last film" for many years but after being spiritually, he gave us the Hawles Moving Castle. Ponyo has surely proved that Miyazaki has hung on his spark and always continues to enjoy, innovate and progress the most creative animated films. See Ponyo with an artistic imagination and imagination of an open mind and hat and back when you were more important than secret place to hide the secret of firefight and secret hidden places to eat up the stuff and eat your vegetables.
