I am surprised with the negative reviews of this photo. If you do not like this movie for it - a stupid, final, top story - then you're just reading it too much. This picture is a classic story of a crowd of "life" and a crowd trying to flee from troubles that follow her. Michelle Pfeiffer is horrific 80's' jersey, who is an uncertain, uncomfortable crowd wife, while Matthew Modine watches an incredible retentive crowd like those who fall for the police. The plot is mostly expected and cutesy and the Mercedes Ruel is stolen as the Queen of the show Mobile Wives. If you are not looking for something very dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80's classic classic. You can not stop watching if you start.
