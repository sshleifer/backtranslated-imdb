When I was told about this movie, I was not happy to see it, though, through the last achievement I have ever seen one of the best films. <br /> <br /> This movie itself is quite graphic (Male view from male, you can not see everything) If not, then there will be no gay-themed movie ... <br /> <br /> This film is also with humor Light is hearty and there are some interesting parts in it. I highly recommend this movie, in about 3 quarters you really feel for the main characters, and this is what I think brings together the whole flick. <br /> <br /> Put together again very neatly. Plus intelligent Mormon.
