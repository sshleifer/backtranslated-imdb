In the case of many such films, my non-Catholicism came to my understanding. The church has these mass rules that have been gathered for centuries. We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at the price of the face. Then, some bad guys have to take revenge for a long time rebellion against them, working under these rules and trying to prevent them, and you have this book and the movie. I thought to myself, "It's pretty cool why did they do it?" This is the occasion of Robert Langdon's character where the problem does not matter, he always seems to move the first step correctly. I think it is like looking at the CSI where they solve the incredibly complex cases in some time of the day. They know the land of the country. There is so much land and so little time to understand what is going on in this film. But if you create Robert Langdon, you have to work on him. That's right because brave men like him have been saved forever. I thought the picture was funny. I was very fun with the vanei code. People are not as interesting and bad as they seem. Look at it and do not stop for a second, a wonderful.
