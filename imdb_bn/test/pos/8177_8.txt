This movie is excellent (I saw the French version). Many subpotts (which usually stuck from the whole), but they are nicely released and combined with the main theme "Discover Your Real Search". In fact, the whole movie (without its background) is the journey of invention of one (or anyone else) soul. Is the king really "good soldier king" who is trying to "fight for the end of all the war" or is he just an annoyed, blood thirsty hoodlum? Is he the true king? Queen Mother's Care is just a lively, career-driven, spineless sock doll or rather sharp thoughts, brave person? Dame / mistress can understand who the king really is? What is the king and the old chancellor? Everyone knows the secret but will not tell? The real reason is because the killer has left his "job"? Subplots (which I do not particularly like) are handled well and keep an eye on the end. The scenes are well-formed and the CGI fits nicely without passing. Suspense is properly maintained and the actors task up. There are many laughs of brain damage, but what is the way to behave in the court of the court (as the Dame complains to the complainant). Realistic Movies without Superhero Moments This Chinese movie really keeps Hollywood Cardboard Coloslar (Gladiator etc.) for shame.
