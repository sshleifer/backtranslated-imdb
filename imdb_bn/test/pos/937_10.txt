I feel a loss, so this photo is bright. Kieslowski is a writer, a philosopher; And when a great filmmaker, his greatness is in his writings; And "red" is its ideal. This film is a metaphysical research by the artist's judgment in the creation of his fictional world; How can an artist try to revive the life - even through his own art, he can not escape from the knowledge, even though how he engages himself in his story, is still fantastic and he is still to revive the world beyond him, yet his dissonance and the reality of life Which he tried to artificially rebuild. And magically, the fate and fate of all these love and the characters living in this story are not the smallest degree in spending an amazing story about this pre-fortune fate. If I had to choose, I could never nominate this greatest film.
