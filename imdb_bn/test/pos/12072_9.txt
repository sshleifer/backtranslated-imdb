I dried like a little girl at the end of this movie and I dared to catch up with someone else's help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is able to support the family when she has gone, she took off her children before shuffles. The role really deserves an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You really feel for this poor family because a mortal mother lets her ensure that her family is not finished with orphaned orphaned systems. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it - you can get it.
