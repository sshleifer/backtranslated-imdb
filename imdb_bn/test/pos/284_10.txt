With the clear exception of flowers and horses, I thought David Jason was the best series. <br /> <br /> Do not adjust your set 'directly after its TV debut!' These 13 episodes have been released in the old silent cinema day and not comic timing. Compared to, Porridge, open all the hours and does not stop that awesome series 'Lucky Man'. <br /> <br /> I believe Jason is banned from repeating the series because it showed him his rawest. It's over. A new generation is worthy of this. The series has actually flopped in ratings, but it is probably due to it that it was shown against 'Brothers', which was broadcast at BBC at the same time, VCRs were common earlier. <br /> <br /> I just noticed his long misery assistant, Spencer, Mark Eden played; Allan Bradley Collision Street Closed. I did not try to kill Edgar Briggs!
