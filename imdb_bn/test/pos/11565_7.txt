This is a tricky little French silent comedy that a man hesitated to believe that he could not stay in the castle for an hour because he was frustrated. And, once the man entered the house, it looks more like a mad house or LSD effect! Although there are ghosts and skelets, there is strange laziness of animals, strange special effects and gag. It is very hard to describe but alone visuals make the movie worth watching. However, realize that self-motivated directors were also many "funny mess" that completely flatten and hit the film. Her "camera tricks" were not so cute but annoying and stupid. Continue to Ignator and Watching - it gets better. The film is fast paced, fun and worth watching. In particular, I really liked watching Max Leander played and mugging - he was so expressive and funny! Too bad he forgot today. For an interesting but very sad reading, see the biography of IMDb on her.
