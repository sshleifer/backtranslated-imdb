Inside Eye Dancing (Rory O 'was here) is the story of two strangers, Rory O'Sa'a, who is almost completely restless and limited to wheelchairs, and Michael Kennley who has become weak by MS and also has limited it. Wheelchair <br /> <br /> Set in Ireland, the picture has reached the surviving center with Rory. He finally made friends with Michael, but after a few exciting scenes, Rory usually rebelled against the rebels, using "rebellious, irrational and general objection" against staff and other patients in the "movie way". His upliftment friendship with Michael is convinced by the fact that Rory only understands Michael, or is willing to try at least. Finally, some application of pensions and tribulations are given, and given, specially adapted apartments have their own own residence rights. The apartment was provided by Michael's father, who originally abandoned him from his disability. To help them in their daily life, two of the famous assistants (played by Romola Garai) are named Sivan. This is basically where the film's crooks develop as a development for them. Michael is particularly hit hard. Unfortunately, for both, but especially for Michael, Siobhan does not feel the same and leaves him as a result. Michael regresses temporarily and wants to return to Asst. Living Center, Rory convinces him to live on his own. The film ended in a sad note that many viewers might have been coming, but eventually, we feel that Michael has become truly independent and in the future he has his future, because Rory points him to the end of the film. <Br /> <br /> You know, I can not say that I've seen many "disabled films" and I do not know if they can be considered as a certain section. But they have a formula of a formula. Until a person is reluctant to live outside his illness, some freedom fighters force him to do so and inside I can dance. However, what works, perhaps it is more subtle than the peaks and valleys that can pass through two men. There is no deliberately gratuitous moments and no "stand and joy" manipulation. The sad part of the sad part is funny. Some audiences may revisit a bit that Rory does with its nasal ear as a very "rebellious" clich√© with curiosity type of punk, but the actor, James McAvoy, makes it realistic in any way. The same can be said for Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken, it is not called by a poor script to try to do the work of the audience, but a young man is actually about pain on inappropriate love. Many types of pain can relate to whatever their physical condition is. Again, these are some things that exploit the film and make it ruthless by not making many levels enjoyable and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
