In the book book, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who appeared at the JMK Airport on December 31, battled with Thomas J. Ryan (Satan) in the new millennium, and came forward through war through determining the fate of the world. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Hartley has created a strange world in which the general beauty flows through strange and strange creativity - David Symonds (client accountant from Curtant) and strong urban and industrial landscapes are full of bright lights and shadows. Naturally, he introduced seemingly apparently formal descriptions, then brought them back in the sunny and unexpected topics - humor is easy, but chatter and strangers. Hartley has a wonderful ability to build on the mundane and insulting short and rapturous moments together. Naturally, he created a tone which is Zed and the world is tedious but at the same time, weak, open and honest. He was transformed into a lot of humorous language in a few minutes, which is difficult to hold in tears despite the lack of clear emotional expression that is so dead-perfect and perfect that is spiritual and poetic. Another awesome and very entertaining film. Life of Life is shot with a Blu-ray effect (a digital camera?): A lot of current awareness as a result of the sudden crying at the hands of the spiritual hands literally and fragile and swift in present moments. All of Hartley's movies have a way of getting the current priority, but this unique effect cleans the image into the first screen of the screen, but you become increasingly beautiful like sitting on it. The final shot is spectacular. It may seem all that valuable, but the film is a joke and makes fun of it even making fun of the idea of ​​Armageddon, Day of Judgment, and the 'city' concept. Although it is actually quite deep, moving, and guaranteed in life, it is mostly light-hearted and playful. Hartley is developed in his film, acting as the following vowels (a voice which does not get a few people, and requests such an act to be a hall - the same person who has negative reactions on Peter Greenway). Always, are those people who react to this movie and violate the annoying changes of the strike and think of those who are spooky or gimmicky tactics, but who give time to consider such neutral and stigma opinion fools? Anyone in the Heartley fan will love this movie - if they can get a chance to see it, that is to say It's hard to tell what it will be like on the video.
