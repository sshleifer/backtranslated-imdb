I just saw this in cable. I like it It held my interest and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple was extremely well-mistaken and very good. Cinematography is not so big, but it adds a real-life video to reality, so it's a trade off, you know? Occasionally the girl will make New England's pronunciation harder. The pronunciation will come and go sort. However, I thought the film was completed overall as a whole. The story was a strong and dramatic tension because you felt that some of my mysterious mysteries were going on, though things seemed old. Work well in low budget.
