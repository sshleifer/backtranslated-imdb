I have seen this movie at the Sundance Film Festival and I am also surprised that it did not create any more notice because it is not only powerful and nicely designed but very original. The audience was completely involved and the biggest part of watching such a movie is the director and then the opportunity to act in the question-answer session. They literally took us out of our screening room for the next picture - we could have stayed for a long time. The film is thought provoking and ridiculous at the same time. If this movie is not taken for the wider distribution then it would be embarrassing - I hope it will be available in the DVD at least because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I share it with.
