It was a real epic production that was a fiction film that wanted all the elements. Clothing, music, cinematography - all the artistic elements of this movie were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, "Cheers" and "Baker" are well aware of his TV role. The role of Gulliver was excellent. Mary Steinbergen (Time of Time, Cross Creek) performed well in her limited role as her wife. <br /> <br /> Other performance that I really enjoyed is James Fox like Dames Beats, Alfred Wudder as Brooddinger Queen, and Peter O'Toole as Lilliput Emperor <br /> <br /> <br /> An enjoyable children will have to film, but it will certainly apply to adults for deeper, profound commentary.
