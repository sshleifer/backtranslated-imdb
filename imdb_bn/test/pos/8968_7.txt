Consensus is probably the biggest problem in this movie. The film is quick, stylish and starts only with the usual funny political satire, but in the second half of the film, it gets more serious tone, just like Oliver Stone. This is certainly a very serious thing but I would say that the movie will be better and more effective if it is fully completed in the same style then the first part of the film is shot. <br /> <br /> For a biographical film about this film and a movie, the film is very short with its 102-minute running time. That is why the movie seems to be not telling the whole story. However, after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the incident following the events has been indicated in the movie, but the film does not go deeper and does not explain much about it, which just seems to be the cheapest way to glorify Charlie. Wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. The actual events of the movie are also simplified, though the story is still called (unintentional) complex. <br /> <br /> Yes, if the film did not try it would have been better. More light with its style and atmosphere at the time and overall to be so serious. The film, for example, was more like "Wag the Dog", which earned a sense of satirical and sensitive political problems. <br /> <br /> This inconsistent style and method of describing the story, acting performance is also mixed. When Tom Hans plays his character in more games and more ridiculously he's nice. But it only works hard to take its character seriously in the film's more serious and sensitive / frustrating moments. Philip Semu Huffman is always fantastic, though he plays in any film. He received the Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most of the other actors seem to roam around this movie, only in movies. It goes mostly for Julia Roberts, whose character is a fair enough purpose for film. He made an unexpected impression on me and also forgot about this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad surveillance. It is actually quite good and enjoyable, but if the film was brave. It would be a bit more edgier than the movie was probably more effective what was trying to achieve a better and foremost more explicitly. <br /> <br /> 7/10
