If you like Madonna or not, this movie is ridiculous !! I watched Madonna's fan and theater during the liberation war. However, with time it did not lose its silliness and pure fun. Of course, there are some bad lines and chassis acting, but the whole film is simply a sculble comedy that Madonna actually carries with the film's best bombs. He is cute, funny, and the only comedic role of his movie career. Madonna usually plays 'herself' in the role, but in this film she looks like Niki Finn, she really feels like another. The film, however, is directed by James Foly (who plays with Shan Pen and Christopher Walken's dramatic and hunting 'At Close Range') and co-star Grafin Dunn ('Hour of Evers') has thrown brightly and has fun. The story is not talented and does not expect the end of some weather, but if you are in a coma, you will definitely see it if you are a fan of Madonna, fun, clean, 80's, or if you're Madonna fan than it. The soundtrack is very notable, and there are 4 Madonna songs: # 1 hit "Who's That Girl", # 2 Hit "Emotion of Commotion" and the Best and Best of Bollywood's "Love Seekers" (Hit the Top 10 UK) and Years Before the 'True Blue' session, Pop Diet could not live "left" on a left. It is available only on VHS but will soon be available on DVD.
