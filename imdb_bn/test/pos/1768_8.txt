I think, as much as I like in life, but almost five years ago, Opera did not fall into my entertainment choices. Oh, I wanted to know what was wrong; I have seen a number of television productions - especially for public telegraph wagonar ring cycles - to understand the attraction of other people with art forms. And I knew that I could choose parts of different operas (I'm surprised that I am astonished as a child that I liked the snippets of "Madam Butterfly" of "My Geisha" and I was "Munstruct" and "Precious Women" I've enjoyed Opera scenes), but unlike the characters of those films, I just "did not get it" <br /> <br /> 1995, New York City Opera Company's I saw live performance of the "Rigolato" replacement, and at night I got it. "What a wonderful, glorious patron of color, music, and raw emotion! And I mean passion with a capital e! What, I think, the operating music lets the actors work independently and work faithfully in a way that seems vague if their words The conversation is based on everything, depending on the musician and certainly when the music is a magical "Rigletto" one The T-opera can be a great entertainment. <br /> <br /> A sympathetic family member gave me a copy of the 1982 TV version of LaserDesk and I have seen that I can not see live performances, "Rigoletto" ramances live regularly, this video version is a The exquisite options.

The set and costumes are abundant, and the location of the location on the river late in the film comes with a higher sense of story drama, which does not match at any level. <br /> <br /> If you do not ever see "Rigletto," or if you think you do not like Opera or do not want to understand, then I'll find you on the videotap and ask for it to buy or rent. If you do not like it, this product of "rogletto" does not allow you to appreciate the power of the opera industry, all right, leave it and go to something else. But I doubt if I'm new to Opera, then I'll be happy too. <br /> <br /> <br />
