It can not be 10 out of 10 but the joke for me has not failed. When I was younger in the DVD, I had seen it many times, and I smiled every time. Humor is simple and funny, this movie was the only Disney of Flickr. I found out the invisible loop part of the man saw people disappear. These expressions were great extravaganza, if ever this opportunity occurs, I would suggest seeing it for a good Ohh fashion. All my favorite characters in the Dexter series must be Dian Higgins, I love her voice and I feel tired, especially after watching her expression was only pure violent for me.
