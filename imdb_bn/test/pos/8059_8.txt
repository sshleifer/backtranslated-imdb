After the Second World War, the album was encouraged by money from a military base across the Georgian River, for the Gupta crime in Fenir City, and became worse. Gambling, prostitution, debt relief, and an organized crime tool in the same city. Very soon it was very bad and violent to endure. This film is based on the real story of the war. <br /> <br /> According to the 1st decade of the 1950s it is suddenly clear. Even with a low budget, location shooting with the same small budget reality is necessary. A very great movie. Richard Killy was always wonderful, and John McKinnier firm. <br /> <br /> Why this movie is not a good movie is a real puzzle!
