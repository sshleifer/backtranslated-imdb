After traveling around the world, I felt that Australia really lacked another country: history Fortunately or unfortunately, Australia was not established after the war, it was not a citizen war and its political history is mostly rather annoying! There is no "big" to identify some of the curved points in Australia's history .... Until the governor general John Kerre dismissed the Whitley government until the government was dismissed. <br /> <br /> Those Australian, you are excluded from this paragraph Can go on. For the convenience of this strange non-Australians! British colonial was by the British. When the time went by, it became clear that Australia was able to stand on its own feet. Accordingly, UK Australia allows the establishment of its own parliament, law courts, etc. Australian law and politics and will not be delivered directly from the British; Rather Australia and Australians will be directed to their own rights, although in court, for example, Parliament is thus modeled primarily in British way. This place was added to the Australian Constitution. Constitutionally, there are two "pro-crown" divisions that were included on this day and remain in place despite the authenticity of the establishment of the Australian Government, the legislative process, the court (but those who are interested - have no right). These are considered low or low as "Crown reserves power" (King / Queen of Great Britain). The first group of the department is related to the Governor General's office. In short, the Governor-General is considered the Chief Representative of Queen of Australia and is described as the "executive" branch of the Australian government. When a piece of legislation is passed by the Australian Parliament, the constitution says that it became the only legislation signed by the Governor General. In this way, the junior-general does not think anything more than a rubber stamp, which performs an ancient and unnecessary constitutional function on the Crown. Theoretically, if the Governor General thinks fit, can refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian Parliament. For example, if Parliament passes a law that allows an Australian to kill an Australian more than 50 years of age, then the GG can refuse to sign it and it will not be the law of the country. However, this ability is theoretical and has never been practiced (date). "Convention" (which is the main word for fatal incidents), the Governor General virtually acts on the direction of the Australian government and therefore, if the government passes the law and directs the Prime Minister to the Governor General, it is almost always without question. In fact, the "convention" governs the governor general's day to the Prime Minister (and to the Prime Minister). Second Article 64 of the Constitution says that the government ministers at the "pleasure" of the governor general are in the office. Now in the 1975 edition covered in this film - an example is presented in this special section: If the Governor General is 'dissatisfied' with the government and / or the Prime Minister, it will be seen that this department has legally allowed him to resign (which happened in 1975). So the title of this movie is "dismissed".) The pleasure of the Governor General can be considered as "arbitrary arbitrary rights" but it A controversial issue. Rather, for the exchange of heat exchange among the Australians - especially governor-general not elected by the people of Australia. <br /> <br /> Now this background aspect has come out of the way, let's come back to the discussion. It has been made well. The speed was patient, but not all drag. The drama included well and was very realistic. This does not make events the most dramatic, and most importantly, it does not present its viewpoint from a political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though ending the writing before the achievement meant that filmmakers probably did not approve the governor general's decision to sack the Hitler government. But I will not describe the entire film for the sake of one aspect or another side. <br /> <br /> In terms of correctness it was obviously clear. Filmmakers must have done their homework and clearly read books and articles from the most important players. There were quite a few subtle details which were left out, mainly because they took a long time to explain and finally had a slight impact on the events of 1975, so I apologize for them. In addition, I was struggling to revive the public sentiment of post-Vietnam era sentiment, but Knows had a lot of closing. Finally, I was pleased that this movie tried to propose personal policies, both parties did not become analytical, obsessive or judges over them. Moreover, there was a great deal that we raised, for example Conor Pipeline, the relevance of the story. The filmmakers realized that their work is to tell the story of the events of the dismissal and not to present political support or dispute with policies and visions. It was smart because it meant that one side policy for the film could not be misrepresented. The dismissal is perhaps the most incredible part of political history in Australia's short history. I am glad that I have been crystallized in celluloid. Looking for Australian essentials
