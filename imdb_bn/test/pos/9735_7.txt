I do not understand all these bad reviews. I believe this movie is one of the best in the puppet master series. Because of the low budget, they could understand why special effects and performances were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrific. <br /> <br /> Greg Sesiro came with a lot of work in the role of Andrea Tollon. She has many possibilities, and I hope to see her more soon. And although the cinematography was not uncommon, and there was the lowest violence and gore, this movie was a lot of fun. I grew up to expect a great doll master fan and blood and cow from the series, but I can say that I was not disturbed by the whole course of Retro Pop petmaster. So, if you ever have the chance to watch this movie, do not automatically feel unwell. Give it a chance. Hope you like it.
