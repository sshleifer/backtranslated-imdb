I watched Peter Watkin's Kulden and the war game a few months ago and was very impressed. This film is essentially the same, or at least the same, in California, in the future (apparently) the near-dissonance trial, and on the other hand, the story of the "criminals" group convicted in the film, described in the film as a "punctate park" alternate in prison, is about 50 miles to achieve their independence Through the slogan. Watkins movies are a documentary style that makes everything seem to be a reason for a strong suspension or a strong suspension of unbelief: How does the camera crew help with hungry and surviving prisoners in two days to help or share them? Misery? And that's just the most obvious example. But a very suspicious story, this is a punch pack; You do not want to be interested in making political films to be involved in any question, but the film is not really any other of its era: it does not interfere, no easy solution. The left-wing political figures are drawn from time to time, but they are not the same; Right-wing government employees feel a little more cartoon, but even at least they are allowed to show little humanity. Overall, this movie thinks about the extraordinary taste and releases ... 8/10 DVD rental
