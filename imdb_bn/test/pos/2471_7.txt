The film's strong side was clear at the beginning of the film and in the middle part. It shows how a very violent, reactionary authority could react to the resistance. The film, in a documentary format, captures what happened in what the US military military legislation enacted. Volunteer for the "Park of the Park", where the training grounds for the police where you are raped and harassed, will open you for this terrible scene. It is a change in the court's trial for those facing the charges, the police are being protected from the attention, training of officers prepared to handle these prisoners, judges at leisure, and so on. It was a very powerful, deeply moving movie. <br /> <br /> My only fault with me was reality. Officials are often seven years old with their pistols, such as plastic toys (such as 90 degree belt elbows, pointing at someone facing a gun, or by a policeman it looks like, again down, etc., etc.). It started as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political issues. At the end of the movie, the favor of the director and producer's bias are repeatedly reminded of the viewer. The character of the protagonist of the story begins as real, real man, and then gradually progresses as "temple error, material forces". Unlike the mistakes they make, the power they show, in contrast to real and real police behavior, during the hearing of the court, the judges show stupid and irrational errors among many other things. <br /> <br /> The reality is that when it became clear that the movie started breaking down, it was just another blank-check attempt to make the government look bad. And that's coming from an anarchy. Ultimately the scenes begin to be hockey, unreal, and thousands of dramatic. Yet, in its earlier part, it promises some very moving storyline.
