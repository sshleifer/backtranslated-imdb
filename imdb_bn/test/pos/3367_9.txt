I would say that I have seen some other reviews of this film, it is a little understood or a real TV series that started from it. Dad's army was sitcom and so ridiculous and so hold a smile to face the dire situation. However, series which was considered as a 'branded' episode of continuity and ignorance, series carry many serious messages. The film was faithful to the series and was just like an extended episode. So I am scared of critics fearing that Columbia has developed this humor and it can be confronted - BBC Cityikomas of this time have hit anything that came out of America. There was also a way to offend the mark of reference to mention the promotion. Homegroup people considered to be inappropriate for the frontline service, who still wanted to serve. They were very brave men who knew that they were sentenced to death as soon as they signed up for Hitler, and declared that if this happens during Britain's attack, it will be executed. Thank you for giving me a chance to set the record straight because it's really good to talk and comment on what you're looking for rather than commenting on the comments.
