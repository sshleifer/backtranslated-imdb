My opinion, LIAR Big Fat, it's a absolutely ridiculous movie with a moral. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "Middle In Middle") and Clayy (Amanda Bains - "All That") Marty (Paul Jemiti - Doctor Dolly) plays these tricks, I feel really happy and well. I like the most about this movie. Actually, what happened after Jason's writings was wrongly finished by Martia. I especially like Chess White's Cello. When I first saw him, I could not be sure, but when I asked his mother, whether he was, he said, of course! Before I wrap this up, I would say, "I have said before, as this story is a moral, and that is moral, always tell the truth." Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bains, or Paul William, I would recommend a very perfect film with a morality.
