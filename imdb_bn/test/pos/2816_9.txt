An animated series about "Stripriala", named Erotica Jones (a Pamela Anderson announcing), who lived twice as a striker as a sexy criminal known as "The Tender Lions" and a sexy crime warrior known as Stripriala. Agent 69 works for a government organization. As a stirriker, Irrotica fights against crime and deadly forces such as plastic surgeons, who plant women breast which explodes them or makes them fat and satos, a criminal who steals from 99 cents and shares two gunmen with guns. Charan Lee (and Spider-Man's creator) of the character and series Marvel fame. <br /> <br /> Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) in late June 2003, a three-dimensional animated show block on Thursday night. Those shows were "Rain & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoons"; New events for classic children show Ryan and Stampy characters for adults, by the original builder John Crickley, "Gary the Night"; Kelsey Grammer of "Cheers" and "Frieser" and about a lawyer turned into a human-shaped rat performing "Stripriala"; The adventures of a stripper who doubled as a superhero built by Plaela Anderson and Stan Lee. I think I see all of the three Premier. I love to love the main shoe as I was interested in seeing Ryan and Steve. I was given a little down here. It was OK but it started taking something very little; Together they had a little bit of lesbian sex together. Although Gary was not bad at night, the best of the three was easily streamlined. The animation was really good, it was a great reputable song, there was some good talent behind it and it was fun like hell! The show was so stupid, I do not even understand how it can be explained! After five weeks (if not a bit less) the animation block disappeared, which was strange because I know it got a good rating and it was notified everywhere. I was frustrated to go to the streamline, but after several months I found a new episode broadcasting at 1:00 AM. I just found one and although it was funny as hell and I was happy to see the show all the time, it seemed a little bit .... <br /> <br />'s short run at the beginning, "Stripriala" was great animation . It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy. Stripperella costume looked very well, the character was well-painted. After a long break and during other episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it was basically everything was really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest change though. Before normal long hair, her hair was bigger than her pony bundi (married with children) even if it was possible. Also, the visor of the eye actually shows his eyes now; It was cool that you were more superheroish before it was just white. Also, the upper part of his attire was a bag-type thing with a collar and his costume was dark blue; That's going to be a blue-purple color in her costume and her top costume is really looking crappy. In short, the show was a cartoon and the earlier stupid was already, but in the second half, it became more cartoon and although it still sunk, it became more and more; For example, there was a beaver next episode about ... Yes, there was a beaver. However, instead of complaining about the change in mid-series, "Stripriala" was running only a season, but it was a very good show. Like the Crypt film of the Crypt film "Borderlevel of Blood", it can be a campie, but it's really fun. As long as you do not prude you will find yourself laughing at this show repeatedly. I did not watch every episode because I still did not get the DVD for two reasons: # 1 Paramount is released and almost all of the released TV shows have this screw-up policy regarding having no extra extraction, although it was a complete show (I wanted to see some commentators' memos by explaining animation changes and interviews of Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and # 2. The opening is replaced by awesome Kid Rock songs. Now I'm not his fan, but there was a theme for listening to that article! If you do not want to pay at least any extra money for Jack-Ass's original role song This exhibition features some interesting guest stars like John Lovitz's plastic surgery model, such as Presto and Mark Hamill. Tom Kobe (SpongeBob) was also at the show as the owner of most episodic strip clubs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In most cases, voice talent, Chief Struzzof (see the show and see what he's doing) and was the best among the three animated shows mentioned easily. <br /> <br /> Kansas: Mid-series animation changes and described above are crappy DVDs. Besides, some humor may sometimes be stupid, I do not really have anything negative to say about this. Overall: Stripriala is a huge culprit for me and it ran just a shameful season. It was a very funny, sexy, action packed culture series that I hope to see in the primitive swim winds on the primitive swiming day and possibly give it another season like a family meal. Check it even if it's a lousy DVD. You laugh yourself silly. <br /> <br /> TV-MA rated: Crude and sexual humor and nudity, runtime: about 25 minutes per episode, score: 9/10
