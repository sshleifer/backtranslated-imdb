Among the jeeps cripps and Texas chains genocidal veins, Monster Man is surprisingly orderly - though stupid - a bit awkward. Throw in a little friend-comedy, nice gorge and intense fear. It's fairly fun that Manchester Man is really entertaining. The low budget seems pretty obvious, but it does not generally affect the presentation of the film and shamefully puts the horror films of big budget. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is as common as possible. Friends, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Ehrich), the pair are running a cross country to prevent the marriage of a woman who always loves. Although Adam is more cruel type, Harley is a self-declared female male and very aggressive loudmouth. To add a bonus to the plot, then they picked a sexy shooter, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things turned into nightmares when stalking them with a giant truck with awesome face drives. When the dead body begins to count, they must first compete against the risks of their life before the time. <br /> <br /> This plot is probably memorable of the famous horror films long ago, but Michael Davies as a writer and director succeeded to keep the tension. Fear is good enough to create, where the characterization is never good, but fair enough. This script is bound with comedians working for comedic moments and they are quite enjoyable than annoying and wait for the last turn. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Deserve more attention on the screen. It proves that the big budget is not an effective horror movie, but skillfully! Some of the directors that have been shown and delivered.
