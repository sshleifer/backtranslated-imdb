George Heno really was great in this case, which went all the above and above. I've heard Len Kieroou's version but it was very embarrassing. George was very impressive - very clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> Angel Lancerbe was perfect for the part. He gave a great performance. He gave Mrs. Lovett a balmy and humorous personality which balances the dark story out. <br /> <br /> I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury listen to her song as well as her physical expression and angry feelings of George, in anger, vengeance and trouble songs. <br /> <br /> I have seen this game since 1985 when I saw PBS I bought it on the video (after copying it on my own in 1985) when it was published in 1990 and after I left it in 2004, I certainly bought a copy of the DVD.
