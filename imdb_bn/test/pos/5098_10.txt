I love this movie because every element of it is not nice. I would quickly appreciate a few of them. Peter O'Toole He gives the final Mr Chips as one of our great performances. Petula Clark, has a beautiful voice and is perfect as Katharine. The director was able to bring the story to the screen in a new new way. Combine with superb and creative cinematography, editing, writing, and you have a movie that shows the fine quality of its product. I can not appreciate the well-designed camera work, it allows us to get around and around, zoom in and out, provide our best viewers, and become part of the scenes scene. Petlulla Clark's last song 'You and I' are just 3 beautifully created, and in this era of 2 seconds, I can appreciate the extra care that everyone can give them the tall scenes to be perfect. The music is great, and the song should be just as straightforward as it should be. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite musicians. Listen to this song, how can someone like them? It is a romantic story between two people of the mid-age to find each other, to bring the best of each other, and it lasted till the end of their lives. Excellent production value, acting, camera work, and music, this movie will be worth watching.
