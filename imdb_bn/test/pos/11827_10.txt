One of the best and fun comedy series I've ever seen! All letters are bright. <br /> <br /> m Mr. Slate (David left) is a very annoying man, disturbed by everything and somebody. <br /> <br /> She wants to do something and wants to manage the situation as she can, but she is never right and gets only deep and deep in herself. His wife, Genette, does not support him, who tries to deepen and deepen himself in pain (and he really does not need help!) <br /> <br /> All characters play / brightly portray. Just imagine sending your child to this type of school. <br /> <br /> It is incredible that people do not like it (maybe some do not get many plays in words, which are featured every time the episode) <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable that no DVD is available yet . There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> Please leave it, let's go! So fans can enjoy it and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Try it, you can like it !!! <br /> <br /> Just names and words from the series: Pampman, Man helmet, Hot Beach, Mount Suji, Trevies Felayeto, Kakfaster, Arshed (and more).
