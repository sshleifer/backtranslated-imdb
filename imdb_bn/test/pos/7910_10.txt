Finally I discovered that I think I was four years old. After watching the 1960 edition of VHS, I said that it seems to be black and white in front of 2 times. Now IMDB has helped me to know the truth, it was broadcast twice in Black and Sada (2 production) in 1955 and 56 successful years. This four-year-old seems to me the best. I did not understand 56 broadcasting is not like 55. I was 9 years in 1960 and the color production did not fix it for me. The Black and White version is as wonderful as today's high-tech movies, even with amazing and surprising effects without even a computer effect. You have to be there! Please comment if you have similar feedback to the B & W version.
