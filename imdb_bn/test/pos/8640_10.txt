David Lynch's ninth full-length feature film, a deeply tactful story about the Mulholland Drive, betrayal and jealousy. If anything, it is cruelly opposing our ambitions and often expecting bitter truth. The importance of each frame in this movie and links to other parts at the same time. It does not appear first and end up trying to place the pieces together so you have left with a real puzzle. This is a movie that does not compromise and fails to handle the challenging form and camera language completely, as happened before with the Lost Highway. <br /> <br /> While someone explicitly recognizes classic linguistic designs and devices, the film is very original, it remains even in the light of a lint movie. The Lost Highway is a new way to tell a story; An overwhelming average birth in the setting of emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch was unable to control this technique, but it is more complex and multi-dimensional to take new dimensions. By doing this, he creates a structure of different levels of mind and time of man. At a news conference at the Cannes Film Festival 2001, David Lynch said that the result of the struggle for maximum fulfillment may be such that the parts are more than the sum of the parts. Mulholland talking about similar synergies. Extremely relevant to where the total contribution of various sequences and a lot of details; Dreamcapes and parallel stories create intertwine In some industries, its beauty is in its simplicity. Mulholland is not in this case with drives, and has not been with Lynch. The lining of the earth makes it colorful and complicated, it is the same complexity that identifies the real world. <br /> <br /> This is not compulsive to my opinion, for example, with the main way of using the Memento, contact the audience. Along with comparing the moviehill movie to other movies, I think what she did to David Lynn and proved to be a master of bridges and filmmakers that nobody ever did this. For example, compared to Alexandra Jodoroski or contemporary Matthew Barney, I believe that Lynch does not allow artists to influence filmmakers more clearly, or perhaps, David Linch can understand well and implement film making as an art form. It is not a small achievement to understand this plot, but the way to work with the words, perspectives, cronies and forms of linen illustrate a dark and terrible act of art that sometimes feels more realistic than real life. The Lynchyan movie is often, and mostly in the Mulholland Drive, the emergence of people's emotions. Work with passion is a fine craft that demands understanding and depth. Lyncht says: "A little more, and emotions go away, a little bit, and it can not happen." Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem making this balance. Lynch's portraits extend all levels and give different directions, create incredible realistic characters and situations. A journey through watching the Mulholland drive subconscious. It's a real and nude movie regardless of the artistic value. That's why I love Mulholland Drive and what it took to top the movie history. Final movie
