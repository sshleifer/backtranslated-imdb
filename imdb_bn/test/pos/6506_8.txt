As soon as I became a huge fan of hip hop and turntablism, I always knew I would love this movie. However, I was not really ready for how good the documentary is. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only hip-hop material that has been from the very beginning. The "story" starts at the beginning of the 70s and followed the evolution of turntablism as an industry until early 2000. (<br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Sound editing is very good, used to help with some excellent rhythmic words. <br /> <br /> The absence of a narrator is welcome. This enables the audience to simplify their own opinions. Each DJ adds the other side of the story, and is very interested to hear about the unknown people of hip-hop, especially those who left the hip-hop centered on left, right and music business. <Br/> <br /> Although there are many wonderful things about this movie, I have some consistency with the biggest DJs like Ca $ HMoney and Jazzy J eff, and out of the American DJ like scratch perverts and DJ Joyce. However, if you see the comment in the DVD (which I highly recommend), then go deep into the depth of how producers and directors can express their deep features. There are many interviews with Ca $ HMoney, Jazzy Jeff and Scratch Perverts in the deleted scene. <br /> <br /> This is the best documentary I've ever seen in hip-hop culture and music. It closes briefly to show the true probability of turntablism; For that I highly recommend checking out DMC and ITF Video. However, that is a minor quibble. I highly recommend this movie, not for the Phat soundtrack, with excellent music of the whole music. (9/10)
