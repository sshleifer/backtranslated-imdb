When I started to see, I saw some pro-quores amateur documentaries. However, I did not see footage 3/4 of them used. They interviewed people and told that the FBI / ATF has excited all these things, which have come so far, but then the FBI came up with video and evidence. I was overwhelmed. Following the fire after the Senate followed the documentary with the investigation and after watching the interview and video footage, how did you react to the Senators and Attorney Generals, backing them on the Davidsians to cover the FBI / ATF aggression. If you start to see it, then you have to finish it. Otherwise you would think it is like some promotions like.
