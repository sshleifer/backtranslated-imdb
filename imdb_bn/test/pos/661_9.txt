Cheezy? Yes Shooting badly? You betcha Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Anyway, bright (or cause)? Definitely. <br /> <br /> This movie celebrates everything that was classic about 80 seconds of bitch style (and jokingly): Fits in a depth with a stereootyped roll that they do not run for a moment; By doing something young, they are trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force disturbed; Full gratuity nudity; The blood of the victims is coming to an impossible extent; Slow moving zombies; Great one liners ... and our heroes even wear a Michael Jackson jacket! <br /> <br /> This is not a lazy out of horror film, but a more respected movie for the loss of 80's horror films ... When it is scared and earned, it can be a fun, stupid, sexy, and Good time fool!
