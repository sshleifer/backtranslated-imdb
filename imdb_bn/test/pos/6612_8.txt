My friend saw this friend of mine (23, 24, 25th August) on the below-island festival that it was a great movie about my graduation history. I do not expect to do this movie right now. It was recorded by some skaters who thought that they could create some cool tricks, or it was a documentary about skating. <br /> <br /> So I went inside, after waiting for an hour, any expectation. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a great job at the beginning of the skitboarding. It starts with the Zephyr team, where the surfers are a fine group. It is living in a beautiful area where waves are no longer good for surfing at a particular time. So they try something else. Skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you were part of Jeff's team at that time, then you are one of the coolest girls / girls. Because most people escaped from the place living with Jafar. So they are now trying new tricks on all scrubs. <br /> <br /> Skateboarding was once again popular. There was competition and a national competition. The Zephyr team was taking part in several competitions and national one. But what they did there was skateboards incredible. But the jury did not judge them anymore. So they put the whole skateboarding world on its head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can tell you the rest of the film / documentary, but it must be seen through your own eyes. Because you can think of this movie. This movie got many styles for me, so I rewarded it with 8. <br /> <br /> Giz and the rest of Holland greetings. see you.
