Okay, it's too long and it's very satisfied with yourself. Nonetheless, "The Great Dictator" is an impressive film. Chaplin is a great act of ridicule Hitler and Nazi Germany is trying to show the persecution of Jews (this concentration camps were before general knowledge). Chaplin's dancer, but still can not see. <br /> <br />
