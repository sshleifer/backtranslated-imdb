All right, so this is the first Karate Kid closed a complete rip. However, I do not think there might be many movies like Karate in the first Karate. There is something about this type of story that seems especially applicable to people like me. Get the full idea of ​​being able to overcome the problem by discovering new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swan is a special jewel as the next Karate baby. You can really say that there is a bright future in front of him. <br /> <br /> This movie does not say without its problems. Unlike the first one, Mr. Miyagi was interested in learning the martial arts and getting Julie to join the war. It almost seems that he forgot what his price was from the first movie. Also, there should be a suspended suspicion when examining monks. The film feels very simple about the life of fans and does not explain what they do in the plot-line. Although fame is even worse, villains are suspicious of a bit. I am also skeptical about martial arts movies which end at the end of the promotor. <br /> <br /> So maybe this is not a perfect movie. So maybe Friday night will not be the best movie to rent. However, in many ways, it is a guilty pleasure. Hillary Sink is so loving, and stories, even though non-resident, works. A section of the film that seems to be based on action other than action and violence is a breath of fresh air. It's a movie of soul and heart like Steven Siegel and John Cloud-Van-Dame. There are some people who need such a movie, and we can accept whatever we get. My rating: 8/10
