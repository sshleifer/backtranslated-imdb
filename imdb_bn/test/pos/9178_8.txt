It was a romantic, simple funny movie. I really enjoyed it and would definitely like to see it and enjoy it, Will Smith is just a handy guy by being funny, cruelly, nervous, sweet and hurt by love. He had to study for someone and become so nervous and lost what he or she could do. It was a lot better. She was great, as fun as usual. Eva was better than Mendes that I too wanted to be good, I thought there was a moment in the movie where Shaft was getting, he was becoming a good man that he could be a good man and still behaving badly. The last was romantic and happy and it was great. I saw it several times, and would see it again. A fun, movie, something you do not see anymore. It was an old time experience with a new look.
