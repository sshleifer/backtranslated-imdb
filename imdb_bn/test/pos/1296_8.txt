Kahin Paar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan is beautiful and beautiful than ever! There is a scene where she takes off her shirt! What a wonder !!! Rani Mukherjee is also great. Pooja Batra had very few lines saying but I am happy that he has been recognized for his role because he definitely has the potential. <br /> <br /> It is about love (Salman Khan) and he is a wedding singer. She is going to marry Nisha (Rabina Tendon) but she stood up. Love Nisha goes to the house and asks him why he is torn and his brother is sick, because he has to marry Rahul (Inder Kumar), NRI to get money for treatment. Love is going on and Priya comes (Rani Mukherjee). Love <br /> <br /> Love with love, but shameful that she wants to marry NRI! Who can be this NRI?! Priya falls in love with love when Rahul is with her. One day, she gives abusive comments to love to Priya and she closes for the marriage with Rahul. Will love stop him? KPHHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The picture was very funny! These songs, especially the songs "Priya and Priya", were very shameful that the film flopped in India and why not know why? Every movie in India flows nowadays! This film deserves to be a hit. The only problem with the film is that they are passionate about NRI! They think all NRIs are rich! Movie 9/10!
