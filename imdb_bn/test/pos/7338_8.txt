The "gymnast" is exposed in short shots and small scenes, with time expressing its characters and messages. Additional editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. This intimate method is wonderful for you to feel as discovering the way you discover the characters as characters. <br /> <br /> Additional methods also have errors; There are some confusing scenarios because they do not have enough context. Some decisions have been taken by letters until the interviews of bonus instruments I saw. I'm glad, because the performances of their motivations by the actors give me a more compromising understanding of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story, women were so amazing to see their own organization comfortable and strong. Shooting is done very transparently; Very matter Feelings of one's love story and living scenes have been expressed, not a visible sledge movie. Physics of athletes - Their reality - Sometimes this is a great contrast to the spontaneous nature of this plot. <br /> <br /> I will see again in a movie because the story is simple but its delivery is strong enough to stay with me for a long time.
