This picture is a very nice and slow film. There is nothing Hollywood about it. It's very Danish and the characters are very real. Take this transsexual theme to make it the first Danish film. It really has no gender in gender. I do not want to say that although it is a matter of homosexual love, the two main characters (Transsexual Veronica and Charlotte) have attracted each other. It's a story about love and life. <br /> <br /> The story is mostly in two apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it feel more real and intense. The main characters playing two actors are great. They really make them feel real. They are not the archetypes, but the real people you can meet on the street. I think this is the first time I've seen a transcible illustrate this good. Have done very well.
