Under the assurance of F. Gary Gray, "Italian jobs" never lose their firmness on getting cold and fun. Although the material is rehearsed and average, the film itself is ruthlessly effective and satisfactorily well. Considering the killer revenge platoon, the tone can be very heavy, but F. Gary Gray keeps the voice light with good humor, the snap dialog and the Pals music. These uncivilized people form a great bond and are happy to see each other hijacked by fraud and murder, do not forget to have fun. This one is 7/10.
