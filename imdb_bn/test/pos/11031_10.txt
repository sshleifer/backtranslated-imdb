I have collected the movie at Super 8, and I have been able to print its full length in e-bay last week. It looks like at least moments, the only way to see this movie in a country that contains NTSC video. I found it in reserve 2 DVD many times, but there are no 1 zones. <br /> <br /> I ended up watching it a few minutes ago and I was amazed at it. It is a strong document of independence and the world's own space. Photography and music were fantastic, and I really felt sympathy for some characters. <br /> <br /> I like this idea that I am probably just in the USA "when the north wind is bright" tonight! <br /> <br /> Long live Awakum !!
