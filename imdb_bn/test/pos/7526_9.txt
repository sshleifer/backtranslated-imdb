This is the first Pep La Pew Cartoon and in some ways it is similar to the next but it is not strange in some ways. Papa love is a cat, although it seems oddly a BOY cat! This whole accident occurs because a cat tries to smile like others, tired of wear and tiredness and tiredness, so it can be alone. Unfortunately, this is our hero, Pepe attraction. Most of the works are very commendable to the most enduring and unexpected finishes - and it actually creates the best of all the cartoons in this series. Excellent animation (though the style is different from the next example), a good idea of ​​excellent writing and humor makes it a keeper.
