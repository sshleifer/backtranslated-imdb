Coming from "Druggie" generation, I was delighted in this movie. It definitely brings Jacky and Hayd up to date, so to say. My husband and I laugh all through it I love to have movies in the collection. I told my two teen friends about the movie and they would love to see it. They are not into drugs but they know enough about understanding the comedy about the movie. It's been a long time since I've seen it, but I can not remember anything. Dr. Jakeel stood on the lab's table and said the most interesting part while throwing a breath in the straw, he discovered that the powder was discovered by the drug. The most fun thing I have ever seen in a movie
