Beautiful, emotional, and fine. I see this movie in an industry center on a small screen of a movie room with 95% senior citizens. I wish to show it to big movies like Lowes around. Wang and Christopher Doyle have a great movie. Since I understand Canteen, the film is a lot easier for me to understand. As the story goes through, the whole story of many English-speaking spectators was not found. Three women keep yapping near me and there is no source of cinema. <br /> <br />; They were surprised to find that they had a son while going to sleep with Mr Chau, Mrs. Chen. He went to Singapore trying to tell him but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Mandarin word for the movie titles actually means money or flowers like memory. The term is usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory which was infinite and short. The whole movie fits quite quite a title. <br /> <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was in the corner of the street on the sidewalk. It is very nice, the sun is shining on the old and faded wall, in the dark of the night, in the rain, really a poetic moment. As I stand against their wall and talk calmly, I feel convinced about the close relation of their relationship. Mr Chaw felt terrible when rehearsing at his departure moment, and Mrs. Chen shouted on her shoulder .... Bravo Wang Kar-Y! <br /> <br /> As much as I like this, Chongqing Express is still my top favorite. Anyway, I'll give it 10. As a reference point, CTH has just got 7. <br /> <br /> If you love the art you love this movie. Do not miss it.
