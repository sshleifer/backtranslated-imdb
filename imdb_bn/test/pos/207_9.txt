Love and war took place on the other side of the iron screen, and love looked at each other as strong as the West, and the fight was often worse. (I'm more realistic?) <br /> <br /> This film about Mr. K. era Soviet forest is much more than war and love. It is not with the hemoglobin's rivers for the best war films of the 1990s and for millions of dollars spent on special effects and marketing artists. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic of Soviet film and a movie. An extraordinary picture of the great human accident: war <br /> <br />
