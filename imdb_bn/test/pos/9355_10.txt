Crossfire is a fantastic movie which makes its time and a timeless classic product both. This film addresses issues that have not been brought to the screen before the liberation war of 1947 and it is a high quality film that highlights today's day with good script, great looks and superb performance of its actors. The first American film to take anti-Semitism Head in Christfire is a cemented classic space. After World War II was established in America, a fool's intelligence developed after the killing of a Jewish man. <br /> <br /> The story is great, its anti-hatred theme is covered with a bold multi-crime crime thriller, as well as anti-Semitism angle, something like the Second Dialogue of World War II and themes. Unlike other mystery thrillers, the audience is almost immediately alerted to those who are. However, the story of this film is still intense because the struggle of all the great characters involved while trying to understand the situation is going on. Outside of great overall stories and themes, the entire script is simply complete with razor-sharp exchanges between smart, meaningful messages and characters. <br /> <br /> The impressive story of the film is played nicely through its excellent casting. Captain Finley, Robert Young Spanking as the Chief Investigator of the Assassination. My favorite character in the movie finale, he's just a cool character - like bone-dry and two-fourths harder and nothing to stop the killers for justice. Because of his amazing screen presence Robert Mitchell, his soft-spoken army is very animated in the serangent character, and is also very cool in the film. Galeria has given memorable performance to her small Oscar nominated role; George Cooper also did a good job like a sick and sad corporal Mitchell; Paul Kelly gives a curious character an eerie script; And Steve Brady, Sam Leven, Jacqueline White, and William Fipos also gave strong support. Robert Ryan has been most discussed about the actor in the film, has given a cool acting as Montgomery and has been nominated for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Crossfire has a great appearance. Director Edward Demitrik has done outstanding work with the filming process and the filmmaker J. Roy Hunt did a wonderful job with his black and white picture. The picture of the crossfire dark and its theme, almost covered the shade with a glossy overton, still very raw in the part. Harmingly, the superb appearance of the film is not the result of hard work - even the intention. Rather than the demotic light the actor wanted to spend more time and money - so what he did. Low light, less preparation (about 6 hours working days), and it's a fantastic looking film. The film industry is not a good work, crossfire is a great example of a cheaper movie that ends with the rich classics.
