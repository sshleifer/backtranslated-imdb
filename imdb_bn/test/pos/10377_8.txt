This movie was a fairly enjoyable watch to me, I mean it was not cool, but it was one of the best horror movies of late. It appears to be low, budget size of almost state convenience, but it has its character as beautiful women. The atmosphere was good (nowadays many horror movies are lost from hell). Acting was a matter of budget less than 80, if you did not know that it played "ugly". But Lucio Fulci's films were full, they kept the movie in the story and lack of money. They are horrific for the movie and more than creating for the womb and the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This is just a simple low-budget horror film that can be seen, I've seen it completely and I love horror movies. I have seen movies where I stay closed or sit in 10 to 20 minutes, and if it is on the video, can move fast or avoid the scene in the DVD. This movie did not want me to do this, I was sitting and seen to the end, if you wanted to skip some parts, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As scary as it seemed, it was a bit awkward. But even though they were a little better, it could be the budget of the lesser budget. <br /> <br /> Music was the top design material on this movie, ideal horror music. I saw scary movies where music is good or average but it may be good, thanks to love, though this movie does not have metal music. <br /> <br /> I have a Metal Fun Die-hard since 1990 but Metal Music looted it in horror movies, the film loses a lot more in the atmosphere when no music is played without a score. So I'm glad that there was no music in this movie, just your usual score which was rather unclear. <br /> <br /> It can be used "Profes Grace - Isolated Dream History". It's nothing like the keyboard music as no guitar "really" obscure keyboard tracks. Like a track "Sleeping forever" you run out of air all over the air and follow some bounce bump that introduces keyboard music. Any track on the CD is the same, the best horror of ideals, it can perfectly fit this movie. <br /> <br /> The only irresistible chick in the movie to me was the chibba / killed or so we are believed) and passing as a scarecrow, get only free and try to escape later. All other women in the movie were really beautiful, 10 big stars for them 9 I want <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I want Hollywood to pay Romero and the people who made this movie. It is better to give them a film, it is even better than giving "Guilt Bad" to the smallest of Paul Anderson, a Guan Muppet. <br /> <br /> Good work, not bad, bad or, lastly, I love the part of last credit when they show you their film making scenes (behind the scenes). Most movies do not do such things, which I think have been added to the film, as it has been shown if you ask something and it's always a good thing, if you ask me. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <
