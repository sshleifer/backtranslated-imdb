I just want to give instructions (along with requesting to release the series on DVD) that the show does not have to be realistic for entertaining. On this day, with all the blood and news and crime dramas, reality shows etc., a good mix of delightful characters, very good to lose in sugar shows. PWOG Bill Fit. Was it Amy Element? No, but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> To cast for the second cast - they were more charitative than cast in the season. I would definitely agree that in the first season there was a more serious VB than the other two, but later I definitely got more suction. Although the wind ceased for a series of years, I will not stop expecting to be released for purchase.
