A passionate love story, where the characters have been very convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of the professional actor. Especially for Vincent Castle, when you think about this role as the first role (when it was pictured). And yes, during this creation, he succeeded to lure the beautiful Monica Belusi out of the movie. I can only say that this image should be published in America, instead of thinking of a remix. It's just so French, almost distorted .... And yet so true ... This image should be printed ... <br /> <br /> A director who must definitely get more projects for this project. It's not a flop to correct the amount of material.
