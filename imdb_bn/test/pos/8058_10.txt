At the time of Clayte Roberts Professor, I started to think it was an ed wood production, however, here are some of the toughest hitting material. The story of crime and corruption in the Southern city is said to be using a cast of Hollywood's poverty line, and it makes the movie more realistic. No piece is drawn here, and sometimes the memorable "The Well" of the film (1951). Black and white texture gives quality like a newsreel. To ensure, the young audience will be reminded of "The Blair Witch Project" but it is based on a real event!
