"Swini Todd" is one of my few "perfect" musical instruments. Like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story" it's a wonderful, intelligent score. It offers two interesting and interesting figures of Lead characters. This is a timeless theme, revenge. It's a ridiculous affair, and just as strong as simply or presented on a grand scale. <br /> <br /> "Tell the story of an easily wrong person during the time of England's industrial time". It shows man's inhumanity to humans, how Swinie's own words say, "There are two kinds of men, one is standing at his right place and in the face of others." In an attempt to correct his mistake, Mr. Todd devices plan to retaliate. Mrs. Lovett, who owns a meat pie under Mr.Todd's barbershop, with his help, has set him "serve those who are above, below them". <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see. The original Broadway version is eight times (six with Kariyu and Lansabari, Hron and Loudon two others). I saw a revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler, and many other concert versions. <br /> <br /> This generation lacks the technical aspects, at least to say, I believe that the production version of this movie is the best. Lansbury and Henne were the best two of these roles, and they had a wonderful time spanning each other. <br /> <br /> Kennings Jennings and Edmond Lindek very good support. Although Betsey Josin and Chris Grenન્ડle, young lovers have absolutely no chemistry and are largely unwanted. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
