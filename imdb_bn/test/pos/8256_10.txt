This film has been almost forgotten from the year 1979, which is a comedy, although it is the UK's largest all-time greatest bank ever. Indeed, one of the titles of this film is "Copper", so that his voice indicates a movie type. A bunch of loveful rouge, which is not violent or psychological, who stop the biggest act of their life with cheeks. To be honest, I do not know much about the real crime and can not comment on whether the unpublished events are properly illustrated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . I would sometimes awaken gel well with American actors in a British-made film, with English actors, chemistry is not always there, but it does not have any problem for Jordan that fits properly with its role. <br /> <br /> Jordanian was probably one of the worst actors of the 70s and 80s and he never got the ability to get his recognition. He began to get stuck in acting and B-movies, not a fair representation of his acting ability. He played a wicked police in mid-season, a wicked killer, EDYY COYLE's friends. In the mystery of my success, he played the character of Gordon Gehake, one of the ridiculers, and he played a good man in the 1980s solo television show. Together with David Nivon, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitchell, they all demonstrated the diversity of their performance skills. <br /> <br /> In this picture she immediately plays a part of her humor as a trick with the eyes for women and you immediately take her character and route for her from the beginning. Can not you help green to choose ?? ?? You see that he really wants to go straightforward, but once it is blackmail, it takes too much opportunity to pass it and ultimately he enjoys the thoughts of this money. Calling the shot, the police inspector was brilliantly starring Richard Johnson, who usually portrays a godly but thoroughly London detective who clearly loves his work. Other supporters do not say cast too much, but looking at them, they were all well-known British character actors who often found themselves playing or copper (not the mockery). Elki Somers, Oliver Tobias do what they have to do, and Gloria Graham is better to see the role of a kayoma. <br /> <br /> Some viewers especially Americans are ridiculous that some of the records in the Greens can do all the maintenance and at a bank everything and when he pleases. Even then, after the punishment, the crown does not seem to be as straightforward as possible in court, it was not as strong as it was in the 1960s and 70's. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of interesting observations in the movie itself. The small time crooks here were too much of the shield. There has been another movie where it happened like BRINKS MAT. It is not just being looted or looted, but because of being involved with many people, someone is going to be unconscious, it is frustrating or just getting annoyed once. In addition, a lot of robberies occur when the authorities work hard on local authorities. Also, they say that there is no respect in the thieves, but Ivan was very afraid that the pinky had its patchwork. If you had just had his firm look at the dock, could kill a look, a look of total betrayal! How did he dip them all after his care? Why would that crooks be so stupid because you have to ask yourself a question? Did Green really think that he could talk sweetly outside his doubts? Inspector Watford was not fooled by his innocent face, as well as a well-built alibi, the job within the whole job was revived. In addition you have wondered why they leave so much synchronism? A note padded with a secure number, travel brochures for traveling abroad, still have unusual behavior on the day of the robbery as well as the day of the robbery. <br /> <br /> There was some decent but common sense police work. In addition, Watson was quick to measure green quickly, pick him up and he was soon singing like a Canary. It only shows how the plans can think quickly, but very quickly, cleanliness is not available for the whole body, some are always caught. Although it is believed to be very valuable, many money was not restored. <br /> <br /> All entertainment movies, interesting shots of London and England in the late 70's, well-groomed with a great finish. I would highly recommend this especially if you enjoy capture. (Note: I recently purchased a DVD of it but the transfer is probably taken from VHS tape and is worse than that., So do not pay too much for it!)
