Please be kind to the poor critics who do not like / do not like this extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is mostly ridiculous, although technically any comedy Not. <br /> <br /> The whole thing seems a bit awkward, probably Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream" Beautiful, intelligent women are many diverse painters and an insulting screenplay that does not miss a beat. This image is only replayed on cable. It's like reading a favorite, treasured book.
