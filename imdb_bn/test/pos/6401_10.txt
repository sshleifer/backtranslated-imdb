We all seem to be the deal It was an excellent show and let it be the time to die before time. I decided that if I really enjoyed a show, it's often a kiss of death. I love quirky, ensemble cast shows, and a great setting always helps. I was really looking forward to seeing these big stars in other television productions, but Marisha Hagert's little Fisher played Stephen's Pagal girlfriend, I sometimes did not see many of them except the role of the comedos. What a shame <br /> <br /> The key West, North Exposure, Gilmore Girls, and Veronica Mars ... all the great shows, everyone has gone their time in sorrow earlier. <br /> <br /> Listen to us loudly and clearly, we want the DVD key west ..... please.
