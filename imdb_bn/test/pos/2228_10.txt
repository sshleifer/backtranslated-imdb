I think this late teenage TV or early in the 30s - probably HBO. I saw it with my parents, a brother and a few friends. That almost 30 years ago, I do not remember a lot of stories. I think our whole group agrees that we have seen that it was the most fun movie When it was, our bellies hit so much smile. My dad has worked in a hospital, so it makes it even better. <br /> <br /> Every time I see a party in the TV list, I also see, what's there even here? My frustration, it's not. Although I love the party, I think it's a fun. Peter Vendors was great as a rare hospital administrator. A secret to me is why it is not released on the video. This is a classic, but it seems that anyone aged 35 or 40 could not see it. If I leave it a DVD it'd buy it in a second.
