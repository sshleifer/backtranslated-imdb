Critters 4 is a good movie. The series is a bit of an abstract, it is taking place, not in a worldly community. The good effect and the acting will be seen in this movie a must. I recommend this to everywhere in the audience / science fiction fans. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Fans of this type of movie should find puppet master, skid alive, camp awa camp, slam party genocide, and others full Moon photo flicks For other recommendations, check the other comments I have sent by clicking on my name above this comment section.
