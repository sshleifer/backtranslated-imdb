This film trailer focused so much on the chain (of course, it's a very exciting reason) it missed most movies, which is a developing, although it is only stretching, though trying to recover the relationship between Lazar and Rai <br/> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > However, in its core, the basic story of the release of Black Sapphire and the healing of helping others Power Maybe it's just me, but I think the poor Lazarus was focused more on his story. After his wife left him, he is an injured person, but we do not fully see how he helps resolve the problems of his past, he also cures him. It just means that it does-- in fact, he manages the wizard which defeats young judgment on his curse, with a big all-chain and some blues. <br /> <br /> I like the story, but I would not have to rely on it even a bit more and exciting. The side letters were fairly modest, if simple and I liked the music. Acting was good enough, although I can not confirm whether the verdict of the character is completely trustworthy. But it could be my closest <br /> <br /> Everybody, I like this picture, but I was not compelled by it. Maybe it's very critical, but the story seems a little convenient to be completely credible and so, even though it seems all too cool, I did not really buy it. The chain thing was fetched very little for me. Still, it can provide some entertainment for the explorers of dramatic release stories with a shot of blues. 7/10
