I was absolutely sunny in this movie. I already knew it was going to be a fun movie, but I was more fun than expected. Surely some hair was pounded, but they cracked me up. I thought the actors were going to be quite bad, but the actor was good at playing this comedy. Amanda Bins must be queued, she looked like her brother wondering and stopped acting as a boy. As with the other actors, they were funny as well. Of course there was a moment where you shouted on the screen, "How can you not tell?", But it's all part of the fun. Finally the plot turned quite well. Have a happy ending, but what do you expect. <br /> <br /> Overall, sunny.
