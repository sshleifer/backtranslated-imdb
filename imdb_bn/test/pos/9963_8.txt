Venice, 1596 AD Separate individual conversations from good Christians. Boyannio, a young but poor Venetian, loves beautiful Porte, a wealthy heir. So he offered his friend, Antonio, a businessman for three thousand dukts to visit Belmont and Patia. All the ships and merchandise of Antonio are busy in the sea, so he turned to praying Shylak, one of the Jewish faith. Shailk does not like Antonio, because he is turning his face. He gives loan to Antonio for three months. There is no interest, but at that time you will not be able to pay, you will get a pound of his meat. Also, Shailak's girl Jessica Christian has absorbed with Lorenzo. Venice Shakespeare's game is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1598. I read this game last summer and now I've seen the movie, made by Michael Radford in 2004. I like this game and I do not agree with it as a semi-opposition. The Jewish character is not even shown as an inhuman giant, he is ready to spend the pieces of Antonio. There is a lot of depth in his character, which comes in his speech, where he asks, "If you scoff at us, are we not blood?" And more More than Ant√≥nio, who spit on the good Jews, more than Shaniq's character. Unexpected like Al Pacino Shayk. He gave such a strong performance. Jeremy Irono is also great as Antonio. Lin Collins portier is the most beautiful and brightest Works great as Jessica and Charlie Cox like Lorenzo is also very good. Chris Marshall starred with Gratiano and he did a good job. In the role of Nirisha we see Heather Goldberg. MacKenzie Crook played Lancelot Gobbo. It's usually the most brilliant conversation it's like Shakespeare. The film depicts a fantastic image of the era. It works on some major problems in Shakespeare's way.
