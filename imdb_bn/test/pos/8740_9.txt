This film was not completely fresh in the film's mind, and it's a cry of shame. Ipl's extraordinary playlist adaptation of the outstanding screenplay has definitely received the Oscar nomination. Diamond Adjustment, and Ingrid Bergman's Ruthless Performance. To work with Bergman, it should be honored for Goldie Haun at this young age, less than a decade older than 54! When he is on screen, it is positively shining. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that can be seen at first, but I really wanted that I was very close to Swing's cultural time. Haun's fashion like Bergman's Chicks is quite strong. (This is a minor flaw - is not it too little for her character to have a girl who lives with her girl? But again, will we ingrid in any other way?) And who does not want to wait for this nightclub known as The Slipped Disk? <br /> <br /> I can play the best role in this movie that it has made me nostalgic for a decade I have never seen, and it wants me more. While talking more, I was surprised by the sexy supporter of actor Rick Lenz? (He is similar to Griffin Dunne in this movie.) It was his first film and I can not see any other big role in his film. As a glove, he has been working since so long, even then it is not easy to impress, but I can not imagine any other actor in this role. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a game, line delivery may seem a bit -Y, but it does not prevent me from enjoying it. In fact, I am still amazed at how fascinating forty-five years later. Because this movie represents a pre-era, it has suddenly moved away from the film's buffness. It is more associated with earlier films of the era than before. But let's not let it stop you from delightsing to offer. A grade
