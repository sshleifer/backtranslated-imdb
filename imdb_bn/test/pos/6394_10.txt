This event is great for many reasons ... parents can contact their kids on this day. Some staff overweight family is so great to see a real family instead. I saw this one time and got hooked. Watching TV worth watching a black family is so great. This event has gone very soon but through it it has been dealing with pregnancy, sexy, drug, bad date, death etc. The best thing about the show is that it has to deal with it in a real ridiculous way. Great show for the family .. I can not tell you how many times I have seen this event late in the night and cried my head. Great pg show rate 13. I like this show reflection.
