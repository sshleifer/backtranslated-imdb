Campfire Tales (1997) <br /> <br /> Excellent peace of work. Everything about this image is perfect. <br /> <br /> The image can be seen from IMDB. Because I was the reason for this love for Christine Taylor and the horror films. Let's get into the main parts <br /> <br /> 1. There are 4 young people in this movie, after breaking their cars, they decided to tell some wonderful stories. There are 3 stories and the main plot (the main plot of 4 girls) 3. The best story is "People can taste too much". in my opinion. The least intimidating story is probably "honeymoon" or the second story (the name can not be remembered) <br /> 4. "People can lick too much" About a man (on the Internet), pretending to be a 13 year old girl. Amanda, a woman who is dressed up in her house, comes to her house, which tells you twice as much of a chat with you online, mainly because a distorted person enters her house and something becomes obscure. <br /> 5. The main conspiracy is sweet and simple, try to trick each other with hundreds of accidents, stories, but there is a very quiet turn in the end. <br /> <br /> The only bad part This movie is that two youngsters have crashed their car into another couple, but if the couples are okay then the kids do not feel bored, they just talk about the couple they have crashed. <br /> <br /> And those who The litter has made people scared people not to earn money. "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer", this image has been created to frighten you. "Shout" and "I know what you've done ER was created to create "Big Time Cash". <br /> <br /> Although the film was not publicly released as a scream, it is 10 times better than screaming and "I know what I did last summer". <br /> <br /> The characters of this movie have great and realistic features. Character characters who are great acting. Christine Taylor did a great job with Lauren, do not go top with acting. Eric (younger brother's Lawrence) also works better for freak out men or teenage boys. Scrum is like a fool movie, a murderer is a joke and kids are stupid <br /> <br /> "I know what you did in the last summer", this film is a realistic man, not a fool of the film, but it should be noticed more.
