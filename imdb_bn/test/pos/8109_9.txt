.. This film was topped by Hitler (and Mussolini's film), and many of the politics and even the Roman Church stopped eyes due to the atrocities and evils of intoxicants. Especially in the US, there were many people who did not understand what was happening in German and Europe (for example, Charles Lindenberg, for example). Today, make a parody of the greatest actor Barlusconi or Cherac. Chaplin might have made many mistakes in his life, but it was truly the greatest of human writings and IMHO was a great show, he was a brave man. The movie has a terrific power in the fun and deep, final lecture and is still updated. I think this movie is the best one ever done.
