How can homosexual homosexuals be managed in a culture that generally denies homosexuality? There is little hope for millions of gay Hindus and Muslims living a life that is accepted and approved by one of their closest families. The main thing is found in Chicken Tikka Masala - possibly involving tender pieces of small chicken meat after Western spicy dishes! Jimmy is married by a typical young Asian native parent of the British and has brought a general, narrow and self-conscious attitude of grandfather. Like millions of others, he has been directed to a married marriage that seems impossible, although he is visibly gay and he is deeply involved with a very attractive young person. He knows that the truth should be said, but his father, especially his father, seems to be sick. And so he became confused with a web of cheating, which became larger and wider like plot development. <br /> <br /> This image is nicely sensitive and is not pictured or patronized. Although the role is generally extraordinary, although it may seem a bit ham, because the director naturally keeps on searching for humor instead of floating. There is no award for photography or scripts, but the film is completely amazed with the wonderful feeling - a feeling that all parents will learn from around the world.
