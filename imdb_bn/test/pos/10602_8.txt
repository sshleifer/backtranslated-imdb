When I first heard of this movie, I was very mildly interested. This plot feels like Hilter's opportunity and the actor and director is left like a left margarine which can be good. When I played the movie Ryan Dun, I was still more interested (when I was a Homeworker fan ... yes, I'm the link). However, I did not believe it was good enough. When I was sitting to see it, I was scared that I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But in just five minutes it became clear that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I The comedy of this film was a delightful fool, and definitely not suitable for all kinds of people. Acting was rather good, much better than my expectations. I thought it was easy to relate to Ryan's character, which gave the movie a credible center. It is harmful as a major subject in a film (i.e. probably not the fan of borat). <br /> <br /> This movie is not suitable for young people, DOH, and of course, will make more, it is a fair part of the weird tortoise when you meet your parents. But it's good for you and your friends on the movie night.
