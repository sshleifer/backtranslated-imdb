Las Vegas is one of the most brilliant shows of our time, it integrates hard hit action with heavy drama and heavy levels of comedy. It features superb character managed by the charismatic hard-guy Ed Dellin (James Kane). Using cool high-technology surveillance equipment to bring show cheats and schemers down. Characters are particularly happy to see their different departments, especially in the hotel / casino cross paths. <br /> <br /> The show is mainly centered on hotel / casino surveillance and safety parts. The two main characters are Ed Dellin, President of Operations and Danny McCoy (Josh DÃ¼hel), former US Marines who served in Iraq, but are currently the security chief. The show's five main characters, former Vault, are now security personnel MIT graduate Mike Canon (James Lesure); feisty, sexy casino host parrot Marquez (vanessa marcel); Danny's childhood sweetheart hotel manager Mary O'Connell (Nikki Cox); Danny's current sweetheart is also the daughter of Big Ed's girl and manager of Mastik Delined Delain (Molly Sims) and the daughter of Eddie, the daughter of Casino Floor Manager, Nessa Hollt (Marsha Thomson), who left the show in the second season. Each character is unique in its own playful way, giving its power and charisma to mourn, which gives its viewers an entire duration of entertainment. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The presence of camomones by big names is a specialty which is popular among spectators. <br /> <br /> Las Vegas is a show that can appeal to both male and female audiences. The boys combine sexy girls, enthusiastic sports cars, high racing gambling, adrenaline pumping action and a pool for women overall for this show. Young and handsome leading men (duel) and strong lively Deline, romance and pants tunnel boys around the same pool for women. <br /> <br /> Each episode has broken the ice to adjust the action with the light drama and comedy. Each episode consists of 2 even 3 secondary stories which mainly move around female characters. Each season also leaves the hanging audience hanging up to the next season air which ends with a bang. An excellent way to end a season! A mix of style driving and a cast mix of colorful, charitative letters, and certainly forgets that the topple pool does not turn Las Vegas into one of the best TV shows of all time. <br /> <br /> 9/10
