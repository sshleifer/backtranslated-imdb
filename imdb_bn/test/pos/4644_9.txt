It's basically a Goffball comedy, some pony pens due to some dramatic elements. Michael J. For Fox and Paul Ruben, this was their first film (Fox was a short-lived TV series and a TV movie before then). <br /> <br /> Since the movie is primarily a nation / skeganer film, such as "canonball run", "it's a mad mad mad mad world" or more recently "race at night", there is no main character. Instead, there is a group of characters, allowing screen sharing and tons of mini-plots. Generally, such films are the way to order the largest number of stars (or semi-stars) on a movie. <br /> <br /> There are a group of these, including the primary group of Fox, which only improves the letters. Their plot is more than a little Disney Affair, a college boy is not paying attention to his younger brother, he thinks he is a lazy Punk. Since they are gathered on a group along with the elder brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. Since it's the main screen it's the main screen. <br /> <br /> Some other stupid plots stand. The Blue Team is about an overweight rich child whose father only wants to get him and his friends out of the house. They ended up with a cool custom van, an on-board computer (in 1980!), To immediately solve the REDLs, and save video games over time! One member, Stephen First, at "St. Elsoc" Went to play Excelrox and was later in "Babylon 5". I will admit that when I try to shrink a word A'la Scrabble, I still smile, "Fagabwe?" This is much more interesting than my opinion of Bart Simpson's "Quizjibbo". <br /> <br /> The other three team plots combine. The green party is a bunch of fat kids, most of the beer joke which is separated for one while going to Prestige Blue Ribbon Braueri. They get the opportunity to harass the red party with two feminists and two fun-loving pairs. The white section of the dance was headed by Eddie Dzhegen, who was previously "Grize", but a complex computer genre of "Wargames" and later some team of "Dorof" series went ahead to play Conway's side comedy. <br /> <br /> If you grow up in the 80's, there are some classic moments in the movie that can bring memory back. The primary video arcade, when I was cold, my mind is always a plus. Look for Paul Rubens and his quarter shooting gun. There is also a small golf course and a roller disc. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The strange party of Chasey's dramatic moments of the yellow group, parents will fall asleep when their kids glaze over the large watermelons in the fat burger (oh, actually they have a special watermelon plate? It must, of course?)
