This event was for a short time when I was young, I remember seeing it while eating fish and chips. <br /> <br /> This series was much more in Trinity Styles, without manual and like, more computery. A geeky kid was somehow made this guy on a computer - Ottoman <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can mention it to anyone while they remember too much. Was it a real or perhaps a dream?
