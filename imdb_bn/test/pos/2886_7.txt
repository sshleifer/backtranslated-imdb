It's a great concert that shows the band's best 30-year career. Lee, Livesen, and Peer were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That said, I think the audio recording was botched through the mixing process and / or the mixing process. Although these boys are not guilty. They even set up the last minute show that was set up, so the band and their crew probably did their best. They were not supposed to just show up for public spending. The blue trap seems to be remote and GD's grass has good consistent content, but there is no end! They should be held on this concert and should wait for a good occasion. If you are a Russian buy this DVD only. There is a lack of quality audio division.
