Watch the first movie of the WHE Films, No Evil. Yes WWE, War Wrestling Entertainment, Pro Wrestling. Of course this is a WHE movie, it will have to play a wrestler, why is Glenn Jackbox Uk getting wrestler? If you do not know that KN or WWE has stood for you, it is not really important, but it will never know that it has something to do with the wild words of wrestling, because the movie does not have any relation with Muskil. See no Noel Horror Out Horror Film, some people might jump in a few moments but in most part it just says, how much we can get! There is nothing wrong with that. Jacob Subrataree (played by Kane) is like a Jason type character, his mother tortured him with a harsh (separate) Christian faith as a child and broke his mind. Now he is a big horror cut killer machine. 90% of the film takes place in a abandoned hotel where Jacob is six thirteen (wonder?) And a fist of adults I can explain why they are in a strange old hotel but eh, who care? Although it lacks fundamentalism, a temple can not be made well, which it should be assumed. Cain plays a terrifying killer and needs to be a little scary. An error in film is the most painful possibility of people, I'm really looking forward to killing them horribly, but frustrated, it's not happening. I hope there is no scandal attached to the film, even though I said that there is nothing with wrestling in this film, but people have not stopped paying enough attention because they still do not want to see it because if they are a wrestling opponent male Again, the movie can also make money because the wrestling fans want to see it. Look anyway, there is a top effect on No Evil and a little CGI and as I said it is quite brutal, so I say this is a good thing .... if you like these things.
