Edith Nasbet's best book is truly transformed into a great movie, I love it. The film is very beautiful cinematography, and has a fine understanding of the subject. There is enough in tears because the finishing has been done so nicely. Amazing Mr. Lynel has managed some really nice films like Blenden, but it is his best film as director of miles. The dress was absolutely beautiful, which matched the beauty of the countryside, and surprisingly and conveniently-trusted script helped the subject. However, this is an acting quality that holds the film together, because it is incredible and not small. Dina Sheridan was a heartwarming character, like a mother, an extremely important character of character, and Bernard Cribbins was ridiculous like Perce. Actually, I like Perce in the film, because it's not funny like books. The children were perfect. Both Gary Warren and Sally Thompass have performed brilliantly, but it's a wonderful illustration of Jenny Agutier's Bobby that has affected me the most. Another special mention of Johnny Douglas's extraordinary music, title music reminds me of Charlie Chaplin's laughter. In conclusion, a fun and tragic masterpiece, which is better than book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox's Bazar
