Daisy Movie Review by James Moj from Perfirmmod.com. <br /> <br /> On paper, "DG" sounds like an Asian film fan, directed by "Infernal Affairs" co-star Andrew Lau, and played by everyone's favorite playlist, daughter, popular Korean actress Jane G. Hune. Unfortunately, despite being involved in talent, and the series spread to worldwide shoots in Amsterdam, the film became frustrating for the frustration and self-centered romantic drama. <br /> <br /> This plot follows Hey Young (Jin Ji Hyun), a silent Korean girl living in Amsterdam, working in her grandfather's ancient stores and portraits for tourists. One day, she began to take flowers from a secret fan at the same time, who believed to be a mysterious man from her past who once built her beautiful little bridge. One day he met with his wife Jiang Wu (Li Sheng J, also "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), who is not aware of him, in fact, an Interpol agent tracking the Asian criminals of the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> Hey Yang Jong Wu is responsible for flowers, two of them fall into a romantic relationship very slowly. However, it shows that the man who sent the flower is actually a park ei (Jung Woo Song, "Saad Movie" and "Musa"), a murderer working for a Chinese criminal syndicate. Uncertainly, the triangle of love becomes sad and two men face up to the end and the poor Hey Young tries to work for the love of his life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" is apparently a love story, it has a funeral, a slow motion, and a plot that pumps on suffering with piles. In the film running half-long in rain, the length of Windows is taken with the scene of the staring characters, with the silence only broken by the bouts of self-compassionate narration. Director Lau believes that under the impression that the film is another heavier Shakespeare tragedy rather than another disappointing hit-man love story. Since the plot is naturally expected and the plat is often liberated from the "full time killer" and John Woo's classic "The Killer" preference, this plot is rather an incandescent wind. <br /> <br> Almost every aspect of the movie has become obscured with Angst, these three main characters enjoy such that the weight of the world was on their shoulders, and firmly refused to do anything to follow their romantic tendencies. Especially in the Park EE, the emotional, socially impaired killer, so much love of modern film, because of disagreeable disagreements with his disagreeable attempts to discuss his impersonation with flowers of hey Yang or flower flowers, is the favorite of the modern movie. This relentless passivity makes it harder to swallow the central romance of the film and attempts to express the feeling of Lau that it is a fusion that combines the characters together. <br /> <br /> Remember that his character is far from the role of the glamorous drama "The Univite", compared to "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstroke", and when he dragged some painful face here and there Her best efforts are to do this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture will benefit from the shiny production price and the loo gray, almost gothic beauty and innocent blue Against the sky or Ano, Amsterdam scene to good use. Field of flowers in rural areas Unfortunately, he used to be using a slow motion for some mental scenes, some postcard visuals on the picture give a sense of smell advertising. There are surprisingly few scenes of violent action, although it is a little too far away, and in a well-organized way, it seems to have been thrown into thinking later and has done more than briefly raising the pulse. Despite its flaws, despite its flaws, "Daisy" is made to be associated with seeing, and often, despite the story itself, often out of the deadly fascination, it is seen that no male hey Yang will end up in the end but will see Who will die his weapon Self-motivated melodrama works well enough to check all the boxes for the genre, and the movie works perfectly well, like the enjoyable, impressive romance. It is of course valued that the DVD director's cut film, which once indicated that it is quite different from the dramatic version, which not only added 25 minutes but revisits some of the scenes, makes the color less linear. Although this new version is perhaps too long, but it must be final, though in addition to these changes, the film was definitely more common and could also suffer from the development of even weak character. <br /> <br /> Director of Y Keng Lau (<br />)) / Jai-young man Kwak (screenplay) CAST: Woo-sung Jong ??
