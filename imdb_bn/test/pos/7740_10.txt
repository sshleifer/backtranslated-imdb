I have often expressed frustration to people that there is little to do with the origin of Mážarski's "Tempest" Shakespeare. In my opinion, it is both true and false, but at most, it is a bad start point for criticism proposals. It should not be criticized for the fact that it is not a work of art, but for it. The film "Tempest" is nothing like a genre of play, but I think it is faithful to the soul of Shakespeare's work. However, "Tempest" is probably one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, handmade cameras and silent are not experimental like conversations, but experimental search for a story transit without unreasonable consent to box office earnings. Majorsky's Tempest epic, sad, realistic, colorful, full life, but most, it's fantastic. The image of Philippe / Prospero Cascatus itself is worth a rating of 10/10, and when you add Guena Roadland, Susan Sarandon, an extraordinary Deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, wonderful guided small tableaux that spread through dialogue, music and photos ... I Sue rest. One of the best movies of the 80's. Do not miss it.
