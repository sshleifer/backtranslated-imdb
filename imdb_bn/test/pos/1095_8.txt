This movie is amazing, although not perfect by Hollywood standards, it seems to be a big split between rich and poor, black and white, in many parts of the world. It provides an actual look to social problems while it handles the audience with children's gloves. Take a special note of the young, beautiful young man playing sepoys. The friendship that is developing is universally true, one can be related to the choices of these young people. Adult effects are striking - it seems to be from real-life experience such as loose-talking and interaction-like many child experiences. I would highly recommend this film.
