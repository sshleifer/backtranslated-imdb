I just saw the showtimes during the night in this movie. I was in the beginning with an open eye, but instead of sleeping, I was invested in a movie's napkin, nasty. It was very credible and compelling. I could do so without being so dirty (like I see every David Mamata movie), but I've enjoyed the experience completely. I know that adolescents swear, but I do not need to listen to me. However, there were some interesting surprises in the story that I would not disclose, but if you have the opportunity to capture this movie in the showtime, I think you enjoy it as much as you enjoy.
