Wow, what can I say was a good movie, which was different from all the annoying remixes. We saw the only thing that I want to end with Jane, when Jane gave up her husband, was predicting that she was going to Serrena, she read not only her but her everything, so I hope the producers really want to end your opinion. Instead of ending it will end. I hate when they do this. The Aerial Acts seem funny but I think you have to be light and muscly, I would like to see more movies like this, probably Jane and Serena could make a sequel. If I were in Jane shoes then I had shoes. She was also attractive for the girl.
