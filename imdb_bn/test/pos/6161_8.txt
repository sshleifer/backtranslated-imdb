This is a beautiful movie! It does not just represent war, it is also friendship and love. Slum life is filled with sorrow, every aspect of her life has been separated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, this image has been made better, because it can not be unfaithful and straightforward towards women. Friendship between two men is much more believable and better build up. I definitely recommend this movie to all people
