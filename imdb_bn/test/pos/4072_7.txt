This is a fun movie. The feeling of Bob and Eddie Show can be a sequel, but I doubt it will earn enough money. <br /> <br /> <br /> With some ridiculous and spontaneous moments in Denro, a great straight man can be again. AG CGI makes fun of working with people instead of animals and flying. Rene Russo - she's fun to watch anyway and she played her nice part. <br /> <br /> Some wild and unusual stunts, especially garbage truck scenes. It was worth seeing in this theater. We needed a good smile and got a lot from the movie and ended out great out there. Do not give up at the beginning of the credit! <br /> <br /> At least one 7
