God Himself cut himself off with a straight razor, then he gave birth to the soil, which gave birth through the son of the hero of the world. <br /> <br /> This is a half-hour movie which shows a dark version of how God created the image. Her surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the film to me is the visual. It's a great black and white film shot using both slow-motion and normal shooting. Sometimes even faster film and stop motion. The scene is long and drag-out, that set a very weird mood. Filming (I think) when no words are recorded, after the effect of the sound, such crichettes, water and other surrounded words have been added, over and over again. You may realize that this movie is not for the person who is indifferent ... <br /> <br /> I often thought it was like David Leichen's Erasehead, it's more difficult to understand than just understanding it, but even more Okay for me, I like stuff like that. It's definitely not entertainment (not like Hollywood's) so if you're going to test it then I recommend you set it up for yourself. Keep open, and with the exception of something like the end of 2001: a space oder.
