My favorite one As a child in New York's Metro area at the age of 60 and in the early 70's, I often had the chance to see NYC with my grandfather, because they conducted business there. Grassroots, violent people, especially in winter, the reality of that city is with me. <br /> <br /> This picture captures Stark, Cold, and genuinely true feelings in the NYC winter season, although it expresses deeply under the criminal and anti-police underworld. A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture. <br /> <br /> and behind the car is simply amazing. Equally with "Bullet" at least, and "French connection" crosses. I can keep an eye on the frequent, the suspension is due to the passage of Pleasurem Fiori Police Crosser's PSMouth Free Police Crosser, because it roams in a sharp right curve, jumping towards the arrival traffic. For that scene, the stunt driving coordinator "Bullet" and "French Connection" as well as many other notable movie chases. Well played, very, and a decent plot line. Musical score is lively and compulsory, and cinematography and direction are top notch. A great, if up to 1970's police drama. A champion Although still not on DVD <br /> <br /> Comparison to style and content: French connection and super fly. In the early 1970's, NYC became blurred during the winter months.
