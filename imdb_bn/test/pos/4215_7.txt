I'll be honest, I paid this movie entirely, this is actually part of the "Children's Play" series. I was expecting a very boring 4th part series, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good, and I found it to be quite funny. There was a lot of dark humor, and the idea of ​​two dolls was a good way to spice things out. Two dolls work well together and join a Bonnie and Clyde type movie. Overall it was very good for the fourth film in Syria, with some deadly death scenes (only Marilyn Manson type died at the beginning, John did not mention the full face of the nail). Applauds the authors for spicing things, and even though I still have a bit strange page room for it's other odd ... perhaps "shiny boy" !!!
