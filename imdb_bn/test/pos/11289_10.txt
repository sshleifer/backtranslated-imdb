E. Elias Merhige's existential test is a hell of a boring watch permanently. It is something that Alexander D. Berke was forced to see "a clockwork orange". However, despite the fact that the film is inaccessible, it is a success. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this and have not seen the film already, it is too late. For me, at least, the paycheck (after 3 separate scenes with a break in your mind) was after the story * Seeing the list of letters. When that simple message hit the house. But I'm wondering if Mergez could tell a 5-minute story in 30 minutes instead of 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, you have already gone out of the bag to see how credit welding is shown on the front page for this movie, and you will definitely appreciate this movie if you appreciate the creation of an existential movie from the beginning of the 20th century. Even then, you may puke <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I appreciate Merhige for creating a piece of art, even if it is disqualified)
