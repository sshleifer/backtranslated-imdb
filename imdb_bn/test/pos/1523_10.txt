This is the most difficult movie I've ever seen ... emotional content is awesome, yet unforgetable. A woman accused of being a political activist has been brought for questioning. Rolling around asking her about the whole movie. Allan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have an intense and strong role to play in, for which they owe to their performance.
