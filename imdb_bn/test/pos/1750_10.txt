When he goes optimistic, he does not discover anything other than bad news for the little bugs in Loveland. This gentle, beautiful nature palanquin, her boyfriend, Miss Madhoo may be in danger, C. Beggie Beatel - and his friends can safely take him home - before it's too late? <br /> <br /> - Not one of the great animated features (a very new art when making this film). Happity is an enjoyable movie that can bring joy to the uncertain audience. Technically it is made well, with a good high quality animation. The main flaw in the movie is that there is no 'heart' in any of the characters - they did not come to 'living' on the screen of Jimmy Cricket a year ago in Pinoccio. <br /> <br /> Comparing Flesher's Studio Output with Disney is absolutely unfair. Max and Dave Fleshier had their own stars; Their contribution - and it will be a remarkable one - there will be a rail cartoon state. Through their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series, they create alternative reality as they are produced by other cartoon studios. Happity was the second experiment with their feature length animation (after Gulires Travels in 1932), and later they would spend their energy again on cartoon short issues. In fact, the first of the first acclaimed Superman series was released. <br /> <br /> The story of Happi is a great deal with Frank Cappar with great power, becomes a hero against powerful social power. In fact, the original title of the movie was MR. BGG goes to TOWN, which immediately keeps Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and thinks of their Capraesque event. <br /> <br /> Famous as Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice here, here are two very different characters, the old Mr Blast and Flat Swat. Movie Magnes will be able to play an intrinsic role in intelligent voice actors Pinto Calvig and Maestro. <br /> <br /> This picture is some of the most beautiful songs provided by Hogi Carmichael and Frank Losser, among which 'My little baby Bumble bees' are the most familiar. 'The Couple The Coup in the Castle' is a fine romantic tune that deserves to be re-invented. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the initial animation of the film, as it came out of the sky, is hidden behind the opening pitcher New York Skylines, opening credits.
