Williams reached a degree in Stardom with this film, and really squandered it. Her poor movie is not led by the delusional choice. This movie really stands out. "Hair" is a musical that is actually related to attitude and probably even more with the famous peace movement of 60's. There are many spectacular songs full of spectacular fashion. By the end of the 70's, in contrast to the music videos of the 80s and 90s, the video's visuals consisted of music content. In other words, the video is inherently compatible with the song, so you could not make it on MTV. The matter is narcotics and hippies, but it is mostly an anti-war film that deals with Vietnam's stupid tragedies. One of the characters is Oklahoma boy's intention to make a difference. He believes that he is eating a pinch of patriotic drill and he is on a gang in New York, who is a less or less glorious hoodlum; Their characters are very unique, and probably will not be sensible today, but these bundles together with the bands burned their draft cards together. Some spectacular scenery and ridiculous scenes involve not only three leads, but a young person with three other gang members as well as a young child, whose entrance is easily one of the ten great entrances in the movie. Because he sings the greatest song of that generation. Despite their faults, you came to love these people, felt a heart and won a movie with Grand Finale.
