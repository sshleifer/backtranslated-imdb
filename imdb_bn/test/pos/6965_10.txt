Six (and last) movies in the boxette. Well, it looks like I've saved the best one for the last. Ghoulies IV. I did a review like this in February, but I decided to do a new job. Ghoulies series is quite awesome. I know there are some people who do not like them, and that's right. This series will be my favorite one. Yes, I know that actual galis do not appear and two replacements are put on the clothes, one of them is Tony Cox from bad Santa. Now, on the film. <br /> <br /> The film is surrounded by Jonathan Groves, the main character of the first film, being played again, Peter Lips, who is now a LAPD cop and the mystery behind him. In the first part of the movie, we encounter Alexander (played by very hot stasi Randall) and communicated with a monster called Faost, which is the direction of the Darkness of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexander for a red jewel and some are awful, therefore, beyond the ghoulies beyond. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with instructions. And interesting by chalk syrin music as well. (Spirir Ahed) At the end of this movie, Ghalli says that there is a Golis IV, Part II, or Ghulis V. I still hope that the signal will be made and I especially hope Jim Winrosky will return directly. I agree with that Gimbo TheGhoulies.
