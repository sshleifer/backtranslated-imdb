If you do not want Italian horror, you do not like this picture. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I was involved in getting married, but the last image My father died while shooting ... all kinds of things. "Dario Argento for creating" Open "<br /> <br /> I was really impressed with the film and the film there - especially in such a state of depression. The whole mystery of "Macbeth" and its curse on the game's fans "Opera." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Throughout life, Argentina is its most clever (and directed by the audience) tricks. A young opera singer, Christina, was suppressed by a violent psychology, which forced her to see a series of cruel murders. By tapping sharp blades on Christina's eyes, the killer makes it impossible to close his eyes, "Take a good look, if you try to close your eyes, you will separate them." So you should see everything. <br /> < br> <br /> It is clear that Argentine Focus is taking great care of the "Macbeth" Opera screen, and closes its hard work, this unusually brutal The killings, the incredible gradual cross sequence and the use of Pov's talent to identify a particular character (thanks to Vincea Redgrav, thanks to God) and you got one of the best Italian horror films of all time. <br /> <br /> I said - It's still the Italian horror. Christina never speaks to anyone outside of this barbarous murder. It may be difficult for the audiences' stomach, but personally I felt more excitement than Christina and her anger. "The tableau" was more drunk than the "opera", but perhaps it was my. <br /> <br /> and last five minutes ... argento wanted it, he heard it, and he kept fighting it in the film. Undoubtedly nobody likes it, but it is not enough for me to destroy the rest of the film. It is one of Argentina's best movies to date. <br /> <br /> 9/10
