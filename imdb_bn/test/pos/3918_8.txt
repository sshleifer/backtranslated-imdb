It's one of the best horror / suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or even decades. Although, in my opinion, this film was predictable in some parts, but it contains everything that is a good film in this style, Chillies, and yes too much! Walk home to safe distributors !!! In some parts it was a long way, the acting was not very good, but my overhang rating for my OHX's room was 8 out of ten ... If you are on the edge of your seats, it's just the right film for you, I have to admit , The entire city was made from wax-handsome ... I enjoyed this museum myself, but after watching this movie I will look at them now completely new Gets!
