When I rented this picture, I was not expecting it, because most of the independent films seem to have diminished a bit in these days (well, Hollywood movies are also about that) but this movie was fantastic, really cool, it's too bad it's a fantastic It does not just reach the audience, because it is just fantastic. I really love Elise's determination, it actually looks at me as a gift to my life, and I see only how much privilege I received for education. But on the one hand, this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, not a budget, it's a fantastic movie and everyone will see it, they will love it and of course learn something from it. One of the best movies I've seen throughout the year, and of course the most real one is not to be a roger Ebert about it.
