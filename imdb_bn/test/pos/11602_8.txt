Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes. Set in Bengali in the early 1900s, this film (based on Tagore's novel) made a similarity between the British colonialization of India and the degeneration of women. An educated and beautiful woman, Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but she does not accept restrictions imposed on her as a widow in her society. It is a beautiful face of the film, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of her depth to portray the strong character of conspiracy in a fine combination of idealism and misconception. Binodini's idealism does not come, and as a result, the harmony between women and colonization is a bit confined.
