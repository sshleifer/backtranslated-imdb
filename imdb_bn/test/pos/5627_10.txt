The film is probably frustrating: a man about 30 years old, a job, a little education, three children of failed relationships, living in his parents' home, but with the dream of managing feature films. But half an hour of the film, you realize that Mark Borchard's immediate drive and ambition - that it is channeled for all its needs in order to manage movies, and nothing else would make him happy. The film comes across all the mental spectrum, but ultimately you feel happy because you know some wonderful people. Go to see it - you'll end up ending.
