I was in the premiere of the movie world, even I met a couple of people in Tod's town (once in the Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he's a little budget with a little time-maker and a little bit of big dreams. <br /> <br /> For the movie, if you like zombie films with very little intrigue it is good and blood and lots of them. You will see plenty of Kansas City location and raw meat, what could be better? :-) Playing different zombies for the same 2 dozen people (only with the change of clothes or hats). When you can get a good drink game with this movie, take a shot when you see the same zombie in a different shirt.
