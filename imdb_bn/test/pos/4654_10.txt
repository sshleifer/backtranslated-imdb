Twenty years after watching this, I still quote something from this movie like "I see myself in the two giant melons", or I'll start singing "Pabs Blue Ribbon Theme". On the other hand, after 20 years, I can now feel the meaning of "meat machine" because there are still many stereotypes that they used for this movie. Those who have a good movie symptom for me. I can say that the film's duration has been tested, which I can not say for more than 80 films. I'm still on the list of many people's favorite movies as a child growing up in the 80's. If you like games and dream to be a "new master" or find yourself in more than 80 films to revitalize your childhood, you have to see it. Also, it is sometimes annoying, and fun. But there is definitely one thing about this movie, if someone invites you to the "Great All-Nighter", that does not mean that there is no X or Acid Trip party, that means, prepare for some midnight Madness! Oh, you can see. Everyone will die to play! hehehehheh
