Warning: Spokalese <br /> <br /> While the film has been running somewhat slow at times, bright scenes, richness of characters and strong themes 'A Venezuelan to die' has given a rewarding experience. I did not read the Thomas Standards book, but I'm sure that the viscounty's visual fascinating, musical scores and strong disclosure of conflict and desire must certainly be judged. <br /> <br /> The study of Gustav Von Aschecke reflects the human tendency to rationalize and measure our emotions, behavior and emotions. This trend is shown in Germany's scene between Alfred and Gustav, when Alfred describes the song as mathematical - for example. quantifiable - and emotional. This clash again comes up again in the scene where young Tadizio is alone playing 'Fuar Elise' in the hotel lobby, and Gustav is going to his Barcelona where he has taken a prostitute, who runs the same song. His flashback, after the fall of the slaughter, Gustav was physically confiscated by the consequences of his actions. This reaction serves as a moral reaction reminder of the persecution of Tajzio representation. Finally, Gustav was forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and resign himself in your own desires and temptations? Or is it possible to save his life in Venice? As a result of his initial effort to escape from Venice at the train station, his stability and prediction of the outcome of his position are predicted. <br /> <br /> The fascinating character interaction, Viccantry's powerful scenery (especially Venice's Dawn and the final scene) Tadizio walks in the water and points towards the horizon) This film represents a true masterpiece.
