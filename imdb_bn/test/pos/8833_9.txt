I was part of the Space ODC Cast, playing Fido in the mission control. I just want to say that none of us is an actor, especially to respond to the green screen of those who are under the control of the mission, no idea how amazing it would be. I knew it was going to be good, providing only for the cameras and professionalism that only the Impressible Pictures production team provided for everyone involved. But when we saw it for the first time in the screening of Carson Mayafar, I feel very proud. I am very happy that none of us saw that we were in the Star Trek. Joe Aherne, screenwriter and director, is the most amazing people to work for. She mostly gets together in a good team and then they sincerely believe incredibly they do what works best. I'm really lucky to have been part of this show. Who will understand something in this epic and watch the complex understand it will turn to be enticing. And my god has it in a beautiful universe.
