Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulain) was not so beautiful. As "Cleent" Gary Cooper is not so good as a laconic Texan who knows this Gal knows well. When two eyes locked in the French market, we know that this match will be fantastic. When they walk around in their restored French Quarter house in their garden and play the theme of love, it's the dream of all our romantics. <br /> <br /> Dresses are lovely; Set kit "quarters" you want was just that way. And that Saratoga was still in that hotel with ample veranda with gossiping old biddies. <br /> <br /> From the novel of Edna Ferbers, the old mistakes in the story are revenge and the fights on those who will run the railway are the first days of the industry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The relatives of New Orleans sent him to stop at a magic movie moment. After enjoying the conversation through Cleo, he fell in love with her and said, "I can say - you are so beautiful". And with a happy, sad smile, Clio said "yes, it's not lucky." You want to "yes" shout !!! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romantic movies.
