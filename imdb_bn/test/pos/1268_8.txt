I noticed two things in this picture. (This is not a satirical, just a mistake in the story.) When he receives his first B & B bill in the lap, he finds the "box". As soon as the coil found it, he said, "Box. Everyone has a box". A minute later, before he dumped the contents on the floor, he said, "We are really fortunate, you do not see them often". <br /> <br /> Observation # 2 (Spoiler Alert!) <<br /> <br /> I saw this thing thrice, I could not find some things. Then I saw the Chromatic version and saw that during the change of time they were back to the previous flashback. So in some cases we were actually seeing three different times during the nearly 1 minute wall. <br /> <br /> It was a good thing because I did not know how many times before I could go back to see Netflix. <br /> <br /> I'm essential color.
