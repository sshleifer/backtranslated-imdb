I have liked this movie since my childhood. I think my mother brought this movie for me at night. I like it and I still do it I think it's very funny and original. There are some very interesting tunes in this movie. Lou is also a wonderful good singer. Actor actor Prince Arthur and Princess Elise are fine, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavyweight boxing sensation Body Bear, the brother of former heavyweight champion McBayer, is also the police and the monster in this film as well. He is a good actor than boxing. He was a natural talent. At the beginning of this movie, Lou Castello kept up the car and how he got a problem with the Buddy Bar. Slapstick at home is very good. I especially like the comedy in the giant's castle. My favorite part is; Part Lou was climbing the beanstalk and they are all sung as a farewell. Jack sings back to them that he'll be back. Lou Costello singing is a very good one. When Jack is fighting with giant, my favorite part is part. When Jack breaks the egg, I like it, and when he tries to make a giant a dilemma, then he explodes. Abbott and Costello are ridiculous and the greatest comedians of all time. This is their only great movie I love and will be concerned. Reviews for this movie are not very good and I do not understand why. This is a very good Abbott and Costello movie. Luo Castello finally came back to reality and I think he came back to dream when he hit Bud. She is going to push me like someone to start singing with her songs and an attitude. Very good movie
