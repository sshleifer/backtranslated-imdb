My most favorite movie is a Dirty Dance. I saw it twice in ABC because it did not have the chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea that Jennifer Gray made the film at the age of 27, because she was very convinced as a teen. She has a lot of flat chests compared to some women in Hollywood, so I'm fooling her so easily about her age. So both physical and emotionally, Gray pulls off a teen playing very well. I like dance - who do not? I have seen dance again and again, I want to see dance classes. I also love Soundtrack, and when I'm eight or nine, I can recognize some songs. I want to be able to see it in my drama class, and I'm going to ask my teacher sometime if she is a movie partner that she can use for educational purposes. It's a lot better than the last time he showed us the stuff. And the finishing was absolutely bizarre. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I am waiting for the great dance to come back on the first day! Who could ask for a better impression from a movie with such title?
