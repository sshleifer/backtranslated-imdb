Kanse won a special prize to play this film and why it is not difficult to see. (A few spoilers - but for the last, you have to watch the movie!) A simple story - Veronica (Tatiana Samolova) Boris (Alesei Bottlow) in Moscow on the eve of the war between Russia and Germany in World War II. But when he learned that he was listed in the army, his spot There are. When Boris comes out in front of her, Veronica tells him that she loves him. Though Boris was shot dead, his last fate was unknown to Veronica or his family. Mark, Boris's cousin, felt the obligation to marry him, Veronica. Depressed and demeaned by the awful Mark, Veronika hopes that Boris will return one day. Fantastic camera-by-works by director Kalatozov-works and wonderful set pieces. (Interested in another cartoon movie Katatozov's technique of filming, I have AM CUBA, at least two excellent set pieces - one of them is the long tracking shots started through a funeral procession through Havana Street, raising two stories of Cigar factory, tracks by window and tall Long Avenue follows the procession - all without cutting.) The superhit acting , Especially Samolova and Vassili Mercuryeva (as Barisal's uncle) which continuously diminishes. A devastating romantic movie with heart rate performance by Samoilova. (This movie is also associated with other Russian classic ball of a soldier.)
