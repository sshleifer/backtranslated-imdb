Heaven from heaven is heaven A movie for this family - teens and grandparents can enjoy it together. But it does not make the syrupy sweet or silly. Characters are really "letters". The plot is a bit complicated and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting a riddle, because it's all bits by bit. The start time is to see or remember an old photo album. It is very good to be done with extremely accurate hairstyles and costume. The story twists, turn around and move along fast with so much fun. <br /> <br /> The face of a special treatment is to see big shields, among which we have not seen a long time in a long time. The funny part is to recognize and name them mentally, though it may be confusing. At the end of the film Claris Lichmann thinks that there is a make-up in his "Oprah". I have never seen Faye Grant in any movie - only in TV series "Saving Grace" she knew as Mother of Grace. She was great, even subdued the southern pronunciation. And I do not even recognize Shelly Duvall. This very intelligent movie has created five sisters very talented quintet and sister Theresa is a divine treasure.
