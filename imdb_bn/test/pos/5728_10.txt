I'm a physicist myself, and I think I think it's one of the best 'popular' roles in string theory. The elegant Universe manages the entire subject of the string (though it is actually M) the theory is accessible to larger viewers. <br /> <br /> Some 'popular science' programs think that the best method is to throw audiences on the edge of the deep, none of them and some of them. This program goes through concepts like general relativity and quantum mechanics and explains the things that need to be solved between two things, so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe at both the larger and smaller levels. <br /> <br /> I think some may say slowly and take too much time to get interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: against that point. From the beginning it is impossible to explain the theory of the string, without referring to the physics in its heart, and according to the explanation of the elegant universe, it is clean and entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you really like this program, depending on some of the green presentations, you want to primarily dumpfode: depending on the size and space of the spare time, the battlefield is not well-organized in everyday life, is not it? However, if you are convinced of some other external concepts in this program, you will find that it will give you insights into the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you're studying physics, well, it's great entertainment as well as you'll be able to follow it and appreciate even more!
