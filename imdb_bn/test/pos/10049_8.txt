This is an extraordinary movie as a movie - it gets 8 out of 10. As a pictured piece of accurate history ... one wants to be more loving, but it is 5 out of 10. And I think I actually have so many charities. <br /> <br /> What he liked - the youngest boy in the central army of American Civil War, and the horse and Saber died with the greatest command. North American Indian tribal victory? The heretical, militant, intelligent, bloody, ambitious, cute, extremely clever, Indian enemy, Indian friend (?), And national hero In 1876, his death was considered a national tragedy and he earned the same fame as Washington, Lincoln, Jackson and Grant / Lee and Sherman / Jackson. The growing awareness of his career mistakes is only for him - it is very ambitious hot spot, his reputation has been reduced. Yet to this day, George Armstrong Castler is the best memorable figure in his history's military history, ultimately losing his last fight (I really do not think so alike - maybe General Jonathan Miju Weinwart, was forced to stay with his men in Baton) death marches - but in WayneWarit March and World War II Had survived). <br /> <br /> The cast has appeared in more pictures than a movie better than the Western Adventures and Little Big Horn. True storytelling was not so romantic that Raul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled it in this film. But even in 1941 the legend was still strong. Olivia de Havilland depicts Libby Castler, who recently mentioned in another film review on the thread that George was alive until 1933, so that eight years later, the effective management of his story was still effective. The cast was shown as our misguided but brave brave warrior, and turned around in the shadow of World War II and kept our originality and the truth was buried. John Ford understood it completely and approved it. <br /> <br /> So we see that he was hot sputter, but he was patriot. Although the West Point was almost destroyed (which was true), the cast was in the class of 1861, and in that year it was really stupid to be a piki about such a warrior. You see, the so-called military genius of West Point (from Robert E. Lee Down) was south and joined the Confederation. Every North "point" people who find the union are needed. <br /> <br /> A more intensive study of the caste's civil war should be given - He is the general in in chief, George B. McLlanan was involved with the staff and prominent campaign on the peninsula itself and other Eastern empire wars. But he was a caviarman - and he will be in the next part of the war, with Grant and Sherman's friend Phil Sheridan's careful approach. Especially he gave dash and differences in the Battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of conflict in the Shenandoah Valley. It was severely hit on the individual level (his nearest West Pointer friend, Stephen Ramsur, joined the Confederation and got in a position as a custodian - seriously injured, the custodian was alive with Ramsur last night). <br /> <br /> After the war, the thing got separated. He wanted to create his Brevet - Major General Permanence (it was not a battleground promotion). One of them is to give him a narrow army along the border. The colonel was in there. He tried to play politics in 1866 by making a mistake in helping President Andrew Johnson get a political tour, and most respondents found Johnson hated them as unarmed fools. He probably praised the Indians (he must have pronounced them and western writings), but in 1868 he created a military military massacre of Indian women and children which ended with the court martial. Subsequently, in the 1870s, he supported Indian claims against politicians' ring (which went to the Secretary of War, William Bellnap), who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit. It destroys Bellena and leaves black eyes on the Grant Administration. It kept him in the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was the former commander of the Ballencope) and Sherine rarely saved his career. Then he is sent to the final Big Horn campaign. And immortality has come. <br /> <br /> That carrier is really a real movie, but will it be very complicated? In the 1850s, can we hold a man in the 1876 criteria? Do we want to be with us for a hundred years? Of course it can happen, but I'm not sure we will like it. <br /> <br /> Castor (1941 style) Fills like a glove fits his main dance movie "Dance". Her final film with Olivia de Havilland is underlined with a sadness due to the fate of heroes. Sydney acted as a friend, an enemy, even a treacherous chain (Kennedy) acting like Greenstreet, Stanley Ridge, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn. It is higher as part of a fun of legendary joke - but it is not what a complex military hero's research should be.
