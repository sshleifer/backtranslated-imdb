Elizabeth Ashley has received a phone call from her nephew Michael - she is crying, shouting and asking for help. The problem was 15 years ago Michael died. <br /> <br /> This picture was broadcast to me on ABC in 1927. It is seen again, a few years later, it still works. <br /> <br /> The movie is a little slow and expected, the death is too long and a happy ending, but it's a TV movie so you have to give it room. Elizabeth Ashley is excellent, Ben Gaza is okay and Michael Douglas is so fun to see at such a young age And those telephone calls are still alive out of me in the light of daylight. I was actually going to have a light on one of them! <br /> <br /> A Fuzzy Little TV Movie Worth watching.
