... and generally I do not like the surprise !! Watch this movie with a chance at South Africa in the second week of the second week of motorbiking holidays in ZA. In addition to playing good shots and work, it helped me to understand the problems of the country. Just watched "Million Dollar Baby" and Hilary Swann saw the name because it was a little familiar and her performance was fantastic. He did not understand the solicitors in the "red dust". Now I'm not worried that he will disappear like many other sideclicks of Clint. Now I'm asked to write ten complete lines which I wanted to write because I wanted to write. Okay, here it goes: I think if you are from Western countries, especially Europe, then you will see how it is happening and will help you to understand it better! So this hope will fill ten lines.
