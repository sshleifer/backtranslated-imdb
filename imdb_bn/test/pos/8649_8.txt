Initially, I thought about the opening scene of "One on a Time in the West" with remotely and remote sound switching. When it comes to town, it starts to feel like "kitchen stories" or "drifting clouds", even perhaps "grim". <br /> <br /> It is seen that it is more similar to "Joe Valkano v" theme (not style). And the same end from the beginning of the movie, understated style. Let you take the inspection letting, suites, blue gray gray, dresses, wall colors, furniture, bedsheets, mirrors, cars, music, background words and even people's expression. Then at the end, one shot of a different light - soft orange-yellow soft music and ocean splashing, children and smile. <br /> <br /> But maybe the observation for me is too long, instead I want to see alternate side or last shot after the character happens to happen. Still nice work
