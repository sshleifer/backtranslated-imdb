The film evidently came from the idea that one of the writers when he saw his creation in a supermarket. Residents of Raven Vassi bow down to the world in 'our' world to stop writing the authors about them and thus do not destroy their world. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the first few minutes we can get: Barnes (Villa Vika) is unfortunately guilty during the confession! Peanut (the creature that tries to collect the microbes from the microbes, destroying every creature continually); Mickey (thick outside belief) is being, thick, thick; And Tubbs (intimate sisters wife and local shopkeeper) are ever getting sweet - but still annoying. Some regular letters are missing, but a new idea by Gents introduces some 16th-century characters - and we also have the Gents itself in action. If you are new to the League of Gentlemen, this is a simple introduction and a lot of fun. If you are a longtime fan, you have what you have hoped for - Jeremy Daisen is with the joy of spots. <br /> <br /> Everybody said that it got the same strange weird humor which is a series, plus some touching 'introspection' some moments. For example, Hepher Leip has taught that he maintained a mild status that was considered by his creators as a 'character of humor'. Although they are mostly letters, many people develop in unexpected ways that are quite normal. <br /> <br /> This song is called 'Han Song' for Raven Vesi, but a showcase for it. The genet who proves (gasp!) They can write other things - and it can be very funny. (But you knew that anyway.)
