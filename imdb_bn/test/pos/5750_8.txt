I thought a Christian, and this movie was quite good! :) Acting Academy was not eligible for the award, although I think it was good, while casting this film, Cast Casting was considered limited in the experience. <br /> <br /> The gospel message and the power of transformation were a wonderful explanation of Jesus Christ. The message that the director was trying to overcome (which is not important, the characters are not arranged!) Clearly found. The theme of the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was also a good idea (very good muscle cars, btw). I think this movie must reach out to many young people. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie, this is a great witnessing device! :)
