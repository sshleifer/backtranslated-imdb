As a movie, Italian JOB is OK well; Well done (not great), <br /> <br /> Excellent visual and panning, a mediatory plot, but nothing bad enough <br /> <br /> to go outside. But as a car commercial for the new species of MINI <br /> <br /> Cooper, this image is spectacular! <br /> <br /> * Spokela * <br /> <br /> It is a typical strange twist with aesthetic film (safe-cracking water was excellent, if not impossible), and the cast was fairly strong < br <> <br /> (except for the exception of a pot walburg), but when it came <<br /> <br /> <br /> The real "star" of this picture is three minutes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cooper, their high flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping, <br /> <br /> Bullets, gold-lugging, shiny new gur Mother. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The same reaction was born in Wahlberg. <br /> <br /> The film promises. Moss Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > Why does he claim that this is his best film I can not imagine; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Charlize Sultan's daughter fined, <br /> <br /> <br /> There is nothing witch. Seth Green's character is perfect and <br /> <br /> Napster Joker (Founder of Napster, <br /> <br /> Shawon Fanning) He and some of the beginning of the Mose Def <br /> <br /> lines add some necessary sparks to the laugh. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Edward Norton and Donald Sterreland are not near enough <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The conversation is rife with the bad one-liners and give-aways, but I think <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie makers here were out of the re-discover, so As a <br /> <br /> General action / mystery flick comes out just right. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it does not value the weight of gold, but makes for excellent complementary.
