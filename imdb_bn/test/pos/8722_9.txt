What a absolutely charming movie? Cast is wonderful, and the story is diverse and fun. All about a happy movie experience. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, it does not make the story enjoyable, actually I did not want to finish it. I've always been an Ingrid Bergman fan, and I was interested in watching him play a comedic role. He did not disappoint me with the performance of Messi Dickinson's Ingrid Bergman. I liked his interaction with Tony in his dance and "dentist" in the music store. It was further proved that whatever I knew beforehand, she was the greatest actress of all time. Goldie Hahon is delighted to see. The dynamic force of his funny, gentle heart and loving Tony movie. You do not even ask why he is so concerned about his wife's wife, you only acknowledge that he is not a person who will not be happy until he is everyone else. And Walter Matthew is as great as Julian. His actions do not create a feeling of conflict for the audience, in fact they almost make him more permanent. The bunch was not an impossible character. This film certainly has been standing over time, I saw it last night and I think it's the romantic comedy I've ever seen. If you are looking for a fun, lighthearted, romantic comedy look no longer.
