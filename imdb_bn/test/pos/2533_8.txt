When it was released, in the early 80's, Pixot came under the influence of young criminals in Brazilian society and Brazilian society. I can not see the movie at that time, because I was too young, but now I have a chance and saw it a few days ago. This is a very cruel movie, but everything is absolutely true, and sad. The name of the 12-year-old boyfriend, who lives in the street, and survives with the helpless; He used to stay in a house for a while, and when he gave up, he continued to loot other bun and prostitution played by Marilyn Per√°r. Boy still forgets his sad reality, a marijuana addict and smell glue with other teens. The quality of the images is not the best, but the film is completely realistic about the Brazilian problem and it must be seen and appreciated.
