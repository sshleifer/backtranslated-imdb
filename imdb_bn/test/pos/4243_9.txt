Chakir's wife started one night and Officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) entered the evidence room at her police station and in the horror films of the tragedy, she stole the residue of the Chaki puppet that the serial killer Charles Li had returned to the road. The Original Children's Play (1988). He eventually moved to an isolated area where Ray's ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) blazed Bailey's neck and finally took her to the trailer. Tiffany Stites and Staples Chuckie (voice of Brad Dourife) came back together and used the book 'Dummies for Voodoo' to bring him a murderer. Tifani did not expect as much as Tifani hoped and Chakki did not become a man of his dreams, so he locked him in a playline, of which lesser than happiness. Tiffany escapes to Chakki by bathing, using her power plant and the book to give her life as a female bride dressed as a bride. To go to the graveyard in New Jersey, stuck together and work together in plastic bodies, where Ray's natural body is buried enough to bring their souls back to the human body. Both Tiffani's neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabell) and his girlfriend Z (Catherine Higel), who are the clever tricks of Zer's corrupt uncle Warren Kinside (John Ritter), will work fine ... <br /> <br /> I run by Ronny Ur Love chakir wife Script by Don Mancini is great fun, moving very fast, referencing other awful films with very entertaining and good affection. From the opening sequence, we see Jason Bhurish's hockey mask from Friday on the 13th film, the Edmie Street series of the Halloween franchise and the rider of the Frederick Kr√ºger in Knightmare of Michael Mayer Mask, the Blade Glove. In the clips used from the brand of frankenstein (1935), it has virtually re-visualized the same scene. Chakir's wife does not take herself seriously, which is very good, has multiple lanterns, Scrum (1996), a world transformed a few years ago, and it makes herself fun and is not afraid of the awful style. In general. When Jesse and ZK get to hear chicks and she makes funny, disrespectful comments and gestures, I like the scene. It does not have to say that there is not an extraordinary good movie there as well. The director was able to create good atmosphere and funny realistic ideas, both people and plastic letter characters are both favorite and bright, because each pair enjoys their own domestic problems, which can be clearly the reason behind the dead body being left behind. Technically Chaky Bride is quite good in most cases and it has a big budget polish and I hope for around 25,000,000 dollars. The only thing that I would say, Kevin John's puppet effect is somewhat stiff and unbelievable, I can not remember a SGI scene in the Chaky Bride. Thankfully, the film is stolen in a bloodstream, bloody throat, bloody throat, until it explodes in the mouth of a person, in the mouth of a person, some of them are bloody and are separated by a huge truck. Lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots Acting is quite good and Dork is very funny as Chacky because he spouts out a liners. I liked the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and after all those fatty gear we found it very sexy, I can not be the only one? I personally think the Shady Bride is a fantastic movie, from the beginning to the end, the excellent humor and horror of equal measurement and just 85 minutes long it does not become annoying or lazy. My personal favorite, as soon as you can see it!
