This is not so much of a review because it has been proved that it has been proved that the Academy does not make money, but achieves artistic success. And I must say that the Emdad members usually put the artist and the intelligent band above 250. Boogie Knights is powerful, raw and cool by script, direction and acting. Very few movies can claim this triple crown.
