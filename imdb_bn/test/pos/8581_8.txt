I have seen this picture twice and I am very impressed with it. <br /> <br /> Conversations between Niemi and her mother Plus Niemy and Matthew are very sensitive. The Nigerian community is shown in a very real sense and colorally it is usually. <br /> <br /> While some may work with detailed explanations; If we knew why Matthew was in the south of early France, then Matty could understand the scenes found in his car. Thankfully, there is a website for Optimum Release which contains detailed product notes <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I hope the video release gets a larger audience because the film demands it.
