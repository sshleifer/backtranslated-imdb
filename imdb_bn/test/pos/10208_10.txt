Fritz Lang has instructed two great westerners: "Western Union" and "Frank James of Return". Frank James equals the movie "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of Randolph Scott's great western side. I have never seen Robert Young in the West; He is awesome as telegraph employee. The only movie I can think of is the open of the Telegraph Company to the west. This is a high-profile story about the West Telegraph, a triangle love story, and loyalty. <br /> <br /> Supporting Cast Fantastic Some Westerners Dean Jagger played Telegraph Manager Virginia Gilmour, who plays the sister of Jagger, loves to love this movie. Mrs Gilmour's movie had a small career. In 1952, he left the film and became a playwright. She is primarily known as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. Slim Somerville is again in a movie with Mr. Scott again in a movie. They also had two great films: "Rebecca of Sunnybuk Firm" and "Jesse James".
