It's a very underlying movie to say the least. As mentioned in the previous post, this movie is a bit loose and contains extremely vague script but you yourself say "Who's Care?" During drying your nose (or pouring your favorite drink here). It was really due to the rare mix of actors in sync. Perhaps a gifted actor (reference 'Fresher', the film), a supporting actress / actress in Kells Grammar plays their role quite well. I have seen how I threw the Big Game shot for the Naval Basketball team and gave it to Dwayne Martin's part; If you are a basketball fan, then remember Martin from 'White Men Can not Jump' and 'Apuo the Rim', and you know that Martin was a little work in NBA with NKO. Excellent how they thrown into the qualities of such credible characters. Rob Schneider's anal-restrained character was the perfect offset of calm behavior of grammar. Lauren Holly is enough good enough for her to wish you to be successful - a brain acting with sexpot This is a movie that will make you ridiculous even if you've seen it long ago ... The comic bits of this movie are definitely the end. I still find myself smiling after 12 years. <br /> <br /> "Is this my chicken one?" "Uhh ... no, it's a parrot .... from the Caribbean." "All right, do not fly ... it's dinner." "Arrrrr .....- Arr."
