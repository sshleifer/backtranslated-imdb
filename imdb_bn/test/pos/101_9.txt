This is a very, very weird movie ... it's such a great thing that you can see it for yourself. The film begins with his graduate teacher harping his class, because students are not curious to be curious nor curious! You can say very quickly that this person is almost inferior - in fact, it is attracted towards the inner senses of your own interest and not finding any value. In addition, he feels tired and bored with the unity of life. <br /> <br /> In the later film, she managed to trample into a bank robbery and disturb the robbers so that one of them shoot him in the head. Strangely, this picture was a very strange description of just half the way and the final second of his life. When this movie is exciting, the style of description is similar to the novels of this literary professor - as well as written in cleverly and we can tell all that we want. <br /> <br /> Check out this weird movie - it's amazingly compelling and not what I've ever seen before.
