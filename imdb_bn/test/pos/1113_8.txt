I have long seen the most breathtaking portraits of small town oddities and I am not just talking about Australian movies. This part of the work has been created "under radar" and it is indeed a completely impressive work, which is a worldwide invisible in recent Aust. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The amazing view of this film by Alex Freon is his iron, cruel direction. It is never bothered, it is highly regulated, precise and absolutely confident. Cinematography I saw some of the most beautiful, beautiful and lyricist. The word creates all psychic, musical tension <br /> <br /> Through the third act, the story spread and the episodes collide and combine - do not try to combine the last 20 minute puzzle. It is a bit of a deceiver - but by that time the film has a bit of a trans, a kind of hypnosis, and you have sold a puzzle - that has no real answer.
