Closet Land Cinema is a wonderful, awesome piece. It's just two actors in a single set, but do not lose your attention. Set design is fantastic and annoying, staging scenery keeps your attention, adding confusion and your own idea of ​​terrorism. There are responsibilities to carry out every scene of the acting, Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stove. <br /> <br /> I saw this picture in 1991, after coming to the video. I did not play where I was in the theater; Not surprisingly, its political content has been given. It should be seen, though. It combines a brighter staging feature of torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to create fear and loyalty among its citizens. The country is not named, which makes it all the more interesting. It can be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World It shows what happens when a small group of people decides what is best for everyone. When the government becomes the ruler of the slaves, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He found himself in a room with Alan Ricman, a seemingly pleasant worker. At first it seems to be a terrible mistake and she is free to go; But, fear protects him and enhances terrorism. He is increasingly victims of physical and mental torture. The questioning author breaks sensory deprivation, temporary manipulation, confusion, audience manipulation, role play, and twisted argument. He is insulted and barbarous, forced to endure hard physical position, deprived of food and water. <br /> <br /> He refused; Asking what to interrogate. It is said to be the end of all if he only signs a confession. A simple little law. He refused. Through this, he appointed advanced defense processes from childhood. It gradually revealed that she was a childhood victim of sexual abuse. To survive, he developed imaginary worlds and characters that would take him away from abuse. This process allows him to cross his torture and launch his interrogator table. He started attacking his own beliefs and occupation and forced him to examine his own life and objectives. Finally, he is free, because he maintains freedom of thought. The interrogator is trapped by the state. <br /> <br /> This movie was a cold war altitude, racism, and at a time when there was daily news of the crime of various governments around the world. This is a world where more "enemy fighters" are held and questioned in secret jails, denied legal rights or advice; Where "ethnic cleanliness" wages the entire society, and humanitarian aid is denied. It shows that the person can stand against the state or other oppressors by denying the protest of terror or terrorism.
