I found the story just like a thriller that the music of the wonderful Henry Mancky did not ruin me. Julie Andrew was nice and I did not understand why this movie has a problem at the box office when it comes out because it just makes me happy to sing everyone. And I'll be happy at the end of the end, which seems like you can tell some of the traditional Blake Edwards comics in this movie ...
