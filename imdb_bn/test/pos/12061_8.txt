I really like this series. The fun and unique style of closing the wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a new trend in it. When it was a sitcom, it stood due to what could be strange issues. <br /> <br /> Each direction has a comedy turn, and the show is really very good. My favorite part of the program is Father, rather Dave's strange comments. Its rants break the program, and allow a really good flow. Not perfect, because sometimes the comedy is not loud fun, and the actor is sometimes waiting for audience response, but otherwise this program is good. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this program, and it is very sad that it has been canceled. Make another series, and finish it correctly
