I have to repeat what I said earlier in this movie's defense. The film is called Arachina, it does not have a name, and I do not want to say anything like acting actors in the small art house movie. I have decided to make a film number in my local high school and it can have a budget of $ 2, and I do not even mean that. So what is the hope? Hitcoak? <br /> <br /> I think the movie itself never took seriously, which automatically took it out of the worst movie list. This list is for big budget only, which is all star custom movies that are taken very seriously. Sylvester Stallone's most of the movie thinks of this Oscar. These two were not Lead Haupburn and Tracy, but they did well enough to do their work for this film. The woman did not have a blithering ass on the butt kick and the guy. The actor was actually very good at playing the old man. Clifton was a person who played an oral obstacle professor, but he did a deity job. And due to the lack of Bimbo, two eligible actors played. I laugh at 50 percent special effects. But that was part of the specs of the movie. It's a hybrid Tremors like live starring Dead Night. The courtroom of the film is like all 50 giant bugs. A meteor or radiation awakens the ecosystem and you know that the giant aunt, lobster, stone or lizard trades locals to us. A meteor was causing problems during this time. I was very entertaining. I did not expect much and I did much more then I applied for.
