"China Syndrome" was not released at a better time: Twelve days after his release, there was a notorious screw-up on a three-mile island. But that (and / or Chernobyl) never happened, even an important aspect of what might happen through the misuse of nuclear facilities remains an important aspect. Jack Lemon is trying to expose a cover-up of his nuclear plant as a supervisor, playing a reporter trying to investigate the Jane Treas, and Michael Douglas plays his cameraman. <br /> I do not know if there is a current threat of terrorist attacks, "China syndrome" makes it more annoying, but in some other way it is a film that everyone can see. <br /> <br /> I hope those who have spent years trying to stop nuclear power have seen this movie so that they know that their opinions and ideals are completely inactive.
