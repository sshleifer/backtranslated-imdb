Because of the 90's, I really enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WW1bb cartoons. <br /> <br /> I do not know why; The first cartoon of the 90's was something special; I do not know whether there was an uncertainty atmosphere, a generational change, whatever. But "Tinny Tunes" puts VB of 90 and distributes one of the most popular, fun, and underlying cartoons ever made. <br /> <br /> The memories are unclear but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and the show related to the show. Easily, no other cartoon has allowed me to laugh a bit (before teens go into dark sitcoms). <br /> <br /> Characters were all fun and were not really true characters. Each single character was delightful and deserved to say a lead.
