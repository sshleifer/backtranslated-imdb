Without the most thrilling story in the history of the film, what can I say about this movie ... and based on the real story! When the Berlin Wall was used to hold a country, it became old to remember, this film gives you dark insights into the Eastern Jurisdiction of the serious prison and does not pay any cost to escape their costly efforts. The film follows two family life, who decided to run away using a hot-air balloon built by themselves. Always fearing the arrest by authorities, by neighbors, they must count on a plan to reach the other side of the wall. Respect for a brave and courageous story that truly failed in West Berlin and the treacherous journey of independence.
