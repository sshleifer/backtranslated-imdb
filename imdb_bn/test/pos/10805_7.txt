I was very enthusiastic to see this Wazda-Depardieu coming, plus time is particularly attractive. Being Wajda fan, I was frustrated, and that could be an understatement. The film has never taken a cinematic flight - There is no basis for animosity between Danton and Robespieri. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script was weak (adapted from "Danton Affair"). And yet, the direction was efficient ... it is Wajda, later! Also, there were some amazing actors but they did not catch the attention of the audience like them. Depardieu comes off as a quasiy-goofy, non-resident Danton ... just do not remember the images we have in mind. Woijech Pzsoniak is incredible, as usual, but again the limit of the script keeps even the great talent can not break the actors. Andres Tsurin and Bogoslal Linda pop up ... as a boarding and st-jost ... and if you are familiar with Wajda, you can recognize them. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was disappointed with this much acclaimed film. Great cast, great director, but no quality foundation. Bad, steady script. We need to get in Danton (Wales) and Raspice (General J) montsets ... what is their purpose? Ah ... who knows? One woman likes, another powder yourself? Riiight. All right, so if you are looking for a great French revolution film, I recommend "La Biplob Fran√ßoise" ... in two parts and great-great! Excellent performance, depth scripts, juicy tid bits ... definitely a satisfactory experience !! Better than the Claus-Mariah Brandu's Depardieu, Dante ... wonderful Andres Sourene obviously took notes from "Danton" and Brilliant like Robespierre. See it! Are now! For fans of Wajda - you better off with "Iron / Marble Man", "Promised Land", and similar. Cheers !!
