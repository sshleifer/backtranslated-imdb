I believe this movie was not made for a royal amount of 8000 pounds but it was not really shown. There was no desire for production or acting, the characters were great and the real and the place could be a deserts of the world instead of the very warm sea beach in the north. The actors were easily accepted as a bunch of tenants who were devastated on a mysterious, secluded and ornamented planet, some of them thought to be particularly friendly with each other, but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their colleagues alive. There was no big explanation of what was happening, which could be really made, so many things were left in your imagination, just as Big is empty which I also enjoyed. I have seen that most of the letters have been quite hot, some were probably strange moments, men were so common that you felt that you could express their feelings and the end and finishing of the film was tragic. I think Mr Steatron and his crew must be proud of themselves, I've seen bad films with millions of budgets.
