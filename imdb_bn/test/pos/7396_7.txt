* Speakers * <br /> <br /> There is no difference between anyone saying that, the film is frozen. This is a film about a killer Snowman, a series of Jack Frost. Ice was created while executing a guilty sedative killer, when the death penalty was brought to the Chamber, but the truck crashed with a truck with DNA manipulation chemicals, which created human DNA ties with soil, or snow in this area. The first film was just boring and finally Snowman was destroyed by pouring antifreeze on it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some scientists revive Jack Frost with chemicals and antifreeze. Never give any explanation why they do this, they just do. Meanwhile, Farhoff's arrestee Shefarif is going to Bahamas. Unfortunately, Snowman comes with him. <br /> <br /> There are all this movie. It's talking about a cow that can stand, when the ice cubes get stuck in your mouth and the killers are frosted. Yes, killer snowballs They even say "grandfather!" Like kids I will pay these credit makers. Snowballs are some of the few things that ever dream. I wish I could get one as a pet. Frost finally wipes out the island, such as a killer snowman has the power to influence the main weather patterns. <br /> <br /> then there are actors. Manawars, FBI agents from the first film, except here he is wearing an ipach. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I'm an FBI agent! YARRR! And then there are stereotypical black Jamaican with stereotypical British adventure and dreadlocks. And finally, Captain's fun. The most fruitful person facing the planet, bar someone <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but ridiculous. I totally dig my butt down, and I recommend this for those who prefer a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** *** *** ***
