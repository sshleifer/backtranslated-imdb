If I leave my theater for the quality of the movie then I think about it. I'm still thinking about this next day, which often does not happen. <br /> <br /> Scenes (16th century Italian guess), clothing, lighting, cinematography are all excellent. This is apparently a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> The letters that must be sent must never be written, but these actors have made most of their content which is excellent. This is one of Shakespeare's best plays, which people still enjoy more than 400 years. All the principals were interesting and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Those who are saying anti-Semitic will be deaf and blind. If anything, it is against the 16th-century Catholic-Venitian opposition. While Shailak was hit, he acted in a controlled and oppressed man, but it is clear that the community he lives in is basically blamed. There are also scripts clearly in their personal responsibility. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
