All right, so I've read most of the reviews of this movie, as well as the opinions of visitors to this site, and I feel that most people who have written the review do not like this movie. That's why I am writing now- I represent minorities because I did. I admit, I went to see the film because I was very impressed with Ryan Gosling's amazing power, and the projects he had recently shared with were less than incredible. She is an amazing actor. Meanwhile, I wanted to watch this movie because it seems curious to me ... why? Because it's a Hoodden known as 'Hoodunit' from the beginning and it's kind of unusual. <br /> <br /> Since the plot goes away, two teenage boys try to "perfect offense" because they believe that people are truly free-only by the crime of crime, unmarried, and remember, innocent, out of selfish will Works. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, that was indicated in homosexuality and brilliantly played by Queen Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was manipulation, smooth-talking control, and Pitt was extremely book-smart, socially awkward outcast Enter the character of Sandra Bullock, it seems that most people do not particularly appreciate it. I think when people can see executive producers then they automatically play any role that is self-glorious. I do not see that as the case here. Without the personal history of "Casey" about a former husband, who killed him almost, who did not share the same characteristics with Richard Herd surprisingly, he would never follow his instinct about Justin and Richard. There was apparently a case against the verdict of the case, the unexpected school generator and the boy's friend. When boys ask questions at the end of the movie, Baul or his companion still does not get a strong proof of their fact that they lied about each other's knowledge, and on the contrary, Justin left the sight. There was the talent of the movie because philosophical boys tried to prove by killing, innocent innocent acting as genuine freedom continued to work against Justin, who, after all, maintained conscience (and finally left part of his conscience on the body dump site). Without that important part of the evidence, they are almost killed by a "number." And as much title as I have, I have read to the readers in the readers and saw that "number" (such as painting) has been done, giving careful and critical planning and correct ideas. There is a song by the name "Murder By Numbers", but it is beside the point. Many readers had questioned the relationship between Casey and his partner, but I think it was astonishing and impressive to see how it was due to its history. Whether or not it's history, his history plays an important role in this movie because without it, he probably did not follow his intentions about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was 'miserable women, women are playing vendetta at every corner of their life', but I think there is another movie about teenage murderers without the depth of Casey's character, and they've just been gotten away with it. There are no movies in there. <br /> <br /> And commented to the reader that, Thirteen years ago, the police said they did not have the perfect offense, can I remind you because I had reasons to deliberately set up, and complete traceable shoe prints. The boys wanted to get involved-it was a game. They were so confident that they had done the perfect crime, which they initially wanted to see the problem of revealing to the investigators. Did they not expect that Casey Meyder was a relative case of loyalty to work beside him. A little incredible? may be. But police officials have solved many crimes following their sympathy. Anyway, it's a movie! <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie about three times in the theater, and each time it reveals a little more to me, and I like it more. As much as I have seen, I was more attracted and frightened by Richard Herd, the more psychological depth - there really are such people. My main complaint about the film was that they could make Justin and Richard's interactions a bit more centralized (because, let's face it, the whole film's spirit is there) and characterizing my original props-each character is very different and its interesting way is interesting. It was a very good act, though I had given more depth to work with Ben Chaplin's character (he's a good actor) and probably lost the character of Bullock to a smidgen. I think everyone should keep in mind that starting with "hitoonit" initially for hitkoke type thriller, this is a big challenge for authors to maintain viewers' attention till the very end. I think they are slowly publishing some small plot twists, the dynamics of different characters, and working well by young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt by playing some really emotional role in the screen. I think if we delete our innate enmity and try to see how characters and their interactions are psychologically complex, we will be able to see a visible plot outside of the hole and see the original texture and quality of this film, if only characters are brilliantly illustrated. Especially Richard Hayward. I have not biassed that :)
