Phata Morgan, one of the weird and most confusing art films I've ever seen, has ever seen. I am hesitant to call it a documentary because even though its images have documented elements, the pictures are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, I am surprised that this story was really valuable so that it exists. The film is basically the story of the world and the creations of the world have been shot from outside, whether it is tribal or otherwise indefinable, everything is happening in the Sahara Desert. The title of the image is about the delusion or reflection of both real and hallucinated images, which are often seen in the desert people. These are also known as miras. <br /> <br /> This plane landed again and again and again and again and again and again after opening with flat landing. With each flat landing shot, the actual architecture of both locations is landing it and the plane itself slowly begins to dissolve in each other and increase the less and less real and more reflective imagery. The film's image becomes more intense and more unusual when the film is going on. The film's description exceeds the camera as a horrific sexual image of the sand and the landscape of the universe. What shot and finds in Shot Desert and Herzog movies goes further. The world's most spectacular mirror is displayed in distances when Herzegov has filled the most pure and photographic collections outside of which you might be able to see. When Leonard Cohen's soundtrack is cut off, you can be sure that you are in the world of a madman who has fallen in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I can not say nothing about this movie, but I would say that it is a sobering experience and there really is nothing like it. I just love to watch that movie in their own class. This film is a good example of how Harjag loves to combine in a transformational form in exchange for producing narrative stories and documentary films. Unfortunately, it is a little more welcome, but as long as it ends, the images will probably burn in your mind. Of course, for those who are obsessed with nature and the encouragement of the universe, of course, must be seen.
