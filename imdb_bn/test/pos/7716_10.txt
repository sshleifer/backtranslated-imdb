Wow, that's what I've seen some mysterious stories since a while. <br /> <br /> A detective story uses old fashionable black and white pictures that illustrate a senior investigator, which is the old fashioned clothing trench coat and hat. The theme of this animation is a memorable memoir of Sam Speed, which is mentioned briefly in Asher <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seemed that it was a suitable opportunity for four characters and he could not be frustrated and the rest was history. <br /> <br /> The end is a little short but still it is for those who like old fashion stories.
