There is more complexity for plotting this extraordinary thought-provoking film than just the responsibility of accidents and accidents. I was amazed at the initial goodness of husband Wilkinson, who wanted a driver, when he thought it was Everett, to publish the police, and change the heart (and morality) when he learned that it was his wife. As well, he was really good, and / or he was trying to release self with permission to go with Rupert. Then, things switchedand and SHE decided to ting right that he admitted to hurt him. Most importantly the theme of the release (for the accident - for unfaithful - on his own weird, faulty path) Watson's ill-health is the strongest in favor of Everett. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Love it.
