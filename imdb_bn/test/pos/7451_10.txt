Now after seeing children advertently twice, the story is not shallow, because in most of my opinion it has criticized. If you do not like FFVII or not for any reason, this movie is probably not for you. Getting familiar with the real story is the prerequisite to fully understand the AC understanding, otherwise you will only see the greatest CGI animation in your life. <br /> <br /> In fact, without losing the story, we must admit that seeing the AC we have been putting pieces together with my friends based on our knowledge of FFVII. The story was given more attention to see it for the second time and most of our questions were answered. There was nothing. AC is definitely not for FFVII players / fans and really try to be something else. FFII is no reality outside the world that fulfills the purpose. The music is mostly rebuilt with FFVII themes with a heavy touch (TBM team based on last credit) and works well with eye candy without exception. I found the music got the experience of adding visible fireworks in all the situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can not keep FFVII in 1.5 hours and remember that the story actually gave me more offers. There are two problems with FFVII: AC and both stories are wrapped very smoothly in action sequences. And believe me when I say a lot. <br /> <br /> I changed my vote for the second time from 9 to 10 because I missed a few explanatory sequences, I could not answer a bit for the first time. As a warning, it will be easy to ignore the story and pay attention to the graphics, but do not try to judge the children of the advert because of this. <br /> <br /> If I do not appreciate graphics, I'm not going to appreciate graphics because I guess they all know that they are awesome, which can be frustrating. Especially the letters talk much more with their face expressions than before. I hope you pay attention to the story because it actually makes sense and works well overall. Get ready for the ride of your life, there is no break.
