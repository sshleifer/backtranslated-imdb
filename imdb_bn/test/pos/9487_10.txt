These two disc sets are incredible! If you're like me and do not get the chance to actually see the band, then this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page, who, in my opinion, is the second best guitarist (second only to Slovakians) to face the world, he keeps an amazing look at every part of the footage of this film. John Paul Jones, although not as front as the page, puts a show on one hell. Although in live airplanes, its Wright lines are not defined as Stageo Recording, but in addition to the Edge and Conteghed, or Watts Kiss and Kit Kyun and Kyun Goud), but its wide array of wide genres is well-known in this DVD. John Bonham, John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, its beats stand out like no other, and this is proof of DVD. At least, but at least, Robert Plant wails like someone else wails. If you ever read God's hammer, you would be surprised that for the first time, Robert Plant met, why was this man not already famous? And so end my review, sorry and spelling or grammar mistakes, Zeppelin rock.
