The film 'Nightbrand' is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not very fond of horror movies, but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and I'm different from any horror movie. I have seen many horror movies, though they are based on horror, I know that the story is outstanding, as it is imagined, so I can not take them all seriously. On the other hand, Nightbide, a unique horror general, because it is a feeling of reality that I have seen on some other horror movies. <br /> <br /> The story of these movies is a kind of story type as a very unique and original storyline from a dreamer's dream of a person who lives up with the non-resident in an underground cemetery sanctuary with unexpected monsters who kill a man. I have seen most of the horror movies are quite fake, but because of the incredibly super-modern and great acting, especially Craig Schaffer (Aaron Boone), with amazing special effects, great lighting and excellent conversation, I've found this movie, with no stupid counterfeit horror parody. And a sense of maturity, however, that many other frustrations There are films. Nightbreed, being awesome as well as being one of the thrillers, romance and one of the action elements rapped. If you have not seen this movie, then I recommend you watch it, because I rated it as a 10/10.
