This movie is poetic about an influential, immigrant experience, reflected in unsettling appearance and fear that can be associated with emigration. These aspects are often not considered for immigration to the United States and especially to a country, and the film clearly and firmly mentions nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, the poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants are expecting their migration. <br /> <br /> They have some fantastic, unrealistic ideas about America that are circulated by travel. One is run by the milk of the river, an image depicting poetic, influential influences in the film. The film is not silly and the locals take life in America, or if it is not ignorant, that the view reflects the turmoil of ignorance, the view is described in detail with ambiguity and imagination. I said, the film depicts reality with Jolting, the boat goes to the United States, and Alice is going through the arrival of the island. The boat journey is rather imagined as the dull which surely it was a lot of time. The quadrupled quadruple quadranges are very crowded in the space of four or five inches from each other and there is a lot of lack of it, which certainly was below the deck. <br /> <br /> Again, the film is not supplemented with inappropriate music or excessive bright light, and the effect of creating a fairly realistic imagination of what it really was for the people living in America. Villagers can not be worldly, but they are quite reasonable, and the immigration officials, urgently, with immigrant officials, Fortunata (Aurora Quartrocchi), the reasons for contact with most of the reasons for the special results are they are not soft or soft, and the benefits of Syriac's conclusion Seeing the reality of the reality of the Sicilia, the widow of the United States indicates the life of the United States In connection with the crime. <br /> <br /> Immigrants and their story are very funny and cool-eyed and the witchcraft imagination of the imagination of the people, for the introduction of beliefs held by the Sicilian, or any person, leaving a little formal education in the United States. The acting is similarly barebones; It's not all exhibition or decorative, but it seems more realistic for it. The main actors, especially Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), the clear leader of the group are excellent. Never laughing at his laughter, his actions do not speak very loudly, and it is clear (the other members of the team members, his two sons, and the above mentioned great Pharaohs, the grandmother of the boys, who believe in his leadership power, and respect his precision, his role is great. Discipline and simplicity, and its character is a rule for its power, which is so capable of its character She feels confident when her character believes very little emotions. <br /> <br /> One of the oddities of this film is with the story of a mysterious English woman (excellent and apt mysterious Charlotte, Gainsby) in Italy and throughout her film, why we I'm amazed at what America is going to do, or otherwise he has a relation with the Sicilian immigrant group. Is revealed and the revelation is usually realistic and does not seem particularly melodramatic or seemingly. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emanuel Krials, who see the real superstitious world its characters and presented them with firmness and confidence. In fact, truthfulness and prejudice can truly meet how strange it may be. It is a worthy test of immigrant experience.
