Era; And (2) When I was at the age of ten, I saw this movie during the Christmas shopping trip and then returned memorable memories of my favorite TV shows when I was young ("Supercar, Fireball X5" and "Stinger"), so for personal reasons I came to this movie when I favor a favor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Barry Gray, oh, that superb score!)
