The origins of the 80's animal show concern over a long abandoned gold mine, which is determined to test some cruel mines. Naturally, they can not find any gold there, but in search of prey, the hungry monster is absolutely hungry. <br /> <br /> Although I must be honest and have to admit I was at first neutral (I personally like the same) "Bugnes"), it actually went along as it actually increased on me. Now, the characters are not very interesting actors are either. The closest Morgan, Keith Hart, is an attractive character. In any case, Terry Barlland of Lady Leadership is very good, and Rolf Theson creates a simple person to hate his authority quarrels. The influential person who played by Mark Sawiki wear thin thin. <br /> <br /> It starts at a comfortablely anticipated stage, claiming to close things on acceptable sets of two victims with a piece set at night. The giant itself is an incentive for its design (as you can imagine, it releases a bit at a time until the game is delayed) and as a stop motion animation product when this process is no longer used. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (run by David Michael Hillman's nickname) and crew deserve some credit for creating their atmosphere. They manage the film with a lot of clustrophobic and depressing looks and use light to do their best. The film does not create a fantastic good end intensity. Not saying, they could make the right maker in their low budget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
