If I used to watch this movie when I throw rock, I was probably going to die in the deepest depression of my life and it would have been very unhappy to try it, only in the real world, when you looted millions of dollars from unintended people, everything does not fall on the rose (Unless you are an investment banker or government), then how is that? I have been rejected from school after school, and it is stings, so it's a brilliant subject for a movie, and when you make yourself fantastically that you can see this film without using real world idiosyncrasions, it can really touch someone, the situation , And let them know they are not alone. Overdone soliloquy full academic system tears completely as we know it. Really, I can say that I am now in college, looking back at where I was, seeing this movie, I really can be grateful in such a way that I will never be able to do otherwise. It's contrite to the baby and yes yes, but it's a mental and objectionable imagination about freedom, and I can not think of a better way to end my night.
