The last film of the underworld director Alberto de Martino ("The Antichrist", "The Killer of the Phone") is a genuinely suspicious but unbeatable gazelle, which is a trademark that makes this Italian horror sub-genre so nice and addictive to fans. Some very annoying themes (child torture, Phoenix priests ??), scary moments loaded, plots twists left & right, extraordinary music and ?? Last but not least ?? Really analogous murder scenes are a boxing! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of temptation, a powerful piece of awesome! What is so strange about them about the normal child dolls? When an anonymous man dressed like a priest, he attacked a little girl and the broken head of his doll was flying on the stairs, it really sent cold springs through my spine! A few years later, an adult woman engaged in a tempting young girl wheelchair. He inherited a lot of money, but used his fortune to practice fellow sportsmen and maintain a positive attitude. She ?? Joanna ?? Fall in love with his personal coach and they get married immediately. Naturally, he only revitalized the horror of his childhood after his money and triggered the tyranny of the young man. Due to the terrible finder priest repeats images, yari tunes and nursery rhythms, with "real-life" tactics, and "the guide for killing" with "Alberto de Martino's instructions". The role of a proud greedy villain in acting is quite skillful with David Warbeck ("Bound", "Black Cats"). Due to the lack of some plot holes and originality, this film may not be able to compete with Italy's most awesome effort, but it certainly deserves more attention. Many previously vague and unknown Italian gaelis received wonderful DVD releases and, hopefully, "formula for a dead" will soon be treated similarly. Already, good luck tracking this baby down!
