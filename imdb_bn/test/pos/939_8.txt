Brilliant Australian movie ... is a little slow at the beginning, but once you leave it you can not laugh. When I originally saw the movie, I knew the line of plot very little, because I am not sure that this film is based on the real story, and especially the director and his mother (probably the name changed)). I knew this event as the director was just friends as the friend of my family. When I saw the movie, my stomach kept secret that after screening we want to show Matthew Newton ... such a nice gentleman (except his former, especially the nasty incident)! Brillian Casting as well as Sam Blue and others! Australian film industry is a great reason to support
