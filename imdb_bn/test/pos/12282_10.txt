A girl who tries to take her daughter back, loves it .... I was there, so I can relate ... In any way, I love camera work, how sometimes the camera goes "left" and they are only Talking about that scene, or other stuff ... or how the camera can find him around him and not ... I saw a few IFC last year and I like it, so some of my friends have seen it, and some of them have seen it, and they liked it too ... If you can, check it out, great Zerla, but it's still a good movie. I have given 10/10 for two reasons ... One: I can relate ... but anyone who has ever fallen in love and has made mistakes. ... Two: This is a really creative way of making movies, like this you are always there, right in the middle of philminyera ... I like this movie
