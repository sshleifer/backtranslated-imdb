This is a great movie. Hannah is a very old guy with a very young heart. He knows how to save his life completely by staying involved with his own death and even his own death competition. Although his wife can not deal with her "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows why she loves her husband for nearly half a century. I want to quarrel with this old man because he knows how to enjoy life and do not fear death. She is not happy, malicious, naughty, and annoying. Vlastimil Broadsky brilliantly played Hanna at the age of 79. Each aspect from his eyes and his older aged muscles provide a lot about the character of the audience. This is a movie which then leaves a big smile on my face, and it shows me a little closer to my own life. Tomorrow I will go and buy myself a palace and make some fun. If I can kill, so can I. But I think I'll be part of smoking.
