A weekend weekend for a group of Human Traffic friends, this is a fly-on-the-wall view of their life (and mind) that will show you how friends of this group are related to each other. There are many moments that can be related to each other, such as being empty on your part and telling the strangers to be completely rubbish. Characters are credible for all the people you can relate to and that role they play in the movie. We have all found ourselves in all the situations in which they are located, and wherever this movie is successful. Sex and drugs are not found in any way on the basis of character relationships with each other. The story of the film is not all but it is not a criticism. This is a movie about people. This is a good film, for which death for a dead track. D. Jay's Peat Tong has kept a great selection of tracks together for this file, in 1999, I found that one of the best movies was made of it. After watching this movie, I felt that I would share all the holidays. Pretty movie! Joe brand as the true voice - I need to say more! <br /> <br />
