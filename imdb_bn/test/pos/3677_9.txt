As I comment on this picture, I quote from the author Paolo Coleho about the words below. <br /> <br /> "When you really want something, all the universe helps you to achieve it." <br /> <br> We really are those who forget about what we want to do in life and are very easy. There are always many comments and suggestions around us for security. I have forgotten what I feel passion about. Despite adventure, I will take me out of the world of safety, I truly believe that fear is the only value that I have to pay for the new journey of the forthcoming brand of life. <br /> <br /> Thank you for inspiring me this beautiful story. Unconditional love realizes that it is a blessing for me. That's the most treasurable love from the light of souls.
