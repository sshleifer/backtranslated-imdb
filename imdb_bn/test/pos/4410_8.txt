I'm happy to see this movie on a DVD available in DVD. Despite having a 'TV movie' and firing in 16 mm, it provided a great insight into the different kinds of people who wanted to become 'London cabies', as well as their fable and family commitments. Even the 'Titanic' candidates with their disrespectful wife are most helpless, even if Jack Roznellal was able to create a fun and sometimes tragic snippet in London's 90-minute entertaining way. <br /> <br /> primarily as a vehicle for Ford's Premier Mick (the stage), Michael elaphika, Nigel hatharana, Jonathan Lynn, Leslie and Joseph mariyena lipamyana (Mrs. rosanathala) the quality of performance in the industry, including an astronomical amount mikera had top billing , But he had to work hard in the face of competitive competition. <br /> <br /> It's as fresh as 15 years after the 1991 Liberation War!
