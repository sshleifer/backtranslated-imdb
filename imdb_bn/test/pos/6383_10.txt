Pushing this movie !!!! Weeks ago a coupla saw it at a screener. Kinda is a wonderful story, where James Franco plays this militant, who is married to Siena Miller to get out of the country and they go to Niagara Fruit for their honeymoon. Do not want to leave it until the movie is released, but it is quite calm and do not expect what you want to happen. I thought I'd hate it, it's a romance, but it's too great to bend and which I like a lot. Acting is really good and Sienna Miller is completely smokin 'and playing this really sweet girl. I think I should play more like this. James is playing a quarrel but you end up loving him and ending the movie is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave this movie 10 because I really came out of the movie and want to see it again, which I do not expect and my girlfriend really liked it and wept. Good date flush
