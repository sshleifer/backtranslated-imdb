Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie filmmaker Neil La Bautie (Man of the Man, Your Friends and Neighbors), achieved major success in the big budget ($ 24 million in BT 24 million dollars, $ 24 million), mainstream reign - and Yet its roots are true. Her cast is now composed of unlisted Hollywood names (Ronnie Gelgeger, Morgan Freeman, and stand up comedian Chris Rock), her element is intriguing and playful like her first two traits, proves that she may be the next big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the most dark comedies, which has been announcing to mainstream viewers over the years and considering its middle box office and critical success, probably the movie movies were not like mobile phones and we were not intelligent. The story (in both metaphorically and literally) is a lovely waitress, who fell in love with a handsome soap star (with a good Gates Greg Kierner), but a flexible car dealer (stuck in a loveless marriage with Harun) Eckhart, who is the company's Make big screen debuts). When her husband is murdered two Hitman (Freeman and Rock) deadly, she sends the show and oddly comes out to Hollywood to meet her love object - she is unaware that she is only an actor When Freeman and Rock discovered that the car they took, there were 10 kilograms of cocaine, they also hit the road and caused unrest. The supporters of LaBute's earlier work may find it difficult to find that it might be the same person who is directed at The Man of the Men - a deaf fellow - who is a sad coworker, is sad about the rogue sexist pig to run a real joke Events But when you think about it, the connection is clear: In the company, a weak woman is unaware that she receives merciless benefits. At the bay, a weak housewife is not aware that the person he is pursuing seems to have nothing but a true joke on his true loyalty. Some might start to think that if the lube is truly wrong, then its repetitive theme is associated with the fall of innocent women. But personally, I think he is coming in clear sex defense and behaving more harshly with his offender than in torture. One of the most characteristic of this movie is that its absurdity is completely full: most of the directors leave the story of two women chasing a woman's dream while running such a script. But La Boot knows well, and one of Hitman's (Freeman) Bati is also terrified. This was an interesting introduction to Freeman, because it lets him play out of his trademark 'as-the-the-tight-time' character (see Arfergen, 7, and 1998's Hardcore Hard); Supporting cast includes the famous wizard Crispin Glover (Future to Back), Alison Janny, and 'Mad of Eure Kathleen Willohite'. First Timer John C The script written by Richards and James Flamberg is suddenly rising up (really: have you ever seen a comedy - or for any movie - in which a person is scalping his own dining room?). You can argue that the finishing is very perfect, but it is not true to deny everything great about the film for a small complaint. If the nurse betty is a sign for any shop shop next to us, then you can make a decision to follow it and I can hide for it. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
