For those who created the first movie timer, I think they did a great job !! We have to support the emerging industry especially coming from the north. It was very popular when I was in the movie, a good house and lots of very good responses and laughs. This is an emotional movie and thus when I came out of the movie I felt it! It is humorous and positive to answer about the community represented. The film is open now, I hope it will be good - people should support this little film. I think this 'winnie ...' man is very bitter, with some! And being very personal ??? Shame! I said to all who are well-connected ?? I have a drink !! I look forward to your next venture.
