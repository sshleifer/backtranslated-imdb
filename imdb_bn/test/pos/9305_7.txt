You know something about the Manhattan Project, but you'll find "Fat Man and Little Boy", at least an interesting illustration of the events surrounding that story. The film is a very realistic illustration of these phenomena, and in many ways it is almost very real (such as radiation poisonous scenes scene). Paul Newman, as usual, made his role brighter and the screen managed to come off like a real person. Supporting cast like John Kasak, Laura Darn, Bonnie Bedellia and Natasha Richardson is fairly good. However, this film is not a good example of starting a true story in a movie. Great movies are able to take real stories and use enough artistic licenses to keep viewers in competition for the whole film. But this one stops a whole, and some scenes (such as John Cusack and Natasha Richard's love story) may be completely removed without losing the film completely. Yet, there is enough interesting information and a little ridiculous bit that at least the audience has enough interest to watch the whole movie. It is not always entertaining, as far as great illustrations go, it is very accurate, attractive, and lets viewers think for something. <br /> <br /> *** *** ***
