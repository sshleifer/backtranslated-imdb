When I first saw this movie, it was about 1956 and I saw it again though I did not change my mind about it. I think Robert Ryan is the best film, because he portrays someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life (my dad), though he never killed anyone, he was more influenced by him during World War II, which made him worse. Just to get through and get through the day was just ridiculous to him. (My mother and brother had to do this) When I saw Robert Ryan like this man, it was a very good example of this kind of person and I was fascinated.
