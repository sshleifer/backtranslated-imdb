Traveling during the past is bent well as a subject. In this episode a person who is thinking about this possibility, he himself discovered the date and location of the death of Abraham Lincoln. He tries to do everything he can think in a short period available for him with predictable results. Of course, he is considered quite crazy. He was arrested and finally he is trying to stop the man who was trying to stop him. The serling was so bright that he is now back to return, but the current is the same? This is the starting type of "Time Tunnel", where the travelers of the weekly traveler got the same work, which had already happened. Unfortunately, the effects of time distortion and future distortion always deny the outcome. Unless you have anything like Ray Bradbury's "Thunder of the Sound"
