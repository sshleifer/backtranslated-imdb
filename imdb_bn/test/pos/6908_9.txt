In the North American premiere of Toronto's Dark Film Festival, I went to see Glenn McQueed's "I Cell the Dead". This is seen as a second show around the world, I did not know what I can expect of this movie, especially the small film that inspires this big screen adaptation. <br /> <br /> I'll start <br /> <br /> About this film Arthur Blake, how he invented both a serious robber and a fascinating and supernatural invention that he and his mentor. <br /> <br /> The design and design of this film was excellent. I was surprised to hear that the whole film was shot in New York and around it. The dress was very accurate for the time, in fact you brought you as a spectator of that time criteria. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> they played smoothly played off each others. The dialogue between the two was very well written, Glenn added her humorous touch even in exciting situations. <br /> <br /> The story is very broad and the ball rolling from the very beginning. I'd like to compare it to a visual page turner, be surprised at what's going on. The photos themselves add very javascript and different level of stitches. <br /> <br /> For everyone, I recommend to anyone in the mood for the dark smile, a little worse mixing. <br /> <br /> 9/10
