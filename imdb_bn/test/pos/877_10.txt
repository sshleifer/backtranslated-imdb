This movie is very well marketed. When it was released in '97, between the master P's reputation and success, with some of his name and everything sold his roof. It is astonishing that this underground city drama has sold 250,000 copies and is still running. <br /> <br /> Check it even if you're a fan of limitation. This is some old school fatty video and do not start with the weird deakiy strippers at Bonus Ice Cream Party. So I do not see the people who do not like Master P or Limit Records, because they do not see what is said to them because it is not for you and do not bother about voting because you are just going to stop the TRU, rent this video with your low vote Or buy a limit from fans.
