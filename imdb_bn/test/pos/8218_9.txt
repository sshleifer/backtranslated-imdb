If you really read this review, I would give you many credentials. You are really careful to look for this movie, which most people have forgotten and then be careful to get out of the first review! So for your reading pleasure <br /> <br /> I thought you already know the plot line so I will not waste time typing out. I will mention that Sandra Bullock did a great job with this movie. She really played the role of a computer programmer, often bringing many sympathy with the difficult role to make. I can say this because I'm a computer programmer. <br /> <br /> However, I thought the basic plot was very good. You can easily create sub-plots in its mainframe and make it a very enjoyable movie. Primase is also realistically realistic that it can all really happen if it is not properly undone. <br /> <br /> To summarize a long review ... oops! Very late If you want Sandra Bullock to play the role of life and look for a very good movie for the time, look at this little gem. You will not be disappointed. :-)
