Yes, I see this show. Because my girlfriend does it. Well, at least, I'm telling my friends. But since no one here knows me, I can say it; I love it That's nice trash tv. <br /> <br /> is in the panel first; Tyara does not miss the single opportunity to talk about himself, yet he will take seriously with most businessmen. Then J. Manuel, a confident gay guy, very serious and amazing professional and Miss J, an isolated, a "queen" of Katwalk and a great fun person, and Nigel, self-made as the only person in the panel. <br /> <br /> Second, the show shows the depth of a shallow art and we have to give it to the producers to show the internal view, which can be informative and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally, the version is superb; Everything is just a mixture; The girls live together in arrogance, set their impressions, compete themselves and judge. Slide smooth with all of these just beat right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Panel is formed quickly on nasty divas, extroverted and bitching; Those who object to their regret! But it is said, until a competitor does not depend on their toes, their judgment is generally fair - I think. <br /> <br /> So, pause your brain; If you can not beat them, join them, and have a good time watching these bits of reality bits with your loved ones. It will climb, seek for something more.
