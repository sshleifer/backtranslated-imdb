It is a movie which should be viewed and treated as a part of the industry. This is a genuine artistic element which is an unknown labor of love for Schrader brothers about Yuki Mishima's life. The film is black from white, from the past to the present, Mishima works fantastic to him. Without being all the bits being confused at least bit. My only thing that is the whole movie, without narrator and partial explanation in Japanese without exception. A best composition that still deserves an audience but has not been found. The criteria, if you are reading it, it is a movie which should be released with your extra extra as possible under the impression. This film deserves more in truley 10/10
