An intelligent soldier kills a man to be a Jew and tries to pin it to a fellow soldier. It was not as good as the novel ("The Fic Foxhole") where it was a homosexual, which died ... but in 1947, Hollywood would not touch it. It's saying, it's still a very good movie. Anti-Semitism is managed very well, but the bad news is that in the audience it is bad ... good duh! But this was in 1947. The film has performed well in full cast (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the voice is very dark ... it should be. Very atmospheric too Her days deserve a big hit ... to see the good value.
