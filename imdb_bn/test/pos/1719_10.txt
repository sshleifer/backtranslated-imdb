Some of my older videos and more. I've played over over. I reared each of the "doctors" for a variety of reasons. But due to a man in the BBC program, Who was rejected, although it was still one of the basics of the BBC line-up. As Sylvester McKayey was out, the doctors were alive through the fans. The BBC will sincerely allow fans to write books, and cartoons. Even after 1989, he said. Continued its pace. Then they got a chance with Paul McGan. The film was flawed, but it gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, "man" went away, and new to the BBC felt that it was time to bring the doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in the US, the Saifai channel took an opportunity and it was a complete success, though the authors drew new viewers. And began to explain and explain the legend. It is incredible to me that they did it. Russell as a season writer As Davis and producer Phil Collinson, Season 1 starring ChrisWeather Eccleston, Doctor returned to us and in each episode we can learn more about the doctor. The doctor who has always been about "Choice", "Love" and "Sacrifice". This is what they are giving. It makes me even more and it makes me sad that Mr. Exststown Show left. My first doctor was a doctor. 3, Dr. John Petei's doctor. Dr. Who knows about his position in the universe It's as hard as the rest. He is the 9th Doctor. I am Who before his performance was Mr. Eccleston does not know, but now I am I hope, there were some ways, he can know, Dr. He was shocked to find his other work in the Hu fan community and to enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
