This film is about a bunch of muffins who think that they are scheduled for a job that can be unfortunately fail. Misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission. <br /> <br /> Hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> Like the "Police Academy" film, humor comes from cookie characters on the boat. I thought it was a compelling film and I would stop watching it anytime on TV. No, it will not inspire you to think about your relative role in the Grand Alliance or to do something great for mankind's service, but 90-minutes enough fun entertainment for a few minutes. Plus, Loren Holly looks hot in a navy.
