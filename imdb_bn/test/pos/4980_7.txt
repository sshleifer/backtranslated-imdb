His outstanding best Stanwick, Robinson is the same - as the ruthless land baron on this fairly common west. <br /> <br /> Strong use of some good action scenes, location, colors and cinemascope. But why is the obvious use of stock footage in stamp footage? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not just Stanwick and Robinson - as a lover of Brian Keith Stanwick Wonderfully frustrated Villen creates and Richard Jakele is cold as heartbreaking killer. See it for camp quality.
