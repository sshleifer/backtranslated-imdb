Fantastic heroes are the best film of the year. It was a complete and fun pleasure to see. I was riveted. The entire audience was uploaded to the Sunset file, when the movie did not end, nobody left, did not talk. I think this picture is a perfect example of the power of the drama. Especially in this way, this example sets an example of the quality of drama / work of the younger generation. <br /> <br /> There were so many, at least seven of your pictures in the picture, where I got so much beauty, the emotional beauty, I could not breathe a bit. And for a catharsis junkie like me, that's the best sensor I could ask about. It's powerful, masterful stories and direction results. Like heavyweight stuff, like Burtolucci and those guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the film is fitted together. There were no missteps at all. Cast was excellent. I've been a huge fan of Emil and Ryan for a long time, and I thought they were no better. I'm constantly amazed at this film. And I promise that I want to see this to every person. It should be seen. It will win the awards.
