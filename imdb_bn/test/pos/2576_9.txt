I was surprised to see how big black snake muen became. Being a fan of Christina Richie and Samuel L. Jackson ID id ID tried it out. After this finale, how wonderful I was really about this picture, I mean, everything is dead-big and very accurate. This film shows how great director and writer Craig Brayer (who made another great movie in Hostel and Flow) can take something like Ludacres and even take some, this is what I like, it's a good time, it's like a movie, which in a good way Create I also like it that it does not show large stereoeps in the south and how it is portrayed in pictures as the most annoying place, but this film does not make it very right and it is re-considered. Only Kristina Richie (who deserves an Oscar for this role), is always the great Samuel El. Jackson, even Justin Timberlake did a good job. Above all, this is great about everything, and if it does not have all its movies, it is certainly worth seeing from a person who enjoys a good time. Three cheaters for Black Snake Moyan !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10
