Mars is a wonderful journey taken by horses very small animals. It does not have to work hard to keep your attention and keep the characters really memorable. Most credits must definitely go to Eris Anderson to choose his own visual style and to write interesting stories, but also deserve the credit for Anju Majumdar for his achievements and amazing musical scores. This choice was probably not an accident. If you can, see the 35mm chance for most effect on it. This is a beautiful picture!
