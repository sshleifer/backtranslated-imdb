I looked at the nice streets of New Jersey in Nick Gomez, where cars-jacking always was high, both thought-provoking and entertaining. It's just as good as movies like Boys N Hood or Men's II Society or Above the Rim. I was perfect for the actor and the scenario, whether it was a lively realistic feeling and was by objective or raw coincidence, was very atmospheric. I liked this movie a lot, got an intimate gem on TV and happy I grabbed it. Visit this movie to see if you get a shot. If they do not have a DVD, they should be free. Well done Nick Gomez. IMDb rating: 5.9. My rating: 9/10
