This is a boring movie, and it continues continuously. Yet it is absolutely unique among the war films, it only focuses on civilian experiences, and loses the humanity's human life during the war. Two young people, married musicians, act in a process of slowing down on both side of a civil war. Clearly, the film is about to break sensitivity, this film offers a great perspective on the modern world, and I believe that many Europeans are especially recognized. Levi urman (never better) and Max Fon Sedo (similarly) by the bold, vivid performance. For my money, Bergman ever made the most painful film.
