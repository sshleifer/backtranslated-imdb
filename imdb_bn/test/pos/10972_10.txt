Mannah from Heaven is a horror movie which is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. You know that the so-called "gift from God" was actually a loan, it will refund the money and finally everyone will be satisfied, but it is not clear how they will reach there. Scenes are often fun and occasionally touching as characters evaluate their lives and where they are going. Throwing veteran actors is more than just a nostalgia trip. Frank Gersin, Sheryl Jones, and Claris Lichman prove that they are more worthy than Ridler, Mother Partridge, or Mary's friend Phyllis, Jill Eckenby and Wendy Malik play different characters apart from watching them in their TV series. Both the touch and the funny at the same time with the scenes of nanar berton noon, nan or church fun. If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, but some good music (with the title Jones Convert "How Do You Look Tonight") and a lift, try this one. I do not think you would be disappointed.
