After being transferred to his new cottage in English, Circle Perrit invited Sir Henry and Lady Angkatel to invite dinner for dinner. But the next day, a guest gets a shot at the pool, and his ugly wife holds a revolver a few seconds away. <br /> <br /> The mystery of this Agatha Chris is somewhat slim, although the killer's plan is still very clever. It is an excellent film and painter, which enhances the story to a higher level. This episode mostly keeps the acute voice of "Five Little Pigs" and "Saad Cyprus", but there is more dark humor than them. At this point there are probably two famous artists, Edward Fox (as Batler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Englewood), although the standout performance is gradually progressed by the super-beautiful Megan Dods. His time: Henrietta: The conflict with Suchet Sparkle and the highlight of this movie. Oh, and since an English police inspector has been involved in this case, I think they could bring Philip Jackson back for this. (***)
