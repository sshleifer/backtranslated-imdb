Let's be fair: there is no rule for writing scripts, so I will not say that there should be something other than the movie. I'll just express my opinion. OK, I really like the script, the way things are said and the characters are turned on. However, I think when a game is adapted to silver screen, it might try and fit these other media. Since the film was directed by Joey Falco, the same person who was director of this play, it is not surprising that the film has become very dramatic. This is the first movie of humanity, for Christine 'loudly! What I'm saying is that there are some parts of the film - like the city of Nordestina, which is a bit similar to the set of "Jos√© de De Maria" - I do not think we are in the movie theater. We are in the theater! The line is very officially called, the characters are choreographically moving, and illumination is definitely meant for a stage. Sure, that was probably the intention, but that has been done. On the stage For example, the wonderful "Closer" movie has created amazing things while adapting a game. When I went to see this one, I do not think I was watching a movie. But overall, it was a good one, observer value. This is a wonderful love story, funny and sad at other times. My vote is a 7
