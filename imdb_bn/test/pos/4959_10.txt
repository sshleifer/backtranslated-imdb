Okay, here's the deal. This American pilot who is doing business with himself, is thinking of his business, when suddenly he grew up with bad, humorous American-American fighters (they are Middle Eastern types, but not enough to like Apple Pie or Elvis Presley). Who proceeded to shoot him. Now this American pilot was not doing anything wrong, but those non-Muslim non-Muslims did not take care of them and before they knew they were executed in a foreign jail for the death penalty! <br /> <br /> Now, here happened that until a US military pilot was released, a couple of nearby towns would be abused, but this is not the time. Those who are probably involved in the kind of 'evil peace lovin' and managed to stop the genocidal genocide. You can imagine, this pilot does not please families and evil foreign dictator smug this, has a satisfactory look about him. He'll pay Americans, oh yes! <br /> <br /> He did not take account of the 16-year-old detainee pilot Doug Masters. You see that Doug has been able to fly an airplane than a car (which can not be long), and decided to fly that evil foreign country, and his father decided to come back. So with the help of his friends, Doug and his Wingman, retired pilot ?? Chapy Sinclair, Doug carried out two air strikes against foreigners. <br /> <br /> Now you think that this plan will fail, but you will be wrong. Of course, the types of Middle East could be all senior pilots, but Doug had his braces, he heard rock music while flying! After a dozen or more fighter jets and the oil refinery ran out, Doug landed at the airport and now flattened his injured father. Understand, evil, and not so smug, the dictator gets quite annoying over these antics and takes himself to the sky to shoot down Doug. But the little boy listens to some rock music and beat Wilen from the sky. Doug and Chappie shot 90% in the air, foreigners made poor efforts instead of shooting their last few guns on Doug, but at the right time, the US F16s launched the flight and scared them away. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film enough. This was my first video cassette film, and at the age of 20 I hope that my father will be shot in a foreign country so that I can rescue him. But he did not like flying, so did not happen.
