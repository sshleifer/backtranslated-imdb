I saw this at the German press screening. Not too far: Most critics really liked it too. Yet there was a worship, which is quite unusual for the species. From my perspective and till now, it was the most fun movie of the year. It retains the three W + G shorts charm and intelligence, and it is enhanced with many references to this and other movies. Of course, there is a clear expression to the giant- and the Weinwerf-movies, especially "an American Weowolf in London", "Gosses", "King Kong" and even "Branded" / "Dead Alive" of Peter Jackson, but other styles. <br /> <br /> Character in "Chicken Run" has been good, but the movie had a whole new "cast" where the role was needed. Here, you are already able to know two main characters. So, if you've already seen shorts (and favorites), the new "Wallace and Gromit" -movies are best enjoyed, but it also works itself. "Chicken Run" was more convenient, but more "story telling" plot. Instead, this new Armman masterpiece has a "disconnected" feeling of that crazy and W + G shorts. Children will enjoy it too, especially due to the sweet rabbit (if you love the beautiful sisters, it must be seen for you !!!) and the gromit has done a lot and really stole the show (children also love) dogs ... :-) ). But many jokes are considered for more adult audiences (it also has soft sexual expressions). The film manages, such as "Shake 1 + 2" and "Incredibles", adds a brilliant British and at least a dark edge to American animated films, to complement the high level of entertainment for the whole family. <Br /> <br /> is animation ?? Expected ?? Fantastic, and they hold true to Armman Style because they did not have much digital effects - they only realized some of Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works well, although one of the main themes is "borrowed" by the Spanish Adelman's "DrugHart" score. The worst thing is: maybe it will take more than six years until we see a new animated diamond from Park & ​​Co.
