There is a subject in such a character, which is what the film director of age tells of the death. This picture can summarize the summary: "It's dead in Italy who rule." Truth! This is a country without a future, in the hands of old and vicious men. And the mysterious portrait of the country's Balochichi, in a apparently stupid story, refers to a director who wants to draw pictures of marriage parties to get married, and does not work here to say a lot about it. But foreigners may forget about this, because it is not expressly expressed. I understand that Australian or Canadian people may get bored and surprised - this is a meaning, but it can be clear to the people here today and keep their eyes open ... such as Bellocchio. Certainly this is not one of his best movies, and it is not as powerful as Buine, but it is valuable for Italianians living in Italians.
