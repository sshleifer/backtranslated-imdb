I give roughly about 6/10 horror films, but this one caught my eyes. I have seen the best horror movie at Mymensingh House ... Amityville is better than Horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton was so good and I must say, there is a good future in the future. His death scene was probably cool. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brian van Hollt was very good as both killer, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). Usually he plays an average police or soldier, but he is very good in this. <br /> <br /> Elisa Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also acted as well as Curley and Nick Jones. Nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, then Elijah stole many fingers in the second half and stole it, such as turning the finger off, after ticking his lips with his lips gladding together, and bending straight straight to the trunk <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm giving this picture 8/10. Fans of horror films will see this.
