Well this is a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame's movies have not been so great yet. On the other hand, if you are a hardcore van dame fan, you should see the scenes as a huge improvement. Also what I really like is music music beautiful. You're sure you will kill time if action fan is there. As the director of Isaac Florentine 2, I do not think he did a great job with great work. I could not wait to hit the movie before the movies of Van Dame before the DVD. Maybe, one day :) <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not see any action movie, it is worth the watch, it can make your hours and half fun.
