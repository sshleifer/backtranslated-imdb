First, I'm a huge body, Holly fan. Who I knew who was big, and I knew about the journey of that lucky plane that made three incredibly bright shades in this way. But I never heard of his music. I've heard it a lot, yes, but I was not sitting on the desire to find something, I came to see the true Buddy Holly. And I tell you that his world is different for him now. <br /> <br /> Because of this happiness for this incredible man, I never bought it but bought Body Holly Story. I have exploded my opinion on this photo. Perhaps this is why body feels so vivid that I could not bear to see Gary Bushi in this role. I will admit I have played an excellent acting role, but its singing is so compelling. It seemed as if he knew that he did not sound like a badie himself and was using a lot of energy to try the same words. He succeeded in some parts of the film. But others .. ouch. <br /> <br /> The film has been spread for several years, but I think it may be better to portray this period better. I was having a difficult time happening in certain events happening at certain times of BD life. I had a serious problem with some historically incorrect flaws. I think the worst was that of the cricketers. I understand how their real names can not be used, and how to simplify them, they had only two in the movie .. And it was probably a good thing. Because the background of the film was worthy of cringe voice, and I did not like the way Buddy's career has been portrayed as an obstacle. There was something else that really did not make any difference in the film but my gary busey was toothache. They wore me out! Body Holly had many good teeth. I do not know why I noticed it. But I did. <br /> <br /> I'll finish this review which I think is the best part of the movie: Body's last performance. The final phone call to Maria, the big thing's performance, the frame ended after he and Richie Valenz was brought to the stage. It even makes me wonder, and I think how it looks at the audience in a moment that Body Holi was so vivid and energetic at one point, and her flick became blurred in the eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... but not bad.
