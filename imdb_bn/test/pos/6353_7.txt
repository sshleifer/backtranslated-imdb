Hummaam, ... set in another keystone comedy park !!! It seems that the number one spot for shopping was in this same local park, because many of Chaplin's and Arabakal's movies are set there! And, although it's another, it's quite different and well that I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Fatty acids are generally looking for normal looking and acting Maired Normand. I think she might be a little younger, though she is young to be interested in her mother's eyes. Well, Fatty did not share her feelings and soon she and Mabel ran away for some innocent fun. Things to get complicated when mom watches are stolen. Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift, ... and as a result of many problems. <br /> <br /> Harmony Pacing and this movie does not depend too much on the cheap slapstick but to make it a reasonable plot is a cute and enjoyable little film.
