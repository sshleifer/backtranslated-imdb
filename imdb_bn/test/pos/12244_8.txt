I saw this movie for the first time. The officials involved in the news industry detail details of how to get the story in this air: Especially Jane Craig shouted out loud to Kenny for editing the piece to snatch it, and then Juan Cusack struggled to get it, and William Hart, who According to Jane, the infidelity of moral infringement, his tears were trapped in the interview of the rape of his birth. Lane, Aaron, indicated an error. Another high point is when Jane uses Tom Jane's own benefit, and then roaming around with Jennifer. The script is bright, and the command is almost as well. These three main actors portrayed their characters, especially Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, who are the most fun of the movie. William Hart is very good. It has at least three Oscars, Best Actress (Holly Hunter), Best Supporting Actor (Albert Brooks), and best-suited for the best picture. I like the last section of the film where it is seen again after 7 years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
