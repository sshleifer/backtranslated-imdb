For the first time, Gilmouro girls could not get caught, but in the first season they were caught a bit. I read most of the user's comments and for the negative, I have to ask, which show you are watching? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, cool line, character and well-played. And best of all, your ideal formula does not sometimes appear in the story with a twist. Perhaps more women are reflected in the Lorlai / Emily relationship between Lorelai / Rory's relationship. People and stories are not PCs but they are real! <br /> <br /> If you find dialogue annoying, I suggest you tap the show so that you can recover parts that you do not understand.
