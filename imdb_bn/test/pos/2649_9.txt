Dear Reader, 2001: A Space ODC is his best cookie ... although I can not really say that the Space ODC is his only movie I've ever seen. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good. <br /> <br /> In the three novels, the novel ... which is written by the author, is impossible. However, we started with the opening of the speaker Zarathustra's Speaker with easy but spectacular opening. Then the 'Don of Man' comes boring outside the assumption. Then on the moon there is the 'strange sort of monolith finding', Strauss's Blue Danube played. Eventually the spaceship scenes and HAL disconnect people and kill people and things are good. The things that happen after death and our 'Monolith Entering' sequence is that much longer and ultra-strange finishes. However, 2001: A Space ODC is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator, or The Abyss, but it's a stone. My congratulations to the chef, Mr. Kubrick <br /> <br /> Signed, Constant DVD Collector
