This film was very interesting to me, a film often in a film, a very scary director who inspired the actress (inconsistent with each other) to create sex chemistry in the film. The director was interrupted while trying to play two people beautifully in the film. Sex comedy is more than a comedy, packed with uncomfortable playful moments, the film also addresses the emotional and natural spontaneous behavior of men and women in the sometimes controversial way of sex. I like this picture, the character played by the beautiful Anne Parillude, performs a beautifully screened screenplay to create a motion picture work of Jane Industries.
