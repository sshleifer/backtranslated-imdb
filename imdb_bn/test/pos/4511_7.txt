Again greetings from darkness. Based on the author Mega Best seller of the author Khaled Hossain, this film provides us with top-notch Russia in Afghanistan and Taliban aggression. Director Mark Foster added a jewel for his resume, which already includes "mind ball", "newland find" and "stranger than fiction". <br /> <br /> The story of young friends Amir and Hassan and unknown bonds share among the next generation. It is a story of respect and courage and loyalty and an unusual upcoming age story. When the boys show big scenes of children and then really show amazing scenes, then Amir returns as an adult to find the son of Lisa Jail. <br /> <br /> This is a strong, strong story. Acting is the whole hard, screen steal with no one actor. Although a happy story can not be expressed, it must be meaningful and heart-felt. Plus is a welcome gift playing in a quick shot pool.
