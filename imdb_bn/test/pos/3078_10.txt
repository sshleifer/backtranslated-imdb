I like this movie! I know that some people might say that this is not a great movie, but I really disagree. Comedy Classic Mail Brooks Style and Actor are nicely selected. This was my first exposure to Curie Elvis and Dave Chapel and they made the first impression. Robert Hood, the only British Robin Hood thinks Curie Elvis is like you. She has great comedy timing and right attitude for this kind of photo. Perhaps Dave Chappell is now much bigger, but at the time he had his first movie and he did some extraordinary work like Achur. All of the characters were very well designed and all the movies were added to their own little quirks. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of Popcorn and some close friends!
