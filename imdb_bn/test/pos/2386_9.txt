I've seen some Fred Carpenter movies in the showtimes, pay per view and video / DVDs, and especially I have enjoyed most of these movies with a few beer (know how to make the centrally entertained) "ADD Mano" and "Murden Innocence" in my favorites. Recently I watched a promo DVD of "ADD Monroe" and from everything from Cast Story to story, and everyone worked smoothly. (Doug Brown's music score was exciting.) I enjoyed watching Frank Severo ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he's an amazing and rarely acting actor. But I especially liked acting Uncle Beni who was Paul Vario, I saw his acting credits in IMDB and I did not find his first acting role in it. Where this guy has been! Give Fred Carpenter credit to discover Great New Talent, it's just the time to show this guy's joke with passino and Dario. As I mentioned, how the carpenter will entertain and when it works with your limited budget, it is amazing how it is produced by Cartenara. (I read Vent Magazine interviews and did not make any film for $ 400 million carpenter.) I saw "EDDIE Monroe" I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "Good Shepherd" both great movies. "Eddie Monroe" is a very good script, due to the good performance of the entire cast (the superstar star star star Jessica Sunis was hot!) Great movies, directions and Doug Brown's music score. As I said I recently saw "Rocky Belbo" and "The Good Shepherd", if I were to write a comment about those two films, then I would say something about "EDD Monroe". Two very good films do not meet with "Eddie Monroe", they did not have hundreds of grand expenses. Great movie and I did not even get a beer.
