There is absolutely no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made such a thing and nobody will do it. And it should really be seen fully appreciated in a theater. At a very short time this is a great sound system to meet with. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie open day in 1968, my senior year at high school. I liked science fiction because I went and wanted to see a "space" movie. Remember this image was created before the first moon landing. <br /> <br /> We started to sit there and wait. But, surprise! There was no cartoon, no upcoming attraction. The owner of Cooper Theater's theater chose to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" for some reason, so that we all stood, so that we were all standing, before or after the end of the movie without any of that. Then the theater went completely dark and started with the strange overture empty screen barely visible. <br /> <br /> The end of the overture and my seat started with appearances along with the first deep as blue screen with the lion, the vibration notes started in vibration, and then my sense was faded, for the first time in my life hearing "also Sprach Zarathustra" This journey has just begun. <br /> (I recommend you to watch this movie in a dark room, as your subphoor made the higher level outline as possible for me to feel in that theater.) Of course, we took some time before getting the exotic space and the movie There was something other than that followed a science-fiction film. Introvert (a good thing, very low quality and unused these days) and we all looked at each other looking surprised, we breathed our breath, and then the journey started, the flood was greater than before. <br /> <br /> I saw it more 7 times in the next year, always in a complete full-size theater, as was before all theater multiplexes. I could have been "high" once but I'm not going to see it again because I was "tripping". I went because I knew I was seeing art. It was so great; The sound that you may feel in your bones follows the awesome silence; Spectacular, unimaginable and predictable; Fear for HAL towards Terror. And, of course, did the WTF really try to go to me? Years and years and many more opinions, I also understood it, I think, as I like. Read others' comments If you want someone to explain it to you or search across the web you will get "explanation", not my intention to write these comments. <br /> <br /> This is what encourages you to look patiently, this is the way to enjoy your beauty that you enjoy watching the sunset and knowing the most beautiful music you have (for example, balloon suites or blue dunks in the gene); You taste like it's a nice meal, it sip like a fine wine; Look and listen for the formula and hidden symbol that has to hear. And then draw your own decision. Stanley Kubrick wanted to share some things with you that she found out beautiful and she wanted you to think about where you are. A man, where you came from and where you came from. <br /> <br /> If it works too much for your brain, and you can not see and hear, think about the beauty and mystery of the movie of Cubar, then forgive me my silence, but your life is a tapir or pre- As almost as meaningful as the benchmark is as meaningful <br /> <br /> But if you want harmonies in sunset, thunder, music, mystery, and sexuality and may have an open mind this picture will add something to your life.
