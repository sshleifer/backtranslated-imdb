'Manna of Heaven' is a delightful movie. <br /> <br /> In the paradox of the change of values ​​of middle-class Americans from 40 years ago to today, the plot is worrisome and interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br <br /> <br /> <br />! The most entertaining film. Rather than relying on 'face-to-face' sexual hygiene, the growing relationship between Inez and Mac / Baker is classic but fine but clear. Their heat is not incomplete in the Art Gallery to tie knit and play their insect. <br /> <br /> The scripts of the script are efficiently interpreted by an awesome star and supporting cast. I never saw for the first time in the first few movies, 'Manna of Heaven' explicitly supports national distribution. <br /> <br /> Conrad F.
