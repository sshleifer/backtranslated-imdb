The show was amazing and very professional. Madonna is a non-stop, dance and 2 hours for the song. When he came out of the disco ball, the opening was good and the jump was a really good performance. The whole show was full with energy, so it was difficult to say that there was some highlight because every song had some special and unique. I saw the live couple of his previous tour (Doubled World and Reinvenance Tour) that they were good but you can not compare with it. The dancer was fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you have not seen it yet, I suggest you see it. You'll enjoy the show from the show until the end. Madonna is still the dance queen.
