It was a fantastically written playback when it comes to understanding things from another perspective. The comedy was timely and not extravagant, and the plot was usually awesome, and when we only thought of people based on external looks, the plot line served a greater purpose in creating misconceptions. Amanda Bynes's brother / sister tries to twist the plot as the character tries to find a new love interest in football game instead of boys. Chanting is true where the real misconception is false and he does a good job of acting uncertain first, then the most important thing in life is to understand friendship, not attitude.
