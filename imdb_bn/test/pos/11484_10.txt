I have seen this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous comment. This cheek movie is meant to be a tongue stilted and played some. Men like Paul Cowley are less and far away, women like Linda, unfortunately, are a dozen of a dozen. The sad thing here is that although such similar relations rarely leads to murder and frame-ups, it is a familiar scenario. By worshiping a boy, the girl does not know what she is, she is growing up, seeing the man, she puts the woman down and takes her out and rescues her. The bottom line, she never loved him - she came right next time and she used her. Thomas is nerdy but not quite as nice as Paul. His screenplay is sensitive and sensitive. Madsen femme-fatale as perfect. What really moved me really was the final scene. Paul says, he finally cried, but not for his wife Linder, but many years ago he watched for an unknown girl and loved him for .. And I liked the closure of Thomas at the end.
