Almost no information available about this movie, or its wind dates. After a running and complete search I found available for DVD 3.99! - Please dated February 28, 2006. Try Yahoo! / DVD and Video. For posting this information, I would like to say that this is a lovely movie which is a real and fascinating story about a mysterious yoke that creates a very unusual stairs in the church. This is a chance to see William El Peterson before the CSI. Turn him into a star. Barbara Haresi is played in the same way in the story - whoever remembers them repeatedly? I have kept writing to get this post. Thank you for the time taken prior to taking time to make recommendations of this little bit unclear movie, which clearly sticks to many people permanently.
