Well, do not really say a lot about this. But it's really good. Softley has very good work from directives and has cast well in movies. Movie plot is also credible and ... hehe good. So the main word in this case is well. I just hope to be more such a scifi movie. Why are these one specific in the crowd? I think it's 8.5 of 8.5
