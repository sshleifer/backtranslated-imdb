Submarine was not used in Berangian! 'This' was actually built for Turkey by both Boats, P614 and P615, in Barrow-in-Farnes by Vikers Armstrong, but for the period of war, the Royal Navy was placed in the hands of Turkey. The P615 was shrunk but the P614 was finally delivered in 1945. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, the last number of both the P614 and P615 is actually drawn .... <br /> There are some very realistic moments in the film. This Turkish boat was similar to the S-Class. Since no S-class submarine survives, their shots (as P61) and the depot ship "Futher" are now made as part of an interesting record, as well as a nice movie.
