The above profile was written by me when I used to be Nick Weieroff 56, which is still my email address. I still believe that the character of Frankie's Andy Divine is the episode of the best Twilight Zone and I saw this episode at least once because I think of Frisbee lucky because she has many friends who love her. <br /> <br /> Many of you are very young to remember, I'm 61 years old, and Andy Divine organized a children's entertainment program in the 50's that I believe in an in-depth group. He had three assistants: a cat called Midnight, who played Halloween, a mouse called Skuki, who played a hand limb and played a dog dog and played on Frogie and disappeared, will be ashamed of many like Andrey's funny guest star Billy Gilbert.
