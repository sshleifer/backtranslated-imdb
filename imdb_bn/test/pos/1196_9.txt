I saw it because my friend said that we can try, when we ask my father what we will see. I do not want to be because it was an old movie, how could it be good? I finally saw that friend and my father. My friends and I loved the film. The songs were great, the actors were calm and we were crazy about it. I guess this event even though it came from Dad's time, but that does not mean that it can not be a good movie. I bought the film after watching it on TV, I left it a lot and sang along with the song. I even saw this in my birthday party with my classmates. This is a nice, good and sometimes fun movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not try then you can not say it bad. Even if you do not feel like I'm going to see a film from Dad's time. If you do not like it, you can always stop seeing the first part of the movie. I really recommend it, it's great !!
