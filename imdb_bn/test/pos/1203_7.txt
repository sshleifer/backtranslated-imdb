(May have spoilers) I find myself frustrated with criticizing the taking of this movie. Although it is not perfect, it is much better to give credit for it. Acting and photography are excellent. The number of musical numbers is great; With the number of titles, "Where do I go?", "Difficult to be hard", and "Black boys / white boys". I did not see the stage musical, I think it's a fair trial cloud. In this theater you do not see musical instruments. Do not try to compare them. Theater musical was probably exciting to watch, but it never did affect the film, so to add a plot. And the last that's added is just amazing. The movie has made me feel that I have seen something really important, in contrast to most of today's movies, which are only satisfied with one level.
