Such movies will not only get credit they deserve. This is my second favorite movie ever, (being the 1st tallest by me.) Because I saw this movie because Will Wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and I think he did an extraordinary job this movie and so Shan Astin Did not I just saw it last night and it just surprised me. Everything in the movie is very exceptional. Scripts, acting, screenplay I had 80% time on the edge of my seat, and if I do not have my mom in the room, I would have said absolutely whenever Joe Trotta (Will Wheaton) died. I do not see that coming !! At all !! I was really surprised when I heard that it was not really popular in the 90's. I was born a few years after my birth, of course, I did not see it in the theater, but I was sure if I was alive. If any of my friends see this, they will be good, "Oh okay?" But that's just because they calm them down enough to appreciate the work like them. If you do not see this movie or want to see some of the bombs you will see this movie.
