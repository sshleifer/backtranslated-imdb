The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. I think that this movie gives very low scores because they are mainly due to the fame of the fans of Ronald Coleman's 1937 edition. That movie - good reason! - engendered an incredible level of commitment. At the time of coming for the first time, from talking to people who saw the real, I believe that the effect of the first "Star Wars" movie in the modern era was the same. I saw it. It was and surprising. But that does mean that this version is also not worthy. The first scene from the 1973 edition grabs you. The words and tumult are fantastic, especially they are ready for peace in Shangri La. And Burt Bacharach's music is beautiful. So - Enjoy all the ways in 1937 edition. But do not let the King Kong of 1935 distinguish it from your enjoyment in the edition of 1973 rather than letting Peter Jackson destroy this year.
