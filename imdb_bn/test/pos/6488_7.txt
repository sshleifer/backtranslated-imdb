Sometimes it is difficult to define what is the plane that separates one successful, joyous comedy. In this case, a rich wealthy girl who plans to take away from Bohemian in the village of Garibach does not promise that the planned plot which only falls for itself. Nothing in the director Lei Jason's film suggests that he was a great genius. And yet he was responsible for maintaining a relaxed, happy environment on the set of credible records in the film. <br /> <br /> She also had a good idea to throw this film properly. Miriam Hopkins was a small mistake that was appropriate for Ginger Rogers in a section. Hopkins was skilled but fragile, lacking warmth and lack of sexiness was Rogers. She is a distraction sometimes which is more hummusred by a pair of more annoying long and holes false eyelashes. But a very young and very handsome Ray Mildand can not be better than a fantastic, unmarried comic performer fantastic. <br /> <br /> and better than that, especially for New York City residents, the Hollywood screenplay was in 1937 in Greenwich Village. Although fully synthetic and standardized, it is recognized by contemporary audiences. Art director Vin Neist Pollas has created this lavish snack of music apartments and ramshackles, which is perfect for the artists of this photo, Strawar, Smart-Alex and Wanabs collections. Assistant Cast Best Gin Williams, who brings sweetness and light in the role of prizefighter-sculptor-designer, who offers self-inventiveness and intensity (sex and otherwise) life in the village. Betty Fillson and Mariana Starlby are refreshing even more by playing younger girls. Tomb, intelligent, and full of humor, these girls seem like real people and nothing like that of professional child actors of that time. <br /> <br /> There are a number of memorable comic sets in special interest: A girl is played with multiple autonomous roles (in her childhood and on the opposite 'found' moments) by showing Ray Myel's vacuum cleaner demonstration and a department store A horrific domestic 'game' in the window is a free-for-all fun. The film slides directly to the front with a straightforward trial in front of the trial and after most of the time it does not return to the track while going to Long Island, but this film is still a look.
