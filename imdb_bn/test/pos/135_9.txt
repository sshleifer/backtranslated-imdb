Cinematography Film's Burning Characteristics. The park really knows its stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. Each shot is filled with vibrant colors to jump off the screen. Each frame of the film seems to be all about the story itself. I hope this movie releases a Blu-ray because it looks fantastic. Vampire's legend is rather playful to see what used to be his view. Sang-Hyeon has to drink blood for survival and survival, has incredible strength, and sunlight risky. <br /> <br /> Although I have never seen the film, I could not help but felt the Chan-Uk Park version of Twilight. The middle part of the film is encouraged to love each other in San-Hein and Tee-Zu. It really felt like Twilight Adult Edition, really. There are some untoward abuses for lots of blood, nudity, sex and even good measurements. Maybe it's the fan of Chan-ek Park in me, but I honestly feel like I can guarantee that these two good films The psychological aspect I like about the past films in the park is as well as thirst. This is one of the main reasons for me which is a film that makes me think or likes unusual abnormal air. The soundtracks of the park's films are always appropriate for their respective films, just like their gloves. Thirsty no exception. Although this soundtrack is almost a bit subtle at this time, it does its best to make the film's overall atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The middle part of the film has been dragging more than anything else in the film. It's weird, though the scenes at that time are very important in the story of the film and it's hard to imagine that thirsty is the same movie, if those scenes are cut off. Yet, this is one of the worst events of my film. <br /> <br /> With thirst of Chan-ek Park, the Vampire bites the Puranas and places them in their own dark, psychological curves. Park films always seem to have a specific formula, or most of the following include: great writing, beautiful painters, a strong throw, some kind of psychological motions that will mess with your head and a memorable end. Thirsty arrives at the stage and hopefully it gets more attention in DVD (and finally, blu-ray, finally) when running her theater.
