For the first 10 minutes or so, this film is a little slow at the beginning. But once you can not stop kicks it. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are great for their performance. You will not be able to guess who the killer is. I gave this movie 9, because in some parts Adam Beach needs to talk a little bit so that you can listen to what you are saying. <br /> <br /> 9/10
