Life was great for New York City advertising artist Ted Krummer. She had a great job and a loving wife. No, in fact, his wife was not so loving, because after Tede returned home from that work, that night his wife Joanna was going out of the door by packing a suit. He tried to stop him, but he just left the lift and Ted's life. Well, along with his work as well as his 6-year-old son Billi also remembers! Ted assured his boss that no way to surrender his wife would affect his work performance. It affected her performance as a father. When Billy paused his client Artwork, he blown away! Well, Ted and Billy received a letter from Joanna a few days later, and his letter was clear that he was not coming back. Ted was bored. Well, he was delaying Billy's birthday's work, which gave him the trouble. <br /> <br /> Ted was delayed to work one day and his boss screamed over him because he missed important meeting of important clients. When he went home, he yelled at the delivery for sneaking ice cream during dinner. Then he really told Billy that he and Juan had a break in him, maybe not his fault; Ted had invited a good friend, Philis Bernard, that night, and well, Billy saw his naked woman's first appearance. The next day when Ted Billy took him to the park, he broke the jungle's jimm and got his first face on the plane. Ted literally took him to the hospital where he had to manage sewing. Then, Ted started to accept a lower spiral. Then one day of the blue he got a phone call from someone other than the jeweler! They met a corner cafe. At first, they had happy conversations, but then the young man told her that she had returned to her to collect her son and took her away. Which of Ted and the storm would be out. Good life for Ted became worse when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him to the lunch and suddenly shot him. Not only that, Joanna Billy was suing for the custody and did not allow Teddy to win hell without a job. He appointed himself a lawyer, John Shawneis, who had charged a beautiful currency: $ 15,000 is the correct change. And if they win. <br /> <br /> Ted was able to find a new job. It was actually a step down from being paid enough to pay, but he took firm determination. Finally, the court came, date 9 January, 1980. Presiding Judge Atkins. Joanna took the stand and told Shaunessy why she left Ted and asked questions about her other relationship and how they failed. The next day, Ted stood and the juvenile lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend Margaret also accepted that stand and he did not really help in matters. Well, the judges took enough time to spend some time, one day Shaunis told Ted that he was lost. Jonah got the only custody of the bill! How ideal! Always in power for the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were devastating only by division. Suddenly close by Joanna when they were in an uneasy departure. There is a little talk and good thing than talking to him and Ted, just to finish, I assure everyone that everything is all right for everyone! <br /> <br /> It was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He earned the Academy Award. I saw him hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, for which he also won an Oscar. Merrill Strip was good. She got an Oscar. Justin Henry was very good, so where was his nomination? I think academy had a rule against giving Oscar for children, but Halley Joel came along with the Oscillation when this law was raised. This movie has great drama, light comedy, and it is very fine. It does a good job of holding your attention. I was watching Rain Man on TCM the other night, then it came later and I could not only help but watch the watch. And that's what you should be doing. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Merrill Strip or the movies of this genre, I recommend Krummer vs. Krrum! Two divorced parents laugh a secret film to fight against their child. I always like Teddy's short lecture on the power of the mother. What was it about a good father that sex? Indeed, how they have children. But seriously, he is right. Why always rule for the mother because she is a woman? Also, George Kow, Howard Duff, who died in 1990, and Howell Chamberlain, who died in 1984. Watch out for Jebel Williams up and coming in the nude in the Hallway scene. Anyway, look at cracker vs crum today !!! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
