I really started to enjoy this show. It just started at a slow pace and it was not given the opportunity given. It's summer so many people are not watching television at home. I know there are some talent and singer competition but I enjoy them as many others. When I miss the American statue for the year, believe it or not. Although this American statue was not I had it possible. I feel bad for the singers who have started to grow. I wish they were to reconsider and return to the show. I think it's an early step to cancel. My only complaint about the show is that I do not care more about the judges.
