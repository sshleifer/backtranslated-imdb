God !!! Do you ever think they will make a movie about it ?? Well I knew they would be, but I do not know when !! And now last here !!! When I got it through the post yesterday, I put it in my (evil) stereo that ran the DVD and immediately saw this hooveryougouge green (looks cloudy) on my face. (Good to see ... fantastic !!) and they follow all other impressive characters from the final imagination! With TIFA and Eris, my favorite .... (They are very nice) Graphics knocked me out !!!! They were really amazing. So real from the last hair !!! The line of the story is a bit confusing, especially when my version was in Japanese, but of course - the longest fantasy fantasy for a long time - I did not mind - I read only subtitles !!! All the characters talk about the way they play, and the Renao and the rude are still funny. The dragon scene is very wicked. Just looks so good !!! However .... the graphics were, amazing .... the story, the fantastic .... and even the basic idea of ​​an FF7 movie ....... the genius !!!
