When I was young, there was one of the first color films in the movie. It's good to remember it. The girl, Leigh Taylor, who later became beautifully beautiful, acted together with little and wonderful actor Mikey Rooney. The content of the movie plot is good for all ages, good wishes and behavior. Velvet's parents have good ethics, especially to take her mother's account to something. Our generation should be well-educated and this film can help with this purpose. Velvet likes horses and runs them, and M.T. Taylor (Rooney) brings him to England's International Horse Racing Competition, which ultimately wins young velvet, but she is disqualified because of being female.
