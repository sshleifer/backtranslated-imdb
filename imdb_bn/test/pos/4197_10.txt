"Head" is one of those movies that will make you convinced to see your friends, but once they fall in love with it. I do not know how many times this happened to me. This film is so funny and bizarre, a remake that really had everything till this moment in his career. Bob Rafelson has been credited with many credits, who have finished his career with Monkey's career. My sense was that he wanted to instruct TV shows and enter into the features, which he did in a big way after this. Mickey Dolenz is absolutely delightful. I can not believe that this photo was not his second life as a comedic actor after. This picture contains many great cayos and wonderful psychedelic ambiguities. I think the continuation of the film's fame continues and it will not surprise me when it is finally full of classical class.
