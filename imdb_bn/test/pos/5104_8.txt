Yes 1939 / Robert Donut-Greyer's Gerson version was the best ... Perfect. In a very difficult year to win Donate Oscar ... Gould and Jwed Stewart are eligible as Mr Smith. Her competitors were 2. That was fairly bad. Most critics in NY hated this version. I see the theater! Finally saw this AM. TCM and enjoy. Peter O'Wowel was extraordinary and delighted that he was nominated for the Oscars, and SP was glad that finally Oscar gave him special awards this past year ... Petra Clark was good as Mrs. Chips but its character, I'm bad Was written ... some good music esp You and I sung by Ms.Clark and later recorded by others including T.Bennett / S. Basses and Carmen Macrie .... The B & W version was more authentic .. but it's a good picture that nicely painted in the color and pavicion picture ... it seems enjoyable and Bravo, again, Mr. O'Oolo!
