One of the best films of the 1980s, this based-based movie is a story of a boring high school student who kills his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on the river and then releases it to her friends. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Life of revolt and reluctant life. This play hard hit and impossible to forget. Young cast performs an accomplished job - Keonu's raves among its first roles are even better than usual. Of course, there is no reason for Len's character (Crespen Glover) like him, and may be the wall of the wall, but it is only Glover himself. In spite of the nature of the nature of Dennis Hooper, despite the attitude of this group of children, he particularly plays a great role in grief. I want to point out Daniel Rabak's cold execution as a young killer; He is also a performer under Hooper, and also has the best performance of the film as well as the hopper. <br /> <br /> I saw "River Edge" for the first time when it started showing the first TV movie channel of the cable; However, I did not catch it all; I saw this for the first time after several years, and now I have seen it again for a specific time. <br /> <br /> Some slow-breaking times break the bar of Madeleine (Constance Forlund) where she may leave her children like her kids. I also like the scenes where Matt (Reeves) faces his sick little brother (Joshua Miller) and when the teacher, Mr. This girl died in Burkauet (Jim Metzler) and does not think any of his students are taking care of him <br /> <br /> <br /> I will never forget this picture as long as I live. It is very sad. <br /> <br /> 10/10
