I saw several movies and it was no idea that it was good. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (though I flushed Nirvana). It seems that it would be much fun but it was more than that. Jansen kept a little touches like books (among others, Kubrick books), movie posters etc. When I see a director it takes time and keeps his heart in a movie. And you can really feel that this. I like many scenes and moments, I'm trying to think of some other movies that I think and I can say that I can remember the only thing in Cameron Cro's movies. Takes a little moment and makes them stand out and especially. The soundtrack is amazing and every song works perfectly with film scenes and feelings. These pictures are amazing shots, and outstanding editing. I could really go about the film and I can really recommend this enough. If you want a funny story with a great tone from a director who clearly keeps his heart in his work, check it out.
