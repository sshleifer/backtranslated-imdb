When I was very young and since then I can think of this movie several times on TV. I always liked it. In a print on the local TV, I noticed that a scene reversed the film. They are hiding behind this stone (it looks like the vasukaze rocks near Los Angeles) traveling by Indians. If you look carefully, you will notice that suddenly all the soldiers are in the left hand! This is just a small segment and I must admit that it has taken me for millions of years. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes, Indians often conduct raids to rescue white captives from India. The direct connection for the final battle scene is the Battle of Bachar Island. In that activity, a team of volunteer scouts, repeatedly repetitive Carabines (not Spencer Carabinets Winchester), was surprised by Indians and returned to an island and closed several complaints. In the last charge, they killed Roman Nos, one of the more famous Indian chiefs. The author of the script can not think of it, but it feels fairly well. <br /> <br /> Some songs have Madison movies which I hope will never come out of the DVD and it's one of them.
