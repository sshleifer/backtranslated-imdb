This show was a wonderful surprise after watching Mad TV on Saturday night. Spike is a nice host that you can still say it is using but he's doing a great combination for his new job. I can imagine it might be a difficult transition from the author (senfield) to host, but he did not go to airtime while trying to determine what he would do against the new talk show host. He is quick to think and rolls into each other and sections easily and easily in each other. It does not hurt that he is aesthetically sexy like the street, so she is not hard on eyes like Lenny or Letterman. I can not remember the exact date of my favorite episode but I especially love Idiot Paparazzi Skit with a fake Je-lo and Katie Holmes. Great new show !!
