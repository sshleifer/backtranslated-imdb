I saw this image only in Birmingham, Awami League's Sidwale Film Festival, which was really a fun festival, and it was blown away. This is one of the best movies I've seen throughout the day with a long shot. An elderly prostitute joins a medieval man and tries to end deep depression together. It is an internal look in the dark part of the human sexuality. The story stems from the original life events, ripped directly from the title. Judgment, blunt dialog, and finally a killer turn. The film contains graphic sex conversations and nudity. Certainly not suitable for kids. Some people are very depressed for the taste Although my opinion is definitely worth checking out.
