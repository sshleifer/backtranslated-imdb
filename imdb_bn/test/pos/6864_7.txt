Anatomie (Anatomie) is an entertaining and compelling film that is short for the discomfort associated with film matters. The concept of moral ignorance in the world of medical science leads to discomfort, and the reality of the institutions ('Heidberg') and special effects make it a completely simple movie. <br /> <, however, the film's characters, scripts, and film glasses seem to be familiar with Scrum movies that reshape the genre. Sadly, when the matter is presented to viewers to take care of the matter, then a full movie full of letters of college students is presented which we have no opportunity to really worry about, the caretakers of concern and Hammie Stage-Healing have been reinstated a few years ago, Drew Barrymore himself from the opening scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Steven Ruzovskski works in a fair and straightforward way of writing scripts and instructions, but without the usual theme, without any borders. Although we have presented an entertaining film with some reasonable performance, unfortunately we are left with an old feeling: There is nothing wrong with this movie, but nothing is remarkable. <br /> <br /> The opportunity to see how post-screaming has been influenced by 'horror' culture of an entertaining movie and a fun foreign filmmakers. 10 out of 6
