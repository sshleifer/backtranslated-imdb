In the end, Casey has a good plan that would accept Christine to stay in Paris. <br /> <br /> While listening to "Thursday" we are dragged into it because of its talent. Skip Woods directs its own components. This seems like a film with good intentions. Occasionally the film seems to be of the same genre as others, there is no sin of any size or shape, which seems to be the main objection to negative comments on the IMDB site. For beginners, "Thursday" shows a wonderful skip Wood that has gone for writing other movies, especially "Swordfish". Screenplay is divided into chapters with related work titles. Dennis Lenoir is not surprising with most of the internal photography. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane makes a great contribution to the film with his case. Although difficult to imagine, he beat the intrigued and created something from himself. This actor recently watched in the television series "Hung", we are not tired of acting, an actor who is not tired. Welcome to a film that is a dark haunted Haroon. He is a sticky criminal that shows nothing about the qualities of any freedom fighter, or repentance and hesitates to involve his ex-friend in his project. James LeGros has nothing to do. Polyline is the zodiac, which is just a confusion, or a gossip for adding a sexy angle goes for a fantastic creature. We enjoyed Glen Plummer, who appeared as Ice. He is not an average myth of the telephone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Roar were also present.
