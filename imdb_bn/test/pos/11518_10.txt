The first "All Accepting" feature film in New York, which came in 57 minutes, and was directed by Brian Faye (the famous Vaudville family). <br /> <br /> There are two Dopi barbers in the story (Coolen Landes, Eugene Palette) interested in the opportunity to "Big City Life" and are involved in gangster and foolhardy flour. A policeman was ready to kill a policeman but in the last minute it was saved by gun mullah (Gladys brokwell). <br /> <br /> Most of the stories are held in Nightclub called Night Hawk. , Which is operated by a crow named Haq (Wheeler Ocoman), who keeps the eyes of beautiful Cherins (Helen Costello), who is the daughter of Landis. Costello is a short dancer and we hear Harry Downing (made like Ted Lewis) in his best Al Jolson style.) <br /> <br /> Acting Range Good (Palette and Braquewell) Strange (oakman). Some actors forgive their lines but keep them on the right with the scene. Elsewhere, it is said to be a small 2-relayer and it was made in a shoe budget. Yet the quality of the word is surprisingly well, the voice all clearly registers and Silhouette's death has a clear cinematic touch. <br /> <br /> It was shown as a silent film, although the movie was a box office remnant, where the theaters were not equipped for the new sound technology. Nobody expected this amazing movie to take $ 1.3 million. It was briefly created by Castello and Landes, and then they launched the long-time palette as star performer. <br /> <br /> Among the co-stars, Mary Carr's mother, Robert Eliot Detective, Eddie Kane Street Police, and Tom Doughing are a cold.
