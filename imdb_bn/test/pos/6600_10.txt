In fact, I have a question more than a comment. I like Z-Boys and The Lord of Dogon. When Sou Lords was the first, then Doc, and when I liked the story, I wanted to know why there was an important character in the film, but in the documentary, he was not part of the team, and only mentioned only, only they knew some kids. Anyone know the story? The story of these boys was amazing. I grew up where I experienced the skeboarding craze, but my kids have enjoyed it. What I saw in the local skate parks is the discovery of these boys. I did not know that. When the film shows competition, and Z-Boys do their work, they shy others in the competition.
