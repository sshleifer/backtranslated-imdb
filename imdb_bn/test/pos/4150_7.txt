This film delivers a lot of promise but a little bit. In this movie, the basic problem must be completed with the addition of Charlotte Gainsberg's character. Sicily immigrants did not need a red-faced Angolo in any way - the film might need it but the new citizen did not do it. In my opinion, the decision to decide on the continuation of the picture. This is especially problematic, since it condemns immigration history, not just the characters of the film. The immigrants had their heroic identity, I believe that I believe that the statue of "white man's burden" is not believable. I'm surprised that anyone will make a movie by Irish immigrants who will include a Sicilian woman as a major character. Considering the seven aspects of the left elbow index film - acting, production sets, dialogue, artistry, film continuity, plot and character development - 10 height, 5 for average and 1 scale for the requirements. Film continuity and plot rate are both low. The above discussed continuation is further subdued by the unrealistic end. Is a movie of such an important historical significance more than no conclusion, which reminds Mark Chagall? Plot is easy, as long as it is involved in very long time in the old country, very short time on the ship, and very important to the end. The role of acting and character is average, because all the characters are corrected throughout the film, and adding Anglo-Saxon-speaking English to English makes this movie a satire. Where is Grucocha need him? Production sets, conversations and artistry are very good, each rating 10. As Sicily sets, Ships and Alice Island sets are just as good. Dialogue is remarkable, and the moral singer is fantastic. I agree with Scorsese that the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure to hear. Note that immigrants are talking about "America", not "United States" - ideal versus political reality There are many good artistic scenery with giant veggies in America's dream, gold coin rain, and the best. Average left elbow index 5.25, raised in 7.0 if the IMDB is equal to scale. Another idea seems to be going through the experience of Alice Island: The misery of pass immigrants was frustrating, after 2006, only one had to give the quote or boat owner and in the darkness of the night the county had to be torn, no question was asked! The movie is valuable to watch, but it seems like what the problem is.
