I have seen this movie a sneak preview and before reading my comment you need to know that it is very intelligent because I love techno, trans, club, house and music. <br /> <br /> The movie was curl, whose brother Jason (or whatever name is called) died in an accident: he closed a roof, "drunk" Karl met his brother-in-law, Sani, and two of them jolted some private investigations about Jason's death, and Karl was involved in Jason's former life, which was related to clubs and medicines. The film, seen in an artistic perspective, is no more than ** ** a bigger pill. The plot is predictable, all the characters are extremely clipped and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town, young looking good young girl, big bad drug king ... list endless) and most actors are not just believable such intrigues. He does not know about the efficacy of Matthew's Rhys for the big boy coming to London and suddenly taking drugs from people, against his female opponent Sunny, performed by Sienna Gilori, whose behavior seems more realistic to the viewer. There was nothing other than the effect of the copper carrier King Damian: a phony comedy, very "eeeevil" and is really ridiculous. But <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> ..It makes my comment more subjective, I think) (twisted and twisted) and you will definitely have to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone else: forgot .... it! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 (see objective) <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 7 (my personal scene and my final vote)
