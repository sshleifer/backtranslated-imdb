Frankly, this is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. I was captivated by Captain Howdy and the burnt story on the edge of my seat for the whole room. I do not really understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> Setup is already discussed in depth; Captain Howy is an online hunter who meets with teenagers, kidnaps them and presents their favorite choices of correction and piercing. De Schneider is Captain Howdy and he is one of the greatest psychologists of all times. Probably horrible because he is so human and you got this idea (especially if you are in the body correction) that the people in this world are really like this. <br /> <br /> But the biggest reason I liked it is the film and the reason is so dangerous that Captain Howdy becomes a hero. At the beginning of the movie, the role is cut clear; The victim is innocent, the police super guy and Howdy Pure Bad According to the second law, something has changed. How do you want to be evil in the hady but it turns out that he really is only victim of the situation and probably is not good and bad obvious. It's terrific for the "bad" man to make himself happy. <br /> <br /> Some people have mentioned that Strangland should have broken into two separate films. Of course, there are two different "works", but this film works so well because the two tasks are back again. The first thing is usually the psycho-thriller but the second step is most annoying due to the feedback of the audience. I do not think that if the second task is expanded and turned into a continuous form, then it did the same thing. <br /> <br /> As a big horror movie fan, I highly recommend this movie. This is my first nightmare movie to give me nightmare.
