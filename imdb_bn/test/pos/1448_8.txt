Frank Sinatra took this role, chewed it with the rest of the scenes and - spread his way. TMWTGA periodically, quarter-finale, requires a little more cutting in some scenes, but that's all. It's great entertainment from the beginning, and when you see it, you realize that Sinatra was a longtime cruncher, his blood junk, gangster card games, and the entire US Urban Hessel thing - he never learned anything from this acting coach. There are all kinds of keys to attract you and cook (non-dated) soundtracks all the way. For forty years the marathon card game Goodfellas, Sopransas etc! Was not the book trusted? What movie And I can not remember that if the brand is released then it is remembered; The cold turkey scenes are shocking, instead of being strong, strong and running with Sinatra. Some other sad, lazy, terrorist police have not mentioned - absolutely spot! And to push Alan Parker * will be driven * me.
