The crew of an American submarine invented Hell Bell while fighting it in 1915 in Adriktik. <br /> <br /> Although almost forgotten, this excellent war film still provides solid entertainment, an educated script, higher performance, and a highly trusted action scene. <br /> <br /> Submarine officers play under Robert Montgomery and Walter Huston's war, who quickly interfere with each other, with dramatic and tragic consequences. Since Montgomery has played well with the daughter of Matthew Madees Evans, so the situation has become more complicated on the shore and under the waves. Visitors burst into two powerful characters, one of which is controlled by his heart and by another rule. <br /> <br /> Robert Young makes an effective appearance as a friend of Montgomery. Sterling Hollah creates a short, vivid, destructive sea portrait. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallet Torpedo Master and Jimmy Durante created for a very funny comedy team as Deputy Deputy and provided stories with lots of smiles. Durante's nose comes for many ribbing and her obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chagrin encounters with British tars. <br /> <br /> Babies will recognize London as a mastic Italian mavens mavens; Mood Eburne as a British Admiral and Paul Porcasi as an Italian Admiral - all strangers <br /> <br /> With MGM undersea sequences produced well, the film gave absolutely first-class production standards. Both the clustrophobic compacts of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with the submarine warfare are properly illustrated. Other moments of unexpected plays (Montgomerie and Miss Evans are caught on a suspended ferry wheel during an air raid) and Hilary (Durango Boxing A Kangaroo) provides the full experience of seeing the film's fabric fully satisfied.
