Charlie Wilson (twice Oscar-winning: Tom Hendes) is a simple congressman ... who likes a party, enjoys women's association and especially drinks his dirt. Charlie's old friend and ex-girlfriend Joan Hering (Oscar-winner: Julia Roberts) wants to visit Afghanistan, that country must definitely help. Charlie saw that he saw, especially from all ages, from the war with the Russians he was killed or hurt. He helped people and rebels fight with the Russians, who started the war. A good fight will start to bring the most secretive operation in the history of a CIA agent named Charlie, Joan and Gaste Abraktos (Oscar-winning: Philip Semu Hoffman). <br /> <br /> Winner of the Oscars: Mike Nicholls (Henry, Wolf-related Birdcage) created a lively, entertaining sharp satire combat comedy based on a real story. His role of Emmy Adams as Harks, Roberts, Huffman Oscar nominated and Charlie's Loyal Assistant is very good. Despite the extraordinary real life, "Charlie Wilson's War" will never fire and you liked it as it is not funny to be funny Director Nicolas and Screen Writer: Aaron Sorkin (a very good man) keeps things moving and likes letters all over the world. <br /> <br /> DVD's sharp pan and scan (1.33: 1) transfers and good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The only special feature of DVDs is Cast and crew and Charlie Wilson and others with real-life features. "Charlie Wilson War" is a good movie which can be really cool but it's not. But this movie is smart enough for those who enjoyed good written or well-played adult comedy. (***** *** **** out).
