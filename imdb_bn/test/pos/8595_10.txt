This movie I have seen most of the time is the best movie. Without the speculation like JFK, Nixon or Hoffer, it is also the best film to use in the theater to make history. Believers lying in the Congo in Belgium are silent. It has made us easily sharp for European and American forces, which is now under the power of the Congress. The film was definitely involved in the United States, of course, Lumumbar murdered. This movie can never be made for US film. In imperialism and murder incidents. (Save Stone's JF) This allows us to stay in problems with the internal conflict of the Congo between Languba, Mantu and Katangar. We can see how uncertain countries will sit while establishing a new government when their history is one of the colonials and those colonists have to pull the string of energy and energy. The film shoots Lissimer Eri Ibnuin in exquisitely. Cast is awesome and they hold you at that time in the climate of Congo in Congo. <br /> <br /> Again, it must definitely see those who love to play in the right historical background. Quilombo see my note.
