"Zed" should not be considered erotic thriller because sex scenes are not as enjoyable as "pornography" or "family friendly" movies. <br /> <br /> "Zed" is not a simple surveillance because it is difficult to hold stories and is not common in society. With the first scene, from the beginning of the film, you expect more powerful scenes. <br /> <br /> The rape scene (in my opinion) was not a good scene scene. I think the director did not use the camera's fairly accurate camera technique. Because of this, it seems sometimes neutral and becomes almost boring. <br /> <br /> Performance from all five female characters is very good. These women show a strong, intense, but credible performance that show the dramatic power of actors. <br /> <br /> Legal concepts helped to understand the difficulties of the plot because the legal term of sodomy is different from a common rape. From the point of view of the defense of the Mage, sodomy is to be punished as a rape (a big crime grade B) even though it is a different offense. Pat and Alex's defense claimed that Meg was enjoyed and asked for it. To tell the truth, who thinks this movie is interesting. The only thing for sure is that sexual scenes fit a legal definition of a crime. See "Zed" if you like legal issues that are not very common in your community. If not, try this one because it is a very good and powerful drama.
