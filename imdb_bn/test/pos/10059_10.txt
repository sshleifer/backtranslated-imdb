Why everybody thinks they have to keep this movie continuously? It's tricky and funny (it's exactly what it's meant to be). Madonna could not prove herself as an Oscar colaist artist in this movie! He was just asked for what character, and he was good at it. I love her in this movie; After Ivita it's my second favorite Madonna movie. The soundtrack is very nice. It's no better or worse than the sparkling of the 80's. To all the critics, do not take it very seriously and you can enjoy it. Madonna is a goddess !!!
