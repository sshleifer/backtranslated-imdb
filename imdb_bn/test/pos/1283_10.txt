Christopher Nolan followed his goals in a very narrow way, and in that direction he pulled something that reminded me of the small 'poverty-ray' films directed at Ulm in 40 minutes. Only this time, he was able to implement the touch of respect - things like black and white photography (given due to the shoes-string budget, these letters are also essential for black darkness) and cast casting (John Do Lead, Charming Male Homosexuality, and beautifully-decorated Femme fatale in the system) - it has 90 degrees underground indie kingdom where for a few thousand dollars and location and Music specific choices and such things can be possible. That, as well as film-silent mood, Nalan also puts a trick web of a plot, probably much more than Memento. Inches, a work of a psychology arising out of an intriguing plot by an inch in the previous inch, where it was the second, here is the non-linear structure showing how much someone like Bill could be as dark as a cobb. , Not just for anyone who is holding your toes in an environment that does not really have bent and deep brains. <br /> <br /> Of course, the whole purpose of following someone is basically the original purpose. I was not sure about the story, and I'm going in, where it would lead, if it could be a kind of awareness of Ala Slacker, where Nalan would lead her character to an urban British person. But Bill-to-Kob's relationship is done quickly and wonderfully, as we see when Cobb approaches Bill in Caf√© to find out what he is following by following him to ask what he is doing - and the first robbery he has to know Brings along Very soon the horizon seems to be a good score, in fact, Cobb and his lady (just a big set of 'The Golden'), probably probably spontaneous tributes to Norre, but why Carp). But it has been expressed in such a way that I was actually guessing, because the manipulation of racism did much more to raise questions, why not so much. Due to the fact that the Alex House is truly brilliant like the psyche, the density has become bigger due to the understanding of the essential points of the actors, which really is her "deepest idea" of the content of the stolen and Theobald with the lack of a person who can never be like a real smartphone. Rather, he can be more intelligent than he really does No, rather it is more intelligent in the stupid way, which has no chance in the dunk environment; Russell almost makes it very easy, even with a mouth that Anna will send head to Savage with a joke. Meanwhile, Nalan says about her style like Cameraman, it does not have anything to add embarrassment and mystery, it is not too quick to leave the lasting impression with fade-in / fade-out, but the script's' this-lead- Somewhere 'somewhere' is enough to add somewhere. He follows it in the handheld form as he knows where his limitations are, and are still pretty essential to keep essential: close-ups are needed when I need a track (I like Russell's face in a small mirror), and a fairly simple technology that detects that track. Sometimes, as mentioned in the 'present day' something to look for and something which is perpetual, play in the brain and with a moral ambiguity as a story of a strong story of lower-level criminals, which is not always clear, which is practically inevitable for me in its dark way. Simply tell, one of the cool calling cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years, and should be expected to look forward to discovering the future fans of Nalan's other works. Even those who think that the quick mainstream quick-editing and big gun-ammunition went to dogs (even in independent movies) it's a bright little 71 minutes.
