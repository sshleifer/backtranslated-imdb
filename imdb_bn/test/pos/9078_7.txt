Hollywood is one of the best and beautiful things in my life. I admire and are very fascinated by the way Hollywood produces ideas and their implementation. It makes me amazed about the human brain's opportunities. I've seen Flatlines long ago, but the story, direction, cast and all the acting still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our lead actor Sutherland during the sunrise "What a beautiful day to die." For all of us, this is a story that shows the emotion that keeps our mind sometimes in our lives. Can not understand some things in life It inspires us and shows us to improve the quality of life. Anyway I recommend it that once it's watch.
