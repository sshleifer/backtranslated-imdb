I am surprised and frustrated to see the number of critics of this site without getting the point of Black Snake Moon. It's not about black / white relationship or old / young relationships, although I think director Craig Brewer has run on both elements to tick deliberately fabulous tabs. It is not about sexual violence or sexual abuse, although Christina rixie character Rai identifies them. It is not about religion in the black community, though religion plays a big role. This is not a love story, although it's not the same, but at the end, two happy couples. And it's not about the south, where "everything is warm," though it is located on the south and it's strangely hot; Holy Smoke, even the tag-line writer did not get the point. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Mon is an example about Mississippi Delta Blues; Those who think that those who can write them, who play them, what they are playing, how they treat them. <br /> <br /> The creators sit with a blank slate and ask, "Well, what are the blues really going to help people understand me, what will they see?" So they set the rural south Then they dream of two characters, whose wife leaves him to live with her best friend, goes to another war and the poorly abused girl sleeps with everyone in the city. After that, we have thrown glashed fidelity by touching the little by the public (they know that Jesus wants their life, and even though they respect him, they know they can not give him), some violence between men and women, and many more Steamy sexual images, including - ready to go up? - A black man in a sleeveless undershirt captured by a half-naked white girl at the end of a 40-pound chain. Fill it with the words of authentic Delta Blues, make it a genuine blues picker, use the music as the main healing component of the plot, blues-man Sona House snap clip on both ends and Voila - you have no modern story about Blues. Even the final character of the film is not a character contradiction, but the whole city dances steam dance for hot, messy blues. <br /> <br /> Here there is a dilemma. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable desires, and being healed by the religion and steadiness (and do not forget the chains.) Of Lazarus' (Jackson) house, but then, we are finally seeing Rae gradually being shown at blues. Is it a retrieved, healthy life-style expression, or even more actionable behavior that has destroyed its first place? Brewer wants it both way, but blues does not really mention depression, about gender and violence. I think he gives a healthy expression without unleashing both of the blues (sex and violence). I have a doubt. <br /> <br /> Not for the first time, Samuel L. Jackson played so well that we have forgotten we see Samuel ElJacon; People are incredibly good. He even likes some of his own tunes in the film and his playing is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Richie is generally, this is not good. Estimated, half that his work was done by Costume and there was not his slinky image, but he cynical desires, rebellion, and an extraordinary combination of weaknesses; Bravo to him, he came. I was influenced by the preacher, John Kothran, Junior. I had to check the database for my assurance that he was not a professional actor and a real minister. <br /> <br /> Parents should be aware of what their children bring if they get home. The language is very far from the chart, the first half-hour graphic sex is full, and during filming, women are violating a dozen ways (Lazarus means good and honest, but honesty, chained radiator in a woman?) Plus, Richie spends half of the movie dressed for sex; If you've got teenage boys, they will screen over half of the screen. I do not recommend this for any age children. Just adult, please <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, It is obsolete, but good value of time. And, my goodness, sound track hot.
