A barbarous, illiterate lion has been behind bars for a circus carnival. He suddenly saw a hole in his cell's floor, then his nose was torn into the hole. At first he thought that Bagh Buni's house belonged to the camel; Yet when he awoke from his sleep, he brought him down to the ground, where he met his next coach Bagas. <br /> <br /> If you ever think how Bagh will turn a barbarian lion with a traditional scrat to a Hawaiian hulk dancer, you will see this cartoon. Director Bob MacMimson provided unmatched humor through unreasonable and unexpected protests. The signature scenes are: <br /> <br /> 1 / The look of the house of Bugs Bunny, cross-referencing of the document call, the initials of Bibi in the headboard of the bug's bed. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < > 2 / Bug Bunny is rising uphill with a small flight ground <br /> 3 / When Nero Singh calls his friend elephant for help, bugs use a toy mouse to fear the mouse, because elephants are used to strengthen the mouse. There was a visit to the elephant, as she niroke using a Boom! <br/> <br /> 4 / Bags are becoming the perfect costume and a make-up made with makeup and make-up, and it's a joke of practical jokes. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the 5 / tragedy scene when the bug is followed by the back <br /> <br /> 6 / After the famous Human Canonball scene, Niro Lion begins the Hawaiian hula dance <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > 1 / When the bug goes out of his house, he thinks he is in the Pinoco story; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Lion for so much noise, then found a piece of wood and started singing to make more noise against the iron bars <br /> <br /> 4/carks wearing rubber heels, start bounce like bug toy rabbit and rise Nero Cause! <br /> <br /> These are 10 main reasons why Acrobatie Bondi is named as Bags Bunny Classic and can be found at "Baggs Bani Classic" MGM / USA Video (1989).
