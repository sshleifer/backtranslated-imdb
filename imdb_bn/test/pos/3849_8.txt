"The Aristocats" is the best, classic, classic Disney. It is not considered the most famous Disney-movie as well as the ultimate Disney classic, but it's a well-made and fun movie that must be Disney's classic. "Aristochet" is certainly a delightful of kids, it contains all the elements for a fun kids movie. I like it as a kid. I'm not sure whether this movie is for sure adults, who can see Disney Classic for Nostalgia Khatir, but I still enjoy this movie as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Like the story, "Aristocats" can not be very complicated or innovative, but it does not matter. This movie was created on the time in which the filmmakers followed the policy which characterized the stories and wisdom, which certainly showed "Aristocats". Make a character film; They all have fun, have fun, great lines and have a great interaction with each other. A part to make voice actor characters so attractive (Eva C abor Duchess, Phil Harris, Thomas O'Mallie etc). They were wrongly mistaken because they were Napoleon and Luffyt dogs, because they do not have much to do with the storystoppers and the real story, but luckily they are fun and funny characters and scenes with them pure gold. <Br /> <br /> "Aristocats" are both entertaining and cute, but this is a very funny cartoon. Animation's style and appearance perfectly fits into the film's French surroundings (the city of Paris perfectly looks great). Character animations and designs are great. And the songs are really very interesting. My favorite "Scale and Erepijies", but the title song "Thomas Omelli Cat" and a beautiful song along with the memorabilist show-stuper "Everything Witches to Be Bit". And the score of George Burns is interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Aristocats", in my opinion, is the best Disney cartoon of the 70's and it is a movie that both deserve and remember. So what are you waiting for? Make a profit of yourself and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves to be memories of them.
