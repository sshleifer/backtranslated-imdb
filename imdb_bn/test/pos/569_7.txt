This is an interesting documentary about a 15-year-old black boy who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the murder of the court case. What does this picture show that how corrupt and corrupt American police system can be blamed and how an intelligent fool fools think a black man feels differently and if he is locked in jail then it is torn apart. He said that he was the person who killed my wife. The star defense lawyer who is not only bright in his job in court, but he also did what the police did with him. Interesting thing. 10 out of 7
