Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Vertigo, Old Boy ... You Love Girlfriend. This is a brilliant thriller. The story is so gripping so simple yet. It eventually puts your seat on the edge. Slow moving scenes, simple music movies add more perfection. So genuine it is so genuine Performance is the top quality guideline ... they are very perfect ... if I could put it in the top 10 thriller made. I have seen some recreational thrillers ... ***** / ***** My vote help me to move this film over 250 <br /> <br /> <br /> You like it .. .
