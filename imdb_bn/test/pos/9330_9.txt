Before it appeared on MTV or VH1, it was played on my local theater before the original movie. I remember this short film compared to the movie that I saw this day. This is the first time I was a music movie, but I would like to tell you that if you look at the big screen from 35mm print of a dark theater, it would have a great effect on seeing a blank pans and scan versions at VH1.
