OK, I'm a sucker. I love it I had no expectations and all of them had met. It was a terrible movie. I love it I have been used to wear a DVD from over use. Someone can understand my emotions. I can not say, to tell the truth. Not to be surprised for those who watched the movie, but I asked Clark from the video copy if I could buy a copy and I could have done because the stock was two and there was only one check out and I had more than half the time. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is terrible. Special effects are terrible. Acting terrible, but I like it. The actors were stupid, stupid, fools, countless - capable of being able to see through the monsters, "Araknid" seemed to be made of plastic garbage bags (probably they were), there was underground light, TNT was not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,
