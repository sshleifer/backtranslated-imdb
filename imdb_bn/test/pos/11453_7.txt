A gang of abusive thirteen goes to a former funeral parlor for a Halloween party. They are trapped inside, and they are possessed by the ghosts that have been accidentally awake. Others of adults start killing and are thought to be led by Angela (Mimi Kimcked), who float and deeply voice. The remaining thirteen teenagers are still not forced to save from the demons and try to flee from the house. <br /> <br /> It's a lynn cockle (which has a couple nude scenes normal) gouging a person's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipples. A couple has sex in a coffin and there is a view that a guy got out of his tongue bite. This great movie to see a bunch of late friends at night while eating some pizza. Although terrible acting and shocking dialogue almost destroy it. Overall, I would give it a 7 out of 10.
