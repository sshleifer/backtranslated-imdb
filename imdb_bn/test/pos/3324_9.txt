I feel very strongly that this film was like waiting for Exhale with white women in the 1950s. As exhale waiting, female letters were mixed with men who are not married or well at all. The only difference, in addition to the obvious, was that the film did not have much humor. I would say that even tragic. Only one of the male characters considered to be kind and sincere (people of Hope Lange), but then there was a conflict between this relationship. <br /> <br /> The story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had dreams of success and success. Unfortunately, romance is easy for them, even though they do not seem to be young, intelligent and interesting. With the most tragic part involved in the role of Sujir Parker, this movie can be called Tierjkar, whose ex-boyfriend's emotions trigger tragedy. <br /> <br /> This must of course be seen.
