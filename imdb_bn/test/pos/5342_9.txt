Wallace and the Gromit are pretty much around for some time, but it was onto their first outline silver screen. Supporters of the British TV series like me were interested in seeing them and the film was very good in the theater. The reason is mostly fun and quite original. In a movie like SR Film Shows and Twoy Stories, this stop-motion film is a tremendous trend in children's movies and completely unique as a cartoon. Plus, compared to the previous stop-motion movies (such as movies like King Kong and Ray Harhausen film), the character quality and movement are good for the light years - very liquid, natural and more alive. <Br /> <br /> Along with the quality of the animation, this movie is worth every level. First, the voice actor is a great job. Secondly, this script is very simple but very clever and enjoyable - perhaps with the few bi-entrepreneurs, the kids will probably have to go on top of the head. Thirdly, they do not only make it a movie for kids, but as a film, people of all age groups are neither savvy nor small crowds. In particular, I was captivated by incredibly cute pictures - and especially adorable bunnies. I like them especially in closing credits - which make me very happy I see the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you really enjoy this photo, sticky in the fur. It's fresh, funny and amazing cute. I hope we see a series - and it's saying something like I usually hate the Sequels.
