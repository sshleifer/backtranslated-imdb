I thought it was a pretty good film. It shows that someone grew up in an environment that created rich and powerful people, but unfortunately his ambition and the people around him led to his destruction. It shows that you can not trust any particular person in the world and a person related to sincerity. The character that I liked most was as follows. He was another ambitious, powerful and cruel woman who loved the people of the world and respected Kilo. He knew that business is a business and dangerous one. Whatever he did was risky but got a job. He helped Kilo become rich with his connection. Overall, I really liked this image and my collection has it and waiting for El Padrino 2.
