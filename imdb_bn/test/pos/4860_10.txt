Most people joining this movie will not get any idea of ​​Arthur Miller's novel. It is a novel that should be watched by more people and see how people's lives change. <br /> <br /> At the outset, Lawrence Newman is a common man. The glasses make the changes that his boss has done for him and his whole world falls around him, a little bit. William H. Messi could not have been an appropriate actor to bring this intelligent performance to the screen. He is not only a gifted stage and screen actor, but he introduces honesty behind every character. He is an everyday man caught in his own insecurity. His anxiety is intense when he takes a stand and walks from his job. Suddenly, he was confronted with the things he tried to avoid in the 40th class of Brucelein to avoid the existence of all of his middle class classes. He is Jewish, is not he? This brilliant and atmospheric cinematography film, firmly directed by Neil Slavin, reminded me of some of Edward Hopper's paintings, especially at the beginning of the movie when Newman pushed step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step in a building and shot at night when he and his wife couple Follow with long black shadows behind Ie, the noise and clashes with bullies anticipating. Laura Darn, David Pemmer, and especially the soil loop, who started the incredible depth of the post-violent door, is wonderful, but William H. They are all pale than Messi's starry clock. (H should stand in favor of Hanstr.) If you do not read the book, I would sincerely recommend it because nobody is more real and reliable than Arthur Miller.
