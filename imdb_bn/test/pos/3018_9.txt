When I first saw this movie, I was surprised and I was astonished to see the amazing vibration of this story. It's a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting, not to mention a very nice job in the section of makeup. Jennifer Lopez has dragged herself from the past role excavated in her career with this movie, which portrays a very sensitive child psychologist, who works with a team of engineers, and comets are in the minds of patients to deal with them. Vincent D'Ophrio played surprisingly well. A tragic serial killer was perfect in one of his illustrations. Emotional emotions meant by its performance are wonderful. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but still performs well on exceptional. Symbols and artistry were playful and titleful, sometimes surprising, and other times were frustrating. Overall, I tell it a wonderful movie with nice acting and beautiful artwork.
