This film is the ultimate gold If you do not see it, do not. Mani Ratnam again surrendered herself. This picture introduced me to Nandita Das, even though everyone is burning in this film. My only regret is that I could not find a copy with subtitles in song songs. Our north is led from Sri Lanka's jungle to the peaceful beach of south India, as well as to the final victory of love of human hearts from war terrorism. Beautiful, delicate, malicious, a few hidden wonders awaiting the audience, this movie is seen repeatedly and this story, The Story of the story, is very well done, we can see the scene from the scene drawing a book. Wow See it
