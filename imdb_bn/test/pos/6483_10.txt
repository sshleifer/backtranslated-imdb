I think it's a movie that you love or hate and I really do not want to go for aunty films. My mother rented "Mulhuland DR" on the other night and almost wandered around the house, O But I love this picture. <br /> <br /> We recorded "bit" in one night when we just let the tape run and accidentally got a great movie. That tape saved and saw a lot of it. I finally got VHS to add to my collection. I have seen this many times and at one point I have copied poets. I even tried to preform a scene for my high school drama class. He said, we can make any scenes and only have bad words. He refuses to do it. If my drama teacher may feel bad, it would be good :) In fact, he did not treat me like this. <br /> <br /> I liked acting as it is true and honest. It was clean and smooth but it was better than that. It was the truth of life, how someone actually behaved and how they would show passion without Hollywood. It was a special role, especially a rex playing one. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Characters do not just draw his world but you too are not. Your ideal person does not meet children in the inner city and preserves them through knowledge of knowledge. Just caring and friendship makes things even better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that even in more than 80 years there was gun violence and less common elements like rock throwing, but the absolutism did not hurt a little. <br /> <br /> I think it must be seen. You will love or hate it but it will have any effect and it will create a good movie that you remember and will talk later.
