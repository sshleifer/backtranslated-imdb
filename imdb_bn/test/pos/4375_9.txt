Mr Karlen left our common forum in June 2008 after he went to the hospital to get chest pain (he suffered heart problem). The media, and comics have covered everything else than me or they will ever be expected ... But, he was the grandfather of observational comedy. <br /> <br /> This recording was its last production and it has a great section of death and then the sacrifice of life's possibilities. The filming of the project happened shortly after his seventeen birthday, which he was happy with (observed?). I followed Karlin's career from the days of vague black and white television and enjoyed his epic record album. <br /> <br /> It's a privilege to see Karlin fan at least (if there is no copy). This special show. He was still moving fast, and great time, even 70! As he said, he is not "smile down from heaven". If he does all this, then it is not sending sperms; Probably he is looking for!
