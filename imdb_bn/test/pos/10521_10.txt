Another is that anyone else slipped through the radar. This little b-produced jewel is so full of new ideas in the old style and so completely refreshing and inventive, that a horrific feeling of the lack of kozone in today's movie gradually crosses your body. The final set piece is so innovative in its setting and style that it previews everyone from Tarantino to John W. Oh, and if you think the "dining line" is all cliche, then wait for the FF's dead line. A part of the conversation that laughs at you can take your heart. A true pleasure. Find it and see it. You will not be sorry.
