I'm a 58 year old man In the rainy afternoon my wife said that we see women. After reading the reviews I thought it could be a wake up afternoon. Wrong - my interest from the beginning of this movie has ended. Eventually Meng Ryan was great to see the super looking again. Let's face it looks very good with long hair. Ante Bening was different to me in each of his scenes. Candice Bergen as Carey Fisher, showing her age The girl, played by molly, especially young India. I understood the difficult dialogue in many current films due to the rapid lecture. Clarice Lichmann and the woman in Finland are as terrific as homeowners. The nyc view was nice to see. Oh, and Bate Millena had a small role but it was horrible as usual. So I see this for a look like eyebrows like a 9-friend buddy Eva Mendes flick this chick. It will not be frustrating.
