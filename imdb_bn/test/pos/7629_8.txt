In the 1970s, the film's film "Somewhere There" was one of the films of The Last Dinosaur, especially in Japan's Tokasatsu films, it was exciting for fans. Originally a date for a theatrical release (almost when Dino King Kong was in December) it was suddenly dragged and made in Night ABC movie on Friday night. Ranin Bus-Japan was not unfamiliar with co-productions, there was a gun behind this production, in collaboration with Japan's Tuburia Productions-who brought us the ultra-different ways. Most American cast stars, including late Richard Boone, Joan van Arak and late Steven Kits, have a story of a prehistoric pocket that holds dinosaurs somewhere in the frozen Arctic Circle. It played much more in feelings and speeds like The Land Land Unknown (1956) and The Land Set Time Flowlot (1975). Certainly the dinosaurs were in suites (a trickrope with a knee in front!) But they were protected in such a way that the music and the score became so good, and Cast had done a good job that was not so important to many. We bring on Godzilla. In the overall "big" feeling of the film, it has many classes from Nancy Wilson "The Last Dinosaur" from its first opening image - the location of the hot spring in northern Japan is wonderful and delightful - and the inappropriate feeling it was in Kaiju Iga T-Rex has some amazing set pieces that have "bone hole" and a tracking shot - T-Rexte takes us to deep forests to watch a monster fish from a stream. Tsuburaya's FX people have done their work in style and as well as a few dodgy matte shots, they are good at their work. This film is considered as the best film of 1970's "Kaizu" film, even more than the five Guidilla movies made in the decade. Rankin Bash has produced several co-productions, titled Bermuda depth (1978) and Ivory App (1980) - but the epic poem of this movie was not measured.
