My wife and I support all the positive comments below, made by other IMDB members. Although it hit any box office debris it has all of a special charm of its own. Genuine and heart-warming <br /> <br /> We saw the video at the end of the long day. We were very tired, and in bed. Normally my wife goes to sleep in minutes, that is, until it is an exceptional film and it keeps us entertained to the very end. <br /> <br /> Perhaps among them young people will not like this in the teens and the twentieth century, but for the rest of us it is a true jewel! See it!
