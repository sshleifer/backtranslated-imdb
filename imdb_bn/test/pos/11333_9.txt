How do you describe perfection? Mood of love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong actively dance to the screen and you play the wires with having a few hours after the rest of the theater. Each scene in the film is very similar to the powerful combination of fantastic cinematography and shot selection, top-acting acting, and sensual soundtracks. French Nat's King Cole sings the vocals for the full movie. Maggie and Tony look amazing, with some truly magnificent Cheongsams and Tony always slinking about looking dapper. I saw this movie several times before, and every time I see it, I find new things about me. Love it!
