Just got this mail and I was astonishingly positive. As a big fan of the 70's movie, it does not take much to satisfy me on this type of flickr. Despite the obvious low budget of this movie, acting is good overall and you can already see why Pacey is going to be the greatest actor of all time. I'm not sure how true this film is, but definitely the good contribution in the continuation of this crowd .....
