They had the option of alternatives before the alternative, residents are like a band other, and I love them for them. They have these classics from 'Hello Skinny', 'Third Reich and Roll', to pay tribute to 'James Brown' with 'Great A James Man of Man's World'. But that's just the beginning. As Bonus, Reynolds and Loffees also include violently beautiful songs for swinging larvaes and even features. Not saying, I highly recommend buying this DVD, I would recommend buying their latest album 'Dance Dance Allon Album'. <br /> <br /> Aunt Willie Eye Body # 502
