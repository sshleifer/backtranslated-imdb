When I was five years old, my favorite television show was. I think it was a daily 2 PM channel 11. The show was easy with Carole and Janice as the child's host of television shows. They sing and read our stories as children. It was completed with only 54 episodes, which was broadcast over again. I think Sherlock, tree doll. Show us how to count, add, subtract, and alphabet. One day for thirty minutes, I learned something new with Paula and Janice. I remember those days as a memorable memory and now I hope today's kids can learn to listen to listening stories, cheap props, sleeping horses and easy things to talk to dolls. The set was standard and easy, but it was carol and janice, when it was somewhat valuable. I missed my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the Magic Garden. Life is so easy and good. Now, I hope kids enjoy the show today.
