AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I just like many as a kid. So far, I can not protest to see it, it's a nice and charming movie, just like great animations and beautiful songs. I really miss animation films like Aristocrats, their perfect voice makes it perfect for families which is not hand-written animations. AristoCats was very wicked and cute, the story was just so wonderful. This picture is not only overwhelming, I think the most memorable moment for me was that cats learning to play piano, lull, it was so beautiful with piano playing and painting. <br /> <br /> Douglas and his cats are very painful in their huge palace, mainly because their lady is very rich and they behave like their children. But when the lady thinks that she has time to make her wish, she leaves everything to the cats, or her Butler. Butler gets angry at the street children and gives them freedom in the middle. Douglas and the cats have woken up and returned with the help of a smooth street cat named Thomas O'Mallley, returning to their lady's home, but learned the coolness of the scull cats. <br /> <br /> <br /> AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I think looked a little bit. I would always recommend this movie for kids or family, it can be enjoyed by anyone. Songs and stories are just memorable. I would always join for the best song "Avivvy Cat", such a great tune. I also love the dogs who had abandoned cats, they protected the farm, they were very nice. This is a horror film, please see it, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
