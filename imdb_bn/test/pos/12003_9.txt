Colombo is a lecturer's guest lecturer for a guideline class. Students invite him to join the next class. Nearby parking garage transit, they discovered their regular teacher, next to his car, a dead wound from a shot wound. (No, Colombo was not after a person's job.) As a class project, Colombo involves his fellow students. <br /> <br /> The lecture for the two students, who were known as guardians, was the whole class. In addition, parking garage surveillance camera taps show that anyone other than a professor had entered or later left to think that he might leave the speech hall unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> To restart the routine routine, Colombo pestered by evil (?) duo, report progress and is eager for an ear for their theory. Forensic proof is almost nonexistent. The solution of the case seeks some final and interesting good luck. <br /> <br /> To show first, Colombo has melted the entire culprits wrong; However, when viewing the repetition, reveals the small details that should not be in this case. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This critic did not even go to Colonbo College.
