This movie begins with a great contemporary muted western commitment to all Moody - since the sick seriously open the Flashback sequence anyway. Scenes are beautiful desolate, characters are achingly cut off. Although some of the acting is less credible, the plot eventually dispenses tension and twists enough to make a look at this movie.
