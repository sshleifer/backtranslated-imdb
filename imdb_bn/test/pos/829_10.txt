Well ... it's almost time! Van Dam has returned to this action thriller and kicked her best film in recent years. The plot is not very innovative, but the entire border background theme is attractive and the former marines are cool as a pack of drug smugglers. But what makes this movie extraordinary is Van Mart, doing marshal arts again. His latest films have been more acting based, but in "Shepard", JCVD ​​shows the bad guys throwing and in the nice shape. Some impressive war scenes and Van Damme show that he can still find out the old famous 360-Katie Hill Kicks Having a low budget action movie, it has good sets and great stunts. Van Damme said some ridiculous lines and shows that he is progressing as an actor. I'm glad he came back to deal with some Van Dam ... I was frustrated because of his lack of war in his recent films. Scott Adkins has his role and Van Damme is great and has 1 on 1 end to his end. Overall, it is one of Van Damme's best movies and it will keep you entertained. Rent a JCVD ​​fans. I'm just surpassing my bloodthirsty for other martial arts epics like "Blood Resources" or "Kickboxer". No good
