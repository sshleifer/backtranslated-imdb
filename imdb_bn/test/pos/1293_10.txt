I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theater and I came to see IMDB. I congratulate with a comment from another user, who believes that it is not something special, 6 out of 10 and shocking. <br/> <br /> Now I'm the bright fan of Masterpiece Theater, but stories on television may be a little stupid, for example, "He knew he was right" was absolutely awesome. "Carrier's War," however, perhaps the best I've seen so far is the best. The whole cast is a wonderful job and recently I have seen more than any other piece I am interested in. Character Mr. Yance is of particular interest, and through fine images, for example, a strange birthday cake or a Ganate ring, my opinion about him has really got worse. Really His final death, and everyone around him kept him cold hard man, the story has exposed the bittsweeti in this story for me. <br /> <br /> The end is fun but one in every sense; That's not what they deserve, but overall things work out. I absolutely recommend this to everyone
