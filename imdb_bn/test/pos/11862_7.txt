One of McQueel's wits is one of those movies that starts with a terrible promise, but the movie becomes stupid and it's lost in great time. Liv Tyler plays an impressive woman who tries to touch her with her own body and touch everyone's way, all of which are spelled under her spell. There are some interesting moments, but the film is reduced and reduced by decreasing. A comedy farce Michael Douglas, who played the killer, is just as good as Levi Tyler, though he has seen that he weighed heavily from Armageddon. It's OK, but Love Tyler is just memorable for his car's washing scene, let you know what you'll see when you see it! Shwing !!!!! 10 out of 7 (right)
