I found that the copy of this movie is not very good. It is almost no color in grain and some parts. It switches between the middle of English and French, in the middle and sometimes sometimes in the middle. To make matters even worse, there is no English subtitle in French language parts, which I think is about at least one quartet film. But, surprisingly, the film is still very understandable and even enjoyable, even in this situation, and I think a lot about how well the movie is made. <br /> <br /> This is a top spaghetti Western performing great, an interesting story, and an excellent music score. It's a cool hero, a beautiful dark-haired girl, has some strange character and events, and overall feeling of grief. This image is written on "Euro". <br /> <br /> I hope there is a generation of negative or printed films from a generation because it's a quality DVD release, and when it comes, I get it to be the first one in line!
