All true, this is not really a "movie" as an extended final episode; By this I mean, you did not follow the TV series (Homeside: Street on Life), I suspect you will spend a lot of time after this film for this TV-maker. That said, "Homicide: The movie" is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member will come back, after many absence many people again portray their characters and stop the incredible program. The film depicts the concept of "family" not only in characters but also in actors. It's all very bitter sweet knowing that this last time we will see them all again under the title of threat. According to the story, I found this picture a bit lacking. Guerrilla Mayor's candidate seems particularly prominent, and I think his shooting can be dealt with by him in his regular position parameters. Also, Dig. Belize's ultimate plot twist, which was leaked at the end of the series, was finally resolved, but I, for one, never think that it should be; I enjoyed being left with a mystery (remember that the first case of the first episode has been unsold to run the whole series!). I can love this movie as a developed fan of TV series and it has been made even after the H-Lot is canceled, but I will not recommend it even if the series has minimal exposure. Now, if they release it in the DVD ...
