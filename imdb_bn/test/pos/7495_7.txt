'Thursday' is a good movie, but we are more worried than other types of movies and lack basicity in it. If you watched a bunch of 'GoodFellas', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pull Fiction' and other movies that inspired you from Thursday, you've seen almost every part from 'Thursday'. There is a scene that is involved with torture, even with Lenin's Reservoir Dogs in the same conversation. <br /> <br /> It's still a good movie. Because not every part is taken from the same part, but the whole thing has some new ideas and some nice touch. The opening sequence to start with, quite impressive. We met Nick (Aaron Aaron), Dallas (Polina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They fought with a clerk in a gas station on a cup of coffee and it ended with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a police force. We've already made a lot of suitcases in the market. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He was married to Christine (Palla Marshal) but worked with Nick. He does not know a thing. Then Nick gives him a call and says he's coming. We have learned that he has disturbed his friends and the problems started. <br /> <br /> What would not be right to reveal to me, but we filled up some other characters, everyone was interested in money or drugs. Casey put down the drain <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Well managed by Woods avoided.
