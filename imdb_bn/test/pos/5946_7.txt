Focusing attention on the attention of the attention, again the look of the 1960's detective film, and then how the action was managed again. The room's order in the hotel was hot, and with the introduction of Peter LÃ¶hr, customs were added to the mixture of villains. A big plus: Jeans was a highlight highlighting the dizziness and in the scene he was tied without a shirt. Plus his eyebrows deserve some sort of recognition for doing a great job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Trailer screen is made for "smart drink". The movie looks embarrassingly bad with Lum's efforts to include jokes and gags from TV series. Quite unlike a bomb and relatively fantastic joke and OSS 117's gags, of course, OSS was its share of misfires. However, the overall voice of the OSS was not an insult to the audiences' intelligence, and the material does not seem to be 'muted'. I got a different idea that if I could understand the language, I would have been more lucky, and especially (pistol gag) was confused with the interpretation of the subtitles.
