Wow .... It's been a long time since I finally saw such a ridiculous movie !!!!! I've never been so much scary about the French film, but since I love Catherine Danov's beauty and performance skills I have decided to watch all her movies ... but I do not think it will turn out so pretty as it turned out. I'm lucky, though I had some doubt though bought it! It really is the film with "feeling-good-time" film and quality. Some great social issues and moral dramas that are very close to today's modern living, which are shown very nice and realistic. I like the dance scene in the house of men! But my favorite Catherine Daneuve's glorious endeavor is to sing ... She brings it like that, at the same time, lots of grace and modest ... very tempting! Besides, I want to express my respect and respect for Line Rand, who played a fantastic role (I do not even know that he played .... I have only known him for his music). So, do not wait and go to the movies ... you will be surprised by many ways.
