I was this little girl and saw this movie from New York and reminded me how many good memories were brought back after people came back. This movie is not just about ending a fairy tale but not about the understanding of the struggle of being a good person, woman and supplier Clodine. It kept the welfare system in the mandatory position of women. It was about the injustice of a system that claimed to be attacked and claimed over the family. For this role, Dean Carroll was nominated for the Oscars, and it was great. If you want to enjoy a strong family with conflicting but wonderful binding moments, enjoy Claudine. Your goal as a visitor is to keep an open mind, and understand the overall frustration.
