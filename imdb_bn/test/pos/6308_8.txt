I saw this in an open week this four weeks ago and I did not really know what to expect to be unfamiliar with Sorrenino's work. He has created a very interesting and ultimately running account of a strange character, for which the phrase 'life-alive' is no longer applicable. It stirred me in every turn and I was surprised to be surprised by the story. I enjoyed the pacing and gradually sliced ​​it into pieces to do what was going on. Tony Servillo Fantastic, as Magnani. It opens with a brilliantly stylish wide shot and ends with a very moving image which takes the film to the glorious region. I had a major character and position after a long time and thought about his final fate and I did not shake it for several weeks. I recently bought this movie and the final scene where she thinks she gets me all the time about her friend. I have yet to talk to anyone that has seen this. It is embarrassing that it did not reach to the wider audience as it could be just a good thing to instruct the Italian film.
