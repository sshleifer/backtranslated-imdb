I am glad that he got this part from himself by changing his name from Cage Copola. Light hearty, no deep thought was needed, but an attractive part of the opponents - even though his parents are still hippie ... in the voice of the 80's, in the valley of the valley and on the other side. Cage's talent can be seen at the beginning.
