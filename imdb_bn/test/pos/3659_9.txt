The inaugural night of 'South Asian International Film Festival' (Saiff) in New York was a program that was waiting for many of us. <br /> <br /> I finally see 'Hori Om' ?? I was tired of seeing the linking of Song Angel by Nilin Sohnani in an article "Promotions" in a loop and in the promotional article, I was begging to hear the rest. Was I impressed by visual ?? And looking strange weird how automatic rickshaw drivers will win the heart of the sophisticated looking French tourist! I remember rather curiosity by the theme, when I read a line or two about it in papers, before! Especially, since I was personally fascinated a few years ago, how the rickshaws of Johorpur were! My concern is increasing beyond the theater and theater outside the theater. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time in the theater that Saif's organizers only showed disaster. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed about how severely organized the event was and was found in a difficult place when trying to explain and suggestion to the invited invited (mixed nationalists) invited to the VIP guest list. Did I want to prove to them that Indian movies are not always about Bollywood? Finally and finally, the film started sending our fresh air on our way. Or did I think ?? Hari Om ?? Begin with chaos and sound. Autorickshaws honking, a whole lot of traffic and chaos. I found my smile because I think inside of the house is inside. <br /> <br /> How did Hari Om start the journey? An autorickshaw driver in Jaipur? The director can not make a good casting call with this character. From Mansoon to Hari Om ?? Bijay Royaj, despite his heroic looks, took the film on his performance skills and his attention on the character, with all the rickshaw drivers' speeches in Rajasthan. He is a winner in all the way. But how and where he learned to speak in English, the question is still! However, the beautiful shadow image of his character humor and sensitivity. I love her innocent pictures from a village a simple guy ?? Which day is there a great desire to be famous? But to know when the reality will be spent <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's funny, anyone really think of excessive care about her dress . She looks very very pretty though! Especially after the next half of the movie, when he changed the Indian dress. His relationship with his boyfriend seems very unclear though. It probably touches the reality of certain types of relationships. <br /> <br /> This movie takes us to the most beautiful part of Rajasthan ?? The surprising part is that any place is actually portrayed as something other than that. You see the dirt, you see primitive houses ?? The only way you see Rajasthan! Yet Is it the only one adjective that leaves you with it ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the first director who can possibly portray India - how can it be portrayed as dirty, voiceless and negative about India? It still seems to be one of the most beautiful places <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I find it rather slow in some part ?? But rest assured that you will never bored. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A very important time in the movie played the song "Angel", it matches perfectly with the visuals . <br /> <br /> I also heard that in addition to the main character, all the other actors are actually ordinary people who never encounter the camera before !! It is worth considering, our so-called established actor ?? Still realistic characters on the screen can not be painted. <br /> <br /> Everyone had a nice experience watching this movie ?? It is a pot pourri of passion. It got romance, humor ?? Reality ?? Beautiful visual and location ..., great music, a great cast ?? A package agreement! When I left the theater - I felt proud to be Indian ?? After a few days, I asked one of my Bulgarian friends, did he watch a movie with me, if he wanted to see other Indian films? And his reaction was ?? "Is it better than Hari Om? If it is, then I will go?" If not, I think I will pass. From now on, I will be a benchmark for every Indian movie that is for Hari Om. " Mr. Bala, what are you reading?
