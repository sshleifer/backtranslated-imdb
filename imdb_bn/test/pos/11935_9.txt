This is one of the best "block" films since the early 90s and a little dated time, a movie that will not be made today, which makes it special! In fact, a very similar movie called "Masterminds" was created out of 90 and it is a PG in the same theme. There were variations, but it was not realistic or realistic for that fun. <br /> <br /> So what's so special about this film? It is among the main characters and comrade among the movies of all the victories in the film. San Austin is very fond of and has played most of the 80/90 memorable movies, especially "The Gonis". He goes on to do more with the "Rudy" and "The Lord of the Rings" tragedy, but there is a good trip under the "Encino Man" memory lane. With "stand by bye", it provides excellent support to the film and Andrew Devoff is a terrific villain. Louis Gossett Jr. is to sleep in his role, but he adds some contraction to the film, especially his relation with Aussie's rebellious nature. <br /> <br /> How can it work? According to today's standards, it is rather tedious and cheap looking, almost like a TV movie, but production values ​​are good and violence is actually quite bad for a film involving school students. However, the director is ready for a limited budget with some pretty suspicious moments and well-laughed. <br /> <br /> Park your brain at the door and enjoy this memorable work, but do not expect Oscar stuff!
