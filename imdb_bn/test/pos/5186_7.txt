This is a disaster movie set in London. Many hurricanes, superstorms and tornadoes in Scotland were replaced in the east, on the east coast of England and later in the south. After heavy hours of heavy rain, Thompson is less than running the London barrier, and it protects the path of disaster. Then a huge tide-wave of the east became devastating towards the east and millions of londars lives in danger. In the center of the story, a climate expert (Tom Corten) is a climate expert who is trying to protect London from the influence of giant waves, trying to convince the authorities that walking in the city was unsafe, even then a Marine Engineer (Robert Carle) and his ex-wife Samantha ( Jaslien Gilesg). They are trapped in the barracks and are thrown into the sea. The Secret Office of Chief Executive Officer (Demo Sochet), ruled by Nash (Joan Haley) directly under the command, is very isolated and efforts to avoid more death, about 200.000 They have a little time to protect London from total disaster. <br /> <br /> Playing well is absolutely acceptable play-disaster. A climate expert in the cosmic Tom Court, who predicted disaster and excellent Robert Carlyle and Jaslyn Gillesgang to revive their love as a former marriage. This film has a special effect on terrifying computer generator special effects, like the 'Earthquake, Info Towering' as well as the classic 70s like 'Armageddon and the day after tomorrow'. While not explicitly denied, we know that floods are caused by greenhouse effect and global warming which produces ozone cavity. The motion picture is well managed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this movie to people like Disaster Films. Other adaptations of the flood are the following: 'Flood (1976)' directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Kulap and Barbara Harisi; Mickael Salman's 'Hard Burn (1998)' with Michael Fliman and Christian Slater; 'Flood:' a river (1979) 'directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
