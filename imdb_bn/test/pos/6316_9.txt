There is a movie that is not a different version of another, a resurrection, but it's not like others. Although it talks about mafia but it appears in other ways and often it seems to be only a secondary theme. I went to see the movie (because the theater of others was full) and I was finally satisfied. It surprised me because of my black satire or atrocity and has more interesting items for analysis. It does not follow the film's classical means, it is just different and I think it is not the only way to choose it. I was very happy because Italian, and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers were not bold enough to change the theme. You can also see new Italian styles in this movie but not blocked in the clich√©s. I hope to be understandable enough, I know it's hard, I hope this movie can be exported from our borders, it's a good product to export. I would also like to point out the song, a very good soundtrack, the film needs its due to its long silent break and they are completely covered by that music. Many congratulations to the director, and thank you, movies need these movies.
