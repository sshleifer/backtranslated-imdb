I love that movie between you. A movie that really feels weak, when it is rare and such movies are rare. <br /> <br /> There are so many talented and versatile ways to write and interpret various characters in the Danish screen. This movie has a cut edge on it. Throwing for a low budget such as a major flow Why do so so much money with so much money to work with a man with so much merit and charisma (not to mention sexual appeal outside other actors) ????? This actor really believes in the raw talent as his script and a director, writer and actor. I'm so glad to know such a modern day genius, the passion for the art industry to drive him and take as an audience with us. Damian I've heard you through many different circles and do not let the world's jealous people come to you. Martin gets this, Fellini got it and you will always get it. We like to see fire and passion in your screen. Thanks for being different and have the courage to write like you. You are a kinda director, you do not listen to empty ships.
