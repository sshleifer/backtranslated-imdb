1983 was the "war of bond". That year, Roger Moore and San Connery acted in two different James Bond films, produced by "official" producers of ex-bond films, and were produced "occasionally" by a group later (sometimes not again). Under the leadership of Kevin McClory, who was the author of the film Thunderball. Wonderfully enough "unauthorized" film is good, despite the obvious flaws and the fact that sometimes it is sometimes a rebuilding of the Thunderbolt. <br /> <br /> Sometimes do not say that there is a difference in the playing of the game. The best bonds ever combine for a bond film. It starts with San Conny, 1971's diamonds are back for the first time ever to play in the band. Connie could be big then he was then but he looks good here then he has forever in diamonds. Never say no, never again, sometimes with a few years old love. No Or interesting and dangerous shark of Russian love. The delivery of one liners and connery of dialogue was as dead as dead. Connery's age is a negation of her credibility, especially when it comes to women in film. Let's face it with Kaneri, even in the upper body shape, it seems strange to Moore when she is giving bed to a half-old woman. Yet despite this credibility, Never Say Never Again, Cheney looks at one of her best bond performance and shows a specific improvement between her two previous bond performance. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger played Domino among his first film roles. Basinger plays a role with enough confidence for a relative new comer and he makes the character credible. Basinger owns his co-star against himself and has enough chemistry with him. In fact, he can outshine his Thunderbolt counter-part operated by Clauden Agar. <br /> <br /> Maximilian Lerago, also played by Claes Maria Brandouir, is also famous. Everything from BrandWire's Largo should be the villain of James Bond's film: Souvev, charming, wicked, and above all trustworthy, someone less. Brandwire's role makes realistic and does not like to fall into the trap, many other Bond villains are heading to the top. Brandu's 007 has played a silent hazard and ruckus in many opponents, with Largo playing. <br /> <br /> Expanded as well as excellent cast supporting cast. Barbara Carrari Fatima creates a fine chicken of blas and when she appears, the screen is bright. Max Van Saido as Blackface is a nice look, though its appearance is as much as a camio. Rooney Atkinson has created a look that is an abstraction of bonds that make up for the best scenes in the film. The Cast Highlight comes from Edward Fox's M66 staff, which ends with the wonderful article of Alk McQueen Lee, Pamela Salem's cake cut, peeper salem and a piece of cake into pieces. There are two mafia as Barney KC, like Phoenix Litter and Gavin and Herlihie, though both Jack Perchechi feel lack of credibility in their respective land. Otherwise, this film is one of the best casts for a bond film. <br /> <br /> The film has many more essential elements at the top of a great cast. During the Battle of Scrabills and Motorbike Chase in the Battle of Srablands from the opening Central America sequence, it is a film where Action Sequences are not only great but also provide the plots for the most part. The image is a cruise missile model, explosion, and all we hope from a bond film, special effects in all areas. Everve Karsner, then he's backing Empire Strike freshly, especially with footprints of atomic surgery and cruise missile sequences in the direction of the film. <br /> <br /> This picture is far from perfect. With the strong use of computer sand video games of the 1980s, sometimes the most of the Bond films can not be said. After a period of time, a movie date appears, especially on cruising missiles and the hijacking sequence, depending on the movie, it is incredibly visible in a quarter of a century after it was released. The script is also damaged by the prediction of thunderbolt. <br /> <br /> However, sometimes the script is never quite good to say sometimes for its prediction. The script is good conversation scenes, not suitable for any single crunching (how much can you say among any Roger Moore era scripts?), Some interesting situations, and most of the time to see it and frequently. Once you have seen that it is a matter of rebuilding, there are several good things in the script for the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is actually the biggest weakness. Because of the "unauthorized" status of the film, the James Bond theme could not be used. It says that it can be seen with the right musician that it can work without the band score. Unfortunately, Michael legrand scores are far from enough. Legend score is completely transferred to a bond image and it is actually two or two places where it works. To make things worse, the film has grown taller with the worst title sequences to satisfy the James Bond film. <br /> <br /> Despite the extremely predictable, somewhat predictive and bad scores, do not say again, still a good bond film. This film proves that "unauthorized" is not a bad thing, among the best customs of a bond movie, good action sequence, good special effects, good direction and some great conversations. Actually it is better than the winner of Octopussy and "Battle of Bond".
