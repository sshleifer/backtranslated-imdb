It's ready to prepare it in the 1980's and the Terra MacDonald McGhee is ready to prepare for such a terrible old house, which is frustrating. After an incomplete conversation on an ugly board, after making a mistake, the children were forced to beat a retrograde demon for revenge, who killed all their friends one by one. Sound familiar? It is supposed to be. It clearly comes out in the market to pay tribute to classical 80's sloglers: "Violence, lazy nudity, Zero budget." <br /> <br /> Do not get enough; It's pure entertainment! I enjoyed the fun and fun poked ways at it all awful clich√©, but at the same time this time the fun of the movie was embraced. With this movie you will find something you never met with the old slash of 80: good acting. The entire cast was very talented and you do not see too much in any less budget flicks, either recent or otherwise. There was a lot of chemistry in the letters. I was very humble in the whole film, and I fully believe the writer / director and cast a long way in their separate career. The script was written very well, and the conversation flowed naturally. <br /> <br /> The effects were somewhat amateur and the scenery was not well lit, but the film admitted in its cover that there was not any budget, I already know this going. This film simply ignores its faults and makes it easy to sit and enjoy easily. Although it is not an Oscar award winning artist, it never claims and supports it. This is a lot of fun. If you like slashhers, you'll really appreciate this film. If you like blood and boobies, then you will appreciate it.
