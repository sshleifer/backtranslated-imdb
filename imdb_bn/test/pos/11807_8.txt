There was nothing else on TV in the afternoon yesterday, so I thought "OK, let's see." I did not know the plot and I had no expectation, I was thinking in a few minutes or I would again surf the channel. But then the stories begin to reveal, and the characters played beautifully by two boys. The story was unrealistic part and scene, but overall it was a real good movie. Observers are very good value.
