I love the absolutely promised land. I saw the first episode, when I was in my mission since 2003-2005. I really liked the background of the rich families shown on the show. Here was the family struggle, but instead of having them; They can reach out to others, who can face the same problem, try to forget themselves and go to work. Do this show because I fell in love All actors; Especially Gerald McRani; The real meaning of "family" has shown that has kept an uninterrupted mark on my life. I've gone down the same road to them, but it has been allocated for me during that time to develop the character. I love this program so much that I wanted to share with friends; But when I heard that it was removed from the air, I was really surprised. I thought and still think they would have to bring it back! So many lives can benefit from the inspired media of heaven. I honestly believe that this show was inspired by God; Because it brings soul when I only see one episode once. This show really defines what a "promised land" really (in my book) is. This is love that you hold in your heart for others; Which brings you to a high destination. The soul of love, one of the most powerful messages in this series, and what I can say is, bring it back. -Robert
