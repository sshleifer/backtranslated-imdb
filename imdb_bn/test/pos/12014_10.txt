During the movie Night Crossing 1961-89, the feelings of the vast majority of East German felt. I lived in West Berlin for most of 1967 and used to travel through the wall in East Berlin in the weekly bar. Why? Crossing the border in the Soviet-ruled country, facing the smell and feeling of East Germany, due to which the Night Crossing is excellent, it captures the feeling and it is exciting. Vopeos arrested me at the checkpoint Charlie and a man with his skin coat and dark glasses caught me, I believe Stasi. When I see the film, I can smell the cheap diesel and cooking oil, I can see the old vehicles, the habitat of clothing and the shops in the store window. It brought back memories of how lucky it is to live in a free country. In 1988, I traveled from east to west, from north to south, DDR. East Germany changed slightly since 1967. Tridents were constantly broken, still there was the main vehicle for personal motor vehicles, shops still did not show much to lure me, the uniforms were still common, but the people, the common man was open and you got to enjoy their trust once nice. Watch Night Crossing, near the truth like any movie seen in Germany, cold in the Berlin and spy funeral came down.
