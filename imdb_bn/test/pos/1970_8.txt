I saw this movie twice and its theme is a strong one. I have been on a computer for many years now and this movie has inspired me in the technological sense, such as a new love that floats my poetic emotion on a fireplace. The very basic idea, it's a great expression that holds you back, it tells the story of the mind that it is necessary to release the reality of every day of this life.
