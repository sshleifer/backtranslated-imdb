PlancktonRule comments are definitely written on Topsi-Turi Day, because everything mentioned by the simple life form is the opposite of the truth! <br /> <br /> 'Sunny Blubber's Eighth Wife' In every scene, cheerfulness could not be better in Calabar - Colbert and Cooper ... supporting Cast is excellent. <br /> <br /> Writing and direction is great! <br /> <br /> Like many other comments, I started crying on this board, "Why can not that movie be anymore?" <br /> <br /> It's the classic paramount 1930's sculble comedy best, folk!
