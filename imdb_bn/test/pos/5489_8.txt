Wolfgang Peterson in the line of fire shines and occasionally a truly white walk, even once or twice we can remember that we've been on the same street before. When Clint Eastwood closes his western heritage book (perhaps) closes his right detective picture (not counting the blood work there), then no one can do that. But there is more to it because the character of Eastwood, hard and hard-working like a harsh, busted, nude secret service agent, has some charming aspects, even a romantic aspect that can never be seen in pictures spouted its trademark line. There are some complications that just do not depend on normal dispersion and how it is appropriate for a story of a potentially transformed person (Kennedy is not saved from killing in 63), some of his credibility, which most likely conceals his wounds - most of the time . Eastwood himself goes to the city to give a great appearance in the film, but in this situation his character is made for him. <br /> <br /> However, the risk of the part of the film may be slightly widespread (we still consider her 'Harry' print scenes more efficient - and smart-as-room as well as everyone else in the room, and romance and the parent By talking about here), including protecting a president who (wisely) we do not really see or know at all. Some romantic sub-plots, which are undercooked for some machismo laughs, the picture will be made in a small sub-par if another quasi-Dirty Harry aspect does not come in the picture: An incredible villain. At this moment there are some additional Hollywood suspensions, but with the character of "John Booth", Jolie starred in Oscar nominated by Malcolm Vichy, intelligent intelligent suspense (almost efficiently than the rest of the film), which is described more as a hunter than a murderer. It may be wrong with Eastwood's character, but Malkovich has probably made some of his former villains competing in a very cool and undecided (perhaps the devastating, crooked scenes where he kills the Bank Taylor and his roommate). As it has been published in its past, the element of 'what's with this guy' keeps viewers and Eastwood Agent's estimates and extra paranodes. This is a classic Malkovich performance, spontaneously vague and always measured at the level of dementia and professionalism. <br /> <br /> It's just about creating a smooth picture from Peterson and company as well as the spunky decorations of this beautiful Don Siegel are realistic around. But Pietersen also took cinematic tricks several times, which was in my sleeve, which I was crying occasionally; Anyone who has such a great but exciting tribute at Vertigo at any time - running out of the roof on the roof, the hero is jumping from the blurry, 'Twist' - it still provides some shawl under my spine. There are phone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we saw the depth of cats and mouse games, probably another kick on the PC in Hitko. But in the end, even with all the tensions and cruel hazards and ultimate extremism, it even has a character picture in some ways, and everything has been grossly appreciated so that the audience can be fined for finishing, at least Susense-movie ideas. A great lead of Eastwood, Rousseau plays a sincere and mature female potential love-interest, and the leader of Malkovich pop. There are also some notable helpful roles and there is a fine studio score there. One of the best 1993 films.
