I would say it was a letting down. The Aparna army is the best way to see the way to handle the problem of schizophrenia, I am not very knowledgeable about this and it portrays a beautiful mind, and here its interesting illustration. <br /> <br /> The thing that happened to deteriorate for me was the use of artificial dialogue and English. It is true that the new class is created / made in India which speaks at home even in English, but I am sure it is not as formal as the movie itself. Moreover, Waheeda Rehman did not feel comfortable speaking everything in English. Bihari tone Charu's conversation was apparently much more realistic and preferred. Second, he tried to give the movie about his abstract smell. I usually liked the movie with the open end, but here was a lot loose ends. His cut pieces were combined together to create a movie. Also the movie takes no central theme. Schizopharia was definitely the main line, but sister-sister, contact with mother-daughter, doctor-azmi relationship, brother real use, Bose-Bose's wife relationship ..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
