My sister and my cousin (female) forced me to watch this chick movie. I do not like to see such a movie, but it was not really bad. I do not want to see this movie, but after watching it I was not saying it was bad, not just my kind of movie. It really was right about talking about something and working in specific situations. As a man, I was not amazed by the joke, but women were sure women. They were interesting about movies related and yes it was great to see themselves on the big screen. "Oh I'm GE, what I wanna say" I have never seen the original, nor do I care. If you are a girl, it must be seen, but perhaps this movie of women probably will be sucked. I can not see a 13-year-old man, "Wow, I think I'm running at the age of 30." <br /> <br /> No one can gather there, but I can not say that it was awesome, so please.
