My kids like this movie. We found it every opportunity we saw it. It was fun to have a fun movie. We saw it as a family and each of us enjoyed it. This is a movie that you can see without an uncomfortable stain that you have to explain to the children. My boys love this movie and they want to be able to see it again. Even after all these years, they remember. That was Amy Joe Johnson a very tricky girl. All of my boys crushes on him. They liked him as Pink Power Rangers, so we saw this movie started. (Like you can say I'm annoying to fill the lines). But seriously it's a fun movie and watching observers. Please give us a DVD or replay of Disney!
