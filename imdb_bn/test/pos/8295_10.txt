I liked this movie, it was a great screenplay for a family, those who shared it up and down, but ultimately they knew that they knew each other special love. I have seen many movies by playing Jacklin Smith, but my god is his best, even though it came 12 years ago. There was an all-star cast in this movie, and the more I liked was that it was open in front of my eyes other actors who I had not seen before. This movie had a long length, but I enjoyed it every minute. This is a movie that you can sit and watch with your family, although in spite of the intimate love scenes, our kids will have to cover the eyes several times. Overall, I rated 10 of the 10 ratings for this movie. Lifetime is not enough in the air, so if someone knows what a store sells, then I have to let it know because it is definitely there.
