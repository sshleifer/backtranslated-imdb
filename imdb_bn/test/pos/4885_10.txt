Now I have seen several episodes of the Leg of Gentleman before me, which I think are enjoyable. When I took the film, I was not sure if I knew enough about the series, the boy was wrong. It's one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen, and the troupe of the lounge makes the film. It helps at any time using a very nice and funny plot as well as a few letters because it does not make much confusing, which destroys the film. Even if you never see the trail of gentleman getting this movie, it will make you laugh and it's a movie that will be seen once and a nice movie to watch with your friends. It's really a 10/10 review in between.
