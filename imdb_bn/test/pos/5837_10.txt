Oz is my favorite show all the time without a doubt! The best word to describe it is "talent"! Writing, acting, story lines .. Everything about this show is absolutely amazing! <br /> <br /> I just invented the show and I made it addict and I was really surprised that it did not get real recognition. It's violent, and most of the letters are not for your liking, but the display is written in a great way that allows you to find out the violence and the criminals and see them as their real people. This is the lowest size, but it still allows you to understand many characters and even take care of their stories. <br /> <br /> The violence that needs to be done is as realistic as possible, but the show is not about some violence that some people might believe. This is really a work of art and I am sure that whoever gives it a chance, I love as much as I do.
