The film was based on the real story, of course, more realistic experiences and the film's basic theme focused on the audience. The story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps visitors from figuring out the last times all the time. At one moment you think something will happen on coach Jones or on the radio. Well, but that's not what you expect. <br /> <br /> This image is annoying or too sensitive and the best of Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Junior acting performances are my best. Opinion The last keeps a long lasting smile on your face and surprises if you are right about what you are doing. Well guess what I was trying to do Michael Tolen and Mike Rich. First-class movies. <br /> <br /> Ascorn Norwich birch Denmark
