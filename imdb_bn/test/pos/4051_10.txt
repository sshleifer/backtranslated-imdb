In the mid 80's / 80's, in the title titled "Bubblegum Crisis", he made his debut in the video of an OV anime (which I think the military slang term for technical equipment Hiery), has received inspiration from "Blade Runner", "Terminator" and even "Robocop", even with Batman / Bruce Wayne's little dash - Iron Man / Tony Stark and Charlie's Angel May Energy was thrown for good measure. The 8th episode, the overall story was in 21st Century Tokyo, Japan, 2032-2033, living machines in bumar are manual work and sometimes causing problems. Improved police (edicts of the Shari'i Police) were formed to handle a special, swat boomers like the branch of law enforcement agencies, but in most cases it was not effective, but millions of scientists, Sylhet Stingrayi scientist, who made Bumar, created four. To fight against the bumars, to fight against the tough corporation producing hard-working surgical (hard-suits) and boomers for war criminals, GENOM The group became known as Night Sabe and the Ring Leader Syller, as well as the Insurgent women, included an angry rock and roll glass with emotions for motorcycles and embarrassment for the police, its angry-tag band Prasees Asagiri, Lina Yamasaki, walking through eyes and boyfriends for a penny Aerobics instructor on travel, and a young man and an expert at ANP Iutara hacker (Long line first) romanabha took. Xenon, in the midst of it, quincy represents, who is a tall, gouted elderly man who owns the company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (3 episodes) and a boring man named Largo. Among other characters, Leon McNicole and Deli Wang, two Eddie police detectives (Leon Spin-Off / Prikel Anime, "Eddie Police Files" which I heard were very dark), their balling, overweight boss Chief Todd, Sylare's younger brother, Mikey, and Dr. A funny little mechanic known as Ren√©, which clearly helps to maintain suites in Sylhet. In addition to Night Sabers and Eddie VS VS Genom as a whole, there was also another story about a friend of Liner, who apparently had a daughter in a big crime family, tried to utilize the annoying Largo Gnom and used a small character story for various pre-wants-revenge. Oh and I have mentioned that Sylaya gave herself to be a boomer? <br /> <br /> Well, it was a great watch, chaos and greatness and even some very nice pop songs, but it was without its flaws, some unfortunately, after the episode 8, the series was closed 13 T was planned for episode. So stories of Largo's schemes (or schemes), Linner's unfortunate friend's family, and Sylhet's source stories were not solved. There was another problem with the series that Pris was the most popular character, so a good part of the series focused on him, and, unfortunately, most of the PRICE-based episodes focused primarily on the process and wanted justice / retaliation for someone self-controlled. The secondary character who had not appeared before but had been a friend, but he rarely left his way to Night Subers, who was always taking him out of trouble and for some reason he was very good for his recovery. (Although being fair, he went to rescue 7-inch Linna, and his boyfriend was killed by a boomer and worked incorrectly in the ADP investigation). This means that we could not focus on the more interesting stories of Sylhet, Nanay and Linne's daily antics. Linna had two episodes adapted around her, which was related to her friend with the Mafia family, when Nene had hijacked the last episode for herself, which showed that she did not have a truly happy soul, and not fornication. Nine was also forced to use his computer skills well, or sometimes he only acted as a loving cave, which kept his screen time and character's development a couple of times than poor Linnah, which was often pushed into the background with him. Greed and its tendency to eat boyfriends get no attention. Do not make me wrong, I like it and I love its overall concept, but it makes me a little bothered. It is also one of its runner-ups for the "Greatest English Voice Dubbing" feature, which means you'll be better off in Japan. Some voices were right (some really match them with their character) but others were just flat and innocent, or in the case of Priss, really overacted. <br /> <br /> Well, Tokyo 2040 comes along and tosses all that many out of the window. Set up a few years ago, the story here is that when Tokyo collapsed after the earthquake, the genomic Boomeras rebuilt the city as the oldest heaven, Boomers still have the tendency to blow the handle, which Eddie requests for the formation of the police. Being made of Night Sabers. So the overall story is the same, but the retrograde character and the appearance and attitude of characters have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Originally Sylayer had small red hair and brown eyes, usually dressed like a harsh, right business woman and was away from others. In 2040, he found another super-model face, white hair and blue eyes, which changed depending on the light, blue and purple from silver to silver, and eyes sometimes violet or gray. , And in 2040 Sylhet is a mentally unstable woman, who stops the handle if not public, and is probably more secretive than before. Sylela does not take the risks of the war zone, he lives here because he is here, but when he wants to fight, he wars. <br /> <br /> 2) Originally Priss was a small woman with an Afro and a really bad mood, always picking fights with those who bothered her, always biting off more than chewing, etc. 2040 Priss, Clint Eastwood Loner has gone the way too cold, very emotional and emotional remotely (you can say like the original syllay), so he is not really connected to anyone. His hair is more stiffy and like a cat (a big improvement) and "matrix" from the trinity like the skin. (Unfortunately, when the author expressed his reasons, he had finally ended her.) The ADP hated. <br /> <br /> Linen's big black hair was going for her, but now her hair is small, brown and good. , Like 90 2040 Linna is an officer who is a bad luck with sexual harassment. As apologizing for the way OAV writers were treated, the 2040 writer actually sent the first 6 episodes to Lina, wanted to write him as a new girl in the city, but was determined to meet Night Saber and win a spot with them. Which he did last. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a small red-haired girl, who often laughs and consumes candy in large numbers, is now taking a little blonde-haired girl, who likes to wear tees and ADP detective Leon McNickel (OV for her Revenge for revenge on her?) And other characters, even her sister-in-law Lina and Mikey, a shot shot in Sylhet's "brother", with which she debuts. Kiki and arrogant, he is still quite a candy and a hacker hacker, but eventually he is separated from his comic release status. Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a deceptive man with a long, long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul from the TV highlands), he is from the old series. Renen replaces and now works as a partner in Sylhet's hard suites. Nigeloy is the lover of Sylhet, but you do not know this because of her lack. He is a consultant to his father / older brother / Mac. <br /> <br /> 6) Leone and Deli come back, but it's different. The original Leon was a tall boy, which was made of backland hair, blue eyes, black leather jacket, a back belly player behind the tight blue jeans, and always carries a revolver which can wax more fold than the haljer; He was frustrating when he was not really bad guy, but he did most of the humorous acts, as he tried to follow the princess romantically (exactly what he had seen in it was mystery), but occasionally he and Deli as important plot point information guide Served The original Deli was also a fairly muscular red head dressed in pink / purple suits, because he was suddenly a lesbian sex character who always hit Leone without providing important information. In 2040, Lyon is no longer a beautiful boy, but rather typical tough person type, black black hair, brown eyes, long and big muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dancer (after that he actually looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger). Or perhaps Colin Farel, or Hugh Jackman), and he still carries a revolver, a big one, but it's not as strong as before. Although the 2040 Leone still has a bit of an attitude of probation (especially in the process), but it is not nearly as risky as the old series, but she has a bad attitude and she took it easy and bothered by Deli. (He's got too much coffee way). Oh, and Leon still priss afterwards, but he has so much luck in this time around. Deli, tall, tall (but not as tall as a lion) red rimmed glasses, white suit, green eyes and light brown hair with a more mature looking man, and he carries a big machine gun (he actually thinks X-Men film James Merceden); In 2040, Deli was much more efficient and more powerful than OA.A. and although it was not quite clear, her homosexual tendency almost completely disappeared, she felt that in a moment of jealousy she was asking about the process e-mail about Leon. br> <br /> 7) Brian J. Messon ("J" stands for what?) Has returned, and so quincy, but Mason is much more than the main villain here, as quincy co-villain because he is no longer a huge figure of terrorism, but a plant in which the batteries and cables There are bunchs. Mason has now dropped sports instead of black hair instead of brown hair, as he did on OAV (he actually looks like OAV Leone in the case), and he is much more than the villain school in Alan Rikman School. <br /> <br /> Although one of the first series is distorted, in 2040, Mikey is no longer a distorted. Of course, there is a lot about McKee in 2040, but they will not be published here. <br /> <br /> 9) Syllier is now a companion, Alfred-de-Butler, who is worried about her and gang, Henderson. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, blairs were like replicas of "blade runner". Armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040, they are more of the fool-on-the-rapage type. Most of the time, they are doing bigger robots (heavy labor, war, cleanliness, etc.) and they tend to be "distorted", which means that they are developed and in a demonic process. <br /> <br /> What is the theme of humanity? What is the theme of the visa technology (the machine has the soul?). Sadly, this series, although animated and well-written, only manages 26 episodes, so it can move faster than one, especially those of us who are used in many seasons of our most favorite characters, and unfortunately it ends with uncertain story bit (which I will not be here to discuss.) This shows what the show saves and how it builds on a steep Hunter, but the letter They make you more of this program, to avoid skulls, colored castles, stoic loaners, psycho women, genocidal men, rough neck policeman, psychic intellectuals, intelligent old sage, and loving innocent, much more diverse than before and stop many games. Enough is enough to expect. <br /> This is not cool, but it's a good watch. Also the English dabb (by ADV) is quite good, though not without some flat stain, but of course it is better than the original cube.
