I'm not the biggest fan of the west. Although my two personal choices are orphanages and tombstone. Although this movie, I like! It was a lot better! The plot is well done, and it was a fun movie. Everyone who participated in this movie has done wonderful! I think even someway both beat out the movie. Well, not really unforgiven because it was a fantastic movie that can not be compared with these two long runs. I do not think it's beat though the tomstone. Both were powerful points. For example, they were both excellent well-known cast, very well plots, and very good filming. But Possas, in my opinion, defeated Tomston in four ways. First, the character was more unique in Posse. The song Posse was good. The idea is in Pacey, in contrast to Vaat Arpe. And the biggest difference, the verb verb! O my Lord! Posse was a Western with really good verb sequence. I mean really good! The action was fast paced. Like the modern day-based shoot'em-up movie There was a big budget explosion! Fistfights were very good. Mario Van Pebbles This movie was great! I recommend buying this nice movie!
