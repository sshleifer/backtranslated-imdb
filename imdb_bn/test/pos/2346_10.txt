I have to say one of the best movies it has seen so far for Naruto. It was much better after the first movie because it had more battle scenes and it came to you at a fast speed. It was amazing, the characteristic was excellent and mostly visual effects. <br /> <br /> The story line is something new for Naruto. But it's basically the same as the first movie. In Syria, you see them fight against other Nijonas, but in movies (1 + 2) you see them fighting against mass destruction machines. It was nice to see Nija fighting with something else, and it was good to get something else after the round. And how to fight other people from other lands across the sea. Saqura was finally killed by someone more powerful than him. (He has become really strong) It was a lot better after the series in Philars, which I now see. When you watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound. With the new Jutas and Gara in the movie, you know well. And the music was well alongside, but I find something to lack it. But the last theme song was a plus. (dind dong dang) I think there was really a good song. I really recommend it. <br /> <br /> I can give this picture to everyone 10 because I love it. If you decide to see it, enjoy it. Hah hah
