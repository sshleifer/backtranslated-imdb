Which I like. Gus as Steve Jhan, part nails, copy of the Robert Duvalls approach which makes Gus fans comfortable considering him. (Some other actors copy their predecessor style to this series). Karl Urban looks terrible and tough, but a joke and smile can crack too, which T.L.Jones did in the original series. Gear, gun, dress, all right, or near the time is very accurate. I will not forgive the counselor and Duval for keeping the Nylon Larriet in their chakka at the open range. Components, they are actually awake riding, instead of hiding a modern Saddle under Navajo blankets. And they are not politically painted as loving pastoralists loving true peace, but as a proud fighter man. There are some mobile phone views, but it's beyond the diversity of something stupid to win a million dollar Reality game show.
