I like this show. I was waiting for the DVD to come out .... It never happened. Does anyone know how to get a DVD show? I have contacted Lifetime TV and a few and nothing else. Please let me know if there is a way in which this series can be on DVD I think it will be the first to purchase line. I really got hooked on this show. I do not understand how a bunch of other TV shows are available in the DVD but there is no day. I'm sure there are many of us who want to keep this series in DVD or even VHS. I thought of contacting the production company. Has anyone else tried to contact someone for this information?
