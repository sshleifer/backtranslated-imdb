I really enjoyed the answers and the south too. I think one of the best and most profitable television series it has ever seen. Cast eligibility is amazing, your actor "Golden Age of the movie", James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchell and other actors of Gene Simmons, who was the new Patrick Swazer of the 80's. , James Reid, Jonathan Frank, Jenny Francis, Philipp Casnoff and Leslie-Anna Down. <br /> <br /> There are two completely different men's friendships in the heart of the story, where there are people from North North and George Hazard (James Reid), who have Arri Moin (Patrick Soze). Throughout the series, their friendships continue to threaten the differences in their background, especially regarding the treatment of the southern slaves (especially in Orion), but when they need each other, they will forget the logic and help their friends. I really like chemistry between two men and they were interested to see if their friendship could survive in the war. <br /> <br /> I saw what life was like before the war, I like what the audience can see. The reasons for that war were going on in the war, what was happening at that time, after that the nation was being destroyed which was broken and then the country again worked for the reconstruction of the country. The war scenes were very good dancers and very realistic to me. <br /> <br /> I think what's great about it, through it many elements are going on, romance, history, war, which will work with the greatest interest, the audience has something for everyone. I especially enjoyed romance between Brett (Jenny Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when he stood up to his sister Ashton. Other romances were not very interesting because everyone was not the same, it was a bit different to everyone, which saw me especially seeing the Madeline and the Ore strand so that they could eventually stay together. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the best American mini series, the romance was the perfect balance in the story, and at the same time it was just as well as a more serious history in the history of the country. Characters are very visible and the places are beautiful, and especially in the beginning and end of the episode, the music works very well and works with the mood of the story.
