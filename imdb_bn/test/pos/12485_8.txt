Is this a murder mystery? Is it a police approach? Is it a back-level look at seedy French music? Quai des Orfevres All this, but without any other than it is a funny comedy of unbelief, jealousy and love, set in WWII Paris. It may be frustrating that the director of this deadly film like Henry-George Clujote, Lee Carrouwer, or Suspicious Nail Bitter, like Doubolic and The Ways of Fayer, is the director. Klujot, however, is an impressive filmmaker. "In a murder mystery," he told us, 'there is an element of playfulness. It is not entirely realistic. In between, I share the view of Hitako, which says, 'A piece of cake with the secrets of a murder and a candy fruit, and if you deny yourself you can also act as a documentary film.' "Quai des Orfevres is a great movie, and it is not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Jenny Martynau (Suji Delayar) is an ambitious singer at the music hall and copper clubs, she is a dermatologist, she uses some sex as well as talent I do not see the error, get a contract, his stage name is Jenny Latu, and she really loves her husband Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blair). Martynu is a grief She is her mate and barbarian, she is a little mild, a little silent and jealous, then there is our neighbor, the photographer Stora Monier (Simone Reinent), who is a blonde, pretty (think of Rita Henry) and capable, she and Martini also have children together Since then, there was a friend, Dora, of course, certainly not to think of Jenny when he thought of friendship, then George came along with Brigon (Charles Dullin), A T wonderful, rich and dirty old man, often Dora, who posits his own woman "young" film "industry" took photographs. He proposed a deal for a film jenite detailed discussion and proposed a dinner at his home. Jenny is more than willing. Morris is mad and it is banned. Jenny shouted at her right, "You are jealous of the rich! Well, I want to share my share in Malka. I am all for the kingdom!" "You father was a worker," said Morris again shouting. "So, under Louis XVI, I'm going to be Madame de Pompadar! I used to warm their tights!" <br /> <br /> And after the death of Brigon, a dead man was found dead with a champagne bottle next to his blood-vessel, there is a striker to try to secure things for Jenny. But wait. Inspector gets Antoine's case. Antoine (Louis Jouvette) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor's sore feet. She has seen it all. He served "colonies" with foreign troops and returned with an adopted child and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and Antony dots on her. One of the first things to discover antony is that not only brainen with a brain bottle, but someone shot him in the heart. Who did it? Long ago, Jenny, Morris, and Dera are all lying to Alibis in one or another place, accepting. How does antonie invent a murderer? If we can sing songs of Jenny Latur, will we sing? Everything gets cleared, but only with time and intelligence, Antonio firmly. We are in love with a lot of love, that is, the triggers of the hair come from all kinds of purposes from envy, and all act as an excellent mix of galaxy music. <br /> <br /> Clauses are taking us to Paris in Paris, but do not threaten the people around them, in modest music publishers, where the piano is played for buyers, at private personal dining room restaurants. Finally, he goes to the music hall where Jenny Latur often performs. She could see Jenny like a song, couples and single men standing in the seat stood next to their coats and hats. And everyone smokes In fact, the first third of this movie is made in this million. With the singing of Jenny's song "Her Petite Tray-la-la, her sweet tray-la-la", we tried to rehearse her publisher's song, which Jenny had a hat, a corset, gartered stockings and more. <br /> <br /> Delayer, Blair and Renault all work fine, but Louis Juventus kept everything together. She is an incredible actor who dislike making movies. The stage was his world, and as a director and he only acted in movies to earn money to work on his stage. Juventions were long with long and shiny dome. He was not traditionally handsome, but what he had adopted to keep a view on the scene was. Look at how skillful he is to play a comedy, watch him in the Darling de Drum. She is an impressive actor. At one point he said, "I liked you Miss Miss Monier." "Me?" She asked. "Yes, because you and I are two types. When women come to us, we will not have any chance." Jouvet is a consolation from the rueful sorrow of relaxation, that brings lots of all kinds of lines.
