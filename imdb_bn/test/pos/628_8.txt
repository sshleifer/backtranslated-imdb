The plot is a bit original, and all actors do their job quite well. There is plenty of sunny relief. Some things do not give much knowledge (eg, the first "Chase" scene, why the heroine will not just hide anywhere and wait until Bardisi goes?). The Russians really speak Russian without utterance, but the models of 50-year-old models are quite strange, and so the place seems oddly timeless. Overall, if you like the thriller, you probably also like it.
