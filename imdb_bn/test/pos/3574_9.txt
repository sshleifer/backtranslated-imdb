Exporting an intelligent and well-received film value! <br /> <br /> This exotic and genuine intelligent movie is fully illustrated in Bogotá, you can feel the meaning of the word "bluff" (though it is a Colombian movie, title is presented in English); ! <br /> <br /> This story is about Nicholas Andrade (Federico Lauruso), a photographer who found his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristijal), who has a relationship with her magazine owner, Pablo Malerino (Victor Malarino); This is left without Nicholas girlfriend and without any work. Malerino's revenge followed Nicholas's Marinero photos and posted photos of his new affair, Alexandr (Carolina Gomes), and took photos of him for blackmailing Malirino in exchange of money. <br /> <br /> <br /> You can understand the full meaning of the title, the film shows a thriller with many comic scenes and characters, which gives real joy to such a person to enjoy the movies. Script. <br /> <br /> I'm standing here that this film is usually different from Colombian movies, which show some dark and violent scenes in our beautiful country, which is really fresh. Some critics say that this story does not show Colombia's general life style, so it can be held in any part of the world, I do not agree with: (1) The movie is fully illustrated in Bogotá, so you can see on the street, and the picture of the real Colombia capital I hope that some American people and filmmakers see it so that they are the Amazon jungle, or Mexican Sama in Bogra. N cities look like some Hollywood movies), (2) Characters, dialogues, the exception of Nicolas from Accent Argentina are completely here, there is a pronunciation from Rosemary (Veronica Orrozko) ink, (3) You can see social and cultural difference of common people in Bogotá Can see I hope all these, plus an English title will remove man from other countries to see this masterpiece of Martinez <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ricardo Perez, Malarino's good performance, Catalina Aristijal and Federico Lauruso <br /> <br /> To export a movie, people from all over the world will definitely understand and enjoy !, do not miss this movie 9/10!
