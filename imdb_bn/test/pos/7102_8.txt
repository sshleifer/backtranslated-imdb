I like Dracula's house more than Frankenstein's house. Carradine is not too much passable and ridiculous as its acting and overboard as HOF. The actors offer tough enough performances. Subplots (such as giant, village mobsters, villagers idiot, hunchback nurse etc) are well mixed, so that someone becomes an odd splinter as HOF. Sew-well runs better than HOF. Hunchback Nurses preferred as hunchback in HOF. The doctor is very good. Alongside, Lone Chaney adds a classy touch with her wolfman. Price observer twice A classic universal horror with the long, long lost of the 1940s. Especially good before his doctor's blood pressure Dracula is contaminated with his / her effectiveness.
