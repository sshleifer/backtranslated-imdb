Susan Sarandon, for a good word, incredible lack. My opinion (and yes I understand that not everyone here will agree with me), he is one of the greatest actresses of all time and must have at least two Oscars in his credit. I mean, it was an amazing performance of Lorenzo Oil (but I think its every performance is amazing) and they gave Emma Thompson ... What was it ??? And this time he got this Oscar, he was in the industry for 25 years. I could not think of anyone's ability, especially for his performance as a brilliant illustration of his sister Helen Prizen. But then again, he does not need all over the artificiality of Hollywood and Oscars - people know that he's good. <br /> <br /> There are some deep, thought-provoking messages in this movie, so it is not lightly accepted that it is taken lightly. Team Robbins, of course, can not escape from the credit here. You think that the images painted in this movie will not be correct due to the feeling of his personality against the death penalty. However, both sides of the death penalty debate are even given weight. On the one hand, you see the fascinating aspect of Matthew, which the human beings testify to their death rather than the heart-twisting. At the same time, you deprived his victim and realized that the depressed parents were patient. A word for Team-Brewo. <br /> <br /> A brilliant movie and as I said, a well-known and long-awaited Oscars for Susan.
