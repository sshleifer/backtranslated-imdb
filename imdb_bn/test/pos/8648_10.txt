10/10 <br /> <br /> Plot Decision <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies ever made and I'm not saying that because I'm fooling through a seemingly unclear presentation. Those who dislike this movie because they do not understand this story often criticize critics because they appreciate this movie because they can not understand it. I do not see this movie as very metaphor. To me, it's a story with a start, middle and end. People are confused by the film because they expect that it is a deep, philosophical meaning that they can explain from meaningless meaningless scenes. I think they failed to understand that the mysteriousness came from a cut-up and re-arranged plot that has been combined with long and explanatory fantasy sequences and not from visual fairy disorder. Due to the length limitations, I will try to hold this short and the point and touch on the main idea. <br /> <br /> General plot: After Zitbarg competition to play, Dian comes to LA. In a sermon, he meets Comilla with whom he falls in love. After Camila slept with other men and women, Deane was excited with jealousy. The detective invented another person (director) in the filming of the movie, and discovered another woman (a random blonde) on behalf of Camila and the Inviter to join. Inspired by his anger and possessiveness, Diane Camilla hired a hit people to kill. After that work is finished, he is overcome by loneliness and slips in a unconscious fantasy world where he wants life he lives on. Then Deeven is awake. He is frustrated by what he did in his consciousness. <br /> <br /> Imagine Imagination: After the film's credits, the first person p.o.v. Starts with Imagine someone shot on a bed collapsing in slippery and unconscious This is where Deen's imagination starts. The accident is an excuse to "bring back" her beloved girlfriend and justify the life of fantasy. He portrays his girlfriend as humble and innocent because he wants what he wants. In the meantime, he works like "everything in the movie" because he has an escapist personality. He killed himself in a sense and felt the identity of Betty, a waiter in a diner. The story revolving around the director was a direct result of his feelings which he actually suffered in such a way as he was and himself "convinced" that he was forced to choose Camila. There was unconscious expression of the lack of control felt during party. Camilla Rhoades in fantasy is actually random blonde from the instinct party. He hated him so much that he turned him into Comilla and made him a very rival. Then she really brought Camille and turned her into a perfect, humble out of the movie girlfriend and used Rita Hairwire as inspiration. He also portrayed the victim as a very violent and incapable person in order to further strengthen Cimmer's survival. Unfortunately for him the search for the fantasy world, Diane, which ended itself, and through a series of reminder of the reality, he was killed by dreams. The first reminder was Club Silinsio, which is "no band" and the "instruments" you hear are not really; A metaphor for this imagination. Because he started to hit fierce because it shakes his perception of his surroundings Another reminder is the blue box ... Indeed, the blue box is not a reminder itself (actually more in the pandora's box), but the blue key opens the box. The blue key reminds her of the real death of Comilla because Hitman said that it will be seen after the end. Along with love, this entire creation was exempted from reality by living in ideal Hollywood when she expected it to be part of her coming. <br /> <br /> This is a story which is a sad woman showing monocology which is lost in dreams. This is not designed to annihilate the series of random things, and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. This is an unfortunate part of human condition which is nicely presented. <br /> <br /> However, this is my opinion until the end. I could be off the road. Or it can not be intended to mean any one. There are a lot of people who agree with me. Great! Why do you mean something to the end? Why not just be a statement of itself? What are the coherent, intelligent descriptions shackles for artistic expression? For example, Peter Greenway supports several words with the help of this statement: "I would argue that if you want to write a description, be a writer, be a novelist, do not be a filmmaker, because I believe the movie is so exciting in the areas that are created. Which is not primarily descriptive. "And where everything written in writing is the only possible way Need to understand immediately with the numbers? There is no such rule because the transparency of the film is not related to its industry. "I did not understand it!" So ...? "Mulholland Dr.," Story or not, affects viewers, harass them, drags them, awes them, lulls them. The way to lend yourself to explaining it is amazing. It does not get old. It does not lose its light. Her visuals are always effective and beautiful. It does not matter what cinematic perfection is. Enjoy.
