Seeing Armard's preview I think the movie is going to be very bad or very good movie. Thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspicious, and realistic. There is never a perfect crime, and why the forces have shown. When people go sterile, they behave like pictures. The last hour of the film is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Dylan is hard to believe at the age of 50. I will buy this movie I'm ten out of ten. Not a Christmas movie. I still write ten lines? No! However, there are not many action films. There are lots of excitement in the Armored, which gives the movie Girlfriend a choice throughout the other comedy.
