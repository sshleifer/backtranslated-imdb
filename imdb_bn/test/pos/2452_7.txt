Not that for Adrenaline Maniacs. This is a good movie, after the war, mental problem, from another perspective. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is a young man, afraid of the war giant of Vietnam, causing problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Shane is also good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emilion can not resist Estevez's character, and does not want to deal with Martyn Shane's character. <br /> <br /> Protecting mother sees this problem in the warm and open heart, but her mind clearly stops because the reason.
