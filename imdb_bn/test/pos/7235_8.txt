This trash version of 'Romeo and Juliet' has passed Manhattan in the present day. Romeo (Will Qianan) is a cave and violent member of the family and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and nipples) and bisexual girl of the Caplet family. This romantic pair faces the physical situation very interesting. Although a civilized film (featuring at the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all viewers. If the audience likes Peter Flickr's ex-films ('Branded', 'Bad taste'), 'Toxic avenger', 'Body of elt' and other trash film fans, he must love this flickr. Otherwise, he would hate it. Since I belong to the first team, my vote is eight. <br /> <br />
