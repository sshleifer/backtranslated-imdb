Oh I remember watching this show 4:00 pm My junior high day time. It was not a delightful experience, because when I was creating my homework it seemed to me to look at it. <br /> <br /> However, the show attracts my attention when shows showcasing my special power and dealing with high problems with common junior. <Br /> But the program was not the courage and special power of all; It was an educational effort for a young audience to be more interested in school and biology. <br /> <br /> The main actress (her name can not be remembered and I am very lazy to make a copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance. She made the show to watch the show. <br /> <br /> They just do not show such shows ...
