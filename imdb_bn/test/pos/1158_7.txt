This is based on real facts, with a great cast and a good story, a completely visible bold movie to watch. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to remember that the story of the movie is based on true facts. It's an adventure story for the most part, with an anticipation of all the normal elements in an adventure movie set in the Arab world. So, many war fight, good old fashion honor, religion and prosperous country. But the film is filled with humor, to see the movie light and pleasant. <br /> <br /> Continuing to live in Morocco's conspiracy, Shan Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot line Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best possible way in my opinion. Two things are completely different different levels, completely different characters, it's just completely different world! Of course both stories are connected to the line and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two world is too big for it to work. It does not always attach the movie and does not confuse a bit. The American plot line is mostly political, when the Moron Plot Line is completely brave and the action is filled. Finally you can think of what the whole point or Roosevelt thinks of this movie. It seems that John Milius is just a big fan of him. Often the American Plot Line goes beyond the speed of the more attractive and faster-growing faster morocron plot line. Finally, John Milies has always been at his best time as an Action Director. <br /> <br /> It does not get completely steam through the helvet path. The movie's maximum and maximum scaled action kicks off. Especially the last battle of the big size is not frustrating. I was like this in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is also in great production design and with beautiful looking steps and war sequences. This is a good looking. Apparently, the movie can only cost $ 4,000,000, but considering the settings and size of the film it is really hard to believe. I think John Millionaos wanted to spend about $ 20,000,000 for his best known "Canaan the Barbarian", but it was looking for more camps and less influential on its scale. <br /> <br /> A big fat Scottish accent but Hey, it's Shane Connery so you just tend to accept this easily. She is well suited to her role. So there's Candice Bergen. It's always hard to get involved as a woman's character and working in a movie like this, but she runs. John Houston also played a big role in this movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
