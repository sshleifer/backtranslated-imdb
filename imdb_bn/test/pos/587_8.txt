I enjoyed the muppet movie a lot. It was the first of the mup pet movies and it is so creative and fresh that it is the best. With the following movies, ideas do not seem to be fairly realistic. But here, we saw Kimit and Miss Piggy riding a bike (incredibly difficult scene), throwing a superb pair and just a lot of fun. Muppets I liked every minute and I did a lot of movie without a serious problem. In this and the next Muppate films, there were a lot of non-Muppets that needed to be felt in some power that could be felt - especially, many by many Caios. Some fine works (such as Charles Darling), but many feel that it is irrelevant and slow down the film's grinding. Perhaps the worst of them was Edgar Bergen. Yes, he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and his other staff, but his little scene was not just needed and most of the cameras were not. Yet, despite this big complaint, it is a great film for the whole family - even the most demanding adults from the kids.
