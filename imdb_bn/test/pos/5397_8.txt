The police about the whole family who fully enjoy this film, so it appears. Ben Trives, (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of father who is only interested in one child who is excellent for swimming and won many trophies, but he hates too much and even hates his father. Ben wants to have his other son team, (Emil Hirish) and even his daughter Penny, (Michelle Williams) rarely stay in college. Mother, Sandy, (Sigarie Weaver) tries to keep the family together and even her husband completely disregards her. There is a very tragic event in the family that changes everyone's personality, using drugs, starts young and old, smokes smoking, and drinks in parties all the time. There is even a gay scene and at the same time there is a room for comedy, and of course there is a very dark secret that Sandy Trevis finally tells her son Tim.
