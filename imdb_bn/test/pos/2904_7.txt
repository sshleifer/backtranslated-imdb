Now there are many movies in the DVD, but the producers have forgotten something very important to many cinemas. With the El Cid and other favorites of the wide screen era, there was the ability of the Egyptian, big budget epic. Many of my generation are learning a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even Incaas (for the first time I've heard from them that Charlton Hesn is called Treasure of the Inquoss). Egypt, or Rome, saw many "bad" epics of the era. Many production costs, excellent use of color (The Locks color was more bridged and sharp holder, which was the general technicolor), probably the cast was wrong, but in any case, the film made us to give an idea about life in ancient Egypt and in some way the motor was out And to buy the novel, my maternal aunt, the best one, if not ever published the best historical-novelAlfred Newman and Bernard Herman also had excellent scores as well. I used to see this picture many times when I was younger, that the box office was not hit by the fact that Fox Studios had a bigger injury than The Rob Stroke, cinemascope and stereo were a nice eye-popping sp4ectacle. I have a laser disk version. This is the only way to view wdyscreen format. Soon I hope to appear.
