Often it is not that a great director's last film, such as moving, brilliantly edited and illustrated masterpieces. Cast is excellent as excellent and camerawork. In the beginning of the 20th century, a group of well-educated citizens began to enjoy together - Dublin has a dark, philosophical explanation about all our fears and dark shades of death. Thank you, Mr. Houston, this great piece of pieces!
