I'm still waiting for a new DVD issue year on this wonderful film. I own a beta max recording with French language. Unfortunately, MGM has dropped the French track in its latest DVD ... Only English has a French subtitle conversation ... I do not know how MGM should be advised: I wrote an email to them, of course, there is no answer. If I insist, because it was especially spectacular, funny, well written etc. in French dubbing track ... George C. Scott's acting is always fantastic and for people born like me in the 50's, Madonna (for example) is much different than the Diana Rig. Thanks for the help ... wishes ...
