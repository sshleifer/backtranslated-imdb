This picture was set when the standard set for African American film excellence. I heard the story of the movie at various times that it was a shock to get an Academy Award nomination when it was released. These pictures play on different emotions, and you definitely feel for all of the characters. Of course, some of the acting is a small wooden, but fortunately, those parts are not animated. The music is exciting, and if you do not think that the end is a tears, there is no heart in your chest. If you see "Cool Hi", you can see that many movies have copied different elements to strengthen their own movies. The biggest example of this is "Boyz n the Hood".
