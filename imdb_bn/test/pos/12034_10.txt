There are 4 parts in this movie and each is about 170 minutes long. It is based on the true story of Joe Bonanno's life and it is called all about what he sees. So in some events we can see that we heard something different about it. The film finally stops you for the chair, I think it is possible to see 4 clocks in the row, and I do not notice that I see the row in row 2 and 2 the next day. Acting in some scenes is fine but in general can be a bathroom, but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor, it is a real story and story is about what the movie is all about. So you can avoid the same spectacular Rambo / Matrix / Titanic movie. The best thing in the film is to follow the original story so that you do not have long and annoying love scenes or there is nothing important for the business of crime to do.
