WrestleMania 6, an entertainment wrestlemania, if not completely successful. The final challenge must, of course, be worth the price of admission, but again many of the people of Mannyas have many more admissions. For the crowd, for almost all things, and always as always, our team of Gorilla and body reliable delivery announcement. Because WrestleMania had a face vs. face in the main event, at this time it was quite unknown, it only made things that were more tense. <br /> <br /> match <br /> <br /> coco b. Wear / WW Frankie V "Model" Rick Martel. For a 3 or so minute match, as well as it gets. I wish it was more a tad, but what I got was fantastic, well-good. Martel won the Boston Crab <br /> <br /> 2 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> WWW Tag Team Championship. Large connection to disconnected connection. | C | / W. Bobby Hein. Huge pop for destruction The match itself was quite dull, I often had problems paying attention Andr√© did not really do much, so in a way it was more than 2 in 1. Here's a strong talent and it's shameful that they could not do better. Remnants that won the title, with the above pattern maneuver. Hitting the roof for the filling end. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / J. Jimi Heart. V. Hercules I got what I hope to do here, a quality boring field match, the earthquake does its job. I'm not really a fan, so my interest was not very interested. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Deafening pop for bruti. Really good match, sadly, there is no time to develop. It really kept my interest, and the card remains one of my favorite. Winner with a slingshot in the post, many of the crowd's approval <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Hardy Piper vs Bad News Brown. Huge pop for piper There is nothing more than a boring brawl, that does not know what it wants to be. Some recreational antics from hot rod, but nothing else. Ruddi portrays herself as half black, and calls herself "Hot Scott" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , But other than that, nothing to see here. Win with heart, heart attack <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Barbarian / W. Bobby Henan. As well as Santana. It's time to get the average, but still watchable. The people were rather dead than Heine's intervention. Jessie's hilarious cracks, more entertainment about Tito's meal, then the match itself. Barbarian wins with a nasty looking, flying warm clothline. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag Match. Dusty and Sapphire / W. Elizabeth. Macho Raja and Sheri. Big pop for Dusty, and looks even absolutely stunning for Elizabeth, even I could add. I thought it was okay. It was not at least alive, that is not something great. I do not have a fan on Dusty 'so. Dusty and sapphire win, when he rolls up Sherry <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Orient Express / WA Fuji Rocks versus Horror is rather amazingly animated, for this. No doubt, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. The constant focus with Fuji, detracts matches from the match. Express calculates by winning, when Jenetty is nailed with salt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jim Dougigan versus Dino Bravo / W. earthquake and Jimmy Hart. Duggan, like an idiot, brings out the American flag of Canada. Douggano also got some tougher wives for this, but could be due to Bravo's Canadian heritage. Sticky match around, I did not care for Duggan, but why it sucked. Finally, very small, really matter. When Dougagan won, two behind the back of Bravo and four. Dougun got Splash for his hardship. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> million dollar championship. Ted Davies | C | / W.Weil. J. J. Robbers / Dr. Damien. Some slow speeds, but when all was said and done, I had a good time. Two solid wrestlers provide it all, resulting in a recreational match up. Strike heavily, although some parts of it get Osc. Win by Debbes count. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nice Pop for Bossman. Very routine, and really very short, means at the end of something. Akim was a hostage, I never really liked it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Rick Rudd / W. Bobby Henan. Jimmy Snuka For a mood, before the main event, it was not very bad. It was time to go further, it has been nice, sure. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Title Title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | V.V. Hul Hagan | WWF Champ | This section is about the reaction of the crowd from the crowd and the most part of the crowd. Warrior got a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion it was a little shocking. Hogan dwarfs him completely. This is one of the best matches in WrestleMania history. Two, who are not really known for wrestling, have been talking about age for that they managed to run up an amazing match. I have seen it many times, and every effort of my respect level, for their efforts, I think I'm not a fan. Even the deadly drunkards who want genuine wrestling can not be ugly about this! Warrior won with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> below. WrestlemanMan 6 is a recreational entry, if there is not anything extra. It's memorable for the main event, location and crowd, but if you ask me it's not the best. I said that I enjoy it, and I recommend it to my fellow wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
