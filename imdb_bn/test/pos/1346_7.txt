I saw Fort Lauderdale this last night. In general it was fun and I particularly liked the character of Sabrina. The acting was good and the line of the story was not okay, which was leaving many strings glowing and how we were (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image has really lived well and we are happy about life. This is definitely a flaw, but for the first time in Asian Christian film I think it was good. You can wait for this one DVD. But if you give it a shot it's a chance to see it
