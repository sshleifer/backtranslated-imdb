"Captain Correli Mandolin" is an old fairytale Hollywood romance romance but gender and nudity, and not by the Americans as it is supposedly. The story on a Greek island during WW2 takes place. Italians came to bring the island, but under German supervision. There is a romantic triangle composed by a Greek couple and Italian captain. Excellent performance by all actors; Penelope Cruz's best work yet.
