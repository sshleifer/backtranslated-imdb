"Fantastic Heroes" Cigourney Waiver 2004, Jeff Daniels, Emil Hirish, Michelle Williams, and Kip Pardu films. <br /> <br /> This story seems to be an issue of concern to the unhappy family, which is the oldest child (Purdu). <br /> <br /> "General People" is often mentioned with this film; It's the kind of "common man" with a reverse role. In this case, Sandy Trevis (Waiver) is more accessible than the father, Ben (Daniel) who is definitely devastating and unable to cope. The little boy Tim (Hirosh) likes the "normal people" like the focus of the photo. <br /> <br /> For me, the film was absorbing enough to be observers, but there was a strange isolation about it. There were some excellent discretions of mother and son, mother and neighbor, brothers and sisters (Williams) and some good off-the-moment moments. What was ever clicked was that Ben was having no chemistry with any part of the family or Sandy. It looks like director / writer Dan Harris had the goal. In one view of the grocery store, the checkout child thinks "about 30" and gives him his phone number. In the next scene, Daniels asks Sandie if she wants a plastic surgery for her birthday. While making this film, Beaver 55, probably 54, and looks extraordinary So what is Ben looking for? However, there is some question about Ben's complete isolation because the audience does not really see how Danielle was ever associated with that family. <br /> <br /> The last couple of twists and some very sensitive scenes. Everyone is very good, standout with Weaver and Hirosh. <br /> <br /> This film does not have much dialogue and there is not enough storage. The script may be sharp. But "fantastic heroes" is a good effort.
