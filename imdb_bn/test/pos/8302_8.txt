This is a truly precious sci-fi real jewel! Peter Cushing added the great personality of the midnight movie classics. <br /> <br /> I especially like the sound design. The strange sounds and creatures of the creatures offer a diverse backdrop (of course, not least the child also strikes!) <br /> <br /> <br />
