Due to medium quality and storyline, I stopped showing about Hindi movies. An exception to this is the Ramgopal Varma movie. This is an excellent movie with great performances from star cast. Those who are sick to see stupid dance and love stories can certainly see this movie. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional. You will see this movie for various stakeholders. Based on the life of Naik in Mumbai Police, the film works in a more realistic way. This movie is confused in the lives of ordinary people, which is different from being a face-to-face expert. I rate this as one of the best movies of the year
