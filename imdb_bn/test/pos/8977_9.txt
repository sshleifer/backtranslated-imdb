After writing Harun Srosine and stopping production, I resigned seeing "West Wing". It was not exactly the same. He has written again that I imagine my thrill of watching a movie. It has been a long time - American President, Fee Good Good. His script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. He made a compulsory story credible, and at the same time crying to me <br /> <br /> Tom Hans was unbelievable as a Congressman in Texas, whose parties only wanted to do less and tried to keep guns. Not so difficult, so there was a lot of time to fool him - and he did it. His office staff looked at Playboy Mansion. As he said, "You can teach them to type, but you can not teach them to increase their meat." Despite his fitness stance with the Congressman of Texas, he is very loyal, especially his colleagues, Emmy Adams (Junbagh and ex-Hooters girl). <br /> <br /> Now a rich Texas socialist who wants to do some work in Afghanistan fully played by Julia Roberts; And a pain-in-the-boss ass-CIA agent, well done by Phillip Camur Hoffman, and a good price to see if you have a movie. <br /> <br /> Extraordinary writing, and the best acting, and a story need be told. What do you want more in the movie?
