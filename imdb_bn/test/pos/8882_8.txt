This movie was originally a fool on the strangers of a train of Hitcoch, which I thought was disappeared in some way. This plot is going to see Danny Davito unrecognized and then Billy Crystal wants to kill him, for the sake of killing Crystal to kill his mother and killing Davito. Both Davito and Crystal are fantastic and so Divito's mother. This is Davita's director debut and it is better than the battle of the rose.
