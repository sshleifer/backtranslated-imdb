Finally I saw LAURE and I want to say that I enjoyed it equally and it was frustrated by it. What is great about it, music, location, cinematography and beautiful cast. The story existed for sure but with this movie it really does not matter. The speed and setting in the locid are exotic. There is a lot to the picture. Unfortunately, some thing is going on against it. Whatever the first thing is gorgeous Annie Belle and handsome al-cleaver have no chemistry. Because two couples are on screen for the full length of the movie and because the lack of chemistry between the two is a specific liability. According to IMDB, when Al and Nanny portrayed this film, they were a real couple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a sex scene which I have seen on any soft porn flickr like a silicone: Our young blonde couple is a Can be a cross-dragar which is preferred by a helicopter pilot! Pilot fly over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) And in their middle class, there is an orgy of type in helicopter. And Al Cleaver is filming all these with his 16mm camera! I'm not joking with you. Ridiculous We later see the editing of a 16 mm footage on a moviola. Footage Rolls, Al and Ani start to start out. These scenes were actually good but the footage bars on the screen behind them were too high. It was almost flying with my BMO while running a helicopter pilot after seeing cross-dragar footage. Is this supposed to be lover or credible in any way? The last thing I want to see is that a woman is enjoying a man by dragging, of course, when dragging people to create such a ferocious woman, while running helicopters, there is less. Al and Ani met with it and had music throughout the scene. I just wish the footage in the edit screen was so stupid. <br /> <br /> The drag is another silent plot point in LAURE which really drags a crow to the movie, with great Orso Maria who is the moment of the Garyini and her two wives. A married trio is an interesting concept but it is registered here as very hot or even attractive. The two women's decor is soft and we rarely see being three sexes. In fact, with Orie Bell, Oso kept his clothes for almost the entire movie. This is another minor complaint about Laur: There is nudity, but it's not like other movies of the same era. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I love such soft-film films in the 1970s when focusing on attention and mood was not the weird stuff we see today. <br /> <br /> Confirm to see Emmanuel in Egypt, which is Anne & Al but another famous screen couple, Laura James and Gabriel Tinti That movie music is very great.
