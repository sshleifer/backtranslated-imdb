A broken story of this divorce that went out of the word, causing a seven-year-old boy to be in a strict custody war. Who surprisingly adapted the novel of Avari Karamen in the big screen. He keeps everything pretty neat and most realistic, while providing all the plays directly from the heart. To tell such a story, his talent was proven again with "Hart's places", where he showed as "Krrar v. Krummer" that he had a natural ability to work with his children. Another strong point of the picture is the brilliant performance, which received four nominations for four Film Academy Awards, out of which two winners were ousted. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is as disappointed businessman Ted Krummer, who has forgotten a man that his wife is a person Wife Joan said, Merrill Strip claimed his supportive actress Oscar for a strong, sensitive painting of a married eight-year married woman. Jane Allenzer was also nominated for his excellent performance as Craig's best friend Margaret. Young Justin Henry, the final voice of the acting department, must go, whose incredible running performance will make you cry again and again and the Oscar nomination will be fully deserved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's really a touching story that parents can relate to each other when they leave their wives and mothers. They grow together to know each other and to form a brand new and wonderful relationship. Tede sees himself with a new responsibility and a new perspective of life and gradually realizes why Joan had to go. <br /> <br /> If there is nothing, "Krormer v. Crumer" shows no one comes to you when someone comes <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hefajat war between unbelieving parents, both feel that the child has the best interest in their heart. Apart from the fantastic playback from Robert Benton and amazingly controlled aspects, it is such a great actor who makes this photo such a winner. <br /> <br /> Huffman is bright like Ted Krummer, man wants to keep his top job and his son strong enough. The strip is very nice, since the woman was lost in eight years of marriage, she had to leave before doing anything like a person. In support of these two mutual friends Margaret is a strong Joan Alexander, a wonderful Justin Henry, a boy caught in the middle and extra impressive. <br /> <br /> This highly emotional, heartfelt drama is more deserving than the 1979 Academy Awards for Best Film, Best Actor (Hoffman) and Best Supporting Actress (Strip). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, 28 February, 1996 - TV
