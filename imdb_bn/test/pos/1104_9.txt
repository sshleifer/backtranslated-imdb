I saw this man at the Bendfilm Festival on Friday that, among the people of the crowd of people, the event was not helped by a bad decision by the designers, who chose the movie entirely before the incompetent small films. When modern love came when a light, radioactive short (I forget the name) came later, it really threw the listener. <br /> <br /> People !!! It's really silly to mix this short with modern love - which is a serious drama movie. A film film. <br /> <br /> So the audience teaser is getting a comedy and then ... modern love. Hmmmm. Modern love, despite my reservation (weird finishing, a little too tensile) that needed a small film that was consistent with its peculiar curiosity, so for the next year the programmers are advised to take extra care of this event. <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> Against the tensual filming of the film - a movie that its creator naturally seems to be 'loud loud' instead of shooting the film script and shot. <br /> <br /> Bad viewers were misunderstood. Wrong session placement, wrong short film, wrong motive programmers wrong methods, despite those good efforts, will see many more movies and travel to any other festival.
