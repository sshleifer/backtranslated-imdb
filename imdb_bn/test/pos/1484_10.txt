This is one of my favorite TV shows ever, Rowan Atkinson is simply a genius! And that's exactly what I've chosen for my 1000 review! I can not tell you how much I love Mr. Bean and he wonders how he goes out in these incredibly difficult situations and he is always creative, plus Robin Driscoll deserves to be congratulated! He is a gifted! What he has done in my favorite bit is Mr. The amazing adventures of Bean and when the rest are amazing, this is my true favorite, plus I hope this ceremony will not stop soon! Each episode is brilliantly written, and they are all masterfully managed, plus each episode is a classic in my eyes! This show is incredibly popular, and why I can definitely see, it's probably probably the most fun show as it is. Character actors have played a very good role, especially Robin Driscoll and Matilda Jigler (as Irma). This is always one of my favorite TV shows. Rowan Atkinson is simply a talent and incredibly talented comedian (probably the best!) And it's just right that I like to see my 1000 reviews that you did not see it, leave what you're doing now and check it out, you believe it Do not do that it is one of the best TV shows ever !, and I'll be watching this show again and again, I never tire it! Mr. Bean Rules! Out of *****
