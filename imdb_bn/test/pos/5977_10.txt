Vashkozenadian is your favorite film, but it will be possible to see it every ten years. Known as the best film in Shepitiko, the story of Partition is going on in the Belarusian Jungle, which was killed in winter in the Soviet German occupied Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And whether the question of whether a person can be moral or immoral in a context otherwise it is otherwise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two men, Ribak, who knows this area Jewish school teacher in a small village was entrusted satanikabhake for food. They burn in the village, they have not eaten anything on the farm and there is nothing more than wood structure and foundation, in which children have hidden a mirror in one hour's hole. The overwhelming feeling is that anyone who brings a country of cruelty to war and a man is really cursed. I thought about the war that the Americans and the British brought to Iraq and how the people's war was shocked by the despondent acts of the nation. <br /> <br /> Two went to a large village near where they received, from a fellow Prime Minister, under a lamb. The arrival of Germany and the two sides escaped through the fire. Sotnikov is hit on his legs and holds off to German as Rybak gets away with the lamb. Sotnikov has become so lively that he is ready to be not alive, he removes the boot on his head. Raima came back and caught Satnikov outside the fire line. <br /> <br /> Raiqak threw Tatnikov through the jungle, bloody meter in the meter had been for a long time. Each meter is a painful phenomenon, and yet he imposes him with severe snow, across the sadness, black bush stamps, which according to the weight of the men skap. There are several similarities to Tchaikovsky's cinematic vocabulary - the long process creates emotional pressures that document, repeat the effect of using it and create longer shots. In the background, unknown because of the action, there is a question hanging out - did Rabibak return for the sake of Satnikov? Living under the moral standards of Marxist-Leninism, or group survival is not it the only common necessity, to bring the food back to its hungry band and to leave it to leave it? To sacrifice a man to survive for the party? Which leads to the question - is immoral under a philosophical system that a person can be moral under a different moral system? As the participants come, another curse of war is in a farm house with three young children. He has been subjected to war crimes and is having a quarrel with his three children. When the Germans show their rest they are given only. They make the way to go and hide the loft. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov cough leaves them. When a German man sees his head and no one responds, he threatens to break Loft and Rebak's nerves and they are caught. Who is the moral duty here now? Sotnikov for cough or Rybek for the tragedy? Two partitions and mothers are searched and are taken to a city on the adjacent side of a covered iron arch at the entrance. They are headmen and already a little girl. They are interrogated by a turncoat, played by the Belarusian Tarkowsky favorite Anatoli Solonitsyn. Asked and tortured Sotnikov puts his head and asked only what interrogation's prewar job was? He did not answer, but the answer was probably 'SchoolTeacher' from his comfort and standing behind the desk. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Rebek also prayed for his life and even offered to join the police. Previously unknown errors of character, making a 'wrong' moral decision, the obscurity (sensitivity) that has become incognito from the trial, has become clear, irrational and very ugly. <br /> <br /> Five are sitting in dark cells. They are all determined to die next day. A Christian parable element from here became stronger. Genuine rembrandt is used in light and composition as other old master poses are represented in Christ. He decided that he would save everyone if he blames everyone. He must be kept alive till morning so that he can save everyone, he can save everyone. He asked the mother to forgive and to know what was happening, Headman did not know that she did not feel frustrated as she did before, as she did before. <br /> <br /> comes in the morning. Sotnikov does not care for the Germans whether its companions do not take all the sins. They will all be sliced. They have a virtual Via Dolorosa which trudge up a steeply prone street. A bench was sent to life imprisonment in the city bench. Hanging from five ropes. The bench is standing only three, so Sattnikov stands on a tree stamp that Raiqq has come out of his control. <br /> <br /> <br /> The judge came down on the street with the Germans, someone in the crowd called him Judas, unnecessary sign, the only mistake of the Shepit. Rybak has been shot behind to imagine many times trying to flee, trying to dying a reputable death and trying, fail, to hang himself in Shire, but he left with the Germans as a victim dog. But if Rebek could go back morally and save Sattnikov's life, is he trying to save his life?
