The filmmakers are interesting and complicated look of each interesting story of an interesting annoyance by focusing on his wife rather than returning to her home. At the same time, we face the true real, existing French Lonar. <br /> <br /> The image is more than a documentary. Very rarely I feel that I have had some experiences that are accidentally deep, which makes it deeper. <br /> <br /> The film is apparently attractive at the internal moment. Of course the filmmaker likes my journey. (Quite lots of European in credit). Hopefully, PBS will screen this screen so that it reaches a wider audience in the United States.
