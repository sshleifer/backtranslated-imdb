I found this movie a bad choice in the celluloid, harmful, instant, slow, and efficiently. But I dare to throw a script, turn on the camera, and appreciate the courage to act a fool. I find bad acting, lighting, cinematography, sound, and whatever the film School Law d'Urville Martin boring. When talking from a film director's perspective, I just want to skip everything and have fun on the set. This picture looks like fun When other aspiring film directors advise me, I only ask Rudy Ray Moore to watch a movie. They always ask me a wonderful look, why the master Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra? I included the smile and want to know whether or not you always tell the story of the first movie.
