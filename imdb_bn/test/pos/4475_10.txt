What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat of Ben Daniels, Lavinia Career and Great Han de la Balzac This impressive film conveys so much comfortable and still powerful experience by character. I saw it mesmerized, as the story grabbed my breath almost as the story developed in its inexpressible end-side. The brutality of this movie was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, manages us to interpret strange platonic, and if we do not participate in each other's world, completely separate ties between the two organisms. Enough of both affection, but maliciously, it is more "developed" to become one who becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept another freedom. It can be the most compelling and interesting form of various types of love, and sometimes unbelievable research on oppressive and destructive human love. <br /> <br /> Just a basic mind connects this story with animals.
