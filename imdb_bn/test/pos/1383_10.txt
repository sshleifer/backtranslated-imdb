How nice!! Talk about a film that divided the audience! It's a real love or it's kinda hated movies. Personally I really enjoyed it. I noticed other reviews are compared to pitch black - Kinda is stupid as the only thing they have to do! People can be real stupid No, this film is much more common with Things (how wonderful people are surprised - they have even the same basic music), there are many artists, blue collar heroes, sharp humorous, endless rolling landscapes inside death and things can not be understood. Perhaps this film closes to be a real classic, reflection of other workarvers. At least Dark Star is something that is common with it. I really want to be keen to know how much it cost? $ 8000? Is it possible? Maybe it was based on a short film costing $ 8,000? But I found myself oddly after the death of various Space Dyods. These have been reduced so much that it sometimes likes to see a documentary. The script seems to be very impersonal and only half of them can work, and I'm not sure the big guy is a captain, one of them. But his gun is strange! Give it a chance, if you like the primary carpenter, you can read it for it, just do not expect 2001.
