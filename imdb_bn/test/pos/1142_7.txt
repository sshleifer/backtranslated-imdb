In the near future - in the world, a corrupt government keeps an eye on everyone with computer and surveillance. A man has been motivated to avoid surrender, and to defend his independence, he is operating outside the war. An engaging and fantastic story and some very interesting editing and camera work. There are some confusing and slow parts, but lastly, a nice example of what a small crew with a brain and talent can do in a shoe budget.
