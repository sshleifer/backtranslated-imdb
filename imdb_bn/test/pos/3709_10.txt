William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Focan has probably written about the life of South during most sadness. Many of his stories have been adapted to the screen. After the Attack of Pearl Harbor, in December 1941, short stories of two brothers were a respected story of two brothers. Big Brother, Pete Gray, Memphis, Tennessee went on to be listed as thousands of young men, some did not return home. Her younger brother did not do well in his departure. He managed to get a bus ticket without seeking any money for his brother in Memphis. He is surprisingly wanted to be listed at the age of 10, because he becomes another kind of soldier. Ron Perlman is a wonderful performance as the military leader who manages to manage care and bond with the boy. This short film won an Oscar for the best short-live action film, which is perfectly suited. It was long, it could compete with long films. In 1941 everything like American fashion, art direction, and restoration is perfect. The film also shows the heartwarming battle of the house because most Americans maintained great sadness. Actors and actresses are known but they do not have a first-rate performance. If Hollywood produces more quality movies, then perhaps I will go to more movies. There are better quality shows on Broadway, I go further in the theater.
