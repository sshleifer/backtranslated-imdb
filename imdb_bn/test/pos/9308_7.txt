It was waiting to tell a fascinating story. Fat Man and Little Boy took the lead and trial of a group of our top American scientist groups, handed over a high-level work during World War II: kill others from a nuclear bomb. Extensively protected in the New Mexico compound, the concept of the brain gradually turns from ambitious to immense realities. <br /> <br /> Fat Man and Little Boy, a movie that requires your close attention. This is not a real thoughtful person's film, but the moral effects of contributing to mass killing not only from the scientific perspective of developing an impossible impossible weapon. Characters are constantly broken into that reality and their wartime duties as Americans. The film is never publicized, however, the freedom of this man's inner turmoil will make us free to be amazed. Performance as well as deserve specifications. Paul Newman has combined the greatest performance of his Pottersack Generals, which is in charge of providing the ultimate big stick for the friendly forces. <br /> <br /> Where Fat Man and Little Boy lose most of the trekking, unnecessary romantic elements. Dave Schultz as the leader of the scientific team struggled with his love for his family and his widespread obsession with his big project. Director Roland Zaffe clearly felt the need to discover more human angles in this story, but romantic vaults initially serve as a confusion. As well as interconnection between scientists and their military dominance, which gives us the greatest insight into the thinking and feelings of these bright men. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to recommend Fat Man and Little Boy. This is a huge forgotten jewel that puts one person in one of the most intriguing stories in human history.
