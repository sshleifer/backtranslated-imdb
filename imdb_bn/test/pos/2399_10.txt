Fred Carpenter judged Eddie Monroe at Boston College and judged from the enthusiastic response, he was very happy about it. An educated, well edited indie, impressive for its large budget appearance and feeling. This movie has everything: A tight script that keeps you hold of it and it does not give up until it's astonishing. This viewer is not coming! Excellent performance around. Craig Morris and Jessica Sunis were particularly good leaders, gave strong performance. And Frank Bagnioro and Alex Carrodo are interested in watching movies as compelling and attractive to create two detectives. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is confirmed by my belief that some of the best works in the film are coming from innocent and Fred Carpenter is looking to be one of the best.
