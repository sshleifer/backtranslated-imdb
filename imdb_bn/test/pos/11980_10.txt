I was diagnosed with "on run" in the screening room in New York and immediately instigated by his true self. Michael Eppierricus and John Ventimiglia from The Soporans Cast, starring "On Run", does not let us sleep in a 24-hour wild ride in the city, which can not sleep at all, because we follow the spontaneous selling agent's melodies that suddenly pull through its long-term - School prison, just outside jail In fact, he has escaped from here and is seeing a glimpse of some activities and life in the "running" great city. Directed by a great performance, this film gives us the old feeling of the 70's pictures, with both the characters re-discovering themselves as they enter the wild events and locals in the city. A miracle on a particular side of New York seems to have disappeared, "On Run" shows great sensitivity and humor. I urged to discover that it is a classic classic prediction: future visitors must certainly surrender this night's trip.
