The 1980s Great Strip comedy set of Great West of England. This is the story of sex, drug, cream tea and september murder. Adrian Edmondson, French and Sanders, Nigel Planner (Sunny Drags) and Robi Coleton participated. Dennis (Edmundson) tried to influence Girlfriend, who was involved in a one million pound drug deal. This leads to complications with sunny results. I am trying to find the original image ratio of this image but it does not appear under the 'Technical Directions' of the IMDB site. I saw the DVD in the store and it is displayed in the 1.33: 1 (full screen) format. Was the film shot in this ratio or was it a widescreen film with a pans and scan DVDs? It will be useful as I scan the pan hates and film scans. So come on IMDB. Can you find for us?
