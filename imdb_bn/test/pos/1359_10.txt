Some say that these girls can be offensive for girls ... not really. Embarrassing situations are fun; For the first time I saw this series, I was in the video store, people around me smiled, did not care about age or gender. A teacher says that to be paid attention to someone in the book must be entertaining at the beginning and should not end by reading the last page. In the first minute of the series, the boy is hit by whom, the same car is displayed during the last moment of the series. Episodes are sensitive and fun ending, especially the last one. I'm sorry to buy this series.
