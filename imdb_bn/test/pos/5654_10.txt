Plain on the plain (Naibi), a hearty insanity, about the cruel madness and frustration of the war will not be a taste of all: It is a movie of war that is in real sense, which does not reserve patrolling, not patriotism, saccharine sentimentality Nobi deep cuts, it should be some things ever committed on celluloid as ugly, tenebrous and bleak. There was no war, no conquest or hero, no moral victory or defeat against these war criminals, but only a small, mad and terrible man was wandering in war because of a devastating disaster in war. Characters deny moral judgment because they are the Creator, a glorious woe, a nightmare that does not allow questions of moral nature. War and survival. To suppress one another against the other in the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Japanese army soldier Tamura has been robbed from his Platoon and ordered to report in nearby hospital due to coughing and disliking him. Platoon's. When refusing to be hospitalized, he is not asked to return and instead of grenade suicide himself. That's what it does. The hospital is nothing but a shaker made of wooden pot and the hospital surgeon only tells him that if he is able to walk properly. This is a hospital excerpt in hospital, one of the most annoying scenes in the film. The area is covered by American aircraft carpet and doctors and those who can walk and flee to hospitals and forests themselves. Momentous moments in front of the hospital Suddenly the sick and wounded, the unrest and the injured statistics come out of every statue wearing their sickly white clothes, such as the visas spawning and the wetting of animals in the world. <br /> <br /> This is the greatest achievement of the novel; In a simple but depraved film, the painting of war is sad and fool-blowing, melodrama or pseudo-heroism. The soldiers woke up in the soil, in the opposite bank and in the field, the enemy hiding in the field went in search of the tank, their light was burning like deadly eyes, like scanning in the dark. A procession of injured soldiers, dirty and half-crazy, crossing a road, falls on the ground with the words of enemy aircraft. The buzzards eating on a pile of dead bodies. A abandoned village A crazy soldier who thinks himself as a Buddha, sitting under a seed plant, is covered with a fly and his own bed, dedicating his hand when he dies by his mama. These pictures conjures to our eyes, stupid and brutally their cruelty but honest and raw. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Try to reach Palomar's reconstruction center to follow your journey through war crimes ground. And by observing war frenzy and obscenity. The film is spreading slowly, slowly and gradually by the horrors of war. Those who take shelter with two deserters to eat the final thirty minutes 'monkey meat' with Tamara, they come to follow the traditional traditions of the nearest Prophet and they are not strong at all about it. Strictly depicted in black and white pictures, with great performance from Cast and assured of eclecticism, the prophet is not only among the best war films, but also among the best of Japanese movies.
