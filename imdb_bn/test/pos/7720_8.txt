This image is about a young Indian who once came home and feels himself involved with a woman. The problem is that he is homosexual. Do not wait to tell his parents that to stop the marriage, it leads others to one side until it is directed towards one another. <br /> <br /> This picture is ridiculous and makes me laugh many times. Sally Banks's acting is fantastic and she strongly wants that this strong lady plays. The plot is outstanding as well. I think the plot is very realistic, and I can fully identify Jimmy's fearsome, anxious and disturbing feelings. On the other hand, Jimmy's boyfriend Jack was given very little attention in the film. I liked to give him more lines in film, and there are more character development. However, I think the director wants to make this a mainstream film, but the love between Jimmy and Jack has not been developed in the film. <br /> <br /> It's great to see a gay positive movie. Moreover, this movie promotes us to differentiate between other people, it can be the way of sex, culture and way of life. This picture makes viewers feel difficult. <br /> <br /> We need these types of movies to give us a development. Thanks for making this picture!
