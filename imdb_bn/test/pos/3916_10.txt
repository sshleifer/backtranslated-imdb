Okay so Paris Hilton sucks it (usually Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! Last night I saw this movie and the whole movie kept me completely. Chad Michael Murray Esu OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT And he is just an Ace actor Total heroes people Nick (Chad) sister who is such a brilliant actress as the main daughter. Up thumbs up I think movies are so different today, most of them take psychopaths, resources, ghosts, but there is a theme about wax here! They actually came out completely by the wax model, although they looked so real. I still did not get stories with this moment, I'm just waiting to get a DVD, then see it again. Posting up such a great film! 11/10 Everyone who does not like it, please do not worry, criticize my opinion because everyone does this great job. When I painted his underwear, I completely feel inconvenienced in the Paris scene. Why just get a cat shagging some cats .. Then be that more entertaining. When Paris's death took place, I used to think that it was poor even though she still continued, even though a knife was on her legs. Hmm .. interesting. <br /> <br />!
