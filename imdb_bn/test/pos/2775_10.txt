Susie Q is not like an original and other bad Disney movie, *** A spoiler named *** ****************************************** In 1950, her daughter died with her boyfriend, when their car crashed from a bridge. From Power Rangers to Susi (Emmy Joe Johnson) - Pink Ranger - ghost is helping to get a necklace with her way of explaining her sister about ghosts and finally getting this necklace, Susie goes back to the bridge and then she has her boyfriend's ghostly car Gets and they float After he missed him he was a girl who looks like him. (Do you believe in the resurrection?) Susie C is now a good film to watch now and later but they rarely give Disney because it will have to fill everything with stupid movies and I want to give it a <br/> <br /> 7/10.
