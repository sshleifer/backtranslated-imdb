Feisty Dianna Jackson (the fantastic former "playboy" a winningly fantastic performance by Playmate Jeanne Bell) went to Hong Kong to take the evil heroin ring that killed his brother. Secret drug Agent Yale (Lovely, Buxom blonde babe Pat Anderson), and romance Kaki, ruthlessly ambitious Charlie (registered with Stan Shaw's greatest arrogant panic) is facing the help of friendly Karate Master Joe (Prashant Chekito), while taking revenge for his needless drug against Kingpin Sid (a functional Way slimy Ken Metcalfe). Director Cyrene H. Working from a blithyl trashy script co-written by someone other than Santiago, Dickle Miller (!), Increasing unrest is animated with nudity and fierce marshall art battle scenes and the running time of 72 minutes of event decreases gradually. (Bell is clearly a squat guy wearing a giant Afro wig!). Specific lazy highlighting occurs when a topple bell exits a butt upside down in his hotel room exclusively. Felipe Sacdalan's raw materials, grains, scrached-up cinematography, gradually slows slowly, gradually slowing down, gradually slowing down.
