This little comedy of Ruth Gordon's hit game is a pleasure. Scripts based on the game, spicy, rich, and fully undated. But from the Cast I must be underlined by leading lady, Irene Dunne. Irene is simply superb - like normal - and enlightens the screen with each frame (and thanks to heaven, this is a lot). In addition, the director Vidor gave some unusual off-ups that mesmerizing him. What a girl I know any other Hollywood actress of any era who is so versatile in her multifaceted and every movie. Why is he a mystery known so small? I saw most of his films and it was astonishing for a solid ID fan like me. See it all!
