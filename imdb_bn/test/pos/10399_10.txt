Out of the cloud, awesome, nice work of the industry. The overall softness of this movie that is illuminated, wants you to touch the screen. The autumnal mood can only be achieved by a director who has seen many summer experiences. Or, make it an old man, in another way, in other ways. I know any other movies that captures the softness and softness of light and seasonal mood with such brutal quality outside the clouds. This picture is beautiful for almost everyone, as long as your ideas of beautiful women are Pneumatic Gold Bebo. The conversation is not really very important, it does not have any means of it, and forget it as a story. Some movies exist as visual experiences, it is one of them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, if you are interested in cinematography, photography, film direction etc. see this movie.
