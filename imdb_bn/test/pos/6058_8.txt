BI (4 outta 5 stars) Wow, I really do not expect to enjoy the movie as much as I enjoyed it. Sitting in the space of one day, I saw, I did not hear it one day. I saw Jack Webcam playing a military drill instruct that might be good for chocolate, but the film, such as "Full Metal Jacket" or "An Officer and Gentleman", is the latest film D. Eye. come. Pale than that. Boy, I was wrong. Perhaps Webbie is far better than her best note "Dragon" performance and has done a lot of good work. The delivery of his tough guy's conversation is just brilliant ... his patent depan has been done in monoton and still you * know that the person means every word of it. This story may seem a little haphazard compared to military movies, but I still think of the movie as attractive and compelling. Even an army nightclub was completely hooked to interlude me completely unnecessary musicals. Someone knows where I can get a copy of that awesome judgment conform song "If you do not, nobody else will be there"? Webb is always playing the most risky drill trainer ... and he is under pressure to grab out private private ovens of death but, by the lane, he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he will drag him out and scream out! Great stuff!
