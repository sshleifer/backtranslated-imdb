I love foreign films and this is among the best. I tend to not see it as a comedy as a list and find it a commentary on how others look around us. Leadership determination in the film is certainly not considered to be domestic in a very strong country, and people say things around it and do not say otherwise to others. <br /> <br /> Leaves information with an intelligence that can create or break free just the creator. :) This actress is wonderful as this character and it is a mood story. This movie contains an underlying story and almost many stories in the story. I hope that if anyone decides to make an American / English version of this film, it is not the case of three men and a child's vein which must be contradictory of this film, one must definitely see .....
