Five of the first films of St. Trinians were based on characters from the first (though the last is usually discounted) artist Ronald Sheryl's schoolgirl, and Milent Fryton, along with the Prime Minister, as well as the characteristics of the wonderful Alastar Seam in his own brother's drag. In today's PC world, most humorous, sensitive, sensitive and abusive - women are being sold to drinks, gambling, smokers, and later to the rich Arabs, but they are always in charge, defeating the statistics of bureaucrats, police, judges and other agencies. They maraud across England. Perhaps the films on television are seen regularly because the St. Trinayans still inspire the fancy dress team and club night. The film contains repetitive characters, including PC Ruby Gates (Jose Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). A fascinating film about the whole series 'The Happiest Dies of Your Life' (1950).
