I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of a 2004 edition of the first Friday of February 13. There were several cherry ingredients, but at the same time there was a lot of cooling. The storyline was good - if you have seen one or more horror movies, then one-lane full to predict. Observers have some memorable scenes of valuable. I have to do with some continuation of the problem character with the plot. For example, inside the opening scene horrible (which was on human, whose blood was drained to increase the crop), looked very real, but later they looked more like a terrible appearance, wearing a blue mask. The plot wanted a few spaces and the role was moderate, but at least it was what people said, like Hollywood movies where the conversation is actually a fake when you think about it. The final form of the last scene, when the main character says, "I'm not unemployed, I'm cone!" And scarecrow lops off the head is satisfied, for the most part of her friends that were killed by these animals at that time.
