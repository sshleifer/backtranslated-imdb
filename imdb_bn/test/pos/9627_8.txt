This is really a Kung Fu classic. This picture seems to have affected martial arts films for decades. Spanish guitar background music, competing schools, improving high speed at the edge of the rooftop, breaking spears, cheating in competition, secret training in foreign Karate techniques, patience exercises and perseasive, and many more copies were copied. "The Karate Kid" (1984), "Hero" (2002), "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004), and "Kung Fu Hustle" (2004). <br /> <br /> <br /> I was lucky after the first release of the film in 1972, just before it was released, the Kung Fu films became mainstream and before Bruce Lee became a family name. I saw two of my friends on a suburban suburb of the Snow De Diego Theater, and even though the scenes of red-colored hands and glorious eyes got a smile, the spectators were obviously taking part in it, as we had a little group. It was a very memorable movie for me. Even after decades of forgetting the title of the film, I can remember several specific scenes. This picture is special for me because since I first saw it (the day after the sailor Kenneth Lee Hines), this movie works as a reminder of the day before taking Judo and the next year Karte Lesson. <br /> <br /> Related to Kung Fu film, I would rate this image as 10/10. But since I need to remember big movie audiences, I will rate it as 8/10 due to obvious technical error. I only recommend that Niffu viewers consider the technical flaws to prove its authentic nature and prove its authenticity and then proceed to enjoy its testosterone-charged Mahmood.
