This film has everything for it: completely improved characters, a realistic depiction of working in Washington, Albert Brooks in person. Network news dubbing down is one more thing more than 1987. Remember, this was pre-cable! Attempting to achieve complex goals is happy to take care of complex people - and it all comes along with lightning speed. Romance is a such truth that illustrates the life of friendship that teeter towards. See if you can spot John Cusack as angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hacks from real-life Broadcast news? Finally, if you are from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's instructions for cab drivers!
