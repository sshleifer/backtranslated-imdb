This is a cherished movie from my childhood !! I can still hum a theme song at the hat drop !! I think this movie is too late to see with my dad, usually two to three times a year. We always mention it as "monster robot". Although the effects of this movie are crude compared to today's quality, they were suitable for the genre of this film. I'm a big fan of Japanese "Monster" movies, so this film gets better with others. I've been watching this movie for many years and want to get a copy of it for sharing with my 8-year-old daughter.
