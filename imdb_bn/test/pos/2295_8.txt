Mr. BASEBALL is a reverse film. Written and illustrated as a "light, sports comedy", it really has an impressive core of people and universal as something of the best of the cappuccino. Plot level, there is a great old American game of your baseball, it played in Japan - the value of America has diminished and Japan's prices have been overtaken by this game. (Some of the sponsors "Sports Comedy" results from Jack's ambiguity about how Japan's "Boss-Boreu" is played in Japan.) You also have a lead character who has presented the thunderbolt as a known base for the baseball star, but who is actually quite unfamiliar - Pro ball allows him to postpone growing up. And you have a lead character who has sternly resisted for his life changes, his new life, new director, new team, new team, and a new girlfriend, all of whom welcome him and try to accept him. Words like heavy things? Not really. This is a charming "clash of culture" comedy which takes place at national, sport, romantic and professional level. But if you see it sensitively enough, you'll also get a great story about a person who can give up his immunity and become very late in life (some make personal pain), and find success in places where he never hopes No I love the story, but I have great respect for Selek's performance; He bares his literal (literally) bares for throwing tantrums in a ugly American, humiliating people and public, then gives us inside these characters to understand his frustration. If you are a big fan of Tacakura, it does not hurt too. Mr. Baseball is a wonderful "loss of solitude" story.
