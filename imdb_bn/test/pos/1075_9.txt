Just seen this movie 2 days ago. Wine is a very attractive look of the people and our world through the world. I have no special interest in wine, and yet I found this very enlightened. The director gave me this impression that people like him have the power to show. He also publishes a lot below the surface, although he does not take a stand and leave that for the visitors. He shows many compassion towards humans (and dogs) and sympathy and tells people to tell their stories and at the same time they do not reveal what they want to say. <br /> <br /> This movie shows us where we are going, what are the benefits and how much we pay a heavy price. It is a film about the love of wine and the love of making it big, personal and global, character and formula. <br /> <br /> For me the real stars of the old wine makers with their confusing look and the world of themselves. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
