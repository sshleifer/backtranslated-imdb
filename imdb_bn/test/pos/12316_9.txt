In this adaptation of James Joyce's "Dublinsner" story, for his last film, John Houston instructed his daughter, Angelica, and he made us a donation to his best achievement to remember him. <br /> <br /> Jayes presents a traditional narrative about acting as impossible as anyone, but working with "dead" at least. Most of the important facts in the story (in fact, almost all of the lines) are spaces, characters, and expressions - there are big moments, but they are cerebral - they are not about making movies. But since, Houston gets it right, and he manages almost flawless adaptation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
