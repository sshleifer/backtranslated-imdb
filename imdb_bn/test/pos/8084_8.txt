It is a plot-driven movie and extremely entertaining. There is nothing surprising or intriguing in the plot, but very important, it moves along a great speed and so keep your attention. I do not notice the acting which is really good guess. John Mills was fined, but his life began to take some of the time to think about moving around him. She will clumped to the head, stand after 20 seconds, bow down herself and nothing happened as it happened. A strong quibble with a firm story, a film with authentic position and a plot which keeps you convincingly up until your conclusion.
