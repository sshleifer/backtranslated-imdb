People from two cities are driving through Hicksville in the USA when a deadly giant truck arrives suddenly and tries to run them on the road again and again. Taking hold of a mysterious blonde shooter, they fill a truck-stop with redneck amputees, one of which warns them 'out giant'. But they do not listen. Big mistake! Michael Davies's "Monster Man" surprises horribly comedy mixes. The story "Duel", "The Blair Witch Project", "Zipar Cripps" and "Texas Texas Genocide" is a stupid story, but there is enough violence and violence to keep Splattor Fix happy. I especially enjoyed the performance of Justin Youre, Comedy provides relief. So far, the complete lack of mystery is difficult to forgive, this is an opportunity, if you lose 7 out of 10 Have time. Did I mention that Aime Brooks is sexy?
