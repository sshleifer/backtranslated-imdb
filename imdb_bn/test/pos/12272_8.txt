This picture is good, but Shafler is not the best. My favorite is Papilon and Patton, but it's a sad and very nice film. Kris Kristoffersen makes this movie better and really makes a difference. I'm going to miss Shaffein and this is his last film. <br /> <br /> A great director like this picture! 7.5 / 10
