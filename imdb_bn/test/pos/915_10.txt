Most of Kieslowski's films seem to have a puzzle, which means to expand the mind and spirit. Characters are designed, not very believable, are ideal. However, Ces≈Çolsky presents their sleeping methods through life, with their complex interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or destiny, I believe in belief, I want to believe in Allah. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps "money" is more than any other film The only problem with discoverable "puzzles" paths is very little compared to other movies, and in some cases they become somewhat predictable. There is plenty of joy here yet. It's like a well-known brand wine - you know what to expect and how it is distributed, sometimes with a new flower found in old age - it's alcohol or yourself.
