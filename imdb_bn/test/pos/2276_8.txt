I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Based on Jonathan Safran Fowar's novel, Avituis Is Illumatine is directed by actor Leove Shereb. The script also wrote the script. In the film, Jonathan (Elias Wood) collected items from his family, from the toothbrush to the retainers until the scrap of the papers, which he recorded to his family's history, to seal the zippock bag and pins on the wall of his house. But it is clearly bare for his grandfather. All Jonathan is really a piece of jewelry to her and an old picture of her is a woman who hides her from Nazi during World War II. Jonathan decided to look for Ukraine to find a lawyer, thank him, and learn more about his grandfather. <br /> <br /> There are few characters running a tourism agency for the Jews, Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Lesin), who thinks he is blind, and who from his own memories and war of giants And the dog can face the mood of his grandfather. <br /> The screenplay effectively combines both humor and drama, because three characters travel through the village to find Jonathan's grandmother's city, drive deep and deep into the past memories. Perhaps the best performance is probably coming from Eugene Hutz, playing Alex Jr., who started the fun of the movie, wearing the tracktwo, breaking dancer, but just as Jonathan made some progress, but all the characters got their own illumination. <br /> <br /> Lave Screebber, Eliass Wood and Eugene Hutz were present at the screening and after the film, they did a very funny question-answer job: <br /> - Scriber was very close to his grandfather who Was a Ukrainian immigrant, and who died in 1993. As a result, he started writing his memoirs to the paper. Meanwhile, he was asked to read Four Short Story, The Very Regulated Search, which was quoted from the still unpublished novels. The Scribber had moved away from the writing quality, so that Frederick tried to do 107 works of the script on page 15. Contacted Sherburn 4 and talked about the nature of their grandfather, culture, movies and short-term memory. America; Finally, agree to accept the Fire Scrubbber book. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> As a filmmaker, he gave his budget and restrictions, he said, he will go to Milos Forman and instead of traveling the road. This fantasy culture inspired him to make the movie in the first place, the idea that "the past to imagine past love was truly worth remembering as well." <br /> <br /> - Sherebre said that the movie was a series of happy accidents. After failure as an actor in Ukraine, he was walking through the Lower East Side of New York, when he saw a poster in a woman sitting in the waist, with a lunatic cassade sitting next to him. Under the poster, Gogol Birdlow wrote the Ukrainian punk gypsy band name. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hughes summed up this story. The music was his first passion in acting as he was never purs pursued. One day, a friend gave him the book, and he felt like how he wrote the song; Screw sentence / syntax, language is my own. Afterwards, they received a call from a production firm, looking for eastern European music in eastern European music. Hutz meets Schriftber, and the book he reads on the film is based on that soon. Shortly afterwards, he asked Shereb Hutz what he thought about Alex and in any way he could do the character. <br /> <br /> - Fayar and Scriber talk about this movie after the fall of 2001. The events of September 11 were both in Europe and they talked about humiliating comments about Americans, which led to Americans trying to find Americans that the stereotype that American Americans had spread. Anyone looking for a history of crossing the borders of the country is painful, weak, weak, faultless, innocent. Shereb thought about this thought, and Elijah got up. <br /> <br /> Sareb's inspiration as the creator of the film is Amir Castro (I think who he is, who has organized a segment in another festival film, all the invisible children) who said, "You are not looking for actors, you are human Search. " Shereb said that Elijah had his heart goodness and kindness like human, which came across the film. Sherebber said that the eyes of an observer who is trying to reveal a character are important, and if "eyes are the door to the soul, Elijah garage door." <br /> <br /> - Elijah Wood made fun of a question about similar understanding between Kevin's character, Cina City and Jonathan, because both of them are blank slates that prove the emotions. He replied that Jonathan could still remember and seemingly without feelings, but all his things about his observation, his experience with other characters, and the environment he was in. <br /> <br /> - On the difference between instruction and writing: Schreiber likes to write many more articles and interestingly indicated as "hell". After his grandfather died, Sherba began to think about how some sense of history and how to protect yourself; Is he just driven by content or not, or explaining the work of other people? She said she likes the practice to find important to you, which is important to you.
