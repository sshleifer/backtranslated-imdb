It's very good on many levels. In fact, this was the first time the British Indy had a low-budget feature-director as director-director for most of the Nifost cast, it's a remarkable achievement. I do not know how much it costs. The 8,000 pounds image was publicly banded but you never know any reliability like this. The point is that the film looks like it spends millions of quads and it clearly spends on that special effect, awesome production design, effective props and costume, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and a small part Absolutely stunning sound mix. Even that said, the script was much great. The letters were clearly marked and everything had to be. It is about ten men at one place in the same film at the same time and it is easy for them to name anonymously, unclear but it has ten characters - most conversations and things were followed in response. When the plot was developing, when the script was developing, the script showed the story well and how it affected characters. If the whole movie is like a second act, it will become stunning. <br /> <br /> Twelve people explode from the ship in separate ponds or e-pods before the ship flies. They are not much more than the automatic metal coffins and the poor sideways inside are stuck, shivering, and they are not realistic about where they are going - but it implies. I like the e-pod - they have done a great idea very well and have a better understanding than a beautiful, handkerchief escape capsule. Later, we specifically said that we designed to escape from the ship, but we can accept it in an emergency - because, let's face it, these people were lucky to have their ships flown out. A planet so close. That said, 116 unused e-pods are still not looking at me like a flyer, and you would be surprised how the prisoner can get e-Pad - but he gets it. (And it happened to me: Captain will not let down with his ship instead of being the first man?) However, e-pods are nothing but all land on wild planets, sand and clear plants - or at least tropical waste and other racked planets in the jungle A sandy, slightly planted area. No, this is a science-fiction movie - it's exactly the same. We should admit that all the e-Pods fall into each other a few miles, so that ten survivors are possible, to fire each other in the sky to detect each other. <br /> <br /> Captain, a person's muscular mountain, who is getting the right agent, if you can start a career in career but decide to contact and contact Captain Behhan with whom they will meet Wants But they could not do it from the planet, they would go in orbit. Engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods, they probably can supply them with a sufficient amount of juice which is enough for bomb blast on the atmosphere in Anti-Grave Dodds. It can be done automatically but it requires a 'pilot' to send signals. The captain is bravely for volunteers, but in an appreciable, understandable step, the engineer points out that the most heavier man is ridiculous to have a few digitally repaired e-pods and it needs to be the lightest member of the team. That kid. I really liked his way that he is now named by his name David and Captain, treating him with dignity and respect. That was good story and good characterization.
