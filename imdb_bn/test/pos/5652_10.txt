The main achievement of this movie is that despite being nationally united, the film still runs to create a tablefuck of war illustrations, which expresses permanent identity with anyone who can see it and anyone who was present at this time. Although good movies may have the ability to universalize their issues, which are often difficult to do; Among the great films, they have the power to make their Unipolar subjects universal, which makes this movie. <br /> <br /> Instead of creating a context of unity, the film depicts Japan as the final final form of the Philippine War. In February 1945, he created signs for peace or war, but with the bloody hand of the defeated, he developed signs of war, death, destruction, victory and illness. Various and higher, such as the Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, which requires a ridiculous approach to both American Trappes to trivialize and distort, and uses all the nations as a struggle that is fine, yet not like a movie that uses a nation and scene, When created, the fascist will see America, the horrors of war, and what it really is. To show it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Through this character, through its illness, its conservation mouth, in February 1945 in the Philippines Seeing the end of WWII and America, Japan and the Philippines gathered in the bloody war of war, where you die <br /> <br /> This film is neutrally influenced by the cynical way of cinematic painting, which Rsakadera the original and useful, whether now or now, it has been used neutral strategy, which represents the image of the symbol in the form of fear, whether pacifism or a showcase for military war. Like Enero Zero Roberto Rosellini in Germany, a story environment and related conditions arise. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film, with the bilateral discussion between the Japanese soldiers, there is no preview and a reconsideration event. By opening this we think that struggle is against humans, and people with humans; It shows that they relied on each other to face the enemies in the past battle, but now, this opening of the Japanese experience in the Philippines or the new information in 'Pivot' is related to the main character of the game. <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br>> <br /> <br /> <br /> While we wade with stragglers as puddles and marshes as sick as land around them. The unidentified cadavers are strewn everywhere. Each can say now and then they are not a body, rock or corn. Apparently there is no difference, all dead and sick. All are dying. The foods they can not eat are rare monkeys and fallen comrades and / or bodies of unnamed enemies. <br /> <br /> Another person dies near Tumura's death. Although the soul crushed, and its crushing, some offered her body to eat her, but she refused; He still will not dive into the death of dignity and Japanese morality, such as the Hiyoshi khaguchi, such as giant and toy in the toy; For this he has to really keep his life alive, for a dignity. Therefore, when Nagamatsu is a soldier separator for the food, he shoots for his cause. Tamura can be used for the killing, but she can not explain for the illness of casualties and casualties. He is not a good man or a bad man. He wants to survive, but not easy to go straight beyond war-killing extra mile. His soul died on the battlefield, he is weak to live here and is not happy to erase the weak to survive. <br /> <br /> The illness that she carries in her is seen everywhere; And sadly, he does not fully perceive moral reasoning to think about others, because he can not give up his body due to his infectious disease, or can not fully think of himself, because he shows everyone a sickness, even though he is still killing them even If they do not harm anymore. The two Philippians saw his attack in the market. He can not see anyone. Someone can see. Just refrain from the disease and the contrast to health, the heart of the spirit of survival. <br /> <br /> Often, an arm indicates the left side of the screen, which should be expected, in it until the thulle their freedom is false. Yet it is blocked by American troops, Japanese stragglers gradually die in this disconolate dirt. Even a church appears in the tower, reflecting the light off of an invisible sun. But the nearby inspection crew flutter wildly about it; Religion is also poisonous air. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Historians have a great deal of controversy in their correct English translation, because non-Koreans translate it as "slaves" and "slaves", although many Koreans argue that Noah is not a slave system, but a job class system that does not fulfill the slavery Criteria Generally a way to escape the wrenching poverty. It improves on theme of war, and symbolism of soldier. <br /> <br /> Is not it important to ask our own questions about what will be achieved in our own history? Should we be comfortable to let unlocks be aware without change? This is not what we are fighting, the history of the age, but why are we fighting? The plains of the plain are with Eiji Fancoshi, Osamu Takjawa and Miki Curtis; Shawei is based on the novel. Japanese with subtitles
