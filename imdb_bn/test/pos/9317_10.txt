Before going ahead with the new millennium, I will go back once because I have completely forgotten about these gems !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, Disney was still able to start a series of films in the "low" 80s, "Inspector Gadget", a teenage teenager, entitled "Note Quiet Humans", who feels like a man Really a robot !!!!! Now with the technology of tomorrow's screens such as the 80s, "Trance" and "Honey, I Shrink The Kids" and combine it with the technology of tomorrow !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents remember that after coming back to this TV, when I was just born or something. However, my first meeting with this movie was in the Old Disney Channel (one time I saw it, and in other parts, on May 12th, in May, May 9, !!!!!!!) <br />! <br /> " Note Quiet Humans "is a very good series of movies, if you can find these movies again. <br /> <br /> Has it been shown recently? If so, give me an e-mail or personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
