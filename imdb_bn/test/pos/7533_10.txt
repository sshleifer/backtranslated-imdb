"Nagisa na sindabadabado" or "Like Greens of Sand" is an incredible story related to getting together with teenage children and their girls. This movie is not about homosexuality, but it's about sex. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Does he love Yoshida? Or he loves ITO? Or has he been "gay" because of an incident? (I doubt it) <br /> <br /> For what? Does she think she loves it till the end? Well, we all know that he loves her as a friend. But you will not see this movie once ... Haha :) Finally, Aihara (along with I.ToO) provides an exceptional message to the audience: it does not matter that you love a boy or a girl. And I will tell you, I do not get it so much that I get it first. ^^ ;; This is not because of the whole discussion scene ... You have to understand how the characters think and say through their actions and not by what they say (especially the final part ... whew, boy, that was confusing!) This is a confusing story, but Still beautiful. :) Of course, I see this one of the best Japanese movies (and believe me, I have seen a lot).
