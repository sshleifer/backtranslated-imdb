Student NURSES is not a general sexploitation movie. Sure, there is nudity and sexual exposure there, but for laughing it is not all. Stephanie Rathman wrote a socially compulsory, well-known tits and donkey film, which writes about racism, socio-economic discrimination, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, Vietnam War, free love, LSD and drug related issues. Test Four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing internship at the same time. Sharon (Ellen Giphtos) has termed Terminal Care Ward, Lynn (Brony Farel) in Public Health Administration, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh), Gynecology and Fred (Karen Carlson) in psychiatry. The viewers of these four beautiful men have many advantages and ridicule of joy, in which they take advantage. They release women to the height of sexual revolution, after all, and they are intelligent and cute as cute. The chaos is yet interspersed across the sequence of budget budgets. A bloody gun battle in the headquarters of the resistance movement, some of which were shot and some police members were shot dead. An anti-Vietnam war protests, the violence of Spokali-clad young people of all nations drawn by Scultan, became violent, police beat protesters. Effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful, weird and confusing sensory and memory montages with hyper-sensual overtones. In a nutshell, reflective and compelling reflection of a time expressed by student Norses real women's perspective (it was written and directed by a woman) However, despite the fascinating treatment of the content it is still fun and title.
