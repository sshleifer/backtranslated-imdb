It is one of the best films of all time in India. The plus points of the film are below ... <br /> <br /> Wonderful aspects, cinematography and editing, editing is very smooth and changes are excellent during the times. <br /> <br /> While the film shows the lives of police and the police in Mumbai, it is never boring or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The main actor is acting differently. Certainly he can become the best actor nominated for Academy Award. <br /> <br /> Controlled violence. Violence is controlled and the film does not turn into a bloody world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
