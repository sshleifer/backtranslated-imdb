This royal rumbl was originally wrestling messages these days. Gimic and image wrestling capabilities are more popular. <br /> <br /> HB vs. Edge. Beautiful match It was too hot for the agency, who resumed like a heel and how well HBO could get in a match. It usually got a little slow at the normal end. Overall this match gets a 6/10. Hendin v. Undertaker Not a good match. Undertaker had to carry Heidiniere through this match, who was really lost and washed his pants. Royce Gene was interesting to see Snysky and why this match came later. After this match ends, the fans are more interested in overall. 2/10 Cart Angle vs JBL vs. Big Show This match was slow, but in the last stage Angel got very quick. Cart Angle runs a little better wrestling and proves that she is the best outler out of the best match. JBL and Big Show hold a slow match. This match was bad at the end. In all these matches, 5/10 was largely due to cart angle. Ready Orton vs. HHH Wonderful heat for the good match, Randy Orton, who was in the match. Randy proves that he can go to the limit with a top star. This match is the first match of HHH, where no one is disappointed and does not save him from the loss. This match was about 6/10. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble match was just fine. Some surprises Some are not so good surprises. I did not give enough time in this match to annoy the cart Angle. But in this match there was such a guy that I never thought that would hit him so quickly. I do not know who will win. I give this match 8/10
