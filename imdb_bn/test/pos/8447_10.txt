I work at the nuclear power plant, so I'm leaving these answers. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station and you can see where you can work. <br /> <br /> I can not think of working in the safe industry. Our reporting procedures require minor incidents of paper cutting. Any problem detected as a potential concern for nuclear, radiological or industrial security is reported immediately in the corrective action process. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is to work with security in front of the United States nuclear plant.
