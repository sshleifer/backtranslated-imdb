I enjoy the El Chanie version of "Fantomom" and appreciate the Weber version of the book's growing interest, if romantic aspects are reduced but I want to find another mystery slash. I do not approve the truth related to the relationship between Andrew Lloyd Weber Raul and Christine. Thankfully, this is a comic lesson that does not have to be done with Eric and Christmas only. <br /> <br /> I thought I was looking forward to another version that matches the performance of the lone. I was wrong. Although Leslie Nielson is as fabulous as Erik, this certainly is a wonderful surprise. It's still brilliant. <br /> <br /> I especially wanted the area to look like a living body than the victims of the accident. I still can not see any other font from the LAN. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Should not be.
