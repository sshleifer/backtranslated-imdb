One of the greatest documentaries I've ever seen with this "Dark Day" I've been skating for an entire hour for my whole life, and I still love this movie. Parlotta and her excellent editor captured the feeling and the atmosphere, helped part with some incredible archive footage. Tony Alva is one of the coolest people of existence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Buy DVDs, you do not regret it .
