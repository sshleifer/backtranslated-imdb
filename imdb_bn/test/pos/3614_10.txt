A beautiful, sensitive film that brings the futility and cruelty of war to the so-called causes at any cost. The performance of the cage and cruise was quite impressive, but it is the ancient Greek character which is the highest praise. Irene Papasa is as gorgeous as before! Although some scenes sometimes seem a bit longer, this film will be a heavy rival to the Oscars.
