As a new person in college, this movie reminds me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation does not parrallel with Natalie Portman and Surandon's situation; But my mother and I usually grew up with the fights of mother and girls. Mom always tells you what to do, or not the kind of mother you want to be. I was bowling my eyes at the end of this photo. Response of Surandan His daughter's reaction was on the east coast, going a few miles away, after that she reminded me that going from New York to a small town on the west coast. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant for women who are now all grown up. It is very touching, I was moved by the movie. Each of the characters in this movie was completely realistic, you did not get any messy communication. I was sitting with credit in the screening of this movie, my mother wanted to sit beside me, so that I could embrace her and thank her for everything. This movie is certainly a bit corny, but everything is trully important. All about what a mother can learn from her child; And what a child learn from his mother. 8/10
