It will be one of Australia's best productions. I totally disagree with the comments of Rami Noor 101. <br /> <br /> This series shows the length of Australian friendship and how tall it is to help each other. The episode five 'AdG birthday' is a great example of this and it really holds the Australian spirit. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The innumerable number of funniest presentations of Gandhiji's street are man's soul and the fact that he never forgets the house, and it was a little like a music song that took them for a short time. <br /> <br /> As a nationally described opinion of the Japanese people, it can be said that you can not change. The Japanese treated Australia very badly and represented it, otherwise it would really be very confusing. Properly comment about the script is false. These six stories have been told in Syria that the actual P.O.D. Collected from experience. <br /> <br /> Actors were fantastic; My opinion is best, Matthew Newton. His performance as the first episode David was wrenching the intestines. Being a city boy, being another unnamed face to his captors. We make him change dramatically due to his violent attack in the first episode forest and in more episodes we can see how this phenomenon has changed him, he is aware of what is really happening and always helps the other members of the Secret Nine. <br /> <br /> <br /> Stephen Kario is notable. His performance on Eddie's birthday is remarkable, from the group's Lorikein, the sick, the weak and unable to take care of himself. The display of this episode gives you an emotional level and makes you proud to be an Australian. <br /> <br /> I studied WWII at the university level and found this series, if it is not physically truthful, spiritually truthful but what it was as an Australian soldier captures the true spirit. <br /> <br /> The good work of John Dwell for capturing the soul of Chongi.
