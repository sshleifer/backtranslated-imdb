It's a thoughtful and well-shot and directed TV movie that took a great deal of clarity and intelligence, and it provides a film treatment that looks great on a big screen - Palette is somewhat silent for the TV. If you are looking for a Action Action movie or "Bosnia Lite", it's not for you - this is about a common woman who has had a great challenge for humanity. If you want to know more about the conflict and how a woman's work heavily influences, then see this movie when your movie comes. I do not see that many TV films have worked on issues related to genocide and racial hatred at this stage. The story "bad guys" avoid obvious demonization, and instead of denying and daily hate shows that thousands of deaths result. I was transferred to a number of points, allowing driving and music to some manipuluted Hollywood tracks, including MyS-in-scene driving, but to discover the horrors and effects of characters. This is a bold movie that is enough to tell the content for itself and it reduces the visuals to support it with dignity. <br /> <br /> Players work in the drama scene to come to life. The victims testify before the war tribunal becomes stronger, and Vend√©e Krusun, Stipe Erase and Heno Farch are excellent. William Hart's British accent is awful - someone else did not allow him to play Britton, and when he finally ended, he killed it! And even though John Carbert's body was born to play a soldier / commando, he was very good, though he did a good job.
