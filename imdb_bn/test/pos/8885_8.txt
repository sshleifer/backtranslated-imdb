When I watched this movie in my childhood, I did not understand the comedy of Hitkov film and dark comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good reason for this movie because I created some interesting comedy of Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito's comedy couple. , Slopstick (frying pan and car scene) and oral (arguments / conversations on threat and writing) are both. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Larry Denner (Crystal), who played a struggling writer who stole his superiority, his wife Margaret (his amazingly brilliant Kate Malguru, star Steak Trek: Viagger from the lawyer Captain Genwe). <br /> <br /> When he shifted the author's block and taught creative writing classes, he met the student Oven Lifts (DeVito), who surprised an aspiring writer and uncle's son, who is still sadly still working as a child Do it. He has toy train tracks, I need to say more? Think of the failure, only Matt McConnie is small, fat and cheeks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oven stuck in his own life. He advises how to get advice from Larry, and when he thinks of going to Hitcock films, he thinks wrongly that if he killed Larry's wife, he would return to her and kill her mother. Hilarity ensues when two try to deal with each other's problems. Oven went to great length to kill Margaret, when he refused to agree to Larry's "part of the plan", Oven's mother made him crazy. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film Larry and Owen slowly but surely a bond of rare friendship in dark comedy nowadays. I really love a part of a movie where Wayne sees Larry collecting his coins and can say more than that. <br /> <br /> Aside from two major stars, late Anam Ramesses is a happy mother, and with his cane that fatal. She opposes her role as Mama Fratelli from Goonies as verbal and physically much more comedic. So he curses like a sailor and belts his son every time, but his character makes it so vivid. She makes her character the kind of person she loves to hate. <br /> <br /> Another treatise in this movie is the music of Jazz Great Brandford Marcellis, who plays Larry's neighbor and friend Lester. There is a great moment in the film where he plays jazz for Larry, who is depressed and needs some good tunes to relieve pain. Jazz could do it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < This is one of those rare movies where both of them shine in their own fine ways. Davito's baby comedy and Crystal's sharp mind made this movie for me. 5 star comedy.
