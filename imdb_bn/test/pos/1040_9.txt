Has anyone found the way to purchase a copy of this series yet? I can see that many people have asked, but I can not tell if someone has succeeded. It is hard to believe that today's good series will not be seen by the people, especially on the real problems of real people, which has exciting and exciting time in our country. How can it be true and what can we do to change it? Aside I agree with other comments other writers have made about this series on this web site. A wonderful story about this event that everyone should be aware of and should know something about today. We've seen this series since at college or almost that time a lot. Now we want to share it with our children ... but can not we? If this is true then will some good content be relay to the same information?
