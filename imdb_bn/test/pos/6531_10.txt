I'm probably too old for this movie, the story of being 16 years old and a guy is a little girl, but I really think it was a great film overall. All the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses, from Allan to Adrian, Dina, Kimberly, a beautiful girl who played the little sister of Ralph Rakeel. I'm not a huge pop-star fan with a lover of music, but I think Haroon Carter has done a great job about this and it seems that he was really in the film and it seemed to be real. My mother loves the big boy, so it's very cool. I thought I liked a lot of people, and wondered if I could see them again? A crossing should be cool. I hired it, but I can also buy it because I have a DVD ton and I want to go back to see what I missed. Although I could not buy it at Blockbuster, so now I do not know where I can buy now, but I'll look at it. However, I'm a 16 year old guy, I already said that, I know, but I must take a date to fully see it. It really is really good for all ages. I think my little sister can also see 6. It's so cool about that, it's something that you can see in all ages. I'm sure I have been done on purpose, but it really works. Girls dream about dreaming with Aaron Carter and boys like me dream of all the hot girls in this movie. There is something for everyone.
