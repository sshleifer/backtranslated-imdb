Reverse Ed is a very annoying film by Neil Jimenez, a complimentary American screen writer. It was based on an actual event that most American youths are trying to live their lives. This is a great movie. Created by American director Tim Hunter Most of the movies are focused on a helpless murder committed by a painful teenager. This unfortunate incident has created a complete range of questions about the real motivation of the American community. Those who saw this film in his time, must have a lively role as a sympathetic social deviation of the initial release, with great animosity, Dennis Hooper's vivid memories. Matroos star Keanu Reeves looks good as a young man before reaching the star. While tin flickers are made without any serious preparation, it is hoped that the "edge of the river" can not be ignored simply because of another stupendous agony. The people who lived during their sleeping days had a huge impact on the people living in the past. It was not like the birth of birth, for today's generation Facebook, Twitter and Orkut, the river's bank may seem old, but its importance can not be denied by a serious movie supporter.
