Hello all you dirty dance fans !!!! This message came across the board and it seems cool when I was bored one day. I absolutely love DD! I first saw it at my friends home at the age of 13 (now I am 17 years old) and got !! I saw there at least 10 times and soon afterwards, I bought the DVD for myself. At this stage, I have reminded most of the script and whenever I ask about it, it can read. "Did I have watermelon?!" It's so bad that I bought soundtracks and recorded Mickey and Sylviere songs, and now the ringtone on my phone !! Most of my friends think it's a shit film, but I do not think about it, I know it's brill! I was reading the comment before and there are a few questions for you - 1. Why are you asking for a frivolous question like Lisa and how old is the child? I do not think it is very important. They are teenager 60, is not enough? Where have you got this special edition that you are all talking about? It sounds very interesting ... answer this. I want to see the opinions of other fans ... Cheers! charliesangel415 xxx
