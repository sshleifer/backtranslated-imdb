A number of cartoon Scooby Doo movies, "Scooby Doo and Loch Ness Monster" is entertaining, exciting, interesting, fun and it's a wonderful explanation of Scotland's Highlands. An annoying aspect of the film is the voice of many characters - Americans are trying to hear the Scottish word in this film, unfortunately it does not succeed well (though some people do better than Scottish pronunciation than others). <br /> <br /> Dafen came to the Highlands to see his cousin Shannon and the Highland Games in Bluff Castle. Grewal told Shannon that he had looked after the nurse's mind. When more chaos is created, the mystery company has another secret in their hands ... <br /> <br /> It is good for the people of Scotland who want to know more about Duaar and Scotland! Enjoy the "Scooby Doo and Loch Ness Man"! :-)
