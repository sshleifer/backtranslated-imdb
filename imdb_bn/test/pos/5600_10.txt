In the book book, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who appeared at the JMK Airport on December 31, battled with Thomas J. Ryan (Satan) in the new millennium, and came forward through war through determining the fate of the world. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Hartley has created a strange world in which the general beauty flows through strange and strange creativity - David Symonds (client accountant from Curtant) and strong urban and industrial landscapes are full of bright lights and shadows. Naturally, he introduced seemingly apparently formal descriptions, then brought them back in the sunny and unexpected topics - humor is easy, but chatter and strangers. Hartley has a wonderful ability to build on the mundane and insulting short and rapturous moments together. Naturally, he created a tone which is Zed and the world is tedious but at the same time, weak, open and honest. He was transformed into a lot of humorous language in a few minutes, which is difficult to hold in tears despite the lack of clear emotional expression that is so dead-perfect and perfect that is spiritual and poetic. Another awesome and very entertaining movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> All of Hartley's movies have a way of getting the current priority, but this unique effect cleans the image into the first screen of the screen, but you become increasingly beautiful like sitting on it. The final shot is spectacular. It may seem all that valuable, but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself, though it makes fun of the idea of ​​Armageddon, Judgment Day and "City of Civilization". Although it is actually quite deep, moving, and guaranteed in life, it is mostly light-hearted and playful. Hartley is developed in his film, acting as the following vowels (a voice which does not get a few people, and requests such an act to be a hall - the same person who has negative reactions on Peter Greenway). As always, this movie responds to those who react and envy this movie - people think of Hartley's sudden transitions and whether they are proactive or systemic strategies - but anyone who likes this movie on Hartley fan (if they have a chance to see it Can get, that is). It's hard to tell what it will be like on the video.
