The director of Kannathil Muthamittal, the first Indian film I had seen, "Dil She", which gave me four month courses <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br />. I can say that I understand the total attraction, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a wonderful movie, I did not know what to dance and what to do to the woman < br /> <br /> The voices for my Western ears were a bit intense, but the way I found the excitement of AR Rahim. I bought the soundtrack the following week and then put it in the next week, bought Kuch Kuch Hata Hai and K3G and "Ichi" <br /> <br /> Some other Korean movies except the "killer", I would not be bothered to see more of Hong Kong's strict diet <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > Kannathil Muthmitalake, it is Moni is one of Ratam's latest efforts and I laughed, cried, got all the madness, was scared and most of the time I did not feel silent. Acting was fantastic, the photography was beautiful, I think you can stop the movie at any time and notice that any frames will be eligible for painting. The song perfectly fits the movie and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm trying to meet again, so I did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What about all this great movie! I stood up and congratulated my home theater when it was over! <br /> <br /> My wife is watching now, and I can not wait for her reaction, I can not expect that it will be something less than me.
