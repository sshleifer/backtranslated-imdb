If you want to follow your heart and do not leave your dream, this is the greatest movie. Elizabeth Taylor Velvet and her chief (her childhood, at least), Mickey Rooney is a cruel friend who eventually became her trainer and she goes to Grand National Steeplechase with her favorite horse "Pie" - "Pirates" - only the opportunity to become a Velvet Jockey There are. I do not finish you with those who have not yet seen it, but you will see it and once you like it. Note the young Angela Lansbury as the eldest sister of Velvet.
