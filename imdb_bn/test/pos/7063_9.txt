No, it's not a citizen. But do you want it to be like "metbles"? This is the best summer camp movie of all summer camp films. Quote "Little Darling" line by someone line? Or "whitewetter" Every time I feel guinea, I insist on "Spaz. Spaz spaz spaz." Or when we walk on the grass in the woods, I tell my husband, "I'm Woody Dab Wabbit." (He will not get it). "It does not matter. It does not matter." I mean, this thing is classic! <br /> <br /> Although frustrated with the DVD. Wish was special features, perhaps making a commentary or a. But the film itself is a perfect snapshot of life at the age of 70, at the end of the '70s. Maybe not my life ... you can not help but every time you want to watch this film, short shorts and knee-high socks and birds will roam in the woods.
