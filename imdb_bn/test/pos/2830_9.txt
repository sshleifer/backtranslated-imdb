I would recommend that only Valentines are one of the most original and interesting and sometimes rotten movies that peak in some ways. Brave, wonderful, and some of its best western areas (- no, no, of course, not a Western, but rather a military chronic, which is sometimes good -). Is it quite low? Budget, however, oh, very original and interesting. It is one of the people who gets the true buff never; Anyone still told you that they exist what are you saying? Feel curious or interesting ?? And it exceeds your expectations. <br /> <br /> In everything, this script has made the level of maturity abnormal for the West? And it reminds me, officially, of Uzgana; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Have unexpected touches? As the blonde girl kisses and she does not want to marry, she is flirting with him, perhaps for her justice and feelings of vengeance? <br /> <br /> <br /> Even? Simply ?? Much more than a military story ?? This is an action drama, a suspense movie, a commando / action thriller ?? Wonderful combo imaginable; A bunch of soldiers in a special campaign to prevent and stop potential negative attacks ?? - In insane decision not to move all the available troops to the place where the citizens can be stopped? But only a few people ?? - And this plot ever takes a rough route? And what is the most ?? People's interest, and their causes and actions never fail. <br /> <br /> Peck is a true word about yourself; She performs with Brio, and although I usually find her famous movie rather insomnia and annoying, as small as I find out all the peak's evenings and even flashing glamor. She was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to recommend this awesome movie.
