I do not know exactly what it is, but the film is sitting happily sitting on my vacation, and I have no idea to leave ... Phulasi has created one of the most ridiculous, intertwined, cheek-infested and well-known films. Never seen Not sure what to say about it, but I love this movie !!! Steak Tatar's view is absolutely obnoxious, and the tragic Fiasco of the whole Nazi persecution is a strange smile ... I'm not sure what Floris was trying to do, but anyone who heard this based on this photo, Floris complained that the whispered Crowe has accused " Scream "with him? "Bit In the Brain" is absolutely essential for bad movie lovers ... yes I'm sure this is not a "good" movie, but I'm sure some scenes will keep your mind forever! An exercise in this craze, man ... I guess that if I was a "serious" critic I would give it 3, but very enjoyable (again I can not explain my love) I think it's a 7 .... really Jerk out ...
