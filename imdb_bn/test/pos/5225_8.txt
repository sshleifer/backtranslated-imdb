It is astonishing to see it today and how far we expect from a movie, how far we have come and thankfully, how many painful ideas have been established. <br /> <br /> Here's our full-spoken story telling film - audio and visual are pushing their time limit. Framing belt-high and up-limited - no mouth-off-up. <br /> <br /> Compositions are awesome; There is a primary over-shoulder cross-cutting scene for displaying conversations; Some annoying perspective has a traitor descendant in a canyon with angles; A sun-bleaching skeleton is in the dust as the wheel and the upper part of the foot frame; The thrill of the showdown between the heroes and the bad guys is seen visually by filming on the long axis of the big tree; And on and on - the first visual treatment of plenty. <br /> <br /> Today, young Wayne carries a film, uncertain to see it look arrogant or unencumbered by the approach. <br /> <br /> If I think Walsh is self-referencing: the pilgrims travel to a different group; The stage actor who appeared on the screen, Voodoovil Comedian, Shell Gameist and perhaps, a wonderful group of Carney Barker and ten-in-one show veterans. They start the journey together for how to create movies. <br /> <br /> At least one philosophy is seen that many visual ideas inspired in the next movie have been encouraged.
