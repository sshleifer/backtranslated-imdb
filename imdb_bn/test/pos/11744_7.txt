Based on the 1952 autobiography "A Main-Splendor Thing", "Love Is a Man-Splendor Thing" (1955) tells the story of Han Sueen, in 1935, a widowed widow of Hong Kong, Eurasia doctor Han, focused on romance, married Marc Elliott American journalists. "I do not want to feel anything again," Han told Mark soon after meeting them, but two soon develop mutual tenderness for each other and who can blame them? Mark William Holden starred in the peak near his hockey-dude era (next year's "picnic" in the top), in the first three years of the first three years, in the first three years, Holen In China (1960's "The World of Suji Wang" and the 1962 "Satan never Sleeping "like others). And Dr. Hahn played Jennifer Jones here, who is not Eurasian (most of Nanny Cawn and other foreign Holden films, in contrast to France's NuyÃªnien), did a credible job of passing as one. Whether Cheongsam, the European franc, the surgical gown or (hubba-hubba!) Bath suits, Jones looks ridiculously gorgeous here. No wonder the previous picture is so dramatically west! Her two interesting Lead Stars, exciting Hong Kong scenery, beautiful cinemascope and color, Oscar winning dress and wafts through the classic, Oscar-winning title song, which is a lovely incense film, "A multi-splendid Things of Love" quite a winner and romantic concoction Be out Han himself did not take care of the film, so I can only imagine that great freedom was taken with its source material. Yet, I've enjoyed it. And if the end of the film comes to the eye, remember Mark's knowledge: "The greatest tragedy of life is not liked."
