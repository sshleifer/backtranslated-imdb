"Don Before All" is one of the best Slasher movies. It is very realistic and atmospheric This reminds me of Tobey Hooper's "Texas Censo Genocide" and "Distribution". Dobara Benson is a very nice heroine and director Jeff Lieberman is very curious and dark movie. "Just before dawn" beautiful pictures and soundtracks are very annoying. I never <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not like slashing films or cows except this image. Many fascinating and strong movies (at least for me)
