One of the things I like about PT Anderson is that his talent can reach his opponent, which most people push the side or push the side and make them bigger. Case-in-point, a wash-up ... Bart Reynolds offers a great performance in this movie. And if Adam Sandler proved that a great actor (punched drunken love) was not enough ... Here Mark Hollberg comes ... as you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> I think many people have passed up "Boogie Knights" because it is anti-porn, or just hate flat-out adult art and can not ignore that view of this movie. But then there is a great story about those who lost the letters and fought for their own recovery. There is a beautiful movie ... and it is very bad that enough people see it.
