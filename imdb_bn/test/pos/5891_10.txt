The best year of our lives is to keep the feelings of my youth and the feelings of that time completely. The throwing uniform was surprising. Probably Dana Andrews was the best player in his career and he should have been nominated for the Academy Award. This movie has so many wonderful scenes that it is almost impossible to list them all. Cinematography is the best of a movie. This movie was a time capsule like the 1940s. To watch movies for a true movie fan. Some critics have said that this movie has been age. I disagree. The human desire theme is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans who come back from the fight will always be with us. This is just a great movie - which can be seen again.
