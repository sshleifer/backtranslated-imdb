Well, it's new ... a famous Italian horror director Lucio Floris, a famous Italian horror director who painted a movie ... Lucio Flori After years of horrific sequence and difficult years, Luciano became difficult to separate the reality from the words and he often threatens violent murder. She quickly descends more into an incredible endless spiral worn crazy and incredible. Even devoted psychologists can not keep Phuc Phichi in the right direction ... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertaining standards, the cat in the brain is certainly one of Phoolchy's most happy films. The Gotta is omnipotent and hypocritical, at least say. It is impossible to describe the number of filthy genocide, especially when you manage to get your hand in the fully featured version (above mentioned: "nightmare concert"). Depletion around, the intestines of the victim spread all over the screen and the chains are working more time! The film has become very strange (it is highly exaggerated) and a perfect experience for meeting friends with a group of fridge bikes. Of course, from this more professional perspective, this product can not be called an excellent composition! The lack of identification or the atmosphere is not the least bit, and the letters are completely empty-headed. To build more room for Gore, the letters are being started for 5 seconds and later die of a terrible death. This is especially compared to Phulasi's highlights - like "The Bound" or "Doing to Torture" - this movie looks like a hot hot saikak. The best way to explain "brain cat" is by direct comment on individual statements made by Phulchi and censorship. Perhaps after watching her many movies ?? Especially later ?? The censorship has been cut by the committee and is screamed by pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted to revenge himself with a poor mess, which can not be cut! If you highlight all the obvious violence and true sick make-up effects, you only got 10 minutes footage left! Especially because after this crazy carnage in the film, Fuchi appeared as Halucinates. Like stuff you can think about our director: "Let's see how you're going to make this sensor now!" Even the full development of intelligence investigation is also in the background. Has the victims missed by their friends or relatives? Looking for the details of a police officer who will take away their killer? You do not know and Lucie does not bother to tell you about it, because it will lead to the sequence which will not be needed for cutting. Oh, and it's pretty awesome as well! The name "Mr. Phulasi" or even "Luciano" is mentioned every 3 minutes (34 times throughout the entire movie), and our director obviously enjoys being in spotlights for change. Hey, I do not blame him ... After more than 30 years of fascinating film supply; He deserves a little extra fun You are a God, Mr. Phulki!
