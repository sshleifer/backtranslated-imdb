Although the film is 17 years old, the film produces the spirit of modern "elite" food grains. Permanent policy in the film: Food is not just nutritious. This is a powerful symbol and a medium for culture. Main characters literally get inspired by idealistic thinking and culture, to get the best alcohol and food screwed, as they give their puritanism and emotions-denial table entertainment go. Using the difference between North Europe and South Europe, Karen Blixenshin points to the summary of their spontaneous different approach to diet. Harder than "Eros" from the south and rather the Scandinavians entered the dust, the party went away. So what are you waiting for? See it again ..... again!
