I think this is a great, classic giant film for families. Joke, what a machine! Long animals of wild animals, flying green peculiar, chrathangas / maias or whatever they have and lunar men talk telepathically with them. Rubber suit men fighting for a doll for men's war um! Yummy! Class, what else can I say? How do they make a 2002 rebuild?
