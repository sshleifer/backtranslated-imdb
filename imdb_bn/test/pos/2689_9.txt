I really have a t.v. Surveillance - 6 to 8 years old and "General Hospital" was still Luke and Laura - but there are some exceptions and I certainly think "Queen of Kings" is one of them. It's classic in every decade and I think this show (or something extraordinary) should be the seratum of this decade. Her comedy timing is awesome and, at times, may be the odd bottom right. Make more notes than being more successful to convey more 'serious' actors - and not so delicate :) - The complexity of their characters without getting too much vocals A commenter has written that it can take a few episodes to enter it and I agree; It is certainly one that grows on you but once you enter, you are quite interesting. And for good reason!
