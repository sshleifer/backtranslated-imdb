On more than one level, I can describe what can happen in this movie very personally. And I can tell about it, it is true, what is the end of the story of Dexter's mother: She really 'cured' her son by removing her sad feelings and loneliness. <br /> <br /> This movie focuses on a visit that I can very well agree with. We're all going to die a day or soon after. Finally, we do not live that time, but at that time we have fun / good time / happiness. This is not the quantity, but quality quality. <br /> <br /> I think if you have not already done so, other words used here will not be more than the time you see this movie. I really want to see it release DVDs. Surely it will be added to my 'Classic All Time'!
