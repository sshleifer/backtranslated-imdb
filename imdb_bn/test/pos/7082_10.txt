If you are an IMDb viewer, then you have high honesty in the best of 200, but this film is probably not for you. As Steve Fear's self-aware hip, this picture is unity. Renee Zengler is a writer of Hip Unburn magazine, who returned to his suburban backyard county home to take care of Mother Strip (who still offers another off-fame performance). William Heart is ideally laid and steadfast, unbelieving and arrogant husband. If this movie does not let you cry or laugh, you too have more hips to enjoy it.
