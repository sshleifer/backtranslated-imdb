Why did Ramon (Carlos Fúñez) bring his five college companions to a distraught abandoned school building, which used to serve the black sheep children's wealth? That answer could be false in a diary of his possession assumed by his death father. What they come in contact with is a recovery phase involving six groups, out of which five of the five strange years ago, the five potential terrorist security guards (Paul Nasi) could have captured graphic fate. But, terrorism is waiting for them to find a way out of this place, since the group runs as a scary moment in running for their lives, often like the Panic, the killers begin to find and destroy them in various bloody areas. The way. Will Ramon and his companion survive in this night's night or will they be resurrected ghosts on the same night as before? <br /> <br /> That professional shiny and strong, violent cruelty match in the stylish Spanish slash. Some merciless exchanges between characters. Their portrayal of the conversation is a reference to the pop culture of American horror films which can disturb some viewers. Being a tragic kidney was really dangerous with Kidis, he attacked them gradually ... like a bloodless dog who made his violent activities selfish. I made loud musical symptoms a little annoying and filmmakers use flashbacks from previous incidents as a reminder to the audience. I do not think these strategies are essential, but it has been speculated that the director wanted to communicate with the audience so they used cues and flashbacks. A small diverting is going on for the plot of this film and the cameras follow the character movements and how they react to the situation of chaos presented. The end of your enjoyment of this photo may end up in your recognition of the unusual supernatural aspects of the plot. From time to time and a killer who is apparently continuing his work from the grave. The turn seems to be somewhat annoying and casual, but working (or maybe not) may work on how the story is going on to show Raman's father how to rebuild these deadly incidents two decades ago. I would say that if this image is verified in detail, it probably will not catch it, but it is a new wind breathing as a slash flick.
