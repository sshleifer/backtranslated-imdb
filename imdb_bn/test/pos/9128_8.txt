How good is this picture? Obviously, they're good enough to rebuild it in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us the Lay Dowles and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this picture. <br /> <br /> This image is almost silent. These few words men, their actions prefer to speak for them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Volonte (Dollar is a Fistful and El Indio from a few dollars). The pictures do not shine on them; They are also on the ride that have Melville for them. Melville makes film; They make it even better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work on ocean movies, but they get this idea. She could not work like it. A big loss in seventeen years, but his work remains for our pleasure.
