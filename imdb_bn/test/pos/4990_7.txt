"Kamchanchi moon" everything was for him. For beginners, a person named Simon Winchester's back, synonymous with high-quality TV Westerns. Unfortunately, there are some of the "moon" problems that most talented directors can not solve: a bad script based on a neutral novel. Forget about historical sanity - Can any reader of the novels say that you, "the moon", is the biggest quarrel that is not compatible with "Loneme dove" Masterpiece information. Many surprising, rich moments and even a greater degree in the miniature, in the book, not completely missing in the "moon". Due to the fact that most of the "visitors" of the Moon are probably bringing at least "Dove" background, lack of character-driven and emotional backstory is less painful. <br /> <br /> That said, "the moon" is an example where the adaptive version can change to make it more suitable and should be changed. For example, the novel "moon" focuses mainly on the substrates. For its credit, miniseries tried to serve the comanches, but ultimately it is enough for them that the audience gets a sense of missing them in some important parts of the story. Likewise, Val Kilmer's school has lost here - the role has to be increased, so the killer (and Rachel Griffiths on that) actually had to do something, or the roles should only be reduced to small, supporting parts. Instead, Kilmer gets the top billing for a character which completely abandons the scratching final act of your body after you leave scratching your head. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments in life, those who do not read the book (what the killer stereotype?) - they have no idea - there is no more scenario that shows us that call and macro are some of the amazing Texas Ranger . Their only expedition (or "dead man's walk") on the moon does not end smoothly, and in calls and macros, they seem to forget their way through a pointless mission. <br /> <br />, Larry McMarty was not supposed to be writing scripts, and another cowboy film did so because of the praises surrounding Brokeback Mountain. Macmarty can write good novels (though there are some differences on the compatibility of this statement), but he has never established himself as a writer. This production will not only benefit from bringing the director Vincent back, but the main screenwriter Bill Witcliffe will be able to fit the novel on screen. Whitcliff's screenwriting credit does not have a mountain supply, but he can not deny that he did some extraordinary work while hitting the original "Lonomov Dove". With all these words, the "Commons moon" is almost a brighter product, which is assisted by a terrific cast, which is unfortunately not enough to just enough. Gav McKay's screenplay of Steve Johan - or rather, Robert Duval's picture is like Gus McKay - he died. And Carlow has criticized the city as a vodro call, his performance does not imitate the calm, Stoic Woodrow of the original movie, I can say: blame McCmarti, because Macmartry is "moon" "novels and now miniseries - socially unknown, weird, but natural From the leader to the vadro, in some emotional character whose lines are neutral and whose motivations are simply It is clear if you showed them that they "" <br /> <br /> However, with the same feeling of consonant that I gave up on the wave of the wave in the "moon", I felt the real "lonemore dove" - ​​this time Because I have realized that this is probably the last time we'll see for this long, long-term display on the screen - and quite honestly, this cast is a well-caring, fully-blown net Work TV has done so well in the series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Lornem Dove novels include such rich backstory for characters that were interesting, completely attractive to see the translation on the screen. Unfortunately, McMartners are tedious, incompatible, and finally irrelevant, all that has been removed for preview.
