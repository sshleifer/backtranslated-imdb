(The original version of 1980 was not reviewed, not restored in the 1980's), in a country where the king does not like anybody, and no one likes the king, and the chimneys swim away from two nearby paintings and leave it. King is a portrait, who loves shepherdess, killed the real king and took his place. A huge bird, a wonderful bird in the head, acts as a hero and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a strange weird movie ... no miracle, not very real. <Br> <br /> Background style is very European, although characters meet with Warner Flowers, but the primary character of the non-main character is Warner, Warner. They are both realistic and cartoon move like meditation. <br /> <br /> This is a diverse film and it takes a bit of it but the riot, its kids and puppy are wonderful as the pet Ustinov bird. Rubber duck police and a beer design that lets you laugh. <br /> <br /> And the film's deeper philosophy, there is a world existence ... out of the city on the metropolis. <br /> <br /> This is really a clear movie. If you're with it for a full ride, it's something extraordinary and unique that can reward you. It is not perfect, but what is hell <br /> <br /> This is a movie for searching. Buy it if your local tender DVD is Bint CAPCOM version (associated with Alice in Paris). It should cost you at least Rs.10, and the price is absolutely valuable, especially when you realize that it comes with two full-length cartoons, two small cartoons and several clean ads and other fun things.
