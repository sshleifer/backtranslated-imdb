I saw this movie for the first time in the Saiffi file and I must say ... it was just awesome. 'The Never And End Story' is among those who will bring back memories of this movie for you. It's a 1996 movie though it seems like a fantasy which has a hazard like setting and appearance. The acting was brilliant and the music was great especially in the fight songs and end songs. See those who still have to see it! I fully recommend!
