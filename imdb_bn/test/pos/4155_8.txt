"Nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the "Golden Door" in the United States) is written and directed by Emanuele Crieseese. This movie is different - and, I think, better than most of the poorest people who leave Europe and come to the United States. <br /> <br /> This image starts with poor, rural areas scenes. Seycilli We've always heard that Sicily is a rocky island, but you can not understand the true meaning of the word because of not seeing the first half hour of "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The middle of this movie is a long journey to the United States. Most of the immigration films show us ten minutes of being in the third-class category, and then we see our Statue of Liberty. This is not the film - we get a sense of life down the deck, and it's not charming. (We do not actually see the Statue of Liberty.) <br /> <br /> Finally, the film will give us another ten-minute Alice Island, and then the immigrants walk through New York's Lower East Side. Not here - Alice Island's experience is about one-third of the footage. <br /> <br /> Vinceenzo Amoto is as great as Salvatore's Mancuso, who brings his two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsberg is just as good as Lucy Reid, who is a mysterious English woman who spins Indonesia. <br /> <br /> There are some strange touches in the movie, especially Nina Simone's song soundtrack. There should be some symbols there, but I did not understand it. <br /> <br /> Another critic has already said that this movie is better viewed in theaters instead of DVD. Still, big screen or small screen, it's worth finding out.
