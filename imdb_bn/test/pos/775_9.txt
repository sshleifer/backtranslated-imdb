I saw this photo on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very fun. Their role in Julie Walters and Rupert Green was perfect. Julie Walter receives a special mention by creating an amazing variety of interesting looks. Ben's character is very shy and stoic, but has played amazingly by Green converted, I must say that he has a future to play after Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ben's father also had an interesting contrast to his mother, and in the end he was very respected. The only character I did not have was Brianne, she was a bit bit unnecessary. <br /> <br /> This is a great comedy drama which is very easy to see. One of my favorite movies of the year is easily.
