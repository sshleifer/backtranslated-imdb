I thought of seeing this movie trailer and I absolutely knew I would watch this movie. It saw something that would fix my glass. <br /> <br /> "Leland United States" is a horror movie. This is not something that will leave you with a beautiful, beautiful finish, but with a feeling of sadness just with the feeling. And when I say it will leave you with an "empty" feeling, I do not mean it as a bad thing. I believe that you are meant to fill the feelings with your own thoughts about the character and the general purpose of people and how they work as a part of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling was completely cast as Leland. She is stoic, yet intelligent. I liked the way that narrates the film with his journal. Support Cast as well as awesome. Kevin Spacy is very good, as always, and Don Cheadle Leland's teacher and mentor as amazing. <br /> <br /> This is a great story and very impressive and excited thoughts. I highly recommend it.
