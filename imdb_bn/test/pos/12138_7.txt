To drag into 2.6 million viewers, imagine what everyone's opinion about the story / plot. <br /> <br /> Continue reading during the life span, I believe that it is a marginal- pitching your seat thriller a single mother and finally facing the stalker. Sorry I was wrong. The main plot is quite interesting - one night one road goes down the street and then drowns by the same person, the reason behind the madness is nothing but a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> Hurt Laura Liton, and she does it well. Whether she is good at the Melrose Place, she plays well in this movie, a mother is playing that will do something to protect her son from harm, and she is still very good today. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think many people will identify with the main character, after discovering why the broker runs, it will be the only movie to watch.
