A film, first and foremost, should say good story. It should be entertaining - and entertaining means of course does not mean "sunny", and its meaning is not "light". It basically means that you do not get bored while watching it. <br /> <br /> Bright like 2001, it is a solid film, especially for current (video-game-playing / ipod fumbling) generation. Slowly, and sometimes a helper will sometimes extend your patience to helpless amounts (such as attempts to rescue floating crew members in space) while performing solo tasks. On the other hand, cinematography is brilliant, the movie is shiny, the last thought-provoking and score ... the score is decreasing, especially the crew of Transporter approaches the moon's handicrafts. Son, I had a big time frogs, big time. It often does not happen when I look at movies and there is a connotation of the skills of Kubrick. <br /> <br /> This is considered a classic, and many consider it the best science-fiction film of all time. If you have not done this yet, it is a good reason to look at it. However, just because someone else thinks that this is not a brilliant film, this does not mean that you will be forced to strengthen yourself. You are either (like it) or you will not. Probably slow motion is not such a bad thing after all. Static and slow speeds for 2 1/2 hours can teach you a lesson in directing your attention. These days (commercial, music videos or video games) are given for these fast moving, fast-paced images, it must be a different experience. <br /> <br /> I think it's a "memorable" movie. But after a while I'm not interested to see it again (unless I am in a particular mood for slow movies). <br /> <br /> So, 7 stars out of 10 from me.
