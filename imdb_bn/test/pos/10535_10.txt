This is the best 80's cartoon, probably the best cartoon ever. It was all work, adventure, thrill, and much more ... <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how difficult it was for Ruby-Spurs to create this great cartoon, it cost a lot The meaning of this work and its value was valuable, for example, just a few visible scenes were difficult because I did not call for a great technology in the 1980s, with computers that did not call We live here, so we /> <br /> <br /> uninterrupted views cartoon I saw the same excellent before <br do not like, so I hope all of them will be released in DVD, because it's my favorite. My DVD has a complete group of 65 episodes, but this is not the same because if they are released from the DVD, then people in the world can buy it and watch DVDs in almost every store, which is a lot of money fans. My best friend Ted has made this petition to get the program on TV or to make DVD better, if we ask for a lot to return to the DVD. <br /> <br /> Please help us by signing the petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html
