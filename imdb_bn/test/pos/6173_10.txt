A beautiful movie, the war-era detail shot the glitter with the eyes, and (it is set in WWII time) the lowest violence. <br /> <br /> A small custom Czechoslovakia occupy a passionate journey. The pilots will be able to leave England from the loved ones (the separation of the spional will touch the heart), the spitfire scene, love, friendship and betrayal. Betrayal, betrayal of friendship, and finally, during the communist regime, the former RAF pilot manages to betray the theme of betrayal. <br /> <br /> A great tragic movie, all so so it is truly correct. I would recommend it to everyone.
