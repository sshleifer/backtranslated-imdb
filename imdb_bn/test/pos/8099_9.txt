Chaplin played a dual role as a Jewish sailor, who misunderstood for the autocratic, Adenod Henkel (meaning Hitler) during the war in 1940, during the war in his dark days and was not won by any adviser. Hitler was banned by Hitler and there was a risk in the way of Chaplin because if the war was lost, he would surely be sent away from "re-educated" <br /> <br /> A funny satire with the classic scene is near a giant balloon in the world of Hitler tossing .. fun but with a message .. a little publicity at the end. This last film with Chaplin's trademark was a little difficult. Decades in a decade 9
