Why would this picture be so good, but there are only $ 95,000,000 total and no award nomination? John Travolta knows what he's doing. He knows that he is Michael, cigar smoking, feminist, magician arched angel who came to live with dead people and is now in the car with "The National Mirror" and his dog Sparky staff on the way to Chicago. It then turns into a road trip that is both terrible and great. I do not even think of death scenes (to be correct 3) it creates a tearzer. Best of soundtrack "Heaven is My Home", "Up Ad the Bed" and "Fence of Chain" I have great expectations about this and I'm saying it was a little more respected in the 90's. Read my comments. Goodbye!
