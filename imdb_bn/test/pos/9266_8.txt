This photo is something so different that you will meet before. It is an honest and cool account of an entire family war with a terminal illness. <br /> <br /> 'The Closer Shows Gets' is shot in a very unique style. Craig Oulette films are using a different angle and view point in a very different way .... What is a very interesting, interesting method (probably due to its experience with the photographic work). <br /> <br /> Her style gives a transparent picture that is not only patient-friendly, but its loved ones will also have to face it. <br /> <br /> A very sad, but very interesting and unique movie. One I would definitely recommend the observer
