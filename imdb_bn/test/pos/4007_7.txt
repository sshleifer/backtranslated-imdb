I see an attack of religious demonstrations for about 6 months (probably long but not more). I was very concerned with Olivia and I found Kevin very wonderful and found the difference between them. Little, it has started to wear thin because of me for many reasons. First of all, my favorite segment is Asrad Net, the first 15 minutes, which shows you 5 video clips found on YouTube, which is usually funny, or any site that has been hiccups (some deliberately). Um, this week I saw 4 to 5 times when the same thing shows the same thing, I have not really seen anything good and I can only make people feel like breaking them in their neck and watching them paralyzed many times. I want to see the show as a long show / callback report also wants to stay in politics, if you are not indigenous and are not generous, this humor is old, if McCain is old, yes, no matter what. There is no disappointment for Libyans to have fun because they do not understand that they can not tolerate themselves as a sense of humor, so it reveals almost every show to McCain or Paline, Sheesh. So we got the same old vids that hurt people, that we will laugh and then there are some left-wing political comedians who never laugh at themselves, beyond their own weaknesses. I see that I work and I hope on what it is, hopefully I will be entertained but it is a bit old. Although I like the fill of Chris and Allison's host, they actually had a good change of pace; Perhaps this show could do a rotary host thing. Olivia, which I thought in the beginning, was really fun to react to this constant reaction and it was outdated. 7 of 10; It will put you in a young mindset if you are a little baby like me (medium 40's). Maybe a cartoon of the day they have to make another segment, they could use a stuff available.
