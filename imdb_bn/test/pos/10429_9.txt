I do not understand why many others did not comment on this, others did not see that many saw it. It's a wonderful cast of characters, one after the other, everyone who wrote this essay. If you do not like drama plays you can not like it (lastly, the plays generally do not look good on TV), but it's a one-person show that focuses on life all the time. Highly recommended.
