Those who know me are weaknesses for my animated films. <br /> <br /> Be fair, those people are half right. My actual weaknesses are for amazingly animated movies such as Max Albert Fleck and David Flaish from Max <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " ? " Clear question This movie was released the same week as the attack on Pearl Harbor. Unintentionally bad times, the film is immersed in relative obscurity. Things are apparently seen, because in the end it is released under the title "Bagweil" in the DVD. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that this movie has been given all because it is the real character mirror. Although some people claim that the film is trying to send environmental messages (I), I personally think that the main idea of ​​the film is in the face of hurdles and solidarity (finally, the country has turned away from the crisis) <br /> <br /> The leader of the grassroots Happi wants to help his endangered community. Problems: Each time he tries to try, through ill-treatment of others or through simple misfortune, he unfortunately fails ... and gradually he is trying to save the beginning of earning disdain to the people. Although he did his best to maintain a positive outlook, he sometimes breaks down and only with the encouragement and support of his friends, he returns to his feet and struggles in a good fight. Just a healthy reminder that, when all is said and done, someone is really self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> "OK", you say. "This is a good message (two actually). Is this really done well?" <br /> <br /> My Answer: Partially <br /> <br /> This does not just make this message especially. It's characterization. This is one of the movies where you can only see each cast member's personality in their animation. You almost do not need a bonus line. It's a good way to add all "energetic" or "animated". Many movies used the selling point, "loving cast of characters". Whenever I hear that line, it always reminds me of this movie. <br /> <br /> In case of case, bad guys: swat the flat and smack the mosquito. There are many movies "loving" villains, but I do not think this as Fellow will get any as entertaining or respectful to you. Forget that the 3 Stooges cartoons are from 60 The closest thing to Swet and Smack and Karie's animated version (but not sadly Larry) that you find. Officially fun moments all somehow involve this dirty twosome. Yes, they are messy no-goodies, but you still care about them. It's a kind of energy that you see only from a gifted author, director, and crew. <br /> <br /> There are two concise jokes in this movie that are going around ethnicity (local American and Chinese). I do not think they wanted to be malicious; But they are there, irrespective of They do not bother me, but it would be impossible for me to take precautions that would be potentially frustrating by them. <br /> <br /> So, if you share my weaknesses (and I think you do), let's go this one.
