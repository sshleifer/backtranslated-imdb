After watching the "Rear Window" on television, a huge Hitakoos fan "Sabotur" is not the best of Hitkoc for me though it is very good but not a great composition. It has its faults, some parts are rather moving slowly and early scripted it resulted in script rather incomplete resulting in it being written. But Hitkoc's direction was fantastic, and the performance was not bad. When both Robert Simmons and Priscilla Lane did a good job, Auto Kruger and Norman Lloyd came closer to the event. The story is good, about a contested man, similar themes used in "39 steps" and "north-northwest", and cleverly provide some necessary flexibility. Music scores were absolutely outstanding; The opening title sequence was remarkable, like a nearly perverted procession, and I liked the first piano concert of Kojovsky and the 5th symphony of Beethoven. Cinematography is also sleek and smooth, scenery and landscapes are almost superb and there are many useful scenes. Such as the Statue of Liberty Climax, but also on the meaning of circus troop and radio music City Hall Shoot Out. Overall, not the best of Hitcoak, but definitely the price of the appearance. 8/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
