The third cycle of the series of extraordinary brilliant exploitation films and the third third artist in the series "Jōshu Sasori: Keho-Baia" The 1973 "Female Prison Scorpio: Beast Stable" (Uk. "Sassori: The Ben of the Best") is a film that is different from some of its ancestors, but it is equally (or controversially even crossed) in brightness. The complete original Sassori series, with the wonderful Méco Kazi, has stood as the ultimate brightness of the WIP movie, and combines all the movies, especially the first three, especially like a film-like exploitation and art-house movies. "Best Stable" Meiko Kazi, the second and last-to-late "Sassori" movie of the third character, the last of the talented director Shunya Eto and in my opinion, the greatest among them. The first film of 1972, "Jōshu 701-Gossa Sassori" is a perfect work of the excavation film, and simply the Definition of Exposition-Art. In the first sign of the same enthusiasm, "Joshua Sassori: Dai-41 Zakkyo-Bo" Ito added more realism and symbols. The third "Sassori" movie, "Bust Stable" holds supermotism (although not as limited to the second one), and more socially critical than its predecessors. The main things about poverty, forced prostitution and exploitation of the poor are the main issues. <br /> <br /> This third "Sassori" movie is fascinating and glorious and controversial in all aspects, the greatest, usually bright, cycle (this is my first, second to the second closing). Again, "best stables" are both very artistic and very absorbable-like. The visible stunning movie generates a lot of cruel violence and panic, as well as the sequence of great spiritual beauty. Nine Matsuishima (Uska Sassori), the beautiful Meiko Kazi, is nicely highlighted. I absolutely worship this wonderful actress, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one. The rest of the performance is also excellent, especially Mikio Narita is as a Police Inspector, who is involved in catching Sassorei. Musical score is the same across three films, "Urmi-Bushi", which Meik Kaji sings by herself, sang as the main theme, which is simply placed as pure perfection. As an antecedent, "Best Stable" is an exquisite classic art of exploding-art which can not miss a serious lover of the film. The whole Sassori-cycle is higher in my personal favorite list of all time. "Bist Stable" is arguably the most brilliant of all of them! 10/10
