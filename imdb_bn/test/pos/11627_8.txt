I have to keep my head drill every day in Barney; Well .. I guess there will be reason to have it. First of all, I'm sure our kids are not fools, they are just kids, but they know (what my 1 and a half year old boy wants to see "beautiful") is a nice or annoying Have you seen the news Do you think your kids know the reality? It may or may not be; We (adults) are responsible for what our children want and what they have to teach. Drug dealer is a film? Middle East massacre news? Of course, kids must have a real life, but ... they are kids; Let's give them some mercy. What do you want for them? If you want kids to get the best way to kill or kill your neighbor or neighbors, then proceed, apply their lethal weapon, bill killing, the animation of any manga, and tell them Santa is an innocent who goes directly through the chimneys for their violation. I want the illusion for my son (do not make me wrong, I'm not calling Barney and the best of friends, actually, there are many flops in the show, I read other comments and I agree with most); Perhaps happiness is made in dreams, or illusion. At least, I'm afraid of him but I want to learn to become awesome, which thinks and believes that everything is not a continuous killer or a hijacker, because they are a valuable reason for growing. At least, he can be a little happy with his dream. So, Dad, do not judge your kids less; They know what they want.
