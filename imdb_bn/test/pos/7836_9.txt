Forget about some (and pointless) comments left here by some. This series makes good performance, good shots, and a refreshing change mostly on the TV pap. <br /> <br /> Any fool can do some nitpick. However, the characters on this show are believable, story lines are stimulating and engaging (but some intelligence is needed in the audience's part), overall it's enjoyable and it's British! (We sometimes get some gems, and this is one of them.) <br /> <br /> Shows are an hour long and I think they have four together (at least I only see four of them). The show clearly influenced some US TV stations / directors, who created a longer series that were not close to compulsory despite the big budget. <br /> <br /> If you like soap and reality shows you will not like eleven or do not understand the Resurrection.
