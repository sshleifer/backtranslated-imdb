I am always a fan of Jacques, Vivo La Bam and Wildboys. And when you are a fan, your expectations may be higher in your star of "heroes". And if there is something that you've just learned to expect to hear and hear many, but do not expect too much of it, '99 out of 100 99 times are you going to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I have heard that Jacques 2 is coming, I thought "I can not even lower my expectations for this movie", and as a result, I'm ready to laugh today, but ultimately it is ready to say "OK It was okay, but I'm a little disappointed. " I was so wrong! Each member of the Jacques Crete brings this movie to the first, showing you the next one crazy ass stunt, shows the whole world that they can not do anything to try to harm themselves - and what we love! I laughed laughing at the first eye and shook my eyes and at the end of the second half of the movie, sometimes laughing and shouting, I could not control myself! Stunts after stunts, fantastic after spanking, and ridiculous comments on the flow - it simply could not get better than this! Wonderful from beginning to end, sure you smile off your ass. I have left to say two things; Please see, and God, please be a Jacques 3 - these guys definitely have a lot to pay!
