His music, especially we hear it here, is very slow. From the time of Bac's death, musicians are enjoying the progress of music progressively slowly and gradually: after one century, Wagner and then the songs of Mahlah can be as slowly as the slow-moving one. - Of course, it can be cheated by writing on 4/4 March and then the temppo of semifwaar = 1 can be specified, but the tempo that does not have the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that played fairly at the speed of a snap. In no sense is the wrong expression that sounds slowness "slow speed" too slowly. A commentator wrote a famous Wagner conductor, "He does not waste time, he hits eternity." <br /> <br /> I realized how early 1970s the directors could create slow films: there are "deaths of Venice" and there are "Solaris". "I like many exemplars." For one thing, Solyaris "moves on the line, or some lines, and becomes soporific;" Venice Death "is gripping from the beginning to the end. Not many things happen, but the exact sequence happens, you lose in photography. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Feeling lacking and forming. "The death of Venice" is not one of them. The respect is beautiful, it will remind you of the timelessness and the relevance of the quality. Neither do you need theoretical knowledge, as you can answer the incompetence of a lesser director. This is a great job.
