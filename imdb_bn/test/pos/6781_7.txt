This old-time classic was found in a copy of a Durbar bin sale. I played it with a dosbox on a Vista machine without any problems. It's graphically dated, but what you hope for the 12-year-old game! Game is an FPS / Adventure game hybrid. I say to pseudo-3D, you can not see or underneate, spin 360 (think Wolf3D). The game can be very limited with a very limited supply of health containers and a bit rough with the average interface (tip: press I), but it is all passable. <br /> <br /> One of the main strengths of the game is mood. While the game uses full motion video, and the act is B-grade and the plot is very sticky, the game completely feels vague. It does a good job to ask you 'good boys' questions. Are they really helping, or are they waiting to see you running behind? Other main sales point games length. There are 18 chapters from memory, starting from 10 minutes in the game time, for possible hours. My first game took me a week to take some sincere devotion. <br /> <br /> date, yes, but if you miss this year and you can find it for $ 5, please give it a look. Cheaper than a movie, and more entertaining than most movies.
