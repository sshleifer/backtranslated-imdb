The greatest Tarzan ever! This movie has been done in such a way that Tarzan has never been close to any other. There is something in it that you want in a Tarzan movie. Other Tarzan films will sometimes portray this character. I would say that if you have seen a Tarzan movie and you like it, you will see it, you will like it and if you have never seen Tajan you will see it and you will forget the others.
