This beloved boyfriend is never really seen anything, let alone the commercial ventures of Venice, I can not comment on how faithful I am for the previous adaptations of the drama, so I will consider it as another film which is more than a novice novel for Ivv Young lover Basanio (Fiennes) and his business friend Antonio (Irene) and Jew Money lender Shylock (pyasino) mubhicitra secret promptly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ b> So shylock off borrows some money <br /> <br /> Now antonio General and Shayk Specially and Shayk, because of nasty and misusing, he is especially suffering from Antonio and generally Christians are generally paid on this condition. If antennae does not pay the loan by the agreed timeframe, then the Shaykake will be busy. Antonios is a pound cut body of meat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is excitingly beautiful and played and spoken, so that you are forced to emphasize the meaning of each line, as a result the audience gets insight into the character and their motivation <br /> <br /> It makes shylock that a movie about the choice Seems to be, and how to make shylocks like mistakes. <br /> <br /> From the moment Shilk claims his pound of flesh, because he is destroyed, the rest of the world against him and his collapse connives <br /> < br>> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems that it is moving towards a big embroidery <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> This film is a powerful and fine illustration of anti-Semitism that shows how the entire society can be launched in a minority and it seems like hunting is actually a criminal <br /> <br /> I went through the movie 10 / 10
