I saw this film purely by chance. It was too late, or was shown very well in television very early in the morning. I woke up and got tired of sleeping and this picture came. <br /> <br /> It works on a matter covered somewhere else (it certainly does not as well educate Rita. Additional twists) and have a very predictable finish. <br /> <br /> Despite its very clear flaw, I enjoyed the film and thanked the story or piece completely played some of its players. <br /> <br /> I saw Sam Neel's big fan and saw him in many different movies: Dead Kalma; Piano; Cyan; Children of revolution; Event horizon; People of the twentieth century and the all-round Jurassic Park. He was very good, but he could play this part by closing his eyes. <br /> <br /> My opinion was, there were some examples of horrible roses, for example Rose Bayern and there were heavy elephants rather than some pain. <br /> <br /> However, two actors (whom I did not remember or remember, they had seen before) affected me a lot of Synyed Cusackon. Francis Kennedy (Frank), and especially Matthew Newton as his son David. He was, especially, very believable and I would like to see him much more.
