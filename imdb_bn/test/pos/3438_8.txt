Carl Gagino * Yay * and a painful end * Boa * <br /> <br /> - "Zed" is a past love story that comes to the city to flee from its past. There he met two lesbians and decided to do some fun after a few drinks. But one of the girls took away too much girls and the second girl kept her and raped her. The incident happened on the next day where he was discovered on the beach and was taken to a hospital. Then, we tried to take the rest of the two girls down and spent the rest of the movie and at the same time he could know about who he is and some new information about his past. <br /> <br /> - Directors and co-authors Karen Kooth did an excellent job with this film considering her neutral low budget. It looks like a hand hold and sometimes 16 mm, but it fits the film because the story has a strong focus on it. All of the actors are working just fine with what they offered and there really is nothing to complain about it. The standout feature of the film is definitely Carla Gagino, who has made it all barbaric in this film. She is more nude in this movie than "Sin City". Christopher McDonald is also in the film, but his character is really stupid, but he has fun to watch. I really did not pay much attention to the song because it does not really draw attention to itself, but it did the job with what it got. The movie is rated and it is a very good reason. It's very sexual and very graphic at times. It is basically the borders of the soft core boundaries, but sex scenes are important for film, so it does not seem right because it is there. Although there is a pointless scene where we look at Chris McDonald's, the scene was a pointless, but I think this is not a problem. The only drawback of the film is that we can not see the trial of the court just after we go to the movies. It's like having sex and having an orgasm or something <br /> <br /> - It's embarrassing that Caribbean Croth did not create such a feature film. This is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget. I really hope he gets back to the game as he is very amazing director. Zade is not an excellent composition of erotic film, but instead we have an enjoyable movie that shows a great director to create. <br /> <br /> - Keep the kids hold and close the screen, you do not want people to feel obscene observers watching this movie.
