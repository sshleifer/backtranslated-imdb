It's all about what you want when you want. And Blue Ward's eighth Wife message should be careful about what you want. <br /> <br /> Most men hear stories about what will happen if you do not solve sexual disappointments. And your physiological turn on a specific part is blue. The Misogynistic Pirates play aside, Cooper plays a very wealthy person, when he wants that he is very much accustomed to achieve what he wants, he can learn too late that he did not do what he had hoped to do, and he did not learn his lesson even if he did not attend the Cloit Colbert. Through a paved (soul and practice) business agreement, he finishes the purchase / ending with the intention of his bed in bed, but he will not have any (literally) and frustrating him every time, corner and house, and tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> This film has a French sensitivity, which means it's a strong bi-stimulant for the day and boudoir humor and a sharp edge that you are not accustomed to (and can not enjoy it) Cooper or Colbert. The whole reason to watch the film was because they are the "favorite" actors and the whole point of the film is that they are unlikely, or at least preferred ones who have developed unfamiliar features to protect themselves, they think the world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on your terms then you will get the satisfaction of this wonderful and sophisticated movie ... and satisfaction as we said, is it all about it. A movie with such a cast comes only, after all, once ... ummm ... blue moon.
