First of all: If you like to watch movies, then I do not suggest watching it. Why? Then you will not be able to understand any other movie more easily ... <br /> <br /> I do not really want to increase any extra expectations but it's almost dreadful, how perfect, intense and beautiful are these Inner works Gudmundsson. When in most movies, at least one aspect is unclear actors, good actors, but terrible dialogues or beautiful scenery, but is the low budget cinematography ?? The Angels in the universe "There is nothing ambivalence." Truly everything is great, even (and not least) soundtrack with great sigger ROS. <br /> <br /> In this story Paul, a student who specializes in dialogue (and more than one person) After being dumped by schizophrenic, it needs to get some attention: together (and sometimes instant) this plot is frustrating and is completely stupid. Contrary to the custom and the complete foolishness, more often, they are often (with the quote of Hejel and Shakespeare) a poetic beauty that falls in the miracle of this film and is simply incredibly saved by the original actor in the real world. One of the other comments has already been mentioned in another topic: this movie is a tiger for the evening In spite of several ridiculous reliefs, it is mostly annoying, partly condemnable, and bitter and most tragic, a modern poem. <br /> <br /> Finally, when you see the movie, see it again, it's a great visual metaphor and There is an expression that you only perceive once when you see it twice and connect them with the morality of the story. And of course: The book reads, there are many more interesting stories in it and also makes you better understand the movie anything more.
