I saw many Dustin Hoffman movies, Stro Dogs, or Rain Men, and I liked them, but their characters are often much more quiet or even shy people. I told him to stay in the same movie as this stroke dog, but I saw a completely different personality. She was much more energetic in this film, but she reminded me of Al Pacino in Sepiko. The movie was very interesting from the beginning. I like to fix everything for Dustin Hoffman's character to be with her son. This is the publisher of the movie. Personally, I think it shows that people should look for their compromises without involving other people on their issue.
