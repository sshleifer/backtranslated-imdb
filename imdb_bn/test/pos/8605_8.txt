After the atom bomb Hiroshima is hit, the burnt bodies are almost around, the distorted victims try to contact relatives, who can not recognize them and after each other the radiation dies due to illness. This is not without black and white film, though sad and scary, humorous. This story revolves around a young man Yasuko, who was hit by a black rain after the blast. She is trying to get married, but everyone dies, and people are worried that the same will happen. After finding the suitable partner (who loses his mind after having a long fight), he ended up showing signs of radiation sickness. This picture is a great illustration of Japan's atomic attack, it will frighten you and probably will cry to you. Good acting, not so much dramatic like that many other WW2 films were made.
