I bought this in the budget section last week. I already had Halloween and Halloween 2, and since I noticed every horror movie collection, I liked it. After all, the first two were good. <br /> <br /> This picture is genuinely cute. It seems to create the right atmosphere, and has a nice "Michael Miles History". It uses old locations from the original and the main character is Laurie Strauss Babysat, which is a lucky Halloween in 1978 ... <br /> <br /> Climax is fairly satisfying. However, it is much better than the H20, which is undoubtedly, complete shit.
