Bean on Fox for this movie dumping. It was a total riots and I hope it will have a second life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> This is a ridiculous irony. This makes the situation extremely difficult when it is "extreme" and does not break into a fifty pieces (or kick the green). It makes you think ... once we become lazy and stupid, you have to make this empire? Everyone gets hurt in this one esp. Several big corporations and even Fox News have taken a punch (probably because of this the movie has never been released correctly - without thinking of marketing, outside of the marketing department and knowing how to market it, "so we will leave!") Some people find the movie Sophomer Because, due to miserliness and pavement, the film is much more than that. What you mean by Mike Judge, or you do not. The negative reviews that I have read do not seem to come from most people who can not get it or snooze the film. <br /> <br /> This will probably play in selected markets for a week so if you miss it, keep an eye on it for the DVD, it will be worth renting and eventually it will be in my collection. <br /> <br /> Good Job Mike Judge, you are ashamed of shame, but you laugh me laughing and I look forward to seeing your next movie.
