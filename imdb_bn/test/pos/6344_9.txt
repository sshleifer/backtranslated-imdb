This is a wonderful section of award winning Loneme Dove Minisiri in the 1980s. This sequel is probably better than the original. It is definitely more family friendly. The language is more subdued. Cherokee Jack has a lot of violence and a special scene, especially scary. However, overall a great movie. Acting fantastic William Peterson is pretty fantastic. Such a great dramatic actor with quick knowledge of cute and ridiculous timing. John Voight fits as a good captain of Tommy Lee Jones shoes captain. Ricky Schroeder gives a heart-shaped performance, the young boy does not grow up to claim him. Highly recommended.
