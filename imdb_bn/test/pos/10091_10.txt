I must say I'm a scary horror film fan, and now I'm not getting enough foreign horror. As the US fears really depend on Gore. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This movie me m. Knight's 6th senses reminded a lot. The way the movies managed was great. The director took everything his time to set up. It took a good 40 minutes to set the movie in a horror film. I was just a drama in the movie. This movie is only rising and not too close to pay. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to do this before, but I love this movie because ... I really cried out loud. Because a scene is just coming out of me ... which is very sad ... but it's great for a photo.
