This will be my favorite film. The script is sharp and played by a nice miller and fantastic Carlisle! Sharp wit, excellent details and no Hollywood polishing; A complete submerged movie which you have gunning for the bad guys! As the excitement of the stock again awkward again, as the live tyler really hunger as his other, light-acting act hungry as Rebecca! The soundtrack may not be known in your name, but anyone who has ever seen top gear, watched football or a TV action sequence is probably familiar with it, especially because of Craig Armstrong's 'Apac' that he never lets. Do it again The soundtrack of the first drama seems to be a costume drama / action / comedy, but a re-shown it fully shows the script's rendering of its play. <br /> <br /> This image is not shown enough on TV! Where is it? Really nice, sharp and classy - do not you regret seeing it - again and again! (Exit to DVD player switch!)
