One of the best musical bios. Dennis Morgan is the same as the singer / musician Chunasi Achult. Supporting Cast is very good, especially Andrea King is attractive as Lillian Russell. The atmospheric turn of the century is the perfect setting. Technicians are excellent. An easy plot, but the movie just makes you feel better. Morgan was always involved as an actor and a singer.
