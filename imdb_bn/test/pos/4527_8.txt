Murder throughout New York is one of the better Chan Mysteries and I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> In this case, Charlie Chan is traveling to New York to attend a police summit. At the same time, people associated with the Biman plant are being killed and he has decided to assist in investigating his number two sons. These murders can be the result of hostility in aircraft plants and help identify the moon killer ... <br /> <br /> Charlie Chan played well with Sydney Tollar and the rest of the cast included Sue Yun <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, 5.
