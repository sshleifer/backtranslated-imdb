I was in the movie premiere last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, but there have been some changes in the book. This movie is much faster than the penis devi code. Nothing is pruning otherwise it will be a 4 hour movie. A lot of changes have been made to speed up the film. I think what the movie feels like and it works well for Hanks, Brown and Company. <br /> <br /> There are some things in this book that seem impossible in film form. I'm not giving a spoiler, saying that the end of the movie is managed in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra is available is also different. Those who watch the movie may be interested in reading the book to get the full story details. Some minor details are also cut from the film. <br /> <br /> Although they did the film in Rome, they had to create their own internal shots. Since I went on a walk in Rome, I can say before the day of the movie that the inside sites are authentic in appearance and feeling. Kohler is not in the movie and there is not much to show about the CERN. Hanks has a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they did not have access to that area and I'm not sure if anyone looks like Vatican archives. Victoria Vetra has her holiday in this film and works well as the eye candy for Hendes. <br /> <br /> This film should be well received by critics and public, but you never know. Ron Howard has mentioned several times in the interview and we saw him in front of the movie and cast as seen that it is just a movie.
