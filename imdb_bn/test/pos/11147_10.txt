This picture is exceptional in Marlene and Raymond's extraordinary performance. The performance of this film is the greatest power generation, but scripts, directions and editing are ridiculous. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exsists in two stars. If you like Marlin, and you like Raymond, you would love this picture ... (This is a classic that compares to Casablanca.) <br /> <br /> <br />
