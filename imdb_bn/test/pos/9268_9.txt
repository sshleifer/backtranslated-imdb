I saw this documentary film at the 2005 Sedmens Independent Film Festival. This documentary is shot, directed and edited by a long war boy (Craig) in his mother's cancer. The one-year course "gets as close to him as possible", with a documentary in triangle form and an internal look of your family struggle with cancer, viewers receive an internal perspective of the effects of cancer, I have never seen such an honest movie, it is a strong and raw movie, and it is not shot by an outsider, so you get the true passion of everyone involved. Many documentaries are shot by the outsiders, but this story tells the boy to add another mental level to this film, which I saw on this topic or any other before. This is a sensitive story that everyone should be looking at and related to it. I would highly recommend it.
