It's a simple episode until it's viewed in the Season 11 episode (except for the exception of the Amaginanden Trilogy). It smiled that the most ridiculous, obviously my favorite season 11. So basically Cartman sees a toy shop whose child has Tourette syndrome and comes up with a new idea Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Toret Syndrome and he is very good with Kyle when he knows that it's like "he's fickling". Cartman is definitely going to burn in the fire, telling the head to the teacher whatever he wants. On the other hand, Kyle, who is intolerant now, is basically saying that Cartman was taken to show children with her Tourette syndrome, so that she could see that Toret's syndrome is for real and Kyle's good "good" maybe someone is looking very much for the fun of hert ", little Kylie Cartman was not able to explain the fading, perhaps in my favorite scene of this episode when Car Man is with Kyle's family but just after this scene another child runs, that Cartman is easily fickling, with the curator at the toy store, the child Cartman originally said to the child: "isn 'Tourette's extraordinary T." But to tell what he wants and For all, a brave boy just started for Cartman, his master plan: Tell him what he wants on national television. ("People will say this wonderful TV, maybe they'll give me an amy" - Excellent, the word "****" is used in this episode 26 times, and of course it is not all. South Park Amy is one month before the promotion of this episode Won a month or more). But there is a point here, Cartman has largely removed all the bricks of the wall, he is thinking of everything now, we have heard from Cartman that he got wet on bed last night, is not funny for the cartman now and he "I can not control what I say" Certainly the person with the person "can not control what you are saying, good, you have a curriculum", so Cartman's "My tiutreta was worse, I find cool stuff and stuff long before the Jews, but now it has gotten really bad." Chris Hansen and a Predator are also here to catch up, what actually happened with a distorted happened with a lot of distortion, Kyle and Thomas were behind to stop Cartman, Kyle ended up being the Savior of Cartman! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Feel sensitive and hope to collect countless calls and emails from our members and the TS community. <br /> <br /> We already have some pre-acceptable programs Our Public Service Announcement (Comedian Richard Lewis) is the request for the Comedy Central Air during or after the strike. Also, this episode will be able to see the picture in the air and the illustration of the TST, we are able to respond to specific problems and problems with the authors. <br /> <br /> We told TSA President Judith Anghar, "It is really surprised, the creator In the event took a lot of time to use Ts as comedy pasture, because of a disability, illness or controversial issues have exceeded their limits. " As an opportunity for awareness and education, we always see the images of TS (good and bad), and a display of this level and popularity is no exception and provides ways to spread informational information about TSA's disorder, "Tracy Coalty-Flin, Public Relations and Communication Manager , TSA. <br /> <br /> We will post an official statement on this site after hearing TSA's program, <br /> <br /> TSA's response to the "South Park" episode <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with many media speculation chips in the South Park season, with the introduction of tourism syndrome (TS) Le ("Le Petit Toret," 10-3-07) Even the completely straightforward idea has been fixed that most people affected by TS do unintentional explosions in cruel language. A total of 85-90% of people, including TS, TS, do not enjoy this sadly socially tarnished substance (medicated coprolalia). For the visitors familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the confusing message could not be cleared ?? If you do not curse, do not have your TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our pre-ventilation, we acknowledge that this episode was surprisingly researched. In spite of extremely ambitious emphasis in Coprolalia, the attention was paid to the attention-watchers, the exact amount of accurate information was released. Scripts of parental inputs, a neuroscientist, colleagues and "TS Children's Support Group" Therapies Theory worked as a clever device for all to provide this information publicly. "There is no doubt that this South Park episode has increased national awareness of TS, yet, we are very concerned that school children with TS will be drug addicted and will be spoken by the programmers who have watched this event," said TSA President Judith Angar. "We understand that for more than a decade, cartoon parody of the authors did not save any group from celebrity, disability or political personality, it proves the authenticity of a popular TV show that the public is aware of so much disorder, apparently, to increase this awareness. We worked hard, sometimes it could be a double swords. "<br /> <br /> TSA Before the program, refer to the movement of executives, and we will contact them again. Perhaps we will succeed in turning it into a chance for the positive TS awareness.
