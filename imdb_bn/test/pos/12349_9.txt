I actually saw one dark knight in the theater and wrote a review of this film for my high school newspaper. Then I loved it and I still love it. The story surrounds the two. For the first time a woman has taught her father Telenakis after her death. After his death, he felt his feelings about his father's strange power. He is buried in drama with other major people, a high school girl is doing something to do with a group of girls who just want to torture him and dare to stay awake all night to join his group. They are afraid of returning at night and afraid of him. Meg Tilly led the role in support of Adam West and Elizabeth Daily Ur EG was my personal favorite. Daily. If you like 80 films and Chesie horror movies, check this one, you will not be offended.
