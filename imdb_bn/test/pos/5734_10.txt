I can not believe anyone has rated this movie 1 !!! And it's only a 3. average ... What does this picture mean about love? This is real, it has a lot of horrific scenes that actually emit me out of my seat and it has some great special effects. The story is fresh, has some nudity, and it is very camp. The killer was scary in his own demented way and the end was very unexpected. I have to admit that I really love this picture, one of the best horror films in Spain. If you think of yourself as a real fearful fan, you have to go there and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised so.
