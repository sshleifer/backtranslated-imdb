I admit that I have contacted the film's expectations and fears. The best novel of Louis de Bernie is my favorite and anyone who has read it will realize that adaptation on any screen can not be 100% faithful. <br /> <br /> I have seen myself through all the way that the film has failed, and the plot of the book has been presented as completely ineffective. In the end, it is much better than the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie later. Nevertheless, plus (John Toll's extraordinary painter, Stephen Warbeck's great score, etc.) I did not realize that my initial negativity (Cage's misconception, too thin scripts) <br /> <br /> But, after two days i Corelli was queuing again to see, and although not perfect, I would now admit that the best of the movie might be expected by someone. The cat actually is brilliant in a role that even De Bornier was not completely circular character: his discouraged attitudes that deviated the isolated remorse and clearly performed the extraordinary dual behavior of Penelope Cruz and John Hart. David Morrissi peacefully works like Weber, the Nazi officer is trying to integrate his new Italian friends and his feelings around him for his intrinsic superiority complex. And the fine Greek-Italian supporting Caste brought Benoere's live-alive living life to Sifolonia. After leaving the movie for the second time in the movie, I finally left my emotions for the novel, which prevented me from being fully appreciated. Cinematic Word of WW2 Cepholonia My hat goes to John Madden, who despite the expected criticism from British critics (who has a successful success like Shakespeare himself, a director who is behind them) is always the target of this crying niners! In order to relocate a terrible hard book to the big screen with such a heart, words and humanity (in fact, the novel), he has created another classic love story, which will probably be fully appreciated only when the dust stays year from now. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of books like me, it is difficult, but try not to make the same mistakes in your initial view. Try to remove the book from your mind for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean environment, and Correli, Palgia, Madrasah, and more. Discover the ideas, such as for the first time (you see something made from real screenplay), and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
