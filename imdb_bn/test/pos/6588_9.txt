This image came as a gift - a silent night's offering of blue feeds - so I did not have any idea about the other critics. The film refers to my rhythm gradually, I covered myself with my seat. I was drawn to recognizing my deep love and humanity as I intended to win "good" - but I was compelled to acknowledge that sometimes I was beside "bad" boy. The film is quite beautiful - the word "Elihiyak" comes to mind, and this film is more than the beginning and it is over. Far from being depressed or confronted, the film accepts deep sorrow - and then, through the nature of its chakrata - with birth and resurrection as well as death - celebrates the film that it can quote an Australian poet "sometimes rejoice." Oh God, I think I wrote a love letter in this movie - but there they are. Hola!
