My favorite Rockford file episode of the 'Style of Hand' series. This episode shows an aspect of Jim Rockford that is usually ignored. For intelligent, Jim is actually shown in love with a beautiful woman and her younger daughter is shown as a father. Women recently divorced and he and Jim have recently returned from a weekend holiday with a young boy. By the strange form of the incident, the absence of the woman after returning to her house. <br /> <br /> Rockford's father, Rocky, who has reminded the woman about the disappearance of the disappearance, is Mikey Spielan's memorable memoir. A previous era hammer series. With many boring and reflections and Rocky's enthusiasm Jim stumbles on the need to send him to investigate the disappearance with his firm conviction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend, Karen, unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity when they stayed at Buane Vista. Crime owners responded by killing Karen and substituting another woman in Jim's car. The person who was apparently asleep in the back seat, immediately left home after arrival. Some incidents have happened in the prison and Jim has been issued for his arrest, even though the LG Police Department suspected the suspect Jim got his solution reached. <br /> <br /> This episode has expressed more emotional reactions than other Rockford files. Combined As Jim Rockford, James Garner is seen in his weakest moment and he still holds the mind to follow the suit. This is private for Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not hired to do a job but he is trying to recover his lost love to save his life. Unfortunately, this is not possible, but Jim tries hard to solve his feelings, but it is very clear that he can not get his injury soon. <br /> <br /> Despite the appeal of the original story line, many important questions are raised but this is not the answer in the episode. (1) What is the girl's girlfriend of Jim? (2) What did Karen actually see in the hotel that the Mafia killed him? (3) How can Jim drive in the back seat and drive for hours while traveling? (4) The girl said, "Mummy did not come back with us". Then she wept aloud, weeping, weeping, weeping, weeping, weeping and mourning; Despite these ambiguities, 'Slate of hand' is the episode of the Rockford file that comes near to Tier Joker. The mystery is compulsory and the story is called a sensitive and weak style that we feel in Rockford's pain.
