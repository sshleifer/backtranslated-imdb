"Death Wish 3" has once again brought Charles Birston as William Paul Curse, now retired. Yeah, right? For a long time, Curse was back in her old ways. But at this time, it was not just a few muggers at one point, this time a gang took part in its war town (New York again). At this time, he had a fight, so curse put out a big gun (literally) for him. His body was one of his rival Stallone or Schwarzenegger, looking for the film to be a little fun, especially for a few fish and for the bad guys, or in a creative way, which is always a good thing. Violence in it is not private, it is, perhaps, on a larger scale, than bombing your victims far away from one another. The film is spontaneous compared to the first two. It's not so easy to see. It does not import much of the film, it's much more frequent and sometimes pseudo-inspirational, but the hose scene is flat. They could leave the original "Death Wish" without leaving their signals, but since they did it, they could stop here. 8/10
