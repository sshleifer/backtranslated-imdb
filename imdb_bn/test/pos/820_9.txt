When I first got the air from this film, it was known only as "Shepherd" and this film was supposed to be returned to J.V.V.D. for the theater shots. I was very excited about the whole piece. <br /> <br /> The title "Shepherd: Border Patrol" was "Tap-dancing for this flicker." Helen's instructions on Isaac Fluorintine, and JJ Perry Stunt to coordinate, I almost peed my pants around. I played 8 different types of ass and Scott Adkins, like the villain I was released, and I was excited about the excitement. I thought it was the situation of another epic martial arts like Lon Wolf MacCard. <br /> <br /> Then came out. I stopped blockbuster for $ 20 and was ready to do anything. My ideas on reviews from Vandammefan.net kinda changed alittle, but I braced myself. The mail came in 4 days and I opened the package. My initial plan was to push the upper side, burst the face off the cardboard packaging, then waste the case in the appropriate dynamics case so that the disk would land in my DVD player. However, I looked at the case for 10 minutes and then set the disc in my player and saw the film. <br /> <br /> When the time was over, I was calm as a fool in the pool. Shepherd must always be one of my best live video-video films ever, and this is a toilet that shows more darling of the mess. Sure, a little bit of this fight was small, but they were still very awesome. Like the Shotown Lord, the kittens like Scott Adkins have had a fantastic outfit. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this flickr. Seriously
