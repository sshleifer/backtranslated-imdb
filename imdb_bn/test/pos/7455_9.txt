TV-14 rates for sexual content and language. <br /> <br /> I recall listening to this show in 1998 when it was used to play in the Teletili Channel. I did not see it then, but now it's on the channel, King. I have seen nearly four episodes of this show and I must say it is fairly intelligent and fun. <br /> <br /> This show is Jason Alexander of Sinefield fame and Team Curry Show at Rocky Horror and the fame.
