Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great Message, Great Symbolism, Very Good Movie <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchell, Robert Young and Robert Ryan together with three wrong men, Leeds and director Edward Dmytryk Combined with complex killings and detective yarn <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A little complicated without good reason. But it also means, and we look early (very likely primarily) who are criminals, even why. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama, generally works well with silent lighting and dramatized post-war films filled with those little coupons, there are social messages, all anti-anti-Semitic points. It's only a once or twice campaign borders, and it's a definitely a good point for us to show it approvalably and wait for the plot and dramatic acting to take the front row. Which they do, especially Young, who is a brightly leiky and patient detective, and Ryan, who is credibly irrelevant and angry road (Ryan is good for him, his type castcast reasonable). Mikyum has played a famous version mostly, and the fourth known actress Gloria Ashim is slightly aligned, even though a great, short, presence. <br /> <br /> Although the film is dominated by the sequence of events and the message, both of which are becoming effective, are easy to watch, cameras, and act as easy to see, which can be seen in the first few seconds with picturesque classic fighting scenes, All done with shadows. <br /> <br /> The capital of the soldiers presented is very deliberate, and at this time some people were very familiar and could be related to anti-semitism threads. Shell-Hakim soldier helpless (but still spontaneously capable), submissive youngsters (but capable, too) without confidence, and tired but externally active veterans rendered it all there. And of course, angry, violent soldiers who are a product of war, too. This is the responsibility of the last society - even the army is acting as a creator for injustice, because they are not criminals, but they have long been disturbed after the war. <br /> <br /> The viewers could now get much more, but it still can be realized.
