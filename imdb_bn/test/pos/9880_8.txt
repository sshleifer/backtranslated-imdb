I loved this movie when I was young, and I'm looking for it again! I love to see it again !! All of the information is OK, but the cover does not look like it matches - I can not say though though. I think this driving was about the kids in the driving class (Alice Milano, Tina Yadder, etc.) and they also saw the excellence gained outside the class. Eddie McCall was the mother of Alisa Milano in this film. I think I really liked it so that anyone could know if I could get a copy of the movie listed above (especially with them), I would like to know. Thanks :)
