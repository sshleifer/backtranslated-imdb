This movie has made me rugby - and coach Larry Gelix - fan. The story's characters slipped and fallen before they started to grow because they struggled through incredible rival conflict. Those who were understandable and completely trustworthy. Like life, there was no easy answer to face all of their problems. Fantastic actors and an excellent script life brought this true story. I wish there were more movies like this. On this day, I look at the exclusively, true stories because they are much more interesting than imagination. In addition, this one is inspirational and it teaches us not to give up someone very quickly.
