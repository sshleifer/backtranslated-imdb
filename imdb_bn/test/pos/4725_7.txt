Patricia Arquette plays American doctor Laura Bowman, who took Burma's leave to cure the soul after killing her husband and younger son. He is behind the military coup and is leaving the room with an old man working as a "well-known guide". But he is no easy tour guide; He is a professor who brought the life out of the trap of tourists ... Both of them have been caught up on political upheavals and Laura sees with his eyes how the government tortures and tortures his own people. <br /> <br /> This movie is my favorite of my themes. Firstly, it is informative (describing Burmese events a bit). Second, it is about a woman struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Thirdly, it is about compassion and sacrifice, and people coming together - even in addition to knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. <br /> <br /> This movie is important for every beautiful scene; Nothing is wasted here. This is a sincere and moving film. A very emotional score made by Hans Gimma, which is beautifully done in the scene. <br /> <br /> Specifically recommending people with human rights and those who want to know, "I serve for any purpose? <br /> <br />
