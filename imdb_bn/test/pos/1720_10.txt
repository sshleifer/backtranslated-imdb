I love pop culture, but when I first heard about this, I was a little scared. Then, I saw an episode, and I love it! When I wanted to know that Christopher Eikelson and Doctor will not play. He was probably the best one they had. She fits the characters so well. It is sad to see him go I do not think the new guy is going to drag the doctor and Ilkelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can ignore all the scars and creatures such as the Dicklex's Chess effects. The story lines and the letters that can make for more than that. I am currently waiting for season two and I will also review it, for any reason, the quality will drop below. However, I think everyone should try to watch an episode. I have been, and since I have been loving it since. Well written, well described, and well-produced, this show price is worth hours.
