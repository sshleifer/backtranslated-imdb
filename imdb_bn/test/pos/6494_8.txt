Thanks to all the Dutch people are not ruthless. I think Jason is being tried just like most people because he has a famous father. Maybe he's not as great as some of those actors, but he certainly does not as bad as offering. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a few years ago, and I actually like it. I knew Jason from other movies and of course Sherwood's Robin. But I must say I really liked the acting of this movie. It was really good! <br /> <br /> During filming, I have actually forgotten that the boy. Shan .. Who? <br /> <br /> And if you are Shakespeare's lover then I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you will enjoy it!
