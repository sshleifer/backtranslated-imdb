The Mayville Copper film is not as good as its most famous film, Delicious Stylish "Le Samourai (1968)." I do not think this is the best example of the very best substance SubZen. The main thing against the film is its long running time. Meville has this tendency to concentrate too many insignificant details. He could tell the same story in a short time, but for the reason I did not understand, the film continued. Still, the movie is not boring. Melville's influence impressed me and cast very well, especially Alain Delon as a very "cool" master thief. The film is certainly a great resource for color photography and Melville uses the word (or lack of sound) in very effective ways. From a technical perspective, the film is virtually flawed. Occasionally, someone thinks that Mewley is watching only, but when someone is gifted, there are only a few reasons to complain about it. I still like the other hest movies (Jules Dasain's "Topkapi" (1964), "Just for Naming"), but this film is a good part of the well-equipped entertainment and "cool" movie as a good example of what people are saying.
