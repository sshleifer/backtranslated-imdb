The show started out with boats. Desmond I had it. Then they tried to save Walt. And lock the thing that pushed the button at a similar time to find a big junk Desmond that the Hell Flight crashed. Echo tries to close the door, and Charlie helped him find a bomb. Saeed and Jack's plan is to find out first, find someone else and who else and what? And if there is armed and there are no weapons. <br /> <br /> Michael Jack snatches swire, kate and hugo. And they are caught. <br /> <br /> After the show more questions were answered then, but that makes the show great. And can not wait until season 3
