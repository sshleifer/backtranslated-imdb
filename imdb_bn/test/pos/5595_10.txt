Broken Silens or "Race Against Fear" 1998): Actor Joseph Scanlan, starring Ariana Richards, William Bumilar, Susan Blacklie, Tracy Ellis Ross, Tyril Rather, Scott Vicarias, Marisa Rudick, Why Cambrokes, David Nill, Screenplay Sara Charmo, Jean Guinness, and Philis Murphy. <br /> <br /> It is another life time channel film, which was created for the release of the television in 1998, which is the long-time TV series director Joseph L. Scanned operated. Inspired by true facts, it is a lifetimes film, a warning story for women, raising awareness of hiding hunters in the family (mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, track trainer in this case). Young and younger known actress Ariana Richards (she played the little girl of Jurassic Park) raped high school truck mate Mickey Carlele with her coach, Kurt Unasm (William Boomler) and she would have to be silent. Nobody believes his story, of course, without his own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, fight the mother and daughter bar behind the clock to make Ansom. The film is quite frustrating, expected to last, sometimes very vow for dramatic, but at the end really strong. Daytime soap type of performance of the Arena Richards, but he is strong in the entire shield. His facial expressions, physical language and overall acting are, in fact, he has to fight court in the same way as a soft athlete, who has his coach, instead of violating him and living with shame, injury and more. William Boomler participated in a strange kind of similarity, though he was far from fine. He has previously abused other star athletes, who are silent and made it to the top, and are considered innocent. Little known actors such as William Boomler did not play such role anymore, but he made a credible and strong performance overall. This role is especially annoying to see him, because he has acted in something other than a sexy lead actor and sub-opera "guiding light". The only real problem with this film is the film's structure. As soon as the film is opened, we see coach Anisam raping Mickey, we do not know at this moment that this guy is not good. But this weak character makes for the development and story. If the first scene is sequenced with opening credits, we see Maize running across the city across the lake / jogging, our good character will develop because we do not know Coach Anomone, although its star athletes are successfully interested, really a nasty piece of work, and we have a Mikey person I saw the idol that she thought she knew and then she realized that she was wrong about him. Director Joseph Scannan is not a stranger for movies such as Notting Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, The Outright Limits, Loose and Clarke, Earth Final Conflict, and La Femi Nikita. In 1996, Scanlan conducted another lifetime movie. This "Stand Angzen Fier" (1996). He has published the gravity of the event The coach is really disturbed by the coach who hides his own student during rape, and these messages should be graphic and mature, but his message is clear: Sexual predators and rapists are not always a strangers and can take various forms and their predictions A high school can be included on the basis of this film Called the women to resist violence against the girl and called on the women to be silent victims for witness and witness so that rapists can not harm anyone else. Despite the other negative reviews, this film does a great job by expressing her message and mother, daughter , Hike should be given to G. School Students (both male and female). As bad as rape, it happens even if it happens to stay silent.
