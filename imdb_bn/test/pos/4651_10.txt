Ridiculous, clear, light-hearted, and quotable. What else can you ask for a film? This is my all time, number one favorite movie. Since I was a little girl, I saw the dream of becoming an owner of a watch bubble with a blue van. <br /> <br /> Cliche characters make this film so funny in comical situations. Among the great works of Stephen First (Harold) and Andy Tenant (Melo), I made my favorite parts of the comedy chemistry film. And who knows Flannick's frustration? Do not forget Leon's Kronis airport antics, Harry is wearing a karachi-like dress: dance, moon and skin to eat! The sources are gifted, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> A word to the wise, if you have not seen this movie, then perhaps it's a place in your heart today. But despite this, it gives an opportunity, you can find that "It does not matter what you say, no matter what you do, you have to play."
