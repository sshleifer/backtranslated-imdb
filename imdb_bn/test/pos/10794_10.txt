"Talk Radio" is my favorite Oliver Stone film, although he has created many great personalities including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Bourne Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "talk radio", it is the expansion of a film featuring Eric Bogosian, a film based on the real life account of a Dallas talk show host. Assalamu Alaikum works with Robert Richardson, Stone can turn out to be a very specific exercise in ideological warfare, which represents a radio station as part of the war. Bogosian Barry Shamplyon describes an overwhelming dose of mischief, destructive nature and self-cruelty over his substance abuse, devastating and firmly as the sky's spouters. Alex Beldwin attacked the perfect note like a perfect note by a person like his alpha male boss, whose physicality he helped to keep. Alan Greene Barry's sweet ex-wife is fantastic, who became another target of his harmful personal Vitriol. Stones and bogosiyan fill every line of dialogue with every frame and sweet poison with interest and cut the ambiguity. John C. McGinny, Barry's long-awaited screenwriter / techie producer, as a stu, has performed brilliantly, as Michael Wincott. The film is a remarkable, incomprehensible performance and a flawless, incomprehensible, unmatched performance. Stuart Coopland score is very bright.
