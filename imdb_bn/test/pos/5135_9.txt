This is a delightful gem of a movie, unfortunately, as a hiatus for "just for kids." This plot revolves around the young man Roy Eberhardt, who came from Montana Mountains to southwest Florida. Trying to fit with other kids in her middle school, Ray invents a brother sister group trying to protect the endangered burrowing ounces of an illegal construction site. For Carl Hysen, based on this movie, the author of the book, as Secretary of the Secret Secretary of Corporate Headquarters Writers / Directors Will Shinar also called Clark at the Office of the Public Records, where cruel teen-detectors discovered that the reporting of harmful environmental impact was missing. Louis Wilson has stolen most important scenes from the most compelling teen actors in most of the best lines. Explosive police officer at Wilson Blue Light and his three-wheel electric electric cart with Fanny Siren. As Officer Dave, he tried so hard to do good work, but usually falls in vacuum, literally! Several times! Very few roots as a teacher of hostage supermarket supporter. However, young actors Logan Lurman (Roy), Brian Larson (Beatrice Beer), and Cody Linley (Mulllet Fingers) are fantastic like young people, who finally call the officer Dave to the right path. . I hope you will move away from the feeling of this movie as I did. Just a little fun! One small complaint, though. I hope all non-Florida understand that despite everyone being portrayed in Florida, the novelists are not skeptical. We're really a friendly bunch! Just ask Carl Haysen and Jimmy Buffet!
