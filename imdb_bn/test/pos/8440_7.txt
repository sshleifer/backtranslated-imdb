Thirty years have passed since this movie has been created, there has been some deterioration and can not keep the public conscious, because I am sure it did in 1979. It's still entertaining enough - and after getting some of it, today one finds out his tragic relevance (see the story of FirstGurvey's Davis-base nuclear plant). Line actor and at a steady pace ignore the '70's ​​atmosphere and it is seen for political criticism. I doubt it will survive the test of time anyway. It may not be completely forgotten thanks to its cast, but otherwise dialogue, setting and score will not create a rebuilding of this movie. The situation of oil is now comparable compared to the 70s and alternative alternative sources are becoming hot again, we can expect that the current generation gets blockbuster alert about the risk of this national nuclear energy.
