This is a good science-fi series. It involves character development, a few really exciting moments and reasonable episode scripts. Another commentator here said that this is a small series, it does not seem to be full leak series with filler episodes and low budget. <br /> <br /> The problem of the show which is briefly starting in the Gadijil series, it is incredible monsters, very big with gorgeous science, then it is warming all the American Americans stuffed. Then, the show ended soon, because the Olympics are coming and hey! A science-fiction show is a science-fiction show, but half of the nude athletes are more important than running in the public. So they are only 22 instead of 22 episodes. Visitors were very small, because people could not really catch it at 20:00. In the end the case did not do this. Conclusion: There is an exhibition with your special effects, huge monsters such as killing people or boating, then going to genetic engineering, transforming people, human clones, end of the world, tsunami Also, only the filers are killed for their stupidity, aggressive redhead or other annoying people. The bottom line is that after 15 episodes, which creates huge things, the show ends. No real end, no closing, just a bitter taste of a mouth on the face, as you swallow one of the pieces in just one.
