Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are really atmospheric, and if the interior shots around the table are a boro, then the night and other shots of the sea are really exciting. Then Connie Island (even a short jittery roller coaster ride) has almost historic, animated scenery, and this episode where two women are behind the mesh on a separate bed and the audience at the midweek can try to tip them. On, and women (moderately clothed) eggs come to strange sex-like ways. Always watch Garbo (front of the crowd). <br /> <br /> Surely Garbo makes this movie even more so than another very good first discussion. He plays on all sides of his character. She is coy and suspicious and in some inner pain. He smiled and cried, withdrew and pushed the exterior. In some ways it is looking for a forward, extraordinary movie (directed by Clarence Brown, which has a significant era of this pre-code word era). <br /> <br /> While playing successful Eugene O'Neil, it struggles to write a few as the actors sometimes prefer to go to pace. Mary Dressler She is almost great in that exaggerated way of trademark. And then there's Grey Garbo, actually there's natural presence, though it seems to be a little bit of a bit, though (but still, so everyone is all). Garba is definitely the first famous as a silent actress, and this is her debut film debut. The audience loved him as he made German version the following year.
