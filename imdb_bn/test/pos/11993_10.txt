One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is extremely strong as an 'in-name unit' sigail. There is nothing wrong with this: Shave Chevy returns as Ty Webb. It connects the viewer with this character (from the original cadets in the 1980s) and thinks about the fans or Cadachac 2 as the first one. <br /> <br /> There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield was about to return. He had a large part of the first film, so Cadshash 2 was placed at the top of his return. Jackie Messon has done a new 'Rodney' and a perfect job for this movie, although their comic distribution is different. Dan Icrade was great but not enough in the film. Moore was involved in screen screen during the first phase. Robert Stack (Air!) 'New' Ted Night / Villian's role was good. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Nunan will have to go back. Many people could have come back to show us how much more happened to them after eight years. Bushwyd could not reduce the total makeover Instead, the characters involved in the club itself instead, they should have the main focus like the first one. When you watch this movie, remember that this is not a major lead and you might think it's another good or bad eight comedy. The fans of the first must see it, but do not be frustrated when the comparison between the original and part II is so far away.
