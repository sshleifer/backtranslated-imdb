Surmise, this film involves two actors (Caine and Moran) to try to convince a gangster. The plot is the best flimsy as various plot covers across the hole. Generally this matter should not be done as comedy should bear such a film though. There are some really funny bits (mostly distributed by Dillan Murder). However, at other times, long-mildramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie. Caine's character looked overdone to me. Especially in the beginning, he constantly quoted Shakespeare and worked like a pompous actor. Someone might say that he is playing the part correctly, but the character seems to be flat and weird. Overall I will see only a fan of actors acting. Otherwise wait for the video or TV.
