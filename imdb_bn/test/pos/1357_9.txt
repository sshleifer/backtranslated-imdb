This is the last episode of Goldby OVA series. Kento has seen himself working in an animation studio, if you do not know how to run anime studio but it is interesting Apart from episode 3, it was probably the lowest receipt, but it was a beautiful girls' interest, as well as wonderful reunions from others in previous episodes. My only complaint seems to be very slight about this episode, but at the same time it can only be because it is the only original script for a non-based show based on chapters. But it ended well, leaving us with a nice feeling, which is 25 years worth of studying. Surely, look at the rest of the series, you can buy the entire series for $ 17, you can see it for about 2 2/2 hours, or you can see your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes free time (which is the lunch break in school if I .) Good series, check it out.
