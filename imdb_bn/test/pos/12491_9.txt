It is an exceptional picture with so much recommendation. There are lots of great twists and turns in acting and writing awesome and plots. As a French "Nir" film, her language certainly is much more than her American counterpart, but it has only been linked to reality. In addition, I like how everyone was non-glamorous - especially the husband and lieutenant. Only about negative, and the reason 9 gets and not 10 numbers, because it was a dark plot hole. Similar to other famous French movies like Drolle de Drum, the confusion between police and the accused started easily, but the letters were rather stupid decisions. For this, you just need to suspend mistrust and keep watching - waiting to wait the payoff is a good one. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best French movies I see. Duration
