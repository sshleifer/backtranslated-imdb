This movie is a hidden gem. I do not understand why this movie does not get much wind time. Errol and Eleanor Parker made for a real interesting and dashing couple. And their chemistry is irrational. I really liked her touching her daughters as her Robin Hood. I highly recommend this to those who enjoy Errol Flynn. It is good to see Iraq as well as father. Through all the accounts from his own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. Also, supporting cast is excellent as well. You can not make mistakes with players supporting Haiti McDaniel and Luciele Watson. Hattie McDaniel made a movie which is much better than getting it. This movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home. Enjoy !!!
