I wanted to remember it many years ago on television, but forgot the performance of Sammy Davis, Jr., I just thought of watching it in the video. Porgy and Bess transform this into a treasure. I love to see it again and want to introduce it as my son. Sammy Davis, Jr. I do not think any of the greatest performances of all time has ever been dropped. Anyone who is responsible for not bringing it to the audience will be ashamed of his ignorance. I have to look for it though. Perhaps African American actors responsible for such things will be forced to realize the forgotten work of execution.
