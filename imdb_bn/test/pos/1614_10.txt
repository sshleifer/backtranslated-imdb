I saw "David in Venice" in 1971 about 15 years ago, it's running deeply and often thinks about it. Looking back again a few days ago, I realized it was at the peak of the great works of movies. With a dialogue, it attracts the audience with beautiful cinematography, fine acting, and above all, without the music of the mansion. The film was not available except for this film. <br /> <br /> "Venice's Death" is a stunning one of the most famous composers, Thomas Mannell's adaptation of novel Lucino Viccanti (he was a writer in the novel, but made him a composer in the film, which is an excellent concept that works praiseworthy) Gustav von Aeschbach (Gustav Mahler Dependent on) who traveled to Venice in the summer of 1911, from personal loss and professional failure For the sake of His search for beauty and fulfillment is accomplished when he sees a son of incredible divine beauty. Asenbach (Dirk Bogard) the boy did not try to follow him everywhere. The son, Tadio, belonged to very rare animals, which is an intelligent and conceptual power that attracts you, inspires you, conquers you and makes you captive. Asenbach Tadizio became one of the prisoners of spellbinding. He became addicted to it; She fell in love with her. Was it a blessing or a curse for him? I think of both. It was impossible that he died from impossible, impossible but beautiful love. The last picture was taken by the eyes of Seenbach and the boy's silhouet surrounded by the golden sun light. It can not be compared with the beauty and elegance of the scene, and it can only dream of dream to take the grave with you. If he can, Eschenbach probably said, "I was able to witness one of the faces of perfection, I could not bear it, but I liked to learn to be present in this world and now I can die peacefully because it happened to me." > <br /> Unforgettable music, Hunting Adagatoro of the fifth symphony of Gustav Maheller looking for perfect use in a perfect film Got it It reflects a passion for a main character - it is long, it is lasting, longing for hope and it gives the impression that once you pray for beauty you are condemned to die. I have taken hundreds of movies that can use full classical music but never compare with "the death of Venice". I boldly say that Maheller's music is his main character - it will vary depending on what is happening on the screen and will sound differently. When he returned to Venice in Venice, he was very happy, which he thought would be his happiness but he died. It sounded frustrating when he first entered Venice from the sea. You can hear many different feelings in it - sincerity and loyalty, confusion and self-frustration, worship and sadness, but always - love that gives pure happiness and literally gives it. For a viewer what was the film for the age composer / writer / artist. We were enchanted by its power and beauty and captivated by as much as Achenbach was by the mysterious charm of the boy.
