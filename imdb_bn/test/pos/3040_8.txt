Just saw Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the film leaves something cheerful, it is an impressive study of the evolution of a young man and a hearty study and a prerequisite south to connect with students with pre-retreat and skillful situations and to overcome the creativity of the teacher. As a teacher, to adapt a teacher to his students and prepare them for all the challenges of life, not the lessons found in textbooks, this is a valuable concept that we all need to remember. Vietnam war threads are even today true. Well worth a look.
