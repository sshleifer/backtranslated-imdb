Although the film has been set in the modern English class, it is a simple story scattered from a couple. It is a slightly dated wind, it is an adaptation of "Way to Through the Wood", the 1950 novel Nigel Bachin (once popular and now forgotten). Despite the academy award for the "Gossford Park" script, Julian Felios has written a few authoritarian personalities, written and directed the script (later for the first time). With the DVD version I have seen the most elaborate audio comments by Julian. Her primary focus was getting her character right, and by the big she was successful. In this he called James, the Sailier City lawyer, and Emily Watson as his attractive wife by taking two outstanding performance by Tom Wilkinson. She kept it short; Only 80 minutes running time <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James and An√© Chelsea have a city house and a comfortable eastern prey of Buckinghamshire. Anne is younger in some years but they are childless. Outside they seem happy, but James, one of nature's morals (unusual for a city's lawyer), a control freak. Only honorable, down the street. William Buel is not one for middle-class morality, and he is more than happy to take advantage of. But there is a complexity, a road accidents, in which a transaction is run by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover in a country's lane. There are bill. Soon, James, Anna, Bill and the victim's widow (which could be James and Anna's cleaners) dragged towards conspiracy to conceal what had happened. The impact of the damage on everything related to James and Anne is the primary focus. <br /> <br /> The third person in this mensage was played by Rupert Everett. From casting point of view, its weak, superior method is right for the part, but not the way it can reach it. This is partly because he is supposed to be sick for some time and he looks good when he is supposed to be ill, and vice versa. The part seems untouched. It is interesting that John Neville's Bill's parents only managed to make their own character beautifully established. <br /> <br /> The world of 5-star hotels and higher restaurants arises nicely. Julian Felios said in the audio commentary that these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwinian age is still alive. Still, what does the film attract the couple together and what separates them. While writing the book, Nigel Bacchin was leaving through a marriage ceremony, and made a good fist to maintain Fellos' environment. He said that it's a fairly free adaptation, but the central theme is the same.
