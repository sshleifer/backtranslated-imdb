I think Jason has learned so much from Big Fat Lea. When Marty stole his story and told the truth, then he was like a boy who wailed the wolf. People listened to him, but they did not believe in him. Nobody did anything to help him. Alongside, Marty's films are not wasted, so they also give advice. The truth is not overrated She is so happy she really got exposed for what she did. Everyone found that he stole from the boy, including his parents. He did not steal only from the boy and lied about him, he gave somebody else's work and tried to call his own, which is the act of theft. Does he not know that the idea of ​​stealing someone's idea is illegal? Another reason he got fired. He is not trustworthy. He is a liar, cheating, thief, a coincidence and a churika. Did you get that Marty? You are a stealer Plus, you've got everything you deserve.
