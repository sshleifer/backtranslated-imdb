The third and final women's prize Scorpio film directed by Sunita Ito. Series star, Meko Kazi, will complete the series in fourth installment, Grassgie Geet, Able Yasuhar Hashbele (who Karzis has directed the excellent Strait Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). Original Female Prison # 701: Scorpio is my best favorite of all times. Sekel, Gelhaus 41, almost as well. It is usually considered to be the best of the series and I agree, I think, if it ever gets a better version in DVD (original, by image, very poor). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as the FP701. It's too slow, a lot more thoughtful. It is part of violence and viciousness, but there is more focus on stories and characters. Sasori (Qazi) ran into the first scene in search of spies (he hammered one hand and closed his arm and fled with him, which can be believed!) And hooked up with a freelance prostitute Yuki. Yuki is being disturbed by a local prostitution ring, in which there is a pet mad madam with a full cage of pet dogs. Truly wondering how sad the movie is. Yuki's story, which is never solved, it's heartwarming. The images are flashy, and the direction of the IT is efficient. It is very bad that he did not go anywhere after leaving the FP701 series. This is a terrific film.
