"The Disclosure", a full-length movie Kisłówski made this episode of the year ago, we came back to this viewer when we saw the whole ten vintet. Like other films, this is dependent on the fifth order, or "do not kill you". Written by Krisztof Piesweiz, Kriseztf Kisłowsky, a young man's mind commits a serious crime to express his own frustration. There is a Dostoyevsky character in this installment that reminds us about "crime and punishment", or at least some of the novels have been sent to the target young people who are not apparently a freedom fighter. <br /> <br /> The story shows the young man traveling around the city or where he will go without any idea what he will do. He showed that only in flexible moments when he visited the photographer's place to recover an old picture of his sister. The murderer with the intention of robbing Kieslowski's driver, leave it to fate, but this is the anger and frustration which get the best of this youth to get killed for a death that does not deserve. The last moment of this criminal is one of the most secretive sequences in a film, past, or presence. <br /> <br /> Another element of the story is the relation between the defendant and the criminal. The court can not condemn the execution of death sentence! The lawyer feels that he eventually failed his client and went to the judge where he made a mistake. The youngster asks him to recover the image and send it to his mother. <br /> <br /> The description of how he interpreted the fifth commandment creates the description of a wonderful movie that the audience will have a long cherished mind. This episode was later forgotten.
