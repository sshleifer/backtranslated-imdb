Will E. This second pair of Quate and Road Runner is the first to be as the first. May be predictable, but I do not care and I still smile so much when I see it. Will E. Rod Runner Shorts was always the most special place in my heart. So, the second collection of the golden collection is not only 11 features, but chronology (2 to 12, the first episode was Volume 1), I see it wrong. I love this thing. This animated brief can be seen on Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 Disk 2. It also has a variant of Michael Bayer. <br /> <br /> My grade: A +
