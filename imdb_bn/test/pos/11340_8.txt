For a long time I did not know the weather. I do not like this picture. This is amazing, because I usually know, but since the movie does not go anywhere, I was a little confused. <br /> <br /> Two people go to a minor communal family setting. Outside loneliness, their attention, business attention, or the search for their husbands going away, fear of one another. Following a platonic love relationship, the leadership leadership of Tony Lange Chew revealed that there is a mistress next to him. Su Li-jan managed by Maggi Cheung has been hurt, though their love relationship is not physically rich. Chiu leave the country, only come back to the year, when everything has changed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is correct, the film is correct. Actively not touching the part of the love or touching it, only to reach it, the film acknowledges that many others are saying something about this matter. It is also true, I think, if they leave with this issue then nothing good can come. <br /> <br /> If we believe, however, Garcia Marquez wrote that "love is a blessing, nothing but alpha, omega, one end in itself", then this image is read in a nutshell, as well as others. Or, if you fully understand the incomplete subtlety, it hits it properly. Which movies in history have achieved, communicated or sustained this term, if only for a short time? My honest feeling of memory is that almost two. When Harry Met Sally effectively offers these romantic perfection; And getting there is all just getting there. When it is interesting to Harry Mate Sally, it is certainly done by Wooing, instead of achieving it. Can not say something good about love after achieving it by two people? Nicholas Spark's latest film The Notebook probably comes closer than any other film; Can we believe that once the love is achieved, the radar can only achieve perfection in some other level, or perhaps the truth is hidden vehicles for the other side? <br /> <br /> Mood for For Love is a decent film, which is worthy of the best and liberal cinematography for Almodora's best offer, yet it continues to say that "Life is sometimes Like this. "Now it is not a vague thing, especially if it is good, but it really comes only after the final work is done when Kar Yai Wang is second to this film, a bigger Try to be involved with. The historic theme played in the background of the relationship which has just happened. This is an appropriate effort, and the film is more brighter than the musical motifs playing around the film, but the additional charge of the theme is not a mistake, the film is a mistake, divided by the viewer, not playing much more than the effect of holistic trends on the spectators. A director should know where he is going and how to go there. But in all honesty, it is only one wrong turn. However, anyone who knows, it takes a significant incomplete to loot the perfect barrels of honey. <br /> <br /> While the effort is certainly valuable; A historic theme extends and tries to surround the movie and try to raise it outside of the couple's tiny money, but without a real prediction, it is a serious mistake. A word, and unfortunately, is too late too. I also think that the challenge for the non-Asian audience is very challenging, which is not well known to China's history, fully praised this massive stroke.
