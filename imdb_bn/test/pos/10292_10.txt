This sad romance is unlikely because the director decides to break his description and propose the perspective of each character. So, there are many re-shooting flashbacks of the same scene. But, to see the results, the fragile moment of the movie is broken into pieces! <br /> <br /> And it will be valuable, because it has created the only French movie for me! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Cast: Monica Baluchi and Vincent Castle are the first steps! For such a presence and hearing such as voice, even hard! <br /> <br />: The camera can be mysterious with the bright, living, set-to-dramatic, or long-closing "A la David Lynch". <br /> <br /> Cinematography: The light, beautiful, love, between gold and pepper! <br /> <br /> Never seen in front of Paris: This is a far more majority of the district than Paris! Huge search here! It's like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! <br /> <br /> Music: Not the big orchestra but the perfect tune with the frame. And the Charles Ajnavore song invented this great singer! <br /> <br /> Story! As I said, this is a love story but sad: it can not be anything to love that it does not make everyone happy or sweet is not guaranteed because this message is not often called! Love emotions, which are Latin "pain" derivative. You can enjoy a lot when you love! Why .. why, endless waiting, lack of courage, indecision <br /> <br /> And when you can make yourself happy, fate, luck, God (?), Satan (?) can knock you back, because soon or too late, and above all, because billions Love in the human world means 2! Many things can happen and many stories can be written! So, what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I lived in such moments: with my favorite car. Her mobile ring and you know it's her "special friend" whom she kisses farewell (and you do not, even if we are always together). So, if you want to go together from this car, listen to the sweet but cruel sounds but start an amazing hard rain because you can not! <br /> <br /> I have seen that this movie is no more like this moment of tragedy!
