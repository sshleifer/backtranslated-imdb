Lovely, yet lethal Alexander (stunning beauty beauty Stacy Randall, who is running out in tight black skin decorations) must find out a magic amlet so that his evil demon giant Fost can exceed our level. It's horrible, broke broke Jonathan Peterson (preferred Peter Liapis) to stop him. Meanwhile, two cruel, unreasonable "sunshine relief" dwarf genes run animated animals in Los Angeles. Experienced lady exploit specialist Jim Wynorski relates absolute incredible stories at a dynamic pace and remotely takes this stupidity seriously. Cast struggle with cruel ingredients: Alan Woods Sassi, Captain Katte of Police, Turtle to Rachel Karel, Sexy Hooker Gene, Blaster of Bobby Djokov, Exciting partner Scottie, Peggy Trentini's lavish museum Quetter Monica, and Shes Mascus as cheerful Dr. Rosell. Mark Stevey's old cookie cutter script, brain-biting hawkish, chunky coconut score, clear cheap rubber masks, genre of Jay Bush, two dwarf persons playing tension or unwanted female nudity, and sticky (low) special effects all the celluloid velveta The main piece enhances overall delicious cheesiness. Brainy piece of a lonely dreck of delightfully cute.
