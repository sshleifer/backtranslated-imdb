This is a wonderful B-film horror movie which is horrific and comedy borders It's about a genetically deformed scorpion in outer space. Can it get more non-real? This is a hybrid between "alien" and "chain genocide" This image was well-communicated with Stockholm and mixed mixed images of Americans and Swedes in Stockholm. Director Martin Moon has done a great job in finding this humorous highlight in this script and got some good smiles from the audience. Inspiring to see what the film was shot with little or no money and what can be done with a limited organization. Stinger has all the qualities of a B-movie horror movie. It is ridiculous and scary at the same time and dedicated to cast and crew for their reasons. It is good to see that such movies can still be made! If you like this type of movie I would recommend it to see.
