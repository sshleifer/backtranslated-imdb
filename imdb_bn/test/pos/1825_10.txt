Valley Girl will always keep a special place in my heart: I would say this 80's teen-sexual comedies the best of course, but appreciate that a back-handed. This is a good movie, duration. It's very specific at times and places - it's an unforgettable snapshot after 20 years - yet its story remains timeless. (This is just Romeo and Juliet, the lowest after death!) Nicholas Cage is wonderful, all the primary promise showed that, as it turns out, he has squandered over the growing action Cropa. Deborah Farman is the publisher of this movie, and I can not believe that he did not go for a big career; Someone finds her quick It is sweet and flexible than most of the genre of films - Necessary nudity is cast by contractual obligation - and, when it is not groundbreaking, it is certainly worth watching that this film respects its character and does not crucify it. The indifferent teenage girls are fun - even the best friends are frumannian crew, distracted by colleague pressure, are never presented as villains. (In fact, his friend Stacy, w / Cage's friends forced Fred twice, despite his protests, there was a good time, and w / Fred was made in the back.) If you stayed there, it would take you back to 80, but It holds up quite well today Warning to strangers with the movie: Do not see any of the continuous listening of VH1 - rent it in its unknown magnitude. Alternatively, you do not want the most effective, time-specific conversations in some movies. And no one can write about Valley Girl, and does not mention the 80 acoustic soundtracks - most of them are surprising, which is not an integral part of the film's time and space, but the theatrical well-chosen. See it - a little flick of awesome! Start again !!
