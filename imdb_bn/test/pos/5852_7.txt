Sandra Bullock paints credible images as a scary detective, although she believes in feeding a disciplined person as victim-turned-abuser, though she needs a sign of trust (or two). Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt portrayed two strange problematic kids. <br /> <br /> I make several problems in Ben Chaplin's equation (the same problem arises when I see 'the truth about cat and dog' (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979/) I mean When you put an Americanman in a universal American film, at least there should not be any reason to keep him there? There should not be any stories that an English is acting as an American police force on a Should some conversations be pointed out and instead should explain clear explanation or have some jokes about his English? <br /> <br /> He is seeing a place here, as he found out 'the truth about cats and dogs'. Of course, watch, disturb and disturb the viewer intimately (at least mine). There is no problem with Chaplin's acting, it's just an actor The matter is made out of place 'believable and not putting him anywhere without a good reason or a story. <br /> <br /> The movie itself: Well, the thriller, especially those who deal with a complex crime solution, requires some suspension of disbelief. . This one is not different; In fact, it requires several attempts than usual. To make the board think enough to be under enough pressure to spare, it is necessary to release him, some unrealistic ideas are being made to prove, and I am sure many people who saw it were in a few moments, 'Come, this situation is very unlikely' or even 'Hey, you can not place this movie as well as proof of upload!' <br /> <br /> As I said: Reasonably entertaining and watch. Just do not use this as the need for detective testing. There are no shortcuts there.
