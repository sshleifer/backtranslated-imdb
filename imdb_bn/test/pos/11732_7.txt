I have not seen every single movie that Burt Reynolds has ever created, but this one (which I have finished watching for the third time) could be very good at her! It is only suffering from some slow stretches; Birt probably tried to try "arty" more than it should be. On the other hand, she is able to avoid most usual clich√©s in the introduction of "solid police" role (notice, for example, the scene where she tries to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time, or fear she is right before the final showdown with the incredible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and those two ninja killers are among three of the most memorable villains of the 80's Cop Thrillers. The film has some offshore touches, amazing amount of humor, a brutal and determined boxhead and many well-managed shoots. (***)
