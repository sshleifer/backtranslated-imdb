The "documentary", "Jurassic Park" of how the scientist's trusted dinosaurs were treated, and most of them were cognizant of CGI. Completely done as a prehistoric episode of "National Geographic" The first frame grabs your attention and lets not go. My favorite part was when the Directococus Alsours stopped. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. What is all about this science?
