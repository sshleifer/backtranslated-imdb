It came back last year that I've seen Doctor Doctor be one of the best episodes. Entertainment has a glorious blend of fear and tenderness, which equals an amazing episode that all mixed up. Ood is brilliantly designed and I'm sure there are going to be a lot of ood jokes in several weeks. I myself am guilty for it. I especially liked that we saw a different perspective on the relationship between the Rose and the Doctor and the end; Well, for the first time I was hiding behind the cushion! I can not wait until the next week's episode to find out how to get this mess out.
