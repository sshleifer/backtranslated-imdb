I saw the MTV preview when I was not planning to get lost, but I did not see or see better than this on my Sunday night. <br /> <br /> There was no need for a dream but it was a very good movie made by MTV. The one thing that caught me to look at was the Samar Phenix late and the wonderful river Pioneer's sister. I think Mehdi ran in the Fenix ​​family because he was good and so the river Jackin River though. Nick Stahl gives a great preformance as a junky joke. There is nothing to talk about wasted. It was the dark sadness and insightful look of the life of the junkies in three small cities. I recomend those who love those topics. 8/10
