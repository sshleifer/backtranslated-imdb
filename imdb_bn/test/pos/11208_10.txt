Sadly painful; Probably made by the movie Chekhov. What is really interesting is that two cousins ​​are so common (many details on their relationship are wrong). <br /> <br /> What's really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they simply do not bring themselves to talk to each other - or anyone else! It's horrible If you are ever afraid to talk to someone who is very embarrassed, worried, self-involved, or just talking to ordinary people (and who do not?) You will definitely see yourself in this movie. And it will not be nice. <br /> <br /> It hangs a mirror to the viewer and says, "If you do not like what you see ... change it".
