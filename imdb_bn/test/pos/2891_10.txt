I recently bought this DVD and I was completely amazed that when Rash songs were heard in 1980, they made similar sounds. Jade Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peer's lineup are so talented that I want to play them again <br /> <br /> <br /> Songs remember Tom Swar, XYZ, The Big Money, The Tries, Freewill, Closer to the Hart, 2111, Limelight and The Spirit of Radio and 40000 plus devotees to sing and spend a great time and I swore more than half of the viewers under the age of 25! <br /> <br /> As far as Russia is known to be a fan, Russians are also worried. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How long have they been unmarried? They do what they enjoy! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD 100 100.
