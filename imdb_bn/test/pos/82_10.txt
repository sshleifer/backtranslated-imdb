When Circus comes to the city and lions's cage is directly placed on the house of the Bugs Bunye, the bugs are empty and end up in the right place in the midst of cruelty. Despite the title of "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end when the bug and lion performs acrobatic. But even leading to that, it's quite fun to eat what's eaten; On the other hand, he always tries to use the weaknesses of other characters against him and then pulls a convenient material from thin air! After the bug "Big Top Bunny" ends in the circus. I made it better, because the opponents later opposed the Eastern European language (I know it was during the cold war, but still) have made a little bit of the drug. I recommend this. <br /> <br /> And finally we can make sure that it will never be aloud for this cartoon.
