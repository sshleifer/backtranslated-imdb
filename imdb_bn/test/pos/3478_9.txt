When I was 10 (now 14), I never saw a movie which I knew was not a happy ending. And a few weeks ago I did a great job, without the Shakespeare for the English class ... etc ... I'm still looking for something that I'm still happy about. But then I saw Ramla Garai on Havana night, which was beautiful, not good, but enough entertainment to see. After seeing this a few times over two or so years I saw it, I liked it, especially like music increased. So I did a search on her and found out the IMDB ... I saw "I'm dancing in" and guessed that she made another dance, and saw it. After this, I took a picture from this movie in search of pictures (Riri, looking for Gilmore Girls poster for locker) ... I searched the trailer then, I found the trailer and when I saw in the hospital and Rory heard that, "You have a future" I I remembered my pledge and realized that this would not be a good movie for me. But it was behind my mind until we used to stay in the video store and used $ 5, so I went ahead and bought it. After looking at it I just wanted to get out of my head because it was very sad. I did not have to go around it until I had a cerebral palsy as a vocab word. Even then, I had to show it again and this time I made everyone smile, even in the sad part, I did not feel depressed because I realized that these movies were happy and enthusiastic ... I love it and now it's my choice, I'm sure You have read any bad comments. But watch the movie it's valuable.
