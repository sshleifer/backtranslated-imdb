When reading the book of Karl Hyssen, the film is true for most of the cases, with some minor changes to Hollywood. In my opinion this is a great family movie. Lab Wilson (Officer Dylinko) has stole an all-star cast with Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. A great job for kids in the film led by Logan Lurman, Bry Larson, and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I painted a big girl, 6 feet, 175 lbs, Beatrice role . This may be more credible in his role of punishing him. They improved their "tough girl" character, and had to bite him with tires, or cut a football ball through a person. He is so beautiful, and I realized why he threw, he was a box office attraction. <br /> <br /> This day does not get any movie, no sexuality, and very little violence. This film is a true story of a parent, a strong environmental message, which reveals the beauty of Florida's beauty and the beauty of its wildlife. It shows how adults are shortened to our planet's authority, and our children can make better claims. Muller Fingers says that one of my favorite lines in the movie is "Florida can be used like some Montana. Florida is so flat, there is nothing to stop developers from clearing off the coast from the coast." Also, the Florida Wildlife Photography spoke volumes without dialogue. As a family movie with kids 5-15 years, this is a great movie! Will be entertained as a bonus father, especially if they are "parrotheads".
