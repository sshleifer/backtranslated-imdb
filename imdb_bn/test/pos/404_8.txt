I recently saw it in TCM and, through IMDB, I saw seven "Crime Doctor" films as Warner Bucket's psychiatrist-detective. A decade ago, the 42nd Street is a bit longer in the teeth compared to its firm performance. Noor, and today a few camps, the film has also touched the potential supernatural way. The plot, black and white painters and characters Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan are much more complex than the series. There are many mistresses by B-movies, unexpected twists and appearances, firmly we all will recognize immediately (someone made it from a situation). It's a wonderful unpredictable 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a boxed DVD series of these pictures.
