It's a deep stupid humor ... but I like it. Jean Dujardan is a great actor in this movie. Bennesius Bezo is beautiful. It makes fun of all secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! This is probably the most ridiculous movie I ever seen. I saw it three times and I still want to see it. You buy the DVD as soon as possible. You do not regret it. It's a movie that you do not need a great scene because it's a parody. The only error is that OSS 117 is too small. This is a jewelry. The success of the French film of the United States is not really frequent, but I think everything will succeed. Believe me !!!
