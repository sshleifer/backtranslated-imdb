I just saw the DVD of this award-winning movie. One Life Stand is an extraordinary drama that draws a very compelling and honest picture, through its speed, black and white shots and atmospheric music. It is a story depicted by some of the tragic loneliness of power, sex and control around the grief of life. Mom (very well played Maoriin Carr) apparently and pulled herself on. The father only appears in the side-lines and is still a strong and original part of the drama. The money is hidden between the box and the shoes. <br /> <br /> The writing was fantastic, and I like the detailed sensual close up shots of nails, red lips, a candle, a mirror etc. The camera used was way too close to it. It adds an annoying story with sexual tension, while adding to the sadness of the sad character while drowning in the dark streets of Glasgow. <br /> <br /> Some memorable shots are displayed on your shoulders or shoulders - such as walking down the bridge bridge. And the surprise and hazardous appearance on the face of the tragedy, in the call center, which is hoping to help people using the taite cards to listen to their callers' inventor's conversation. <br /> <br /> At the beginning we saw John Paul, wide eyes and innocent, because of the shot shot, he wanted to try modeling. Trise, deluded her mother, and made poor choices for her, pushing her away in a way when she tried to keep him. John Paul's modeling escort was made to work, and the Triz boss gave his money and finally he went on a date. There are moments of humor and fine mockery. A nice scene when they have a fairly normal diet and starts to open a bit, when the father sees his dark presence and everything on the clouds. But this, and some other offers moments of hope <br /> <br /> I sometimes thought that the film was very intense, but it's a little bit of a challenging and memorable movie, and a little different. It has been standing on the reverse side of most American films, which can be seen as a fantastic, or original 'world', such as impressive spectacles. This film portrays life with all its rough ends and displays unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> It is not 'light entertainment' but a thought-provoking and real-life drama. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is truly involved and passionate honest film.
