This step is absolutely, its course, or any other, one of the best movies ever. Kubrick is not the greatest director ever, but his entire filmography should be kept in a capsule and never forgotten. 2001: A Space ODC A journey that I see on any screen. Kubrick is some of the directors who can attract you and keep you from start to finish, even in the absence of extended dialogue or plot development. As well as with the 2001, both of which are capable of presenting a picture of the future are both magnificent and scary. 10 out of 10, there is no doubt. For my money it is not much better than 2001: A Space Audices .... Now, Siegel, 2010 ... This is a different story.
