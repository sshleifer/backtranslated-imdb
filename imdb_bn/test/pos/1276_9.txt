Magnification like Chris Nolan's identity and credentials are amazing from the beginning. A first film is complex as "memento" or "the pristish", although it is a bit difficult to handle. Still it smacks originality and creative drives, and it has a "bend" as challenging as realistic gentleman as well. Some filmmakers have made good use of their editor and attention to the story of Nawalan. This story is an annoying writer who likes to follow random strangers in the street, until he follows someone else, and follows him, the complexity becomes complicated and identification starts again. More natural and realistic than the Naulan's next job, but just as the razor sharp.
