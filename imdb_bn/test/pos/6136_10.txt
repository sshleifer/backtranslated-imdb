I have been looking for this mini series for a very long time. I have seen this movie while coming back to Russia many years ago. If I'm interested in sending my copy to someone who has a copy of this movie, I'm interested. I would like to cover all costs and pay extra for tape or DVD. It's one of the best TV series I've ever seen. I would suggest it to those who are interested in Israel's history and world history after the Jews. I'm trying to find a book (I've heard that it's even better than the movie) but new amounts cost about $ 50 and I've never bought used copies. Thank you very much for my email address yurets777@hotmail.com.
