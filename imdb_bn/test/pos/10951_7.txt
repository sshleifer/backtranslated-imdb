A vampire princess falls for a human girl, negligence that her brother is a famous vampire hunter. The underlying theme of this martial art romp is that it captures ideas from "Underworld" and "Bufi the Vampire Slayer" but maintains its own style. I forgot the UK and Hong Kong title "The Twin Effect" because there was no pair in the story. It shows that the two main female characters are played by the Hong Kong pop stars, who are performed as "Twins". Do not let this stop you. These girls can work (at least for the good of this kind of film) and add a lot of work together. Jackie Chan has played with the presence of several cameras that add dash to the processing of its own brand Slapstick Mahmud. All this is great fun for all those who like to serve with help of their vampires who have tongue-in-cheek humor.
