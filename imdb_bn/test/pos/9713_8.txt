This movie exploded me - I only saw two episodes, never seen the first movie, but went to the pre-screen where Johnny Naxville introduced herself to the film, 'Hours and a half' to tell us to stop our ideas of moral judgment. She was right. As a film, it will probably rate 2, it will have zero plots, there will be no structure besides randomization and there will be very little production value. However, that's not the point. Everyone in our theater started laughing and smiling - just stants did not have anything creative (see if you need to know the trailer but they have hidden something best (or depending on how you want it), but they take us completely by surprise with some stuff. These guys are some things that will not make it into your newspaper reviews (and perhaps it's already However, about 3/4 stunts are fantastically violent (even morally reprehensible, even if you remember the statement of Noxville), and if you are in the right comments, this movie is harmful to watch. It can be shown on TV for about 20 minutes, so be careful about what you are going through - something to do Nis is hateful, but instead of being disturbed by it, you can smash it completely. I think the person who thinks Jacques was a fun person who had a hip-fade with just a few funny sketches and unnecessary pain, that I had the fun of this movie. There are no borders for this. The guys have to work. It should be a great comedic fix until it's so fun and boring. Through this movie you can remember what you got, but these people have a few steps in front of you - I'm sure you will be surprised at the third step. So enjoy and do not worry: you often do not want to do any stuff at home.
