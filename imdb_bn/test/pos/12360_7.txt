The grandfather of the Swedish film directed the existenceist film about Victor Sjostrom, this stark, treachery, betrayal, death, forgiveness, crime, release, and the most mad moments of human condition. He is not a star like David Holmes, who is not drunk, who returns to the drunken condition and responds to the moment of generosity, only afterwards his soul has to contract with the phantom carrier driver: Death. <br /> <br /> In contrast to many silent movies, almost non-existent scenes about the film's acting. Pensing becomes tired with his extremely familiar Dickensian description. However, it looks like a very brave and unique film, compared to the opposite film and its time.

This is definitely a truly obscure and horror movie for young people. Seeing the movie, this movie is easy to see after the Swedish master Ingmar Bergman's subsequent effects.
