I've seen more about this movie once. It's not the best scifi flick that I saw, but it's not a bad movie. The acting is good and the characters are less "budgetary" than most of the low-cost budget sciences. (At least it's not too stupid to have fooled bimbs like low budget CCI.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and she is single mother and is also concerned about doing something better than anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
