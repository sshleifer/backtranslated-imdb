This photo will be considered controversial today, but still very funny. The ethnic stereotyping is made from humor and not to hate. This picture has been closed and how the corrupt politicians already see in the early 1930's. This image was proven before the 1970s and before it was accelerated in America. Lloyd is still his standard style here, though his character is raised in China. <br /> <br /> In this example, the foot of a cat means a person running for political office, but is used to advance his agenda on established political machines. In other words, they think that this guy (Lloyd) goes to office when he is frustrated. Then when he was elected, he surprised them. <br /> <br /> This same theme is later used in the film James Stewart. Mr. Smith go to Washington. Stewarts are more famous and have a strong message. This picture is Harold Lloyd Trademark which is more tricky and finer. The heart of the romantic comedy is still hidden in the movie's disguise, but today's mainstream viewers will still appreciate political humor and the end is absolutely invaluable. I hope someone can defeat today's political system in this way. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie and loved Harold in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> At least we have this. I think the most quoted figure in the movie is the fictional gender po. I always thought Confucius is a wise person but it believes that China's wisdom was not limited to him, and the film was a huge field of comedy Lloyd.
