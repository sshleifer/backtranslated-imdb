Enemy-Penalty Battalion is looking at the life and death of an ongoing and most honest, Soviet soldier, who was sentenced to bleed their crimes with the blood during World War II. One could almost say it equivalent to the Russian equivalent "Brand of Brothers" miniseries. <br /> <br /> Created on July 1, 1942, in the wake of the Stalingrad War, the convicted battalions were considered as expensive units and were subjected to serious casualties. (Sometimes as high as 90%). The soldiers who were captured by the Germans but were able to escape, were accused of breaking the protocol, they were given the chance to join the program and prove that "traitors of the motherland" were "their lives." And those who die in war are rehabilitated and in view of the law, <br /> <br /> This miniser shows such an enemy in accordance with the order of Tordodelbov - a respected officer was captured by the Germans, left for the shot and the dead. It features a colorful and diverse group, from a situation There is no recourse to the force. The autocratic, but respected criminal group Antip "Kulak" (The Fish) and his small gang of overwhelming criminals, Young Jewish intellectuals who hit his anti-Semitant officer, father (Orthodox Priest) Mikhail, who lost his parish, joined the Battalion to fight in the house, political prisoners who hated the rule, but those who ended their country and country. Bar wished to fight, all of them must find out the reason for their courage and lifestyle, and fight To go <br /> <br /> While setup during the war, there is no war feature in every episode, indeed there are no war scenes, often undesirable, spodic and short - which were probably the direct objectives. In, throwing miniseries, their background, focuses on various relationships between their thoughts and tragedies. Rape and execution of a young woman of an enemy of the enemy, with the permission of AWL, the anniversary of the anniversary in March, the celebration of finding a German bunker (and the subsequent outcome) associated with food (and the champagne), moral officers hesitated in relation to their men having their own peers To protect against, deceive the spouse and especially in other circumstances Yahina. The camera is obsolete - it is not the unwiseness of the war and the folly of human nature, or away from the passion of raw people. Negotiations do not resolve the swearing in the same way. <br /> <br /> The acting is extraordinary and deep, and the script is similarly well written. To get rid of anger, fatigue, and to find a scrap of joy to lose everything for resignation, it is almost completely corrupted. One might argue that Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by some of the languages ​​and cultures not familiar with. Because it can be lost in some sense to a history drama, some terms and situations (military terms, mention of other war, some historical references) in some sense. There is no need to fully enjoy Shtrafbat for this understanding, but these references are an excellent touch of authenticity. Another charge that can be realized is that it is a plutonic event in the case of conspiracy and plot, but in truth, it is a tiny bit that will forgive a small loss.
