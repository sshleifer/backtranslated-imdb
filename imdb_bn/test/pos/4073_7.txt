I did not see this movie much to expect, but surprisingly surprised by Robert De Niro and Eddie Morphy's document. It was a fast movie and went for one and a half hour quickly. It certainly did not win any Academy Awards, but it was a change in the pace of Mr. De Niro. She is good in the comedy. Overall I enjoyed it.
