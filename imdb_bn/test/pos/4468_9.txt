As far as I know that I have seen most of Lucyo Florian's movies, except for the exception of the later on in the DVD, and I would say it's the best "pre-zombie" proposal. Actually it beats his next movie hands-down out. It's a story of curiosity and suspicion in a small Italian city somewhere in the middle, where young boys are mysteriously killed. It's no secret how they died, I guess, it's doing more. Is that a woman who is always a witch? Is this a young woman, who lives in an elegant modern house on the outskirts of the city, who used to do more drugs? Is it folly of the village, caught early in the wrong place at the wrong time? If you see only you know that it should, because it is a topical mystery thriller, or I say, "Gioło". I saw it before but it has been a long time and after watching the second it was strong for the first time. For your zombie flickr, only Lució knows Folcci, it opens up your mind because it is very good to look and when such a "monster" is such a person, they still have no objection to their next film. 9 out of 10 saw them! Please ....
