"Distant" is a slice of Turkish-life flick that follows the basic activities of two adult male cousins; One photographer and another unemployed underworld. There is little doubt that the progress of Nauri Bill Silon is quite efficient. However, this little foreigner short-term arty dramatic empty filler is so full and likely to appeal to such stories or something appealing or provocative that it should probably appeal to the film and only one of the most original festival audiences. I personally became increasingly anxious about the film and found rapid progress through vacancies - and there are many in dialogue, plot development, and denial. "Remote" Esoterica is a very nicely done bit. (B-)
