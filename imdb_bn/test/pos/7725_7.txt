This is an excellent film with good performances by Paz Wage and Leonardo Saberglia. Of course, Vicente Aranda is a legend in the Spanish movie and one of the great directors of the Spanish film, but I do not think it's great, even if it's one of his greatest movies. Screenplay is a character in the game with the introduction of Marymy, it's a nice touch but it's incredible. The song was composed by Jos√© Nieto, a national Spanish prize in the film. I mean this film is very good in all the technical aspects. Very good actor supporting roles such as Antonio Danchen, Maria Boto and others I have 7 out of 10 reasons to think it may be a good movie, but it is not annoying at all.
