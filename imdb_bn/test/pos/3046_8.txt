Martin Ritt seems to be always interested in social director (he was encouraged by him as the son of immigrants, especially since he was blacklisted in the 50's). Due to the inconsistency of the "right to the right" superintendent (Human Cronin), in 1969, based on Pat Conroy's novel "Water Wide Wide" on his own experience, teaching a school of almost black black children to the outside world. The power of the movie was in the cultural and historical context: Convey (John Voight) had despised the other teacher how many children do not even know about Paul Newman, Sydney Pot√≠re, Vietnam War, even Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I read a complaint that when Connie played music for children, she only got white music Played. True, you can not blame the movie for that; It was based on Conroy's real experience. In any way, the movie is a real jewel.
