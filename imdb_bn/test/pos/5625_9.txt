American movie is a wonderful documentary. It follows a very determined independent filmmaker's trial and hardships to struggle to finish his first film. <br /> <br /> A nice example of how the raw footage and insightful content of this film should be made by documentaries. I think movies that want to be film makers can be very inspirational to us.
