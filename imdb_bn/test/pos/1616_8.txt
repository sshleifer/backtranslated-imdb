I bought this DVD cheaply from Walmart, it seems to be a standard, shit-to-video giant junk, but it's much better than expected. There is no criticism to say about it ... it is probably a low budget, but it only joins the fun of old fashion. It's very cool and entertaining. <br /> <br /> has everything: horror, sex, a big plane crash and good characters. And I would say it's quite original, as any other movie that I saw it does not really stop it. This is its own unique look, which I liked so much, so the film is credited with credit. I want to see more of these horror films "The Skare Master", Brett Piper, whom I have never heard of before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is truly creative with Govi ​​Music. So it's just perfect to keep it when you're not ready to sit on it and visit it. It has some special features, which are really interesting But we do not see the director or hear him in the language, be shy. It comes out of Adjud Studios in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend it to all the awful buffs, you love it!
