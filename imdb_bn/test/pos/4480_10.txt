Honore de Balzac actually treated here as a warm-blooded love, although it was unfounded based on the strange short story, although it was unfounded, though in the early-1960s, love flowers in between men and animals. The thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels played the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic War, who held a exiled (?) French painter across the lazy, hazardous landscape of the Gobi desert. After traveling around the circles literally, two people try to reach the civilization, thus everyone decides to take their separate ways with the promise of returning to the same right place (against your decision against the right decision), and if any water source is available. How Daniel's character can face an animal (a wild and illiterate female leopard), and finally creates seemingly impossible ties or love, so that both save their life and almost destroy it until the end of the movie. Subtle cinematography, the least dialogue, a somewhat abstract story that indicates possible interaction between the three scenes, can eventually make professional critics cover the film as extremist and incognito. Although it's a movie that does not seem to be perfect for all your minds, but I think it's fine, although the legendary left-center mix mixed with a spiritual and vivid environment, it is compelled to play more than half of Flickr actor Ben Daniels against a wild animal. (Four leopards are actually only used to contradict one), which is simple The idea and the little knowledge of the theater indicate that it is a tragic and very difficult thing if she asked me, she became very bright! Overall, I think "Passion in the desert" spends some time, but if you are a patient, then it is willing to give some time, but really it makes a unique spell on you despite everything; And in contrast to the story of most platonic people and animal relationship it is not necessary to keep your interest in dry mouth, a monkey or a kid dog.
