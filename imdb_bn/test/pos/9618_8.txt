Five fingers of death: Although epic martial arts epics showed the influence of the American cowboy style, nobody liked it openly, especially for Salon's war scene. And although the Shaw Bros movies borrowed from the Japanese Chambor (swords) style, no one did it with such success. I think this director was with this issue from Korea, and thus a Chinese-based approach to this loan was brought, which certainly raises some interesting questions about culture; But at any event, this movie presented practical innovations in technology and technology in Hong Kong Action Films. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera was given full access to any set, meaning that many angle shots, such as low-end interior shots, show the ceiling of a room (which is the real American invention), usually given to John Ford), or high angle long shots Allow visualization of large ground areas, or front-end tracking shots. It is true that this is not the first film from the genre of genre films - still remains as Wang Yue's 'Chinese Boxer'; But at the commercial level, Shaw Brass has the right to choose 'Five Finger' as the first major release of the West, because someone would say it was 'least Chinese' of their action films, which is at least dependent pure Chinese theater tradition. It did not make any impression (which universally trashed the image) to American American critics, it was not lost among American Africans, especially African Americans, whose culture is always - as per the requirement - an eclectic patchwork and innovation of the material. The five fingers were given the opportunity to discover their stories, and the intimate young man was forced to make extra efforts to overcome the social merit and betrayal so that his eligibility was recognized. It seems to be universal in modernity, but each culture has its own way of expressing and solving; 'Five Fingers' have been presented as such that many Americans and China may be related. <br /> <br /> So what is the picture of the historical value now? Of course not. For one thing this problem has not gone. Secondly, some innovative movies look fresh like most new reserves. The action is also well-established, and the performances are shiny even if it is very cordial. The film is a long way, but the story falls on the ground. And amazing sets-out of the pieces, such as the Saloon Clash, the fight of the competition road, the strange dual end. <br /> <br /> Theater clearly shows on the screen, but still to visit the impressive home: Recommendation.
