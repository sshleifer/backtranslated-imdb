I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Ten years ago I could read the book well and it was curious about how to translate it into the film. <br /> <br /> Scrappall is very true for this book, which I liked - it's a rarity in itself these days. Characteristics were firm and trustworthy, and Striighting moved me into my idea, although I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> is an intelligent and well-favored film.
