This movie speaks of Ramon Samadoro's real life, who had lived for 27 years after breaking his throat and struggled in the fight to get legal permission for someone who could cooperate with his death. <br /> <br />> Javier Bardem is the best actor of his generation Consider this: He must carry this movie only with his face! Incredible that he did not even get an Oscar nomination. Now we all see the academy a joke! Supporter throwing was horrible! Aspirant Rosa, his lawyer Julia, everyone else in the family ... Everyone has his own opinion that Raman wants to die. <br /> <br /> Whether your opinion is against you or against suicide, because this movie is worth seeing by people all over the world! I started to cry half way through the film and did not stop until the credits rolled up. This movie is so impressive but wonderful to watch and I can not wait to see it again. I give it a 9/10, and in my opinion it's the best film of the year.
