I'm trying to find somewhere to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the movie "Is not it frustrating?" I watched this movie at the age of 7 and I used to stay in town where it was portrayed. A few items from my family were used as a proposition and some of my scenes were used in some friends' homes. Filming happened quite well in the city and surrounding communities. I only watched this movie once and I wanted to get a copy, so now I can show my family a movie. I did extensive search online without luck and I wonder if I had any idea about trying to get a copy of this movie?
