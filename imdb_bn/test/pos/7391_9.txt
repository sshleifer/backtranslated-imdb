For the first time I saw this picture, I wanted to like it for a lot of reasons, but I did not just do it. It just got a little dust. But there was a small question about what I saw at the beginning of the movie so I saw it again ?? And then finally click it for me. I first saw the movie to know the "wonderful ending", and when I definitely do not recommend maintaining the last flood for you, I still enjoyed most of the photos and discovered many unexpected incidents that could explain to everyone <br /> <br /> I do not think everyone will love this movie, even like it. If you like the actors, you will love this movie because acting is fairly strong and they get all the screen time. If you like the mystery (like Hitco), you would love this movie. If you like an independent or psychological movie then you would love this movie. It really works for me in those levels. If you do not like actors, mysterious plots or psychic elements, you can not like this movie. But that's your loss. Personally, the only one that was a little mad at me was signs. Alan Rickman tried well in American dialect, but it was not much improved from Die Hard's view. (Wonderful voices though made for strange pronunciation.) The film was a little weird in the middle of the pronunciation, but it was not so confusing that it became difficult or especially getting excited. Also, the scene from scene to scene camera was clear and could annoy some people, but I think it has been added to the scene (or scene? I can only remember a scene where the change was severely different, but it did work). <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, watch it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you understand how the plot is really complicated. Every time I see this movie (it's a year and a half down, so many views are not hard) I think about it another thing and wonders, "Why did it happen?" Or "who was deliberate?" I like that movie. This one. So just see it. Twice
