I saw this movie on TCM yesterday, all the excited hopes, until finally it (twice) was released in Toronto in 1957 with its memorable one. I told my wife, it was not seen before, to see the adventurous long trekking shot, there is no cut, where on Veronica bus to find her Boris. In the frame of the hand held by the modern stadicum, the shot traverses on the road and the dirt in the tank chases on the road and crosses the cranes (overwhelming) to cross the train. Then I think that, no cut, we follow the fence close to him as he escorted, anxiously looking for him, but did not find him. But we continue to follow Veronica because they look for the victims of the victims and their mentally scattered women, all the extra, and each one of the Stanislavsky behavior writing a jewel. How, a surprise, Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky have set up this remarkable sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the road on the road, the scene suddenly came to an end and went back to the scene in the apartment before going to the soldiers and their families. I think this image is not only restored, but it has been re-edited. What a downer!
