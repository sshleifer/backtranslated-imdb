I recently bought this movie for $ 5 a discount shop in DVD. Although it was a non-frill DVD of Ginon label (the only movie that started playing immediately - no menu, no special features) and the quality of sound was remarkable. This image is based on the real story of the biggest bank robbery in history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wanted to go straight but not allowed to do so! He illustrated an American in England. David Neven plays the lead bad guy, with great charm that he is famous. Bad, but when he refused to deny Pinki his "fold" for the job, he was disappointed. Like the American Gangster film, in England, suddenly this is the fair share of the leader and there is no bullet on the head! Cast all supporters do a great job by producing a very credible movie. <br /> <br /> What is probably the best for me, it is totally enjoyable and understandable (I have often lost myself in the confusion of the plot and without special characters) a special effect There is no blood. Do not oppress anybody. Do not even have a car chair! Just a well-written story, well played, well directed and well-photographed! If I have any complaint about the movie, then I will ask questions about music. What is the story of the Bluegrass Music Bank held in England?
