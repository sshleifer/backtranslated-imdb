Love Jones is one of the best movies I've experienced. <br /> <br /> The main element that I need to take is that it is very well managed. I've studied this movie completely - with more than once watching movies, some things are seen in your subconscious - along with the direction of this movie, the writing is chic, hip and artful! I love the direction Lorraine Tate and Nay Long are wonderful when driving motorcycles with North Chicago north of the night. The director of this movie delivered the prize for his great work. <br /> <br /> Love is a passionate and sexy movie about love jones. It is we can be a human being that we love, those who have errors, who love life, teach, and only we are through preaching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for lovers and friends and sit back and roam romantic (like yourself) and sit on Friday or Saturday Enjoy the night alone. At any day of the week where there is peace, academy, and a little entertainment, I recommend love jones.
