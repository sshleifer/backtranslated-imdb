eXistenZ is reality and virtual reality, which is trying to beat a game from the states to the regions, the landscape, the landscape, and it does not know where its leadership is right. Virtual Reality Games have more levels of virtual reality games, the reality that comes from comes from "real". <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that the twist that Kornberg will not be there, it's incredibly clear that it's a different separatism <br /> <br /> The problem of this film is its original nature but in a sense. Craneberg questions the reality and criticizes the game. Yet the same thing that he uses to criticize the game makes him revive: violence, isolation, lack of focus and in a sense, even if the pixelation does not have such pixelation in the film. I once heard that Craniberg's violence is actually criticizing the criticism of the hypopolis in the media, but it's incredible pleasure to spread new ornaments to the ornamental ribs of human, animal, and biological farming. /> <br /> This film is brilliantly written and used in the use of video game fantasies (You can not tell the cut scenes, the relative lack of surroundings or what you want to say in the neighborhood, where some people think there are many and still there are those things Should) including the intrusion motif. This certainly makes video games push the reality in such a way that it is annoying and irrational, but it makes video game electronics better by replacing it with the literal "roots" of organic matter that shrink and move and hate the maximum one. Awful degree For this price, this image creates a response in you. <br /> <br /> But for what? It criticizes the virtual reality, but it's a movie: it's its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the video game plot line and character design principles, but it maintains that policy. The role of video games is more than killing the real people, and it is definitely thought of how video games can be confused with reality and do not let people think about the consequences of their actions in real life. Again, they get complete satisfaction from overthrowing people, objects, animals, things and lethal people from the bloody discipline. <br /> <br /> So when it has a major focus on its harmful, it does not actually do anything with it, actually it does not. Only this is what it does, which can not deny itself with fingers in the original way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For glory and violence, because it does not have any good reason that I can see it for love and yet I Can not ignore as middle-class or bad. It will not be easy to accept, but since I can not really do anything with it. I believe it's a little too much, it does not have to go as far as possible, but Craneberg's motives were so mixed and confused that I do not know whether Cronburbers 'errors or Krebren's point is and I think' there is no way to find him directly. Without asking. <br /> <br /> - Polaris DiB
