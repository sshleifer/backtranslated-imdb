Last night, I saw a little bit (Kontele Muthmittal with English subtitles). Surprisingly, it was 137 minutes long - little more than the time listed in the IMDB. <br /> <br /> I lost interest in this movie at first because the confusing style of filming really made me lose. The context for what was happening was missing and I'm glad to stick with it. Initially, a young couple married and shortly after the marriage, the war broke out in their local Sri Lanka and the lovers separated. A few months later, the wife was very pregnant and came to India as a refugee ship. At a refugee center, you see the lady giving birth - after that the movie title is finally published. <br /> <br /> The entire focus of the film is completely changed - a young girl will run 9 in India in Madras. You see her in her house and she talks with her life and family on camera. None of these seem like interesting or important, and do you feel that - what woman was about to be born? My wife and I debated about this and finally we think that this little girl was actually the child's first child in the first part of the film. Somehow or another, he was accepted and talked about his life with his mother # 2 - Although he did not realize that this person was not his biological father. Parents should be fairly stupid to express themselves soon after (<br /> <br /> One of my complaints about this movie), they say this young girl in a way that tell her parents' honesty and empowers the girl to be emotionally drunk and confused Decided. Along with a stupid decision and saying to her the worst way, the father agreed to help her find her biological mother, made for this. Seeing all these influences of the girl and the parent (especially adoptive mother), I became aware of the flurry of my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka was involved in a long, long time and atrocities. For three decades, civil war has been closed with Tamils ​​militants. Family decision to return to mother to Sri Lanka was really nice, but sometimes it was a bit stupid - as they had taken so much risk and often jumped in the middle of the war! It was all breathtaking and drunk but I was surprised by the affection of receiving parents - first of all tell her that she is not your biological child and now you take her to the middle of the war zone !!! Sure, the child really wanted to meet his biological mother, but it was really stupid in the dark eyes. If it was, I could be tempted to play the part and give it to the unemployed actress to fool the child - thus avoid fighting through the war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaint, the film was beautiful and very fruitful to look at. Far from perfect, it sure hits a mental home run. Also, when I expect something like this, because I have seen a number of Indian films, many Western visitors will be surprised by the wonderful song that does not seem to come out of nowhere - it is the ideal of most films from India - including those made in Bollywood ( Bombay) and TamilWood / Kolivid (Madras).
