I can not cry easily on film, but I have to admit that it has brought me in tears. Although I'm not Mrs. Strip fan, her performance was excellent. The title defines a sentence that is a mother's love. I did not like any characters for the first hour, but it changed after the movie was started. The film explains why there are some marriages, though certain marriages are over. To see a film.
