This is a perfectly successful example of a 1950 biopic. It's a strong and handsome young hero - well, not on screen and young; Extraordinary, unlikely, direction by Billy Wilder; Freelj Wexmann's heavenly strings when a fully-guaranteed musical score of the upward scales is required; Strong supporter players; A gripping story; Stunning photography by Hitacho's favorite Robert Barks; And a description about a single historical event. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with hostage Stewart Charles Linberberg, trying to get some sleep in his sleeping solo flight from New York to Paris before his sleeping solo flight in the London Island Hotel. . And she can not sleep. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < St. Louis, Missouri, flight sponsors that share the house. (Even in 1927, money was spoken.) However, there were several Flashbacks and Stuart descriptions of the movie HAD. What is the alternative Observer of unity? Jimmy Stewart sitting quietly under the control of his thief, sitting within three hundred hours, when day and night came and goes? I found scripts and directions fascinating for their time. The unexpected subject has been dropped, so can not introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary audience. <br /> <br /> My bet is that the shaking crowd in Le Buberte near Linberburn broke into pieces for the memorials. . And of course nothing about the pilot's relief tube, though it will add more opportunities for humor. Some of the events of today's audience will happen if they think too much about them. Aloft, Stewart Chats, with a friendly hit-hiking flight, which makes her wake up by crying in her own way, in a critical moment, landing on her cheek. Later, Father Hussman, the Saint Christopher's medal, tried to sneak him in the role of Stewart, just as the machine slowly pressed against a glass crystal. Atheist Stewart doubled - once flying and once by God. <br /> <br /> But do not remember. This is an impressive film. Landing in Le Bourget, Joy sticks to the back of the sticks, confused by searchlight, frightened and tired fatigue, really believing. He said, "I'm going to tear this plane," she says herself, and we can trust her. <br /> <br /> Flying plane is not like driving. There is no smooth corking highway to tell you where to go, there is no way to provide guidance. You are busy every second. If you look at the devices, check each wingite so that they touch the horizon, touch the air nose and continue to rotate, down and on the coast for other traffic, though ultimately there is no problem with linnabar. She was alone on the sea. <br /> <br /> Why? At one point in the film, Stuart and Murray Hamilton, two Gypsy Bernerstrom of 1920, lounge around their airplane at the Middle East field. Hamilton asks, "What is it that we love to fly so much?" (No answer.) Later, his financial entrepreneurs tried to talk to him from the flight. The other five pilots have already died trying it out. "But do not you understand? It should be done." An incredible stewart <br /> <br /> It does not have any answer. Why would it be now, and why by Lindbergh? Why do not wait ten years, and in the meantime do not stop wasting life? Answer: Dear Socrates, our glands partly lie. Pilot is a placid and confident lot, sometimes given arousal jag. Their main problem may be an internal reception of Adrenaline. Just kidding. My best friend is some pilot. Still, Lindbergh has been quite a guy. He deserves to be regarded as a hero. Not only because of the flight, but because of his next emotion - calm, submissive, a family man. We can easily forget his gratitude to Hitler, because he examined the fighters of Corsica in the Pacific and wanted to make it with the help of navy to tie the airplanes and get the best performance from them. <br /> <br /> See if there is a chance. If there is nothing else, it's called a history lesson with a visual splendor.
