Isabella Huppert will be the greatest actress of his or any other generation. "La Pianiste" is really sure of it. That was not enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of the best actresses of her or any other generation. So, you can imagine that the casting pieces are scary we are valuable. We have never seen Isabell and Anne characters on the screen. A mother and a daughter were yes but so terrible deplore that sometimes I was even fuzzy or even unable to breathe. Personally, I do not believe in the director's intentions, I do not believe that they (the objectives) are going through this frustrating designation and the last shouted with disappointment, but with the stories in my mouth, I hurried up the excitement of the power of the strongest haupts and guidars. I recommend to cinema lovers anywhere and to great performance collectors like me, you can not miss "la pianeste".
