I saw this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. When I was watching the film I thought I saw a movie with the same story before ... a movie with a Ray Leitata but I can not remember it. Of course, this is a lot more dramatic, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This story is: Emilio's life has become so false that she can not survive. After 20 years of his life his wife, son and he knows that all people know that the truth has followed him and there is no way to go there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After a while you got tired of the same thing ... Relationships with a young girl were something to advertise but it does not. Despite the movie still funny, exiting and involved. That's what you want to help Emilio with your lies or help others catch him. I like analogy, photography and good performances. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 7.5.
