I won an Oscar for this picture that was very surprised to know the Goldie Haun. He was very lean and completely 54 (!) Year old Bergman as well as they were reading at school as well. If it was written today, I think Bergman and young Ivan got injured together (a lot more hot than the ingrid litter ...) and two self-absorbed letters run by Matthu and Haun will be omitted. Cold. But at the end of the 60's it was written and the park looks like a luxury suite or bayerfruit. However, Matthew's one-fishing boat, Hawon's innocence and Bergman's enthusiastic performance make it look pretty.
