Japanese animation director Hiuo Miyazaki and his studio Ghibli Productions Company's first exposure was released seven years ago when an English-dub version of Away was released. What a wonderful creative and unique film experience that was! So in that note, I found my movie theater-appointed friend, Mijaji's new movie with me, especially since she loves Disney (the American distributor of this movie). Again, I can say "wow!" What a wonderful visual about drawing water like a sea ... and how the transformation of the title character transforms from a goldenfish ... and how the deficiencies of some letters change ... and well, if you want this movie see what I'm talking about I know. Oh, and the voice for this American-Doubled version is being used: Tina Fay, Betty White, Liam Nisson, Claris Lichmann and Lily Tommylin All the best choices. What does everything understand? No, but part of that childlike charm across the whole. There are funny scenes about Ponyo and the boy and many other people they face. Oh, I think I wrote a lot more, so I highly recommend Hyo Miyazaki Ponyo.
