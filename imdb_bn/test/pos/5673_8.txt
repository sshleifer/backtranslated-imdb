The movie started in the ear with three people who decided to visit the first crocodile farm and then went on a little lighter activity, a "fishing" tour. <br /> <br /> If you like something, during the tour, interesting information and information about crocodile added later enough to increase the sensation after movie time. To remind you of what you said earlier <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is not completed. Suspense "what ifs", "unknown", and sometimes made by decision to make mobile decision decisions. <br /> <br /> I saw myself as if I was the same, what should I do? Boat, intended for any intelligence. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> As a buzz for a horror film, I only see almost every horror film in my image, in almost every series of films, and it is one of my best "crocodile" horror movies. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not be disappointed.
