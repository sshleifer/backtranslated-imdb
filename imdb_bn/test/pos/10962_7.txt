What can be said about an anti-film film produced at such a colorless void, social apathy, and authoritarian satisfaction. Cassevettes was the first major independent film success in an instant box office and still did not receive serious attention to its demand. I compare this wave of American independent projects, including Robert Frank and Harry Smith of 'Bit' filmmakers, with a growing view of Paris known as the new wave of France in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> In addition to reviewing American cultural heritage, while the rest of the culture discussed poetry and philosophy and weaknesses; Even at this stage, even this fabulous, highly spontaneous brand of filmmakers fought against the establishment of political development and education in the mid-twentieth century. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In most cases of casket work, its components often have a reversible impact effect; A psychological response is evoked through the relationship between subtle character, not many imagery. For this reason, his work seems prolonged because he took a more intimate view to define the chargers, which are very dependent on clear action and tell more about the explanation. <br /> <br /> Although my favorite cassette film is 'husband', this is his most important.
