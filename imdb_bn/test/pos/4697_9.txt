Fantastic series, one of my favorites (Miami Vice and Tourism of Two other, and this series is OK with them). <br /> <br /> These guys do not even after the Frilly Ticks - they dress more like Woodsmen. Everything in this series is realistic, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The devil is worshiping nuns, and mugs, wit and magicians are cutting belts. <br /> <br /> Whatever comes most, it is a series of its time. Instead of the centennial edition of the Central Government and the Mockish-era's torture, this series was firmly established in Theichrist Blissation in the 1980's, and it was a strong environmental risk. Robin's guardian Harn Hunter is a worshiper of nature, who often worsens on deer's head and is a composer of the alternate edition of The Green Man (such as Robin) - the Egyptian god of the plant and the resurrection - in this series Robin in the Hood is not a person but a concept; When the old man is killed, Harne is called on the new telephone - the person dies, but Robin in the Hood will live forever, so the idea of ​​the resurrection). <br /> <br /> Music and scores are really outstanding, and performed by Irish formation, Clanad. While watching it, I did not think, but _boring_ true medieval Angolaxan people think of how the music was. :-) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> series, the actors will have to overcome their own skepisis, and satisfy themselves that this is really a Serious work After that, they entered and acted great! Like the first Robin Michael Prade (the second is played by Jason of Shan Connery), Judy Trott is a beautiful and fragile redhead Mérion, Phil Rose is portly and really kind of frondy bald, volatile as Ray Winston, and boyfriend red color, Clive Montley Giant Shepherd Little John, Peter Llewelyn Williams Little Bumper's friend and colleague Shepherd and Mark Ltd former hyasasina / Assassin Nazi - all of them played great. Also a great bad guy, Nicholas Grace bug-eyed, designing Sheriff of Nottingham, and his elite, Left Sidekick (and Robin's half brother, turns it on) Robert Eddy as Gisborne's Sir Gaya. Really clean fashion designer Richard O'Brien, Clowns (Oliver Cotton) wizard's lord Lord Owen (he's at the end of the first series and later on the second end). <br /> <br /> The tether of Bradford stands in Avon for the Barn Sheriff's fortress. (See it under "Places of Interest" at Bradfordon.co.uk.) <br /> <br /> If you are a myth, then medieval, romanticism, do not waste your time. Jassa or Hercules - this is the real thing, so Get out! <br /> <br /> <br /> Alex
