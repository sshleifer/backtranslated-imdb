This is the only great thing to come out of the US from Simpsons. There are not just thousands of new ideas, but it's really controversial (see Jewish rage, season 1, episode 1) and people are not afraid to "tick". However, with Fox's wonderful minds, Greg Bonny and Futurama canceled, so make sure you can still buy Season 1 box set. It will be the best money you ever spend on. It is definitely a show that is better than the one you see, like the first> constant flashbacks can become a bit annoying and the story seems to not fit properly. But after a few episodes you understand how it is brighter, and at the moment it can be compared to any other show> in the moment.
