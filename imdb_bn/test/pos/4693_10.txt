This HTV series is beautiful. I firmly recommend watching movies It has got what it should be: fantastic scripts, strong characters, beautiful scenes and exceptional environment. Add some ambient scores to Clannad and you'll get unforgettable pictures. I love every adventure movie on HTC: Tracer Island, Smuggler, Adventure Adventures, but Sherwood Robin strikes them all. I would like to thank the special HTV production team and Richard Carpenter for giving me lots of special attractions and excitement. I got DVD releases in my small movie collection. I'm not prepared to regret such a lot of movies.
