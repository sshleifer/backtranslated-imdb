I just saw "check out" at Philadelphia Film Festival An impressive combination of what is an impressive story and a great shield. Director Jeff Hare Morris Appleboum and the family are wicked, but have done outstanding work to invite visitors to the delightful world. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy crazy antics but they feel real pain and anxiety for each other. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Peter Fawn fan, but he plays Morris Applebum and plays a role in great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone will see this wonderful movie and enjoy what I have enjoyed. <br /> <br /> <br />, and crew for a job well!
