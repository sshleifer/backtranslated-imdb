In the previous films of Fasibinder, his ideas sometimes exceed their ability to execute. He was always a great writer, but he took some time to tell the style of the camera and Pat's story. <br /> <br /> Great use of color in the first movie of the Fasibindera in the four season. From the bright green creature of the trader's cart, from the funeral to the bright red rose (who thought of a funeral in a fossil film?) <br /> <br /> His camera work was also there, but it was still fairly minimalist. Occasionally the zooms seem to be somewhat uncomfortable occasionally and abnormally, but again, the fasciinders are still out of its purest guard guard stage. This may be the reason because Michael Belhawes is not behind the camera, but rather a slightly inferior diuretic lohman. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a fasciinder, and you've got your fix here. The broken dreams are so clearly and shamelessly disguised as to distract the viewers and drive them to the depressed pillars. Just do what the doctor ordered. A primary style that shows significant progress compared to its first films was released only 2 years ago.
