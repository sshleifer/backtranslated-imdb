As well as the screenplay of lesbian love stories, FIRE is also a ridiculous mockery of the middle class (?) Indian culture. I appreciate it a quality which is a little appreciated about the movie. These two styles (i.e. deep meaningful alternatives-love stories and joke mockery) are usually combined with oil and water, but Mehta (some) is managed to achieve near-balance of balance. Servant's behavior of the family, the family's treatment, the constant existence of the painful grandmother, the obsession with the education of Ashok's husbands: Coming from a culture like India's culture, I can immediately identify it as normal. They have been crying out and screaming out loud. During the development of her primary content, Mehta managed to achieve this secondary theme efficiently. Indeed, most of the comics in the film provide the necessary relief from the huge issues of banned homosexual love and gender related issues, usually derived from this mockery. This image flows heavily from comic to severe sub-continent. <br /> <br /> All of them, bright use of symbolic instruments (Radha is coming out of the legendary Sita and coming out of the fire, and so pure, lifelong desire for young Radha to finally see the sea at the time of independence). Shabana Ajmi (Radha), the crew of discussion and Deepa Mehta; Their very non-Hollywood-like (and non-Bollywood-like) talent makes this movie specially. One criticism: In the first scene, I looked helpless so that they did not flow very well between each other. Ray: 9am. .
