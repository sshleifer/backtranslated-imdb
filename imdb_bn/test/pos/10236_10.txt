Why do not I love this movie so much ... maybe it came once in my life that I wanted to fit intensely, perhaps it is a wonderful giant effect, maybe I enjoyed the novel "Kabad", but it's probably because I love Clive Barker. I think it is appropriate for the film to be cautious and the novel has no true solution and like me you probably have a WTF moment. At least two signals were planned, but the film did not come due to flopped for some reasons. In the studio, the film worked hard to spend 30 minutes or more minutes and they did a great job of promoting it. Advertisements It looks like another cheap slash, which mainly shows the character of the "button face / mask" decker. A movie about this monster! About the imagination! About a place called the Midian! This is a story where the monster good boys. There is nothing like this! I think it's not a movie for everyone, but it's been a great job for Clive. Sit back and be ready to go to Midian - where are the monsters.
