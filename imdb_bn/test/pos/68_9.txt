Julie Andrew and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / music. Mrs. Andrews's first song, "The Dark With the Dark," will always be on the road behind my mind. Plot line is great and suspicious during World War I. If you are a romantic, you will love this movie. This is a movie that I always enjoy watching again and again.
