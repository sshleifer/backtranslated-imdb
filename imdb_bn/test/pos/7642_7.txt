Like a twisty country road, "ride of solid fortune" shows visitors a ride. As long as the credibility window does not fly, there is no mistake with the plot curve. Unfortunately, the film challenges the tolerance of the audience. However, it is easy to forgive this error due to superior acting, character development and wonderful carnival environment. Do not expect any type of character. Armen Assange, Norman Raidas, and Dogma Domingik, Shadow con artist play, not just the kind of person is easily admired. The double cross comes fast and furious, and the final cross is a bit of a stretch. Recommended. - Mr.
