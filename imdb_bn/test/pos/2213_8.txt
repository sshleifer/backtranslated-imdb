I enjoyed this movie and I think most of Lauren Ambrose fans are also very much. Its character is much soft and all performance stronger than its role under six feet. I enjoyed Emily's role, a mentally challenged intelligence was conducted. Despite the user's review of some other wrong information, the performance of actor Tailor Roberts was performed accurately and without a cliche. There was also a standout fran crossover, which complemented the natural serenity of veteran actors in natural comfort. Although the tip hit a snap here or there, it was only a problem with an unrealistic script. Do not hold well on screen as well as what a stage-game does as well work. However, Paul Ryan's lovely cinematography clearly points to the motion of the film as well as the motion of the film, which is not surprising. I recommend this movie to six feet of fans, and also recommend plain good acting and movie fans.
