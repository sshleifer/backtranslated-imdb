Talk Radio is probably probably not most familiar with the movies of Stone, but it does not allow you to leave, this film is ripe for the discovery, I do not deny anyone entering it. Eric Bogosian's 80's Best Picture, alongside me (along with JFK), is one of Stone's finest moments. Stone does not seem to comment on this day, and like all his other movies, there is no director's comment in the DVD. There is nothing to be ashamed of Stone, most of the directors will kill a shot @ shot in such a film. <br /> <br /> The studio's clustrophobia is intense and champagne comments are very important for today. The "All Drug Validation" speech is strong and you can agree with it yourself. In my opinion, this film is about freedom of speech and how ever people like to hear something that they do not agree. With lectures and conversation listeners are very appealing, even annoying, running a chill under my lip while a madman tells Champlin that he is going to be raped again because the city makes him crazy. It suddenly got frustrated. Unhappy, of course, champagne does not discriminate on its own. There was a villain of Under Season 2 (Dear God !!) in the film Champlines (or I called Bogosier), fearless, completely shocked, shameful and bogosian another big role in the film and performance. One scene was not true. Barry's boss Dan (Alec Beldwin) let him calm down, Barry thinks he will stop and think as he says, it seems a little narrow and clutched. Critics are criticized for criticizing scenes outside the studio, because it is true because the Stone film is trying to do more cinematic and lets the viewer see the launch of champagne but it does not work completely. It's impressive close-ups, a brilliantly cinematic movie with deep focus, an impressive 360 ​​set which is extremely impressive together, which is extremely fast spent. The movie has to be seen, it makes it rare because the time has been ignored, but now it draws attention which it is so deserving. A classic th @ film should be studied by the generation of students. <br /> <br /> 10 of the 10 "Bad To The Bones" are 10 for the innovative use, the Splendid Stu, Leslie Hope (24), John C. McGinley as champagnes (from Scroobs to Dr. Gaydhie, John Panko and Alec Beldwin, Suet and Michael Vinak, who played three roles (very underground actor), tensions between the audience and the champagne, which are repeatedly between heart racing and of course Bogosian and Tonagulira kudo for such a fantastic piece of cinema. Enjoy!
