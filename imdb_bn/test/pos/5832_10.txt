Oz, was the first original television show that HBO entered its channel (1 hour format) and it is very good to date ... The story is simple ... Oz is a superior life focusing on the most security prisoners in Oswald, primarily "MCT". Now there is a lot of praise for this show (in my opinion when my opinion was the best of television), the direction (the top note), the acting (the best of the best), and the characters ... it just closed my socks in the show ... this show Until the critique, there was a critically acclaimed gem, the critics were indifferent to the story of that epic of faith and family to look at this wonderful drama ... one of the ozes to me It's a shame that I did not win any major Emmy ... = <br /> <br /> <br /> This great, comedian for everyone involved in heart ... <br /> < br> KUDOS
