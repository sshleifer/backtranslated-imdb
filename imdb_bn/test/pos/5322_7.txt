Albert T. Like Fitzgerald, a surprise about the condition of the generation of a father, who is in the air for the first time, because he is leaving the place long ago and where he kept a wife and a child. Now accused of murdering a mentally disabled boy! When we first saw him, he caught a title in the paper, reading the woman in front of him. Rather, he asked him if he could get the magazine, and the woman provided other departments. Well, he does not want what he wants, whatever he wants, he has to give the portion he is reading in front of him. <br /> <br /> Matthew Ryan Hog ​​wrote and operated this annoying movie which is reflected in many ways. Our society like today! Indeed, Mr. Hoge indicates what went wrong with him. <br /> <br /> This picture represents Leland, a young man who can not distinguish between fantasy and reality. It is clear that killing a man, even the sweet and innocent son who did not do anything to deserve it, would be a fateful consequence for his own family and for the family of the deceased boy. Actually there seems to be no idea about Liland's crime, because he does not show any remorse about him. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Lavland was attacked by her parents' divorce. His own father was a different man who could not care less about him. This is Pearl, the young man sees turmoil and wants to help him, but he has no chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the photo is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. The great throw under the direction of music hag works well. Kevin Spassy is a good opportunity to play an abusive father of the accused murderer and hates him for being a foul idiot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
