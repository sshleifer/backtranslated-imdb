Robert Deanaro and Eddie Murphy, what a team. Ren Rousseau, William Shander, and the person on daily videos are accompanying this trip. This is a fun and a great movie. Not only this, but it's a good friend, Flick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The name of Tom De (Shanghai Noon) refers to this hell. From the beginning to the end it was a wonderful composition. Here's no slapstick humor. But good old time laughs. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> You like it It has a wonderful cast and crew. So, look for "COPS" for a ** coupe movie and close one by watching "Showtime". And remember, they will send your neighbor to the Umm ... Um ... Oh! Friday night at 8 o'clock (people, everyone says I'm a bad writer).
