A few years ago I saw this movie. But I like it a lot. <br /> <br /> ** Going forward, Spoiler ** is an old famous open singer retired and he decides the money he has given to his cat. To get rid of his Butter cats, listen to these plots and plots so that he can get luck. He keeps a knockout drop in their milk. When they wake up, they find themselves miles away. They have to go back home before it's too late. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10.
