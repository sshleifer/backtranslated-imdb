Danny Briseman is one of the best films of all time and it is a world of people with no sense, feelings, no love, truth and no freedom. A world where people are afraid, express themselves or show affection, in a world where no one is free and there is no one to understand what it means. Like the world we live in, Bensome's world is a world of lost spirits that are trying to fulfill, but focuses solely on their fullness, materialism, social acceptance and mediatory satisfaction. <br /> <br />> Den Brysomme Mannen is deserving of full attention by every human soul, because we can all use a new wake-up call.
