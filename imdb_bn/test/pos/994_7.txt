This picture blossomed unnecessarily in the UK, and it was not worth it. The trailer of this movie is a bit confusing, and I think it confused critics and the audience that it was "temptation: part 2". The movie was sold in the market to earn profits at Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning success at the cost of the film, but it is a different one. It was during the Second World War that Welsh poet Dylan was the author of campaigning for war effort focusing on Thomas's life's imagination and later he returned to Wales. Director John Meyeri Dylan Rapid Dylan (Matthew Rihas) played Kaiyara Nightly in her early childhood, Bhara Phillips. He was the first child of Dylan in his hometown, but the moment has passed, and the singer only wants it as a nice memory. Or he? The dread has created an unbreakable close relationship with another woman in Dillon's life, "Queen of Ireland, the love of my life, my child's mother" Catalin Thomas (Sienna Miller). Three wars constitute an army in the war in London, but the recruit then falls for the violent soldier, William Kilik (Silian Murphy). They fight fast, with Killick going for battle. Dreadful of fear, Thomas feels convinced to make Wales his fool, but the trials of three face the reality of his child's birth, William's jealousy and shell-shock after returning home, and Catalin realized that he could not share Dylan with his best friend. /> <br /> Illustrating in a low budget, it is a piece of mood than any other. It needs to be treasured but some memories and feelings that work well as a perception but renewal. Siena Miller's performance is particularly vague (unfortunately, the Pappacy Nonsense actually feels her talent), and Nightwie and Murphy are very good again. Lyle is down as Dillan, who, the Welsh poet himself was not a rose bed, lacks of charisma and makes us wonder what this woman Dylan does. Writing is very sticky, some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness. It's certainly worth looking for, however.
