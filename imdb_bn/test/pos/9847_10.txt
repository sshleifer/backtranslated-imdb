It's the best movie I've ever seen acting on. All artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are superb in this movie. Sometimes it is said that "they do not work, they live in it", you can really see it in this movie. The director is also able, you can not see much of the camera running around but camera position is good. But after acting, the most outstanding part is the movie content. It gives happiness, encouragement, the desire to live, the importance of real friends to humans. We all started nowadays to start living separately, in this movie you are someone else. And most importantly, you see that the most respected feeling in the world is love, loving your friends, loving your darling All people will see this movie ...
