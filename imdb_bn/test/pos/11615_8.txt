I'm going to this movie, I knew two things about it. I knew it was a real extreme, and I knew that it was somewhat modern. Both appeal to my own rights, but when combined, it can be really unique. And this was unique, unique, without a doubt. As I said above, it is an arts film. They use some intense sounds, it reminds me a lot Aronofsky film. Apparently I did not see anything like it. Cinematography and lighting are very well done. The movie is visually visible and in a little bit better than what I saw. Especially when you consider the experience of these young filmmakers (couple 20 years old), then you have to take a hat on them. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to describe or even discuss the film. Is not a real story ?? You can say it's rotating the right and left side of the brain and how do they control your life? I think. It's four parts, or four ideas brought alive through visual and extreme hearing. There are some things to hear and there, but this is mostly a non-commentary film. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the minimum and it is a naked body and an eye-rolling rolling. Try and guess what ?? Wrong The second segment is my favorite. It is a brother and a sister (who looks a little like Sarah Silverman, but with big boobs). Brother rude and sister a little whore. I will create the most extreme, and best of all of these sections. This huge effect was great. The third part is surrounded by a group of nude people related to the motherland. This is probably considered to be the weakest of clusters, but is still smart and well made. The fourth segment is probably the most powerful of the photo and I want to say the deepest. To understand what is really being said, I will have to look at this several times for myself. I know that it deals with Christianity in such a way that it can mock or throw your soil? It is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have suggested unconditional cruelty to me and I'm proud to say that my movie collection is now It's extreme, violent, poor, very sexually stimulating and amazingly awesome awesome thoughts. The next line is used in almost all the reviews I've read for this movie. "This movie is not for everyone." Not true now. If you live in extreme movies and / or are you just a lover who wants to see something different? Check it out. 8 1/2 out of 10
