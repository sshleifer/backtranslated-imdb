To return to me a movie is a charming jewel. With the star staided cast, what could be wrong with this modern fairy tale? Written and directed the funny story written by Bonni Hunt has many jokes. David Duchovny is very good, showing a different approach than his ever-changing change-ego mulder on his favorite show X-Files. A great date movie!
