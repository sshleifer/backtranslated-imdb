Living in Romania, I was amazed by the very realistic setting for the scenery and the great caring of the local details by the director. Anthony Queen's performance is absolutely great, and the rest of the cast has a great job of supporting him. To enjoy this film, it has gained some knowledge in the Eastern European context, but it is one of the great performances with other memorable lines. The ending may be very milderometric, but the way the world's people are in this way, I believe that the screenplay is great, because it has no bloodshed, no battlefield in the horrific mainstream of the second WW. Yet, life has been lost, and you have got laugh now, and then by touching the characters across the film, they die quickly by the reality of the war.
