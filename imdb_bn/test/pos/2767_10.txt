When I was young, this movie was played continuously in the Disney Channel and I really liked it. However, I did not taste very well (I do not say now) so I can not wait very well for my nine-year-old self-family. The movie was probably 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yes, observer value. I know that some fans of this movie have made a specific song a surprise - when it appears in a car accident. This song is Jaguars's "Play at love song" and it is very hard to find and obtain. Actually, this movie, too much. I can not find it online or anywhere in DVD or VHS. So I want to see it again so it's actually a good movie if i can gauge. Well good
