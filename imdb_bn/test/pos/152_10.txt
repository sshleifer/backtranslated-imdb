After watching Old Bowl, I was a little disappointed with the rest of the park, it was a bit good, but the sunny and originality of the Old Billy has never come to him. This one, it's nothing like Plot or Style in Oldboy, but has the same level of quality. <br /> <br /> There is nothing better with acting Kang-hong songs, Ok-bin Kim and Ha-Kueen Shin. Excellent performance. Kim is able to manage soup from volunteer comedy, especially from awesome horror scenes to simple comedy. <br /> <br /> Quickly weird about many cats and turns and a big swipe in vampire reviews. <Br <br /> <br /> I am spot with speeds and sunny tones and spots across the most memorable scenes I have ever seen. It is proud of what you would ever see the strange love scene you would ever see. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie.
