Although it is difficult and sad to have a child's intimate illness, 'treatment' successfully represents the notion that it does not have to be complete destruction and sadness, and if anything, if the children want to get hope and joy in their life, It is a great friendship of friendship and a movie about childhood innocence. <br /> <br /> This image is seeing a defective young man with a remote soil, moving to a new area where his next neighbor, 11 year old, was infected with AIDS through blood synthesis. After her initial fear and strengthening the ignorance of AIDS, Eric Dixter's friends and their fraternal friendship seem to have started traveling down Mississippi where they heard about New Orleans doctor who claimed the remedy for this disease. <br /> <br /> Two of the young Lead talents of Brad Renfro and Joseph Magelloro, who respectively play Eric and Dexter, are exceptional. Brad was able to portray Eric's tough edge without the innocence of the underlying child, when Joseph expressed the feelings of the character of Dexter's character but correctly pointed out the encouragement of the illness and the initiative that his illness does not mean that he still wants to play like a child with a baby boy. The pair's interaction creates a feeling among the viewers that these two boys who are actually close and they carry the film well. Anabela Cyroyo also provided a touchy performance as Dexter's mother Linda, who enjoys her son and she is happy to see her get excited with this new friendship and eventually she gets married to another son. <br /> <br /> Against an awesome soundtrack, 'The Chuur' is a very intelligent film that unravels the story of boyhood friendshiplessly, which lives immediately between pregoodis and terminal illness without enjoying happy or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that adults who have problems with Dixter's AIDS status, children even 'bullies' come to accept him as another. Despite the nature of Eric's nature, he is much more similar to his determination to heed Dexter, even though the little boy's scary idea that he knows his fate but moves away from his best friend's enthusiasm for healing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 'The Curie', it is rare to find a movie which is sad and raised at once.
