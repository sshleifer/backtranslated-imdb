Schooly and Mulluder, the other two scientist, a pilot and a man in Seinefeld, went to an Arctic research post, where everyone was killed or killed by killing each other. They discover that there is a worm - a virus - it is crazy and parasite at the point of death. The problem is, after a certain dog is flashing, someone can be infected, but who? This is not just my favorite episode of Season 1, but one of my favorites from the show. The Arctic atmosphere surrounds the characters and, of course, like Carpenter Thing, it is very fun to see that even these unusual characters suddenly start to escape in the dramatic scene. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are sugar, I did not think of them all. The drama in the characters generally works more due to tension and because all actors (including Bana Lok) understand what is happening in the story. And, naturally, I like the last ambiguity. Highly recommended.
