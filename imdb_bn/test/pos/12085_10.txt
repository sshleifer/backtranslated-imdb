I have seen this movie a long time ago, but it remains in my memory as the most memorable movie. I cried non-stop My mother will never see this movie again because it is painful to watch. However, the story is not quite complicated except ... Anne Margaret is going to die and give away 10 (?) Children. If that's not bad enough, it's time to stop depression and break one off one's siblings. I think it was very sad for me because I was from a very close family and could detect the pain of every child leaving their mother and siblings. Maybe I'm a Mokokist but I want to see this movie again because it was done well and the last, surprisingly, was a little happy (so at least we could laugh and smile together together). It should come on TV a while later I can see again.
