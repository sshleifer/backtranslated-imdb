I recently stumbled upon this show when ABC Family was an entire day marathon before season 2 premiere. It seemed to me to look at the preview for the show in 2007, and it seemed to be very small, it would not be very good, because it was in the ABC family. <br /> <br /> Do not be suspicious of any ABC family show! The best way to show this is to surprise me. Not only good writing shows, story lines are realistic, fun, and enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of conversations about the relationship, "This guy gave birth to the girl who dumped me for that child ...." But some of these shows but! Characters are interesting and you really feel a connection between them. There are many chemistry among the actors and they seem to be doing the right thing in front of your eyes. <br /> <br /> Do not doubt this show, it's really enjoyable to watch .. and get hooked on;)
