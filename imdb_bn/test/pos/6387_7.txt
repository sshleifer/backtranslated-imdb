Most people are tired of the number of clay movies that make up the Hollywood. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Companies want to spend money only on remakes are those viewers who make ready viewers <br /> <br /> This movie is a welcome change. It can be classified as a romantic comedy for its genre, but it does not let you turn off this movie. This is a very original movie which is not like most of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you already know the primary plot, so I will not be disturbed by it. The only film to compare it with, known as "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel", is a small gem that takes a different route than most of Hollywood's garbage. <br /> <br /> It's good to see if you're tired of the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
