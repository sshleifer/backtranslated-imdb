This movie has everything! It has a good story, well played, great scenery, adventure and some gorgeous gags! Order Farley Tommy Kallangon will have to go to the street to close the company after the big tom died. The problem is that Tommy does not know about the break point, and Kalhan Auto Parts staff needs Richard's help (David Spade). Two dorks hit the road from the moment, the movie is just so fun. If you love slopstick with a great story, you will love it because gags are thick and fast and the movie will laugh at you! It was very tragic about the terrible death of Fareli in 1997, but its talent is an achievement 'Tommy Boy'. Get it cold, and enjoy this brilliant slapstick!
