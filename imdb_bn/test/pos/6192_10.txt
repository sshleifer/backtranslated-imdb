The problem of this series is very real. I see it in Amazon "Unbox" and only finished episode 2, I hate, I hate Fark, the leader of the cell. I can never recall any television series having this emotional effect. Remember the old tag line for horror movies "Just tell your own movie"? Well I myself reminded myself repeatedly that its "only TV". But of course it's not just the TV? In reality, the probability of a cell like a moving image in the United States must be in the amplitude limits. That this program gives its rogue authority. And so I hate it a lot.
