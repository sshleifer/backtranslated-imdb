Of course, it is not a film to introduce the art of revolution or film making new strategies, it is a very nice and difficult production. It's a miracle that we can enjoy it at DVD quality today - perhaps almost 100 years ago most of the viewers saw black and white copies, because the Stencil-tinted de Llis version was found in a very good theater. If you are not fascinated by this movie or subject, you will not be surprised at the copy published by Image Entertainment (together with another gem, Manger to the Cross, 1912). It is impossible to see an old movie throughout a century but it is so small. The stencil-color process is very effective, and compared to occasionally hug and cheerful images of hand-colored films, the colors are crisp and specifically defined. Illustrating the limitations of filmmaking, when the filming began in 1902, the static nature of the scenes can be considered as deliberate, thoughtful, and serious today. The tableaux keep moving at a permanent paste, so the film does not get tiring. You will not be fascinated by this movie as an act of cinematography, but it is as beautiful as the academic, painting industry. If you are a religious person, the Anonymous you are seeing is that people who went far apart from the isolated letters have long been associated with the mystery. A perfect look for Christmas or Lent. <br /> <br /> PS I just tuned "Boxes" box for fun. As you can see, I did not reveal the end.
