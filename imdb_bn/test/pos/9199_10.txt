This show does not merely entertain and tries to be a Greek drama. It certainly has one element material with all plot twists, but it is extremely compelling and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they certainly will not lack the material to work with! Something else will happen there! These show actors are extremely personalized and you really want to see what they see and do every week. The show is very funny. Humor originated from letters and situations. Not just thrown into gratuitously. It's a well-planned show that matters. It certainly lets me look at Friday night and I'm happy that now the owner of the first two seasons of the DVD!
