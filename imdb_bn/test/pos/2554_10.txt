Chop Shop Theater A Hidden Treasures! I can not start wondering how much I can play in this movie. This movie is intended for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and look at the look and feel of contemporary movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is a small boy, Alangundro "Aale", who works and lives with his younger sister, Ishar's "EGG" with a little room in a room in an auto store. The story has happened in a section of New York City (which I do not even know - Wilts Points) where there is an endless junkyard and body shop. Here, Bahraini tells the story of two forgotten children that they want to support themselves by supporting themselves by buying a food van. <br /> <br /> Aale Auto Show helps in this, and helps with Easy Food Van; Both, as well as earning extra money. Alele bootleg sells movies and parts of theft cars; The result of selling Aji himself. Their lives are surrounded by miserable and poor, but both witnesses, although living in their harsh world and rarely living, their love never gets annoyed by the smell surrounding them. And sometimes they were able to enjoy and enjoy the moments of their childhood which are stolen by the reality of the struggle to survive and stay together. My best comparison for the chop shop is that a mixture of Bahrani is as strong as the innocent love of family members against an awkward atmosphere, Pasolini's Mama Roma is coupled with a very rapidly growing struggle in an unfavorable environment such as Brasson Mouchette As <br /> <br /> Both co-written, directed and both of these films and their first Man Man Push Cart (which has won wins around the world) have been edited, Bahraini total package filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I hope his films will not be hidden treasures long!
