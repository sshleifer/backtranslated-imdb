In 1968, "CMBIPPSCXXLSMA: Tech One" was released, it did not come out of nowhere, and a psychedelic thunder struck like a bolt. Afro-American actor and filmmaker William Greaves, aiming to change the 'news-real' style of making documentary film forever, and there was nothing like it to this day. The film is a film-making film and deliberately written and directed, so much controversy and conflicts that arise. Set in the Central Park of New York, the action and tiny dialogue concerns a couple who fight and bicker about homosexuality and abortion. Women want out of relationships, and people want an explanation. At the end of this interaction, a drunken homeless man interferes in proceedings and offers his commentary and personal back-story. Then, after shooting the original footage, the film crew adds their own opinion of the filmmaker and they think that the film handling it. And for the whole movie time, recording the action in the scene, and for the external comments by cast, crew and viewers, many cameras are employed. I would definitely recommend this movie for the intentions of intelligent guards like Andy Warhol, John Cassettes, or Jim Jarmas. William Greaves tried to show that the real perspective is not actually seen and can not be understood because the reality of seeing it will change. "SYMBBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be seen as an application for the production of cinematic presentation or uncertainty. This is only a possible explanation, and the real purpose of the greedy is obviously open for speculation. Above all else, this film wants to confound, confound. And stimulate, and without a doubt, pretty successful.
