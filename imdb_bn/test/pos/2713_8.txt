The melody is the best aspect of this television movie, which is better than the average production cost of self-motivated, but very surface and slightly changed biography. Richard's discovery "We've only begun" and Karen's marriage problems are commendable ("superstar" was a nice touch), but Neil Sedka, Tony Peluso's guitarist, contributed a lot. Her Karen is sweet in personality, but it does not include the dome of the original carpenter's personality and the spacious aspects. Anderson is creative and responsible for loving as well as love for Richard and Fletcher in love but as Hughes makes his mark as Agnes. The most horrific moment in the original broadcast is the "love for love" use in a commercial background showing the Adoreccia hotline.
