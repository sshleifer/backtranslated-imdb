So work well. Photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's a funny storyline that brings smiles to your face with every scene - I like it and I'm 60 year old heterosexual guy. Each character seemed to fit their part in a tee. The best performance I've seen from Mrs. Capshaw was that she was in more movies than me, but it was a great achievement. I think it's a plus budget for Spielberg and a plus for the best that could buy the plan technically. The two Castes have now shown their successful TV - why is it easy to see? Tom Selleck does his usual good job.
