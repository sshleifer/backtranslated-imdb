This is the perfect example of a classic flower moon photo movie. No fan of horror / vampire flicks should definitely be checking out this one. The main plot and the good, the story is easy to follow. Also, this film has some heartbeat scenes that combine Horror with action. So far, the only one that I saw in this movie is the fourth part, which I would like to say is that it is almost better than the original. <br /> <br /> I think it's a 10/10. <br /> <br /> Fans of such horror movies have to find puppet master, slum party party genocide, skinned alive, camp and slip and flu moon photo flick.
