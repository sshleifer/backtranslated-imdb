Mothers should be given separate titles from one movie to mother or one of the leading movies. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary zombie movie that gets slow after that time and eventually ends up in the same as every other junk movie. <br /> <br /> It's a very different and fresh range, almost classrooms in classrooms. <br /> <br /> An elderly woman who takes a toxic loser, who is only eating a meat, who infects the elderly lady who has to eat jumbo or wheeat in the meat, which is mostly not defined. <br /> <br /> There are stones in the story because its boy has realized what has happened and first tried to help him by providing 'food' in the fearful situation. (I can not say anything more about this, fear of inserting an explosive!) It is one of the cool films, which opposes guns, explosions, cars, etc, etc., which gives the same garbage to many movies. , But with enough significant moments to satisfy still awful fans, along with the sadness in the story, along with the wonderful touch of humor against the uninterrupted fascination of some so-called 'horror' films. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, especially beautiful atmospheric shots, where the old lady is only sitting with her Christmas tree for her company and feels so innocent, but what happens to her !! Eating! <br /> <br /> A gem of the movie and you should see at least once a true horror fan without having to do your thing.
