I read books in a summer book club, and all of us like it. My friends from that club did not agree to watch the movie, so that the book was destroyed. I do not agree, recently seen with my younger brother and my parents. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised. The book was truly true without losing its own soul. The 'new kid' theme has been shown in a fair amount so that we get the feeling of it, but this is not the story. <br /> <br /> I never saw the act, but it was still good, and especially the kids There was a lot of energy. The letters were interesting, and the plot was not tricky and overstated too much. This is a children's film that works fine for adults or teenagers. <br /> <br /> I see a little hard-girl attitude from Beatrice, but she was still a great character. His hair was not clearly colored with an old stove and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well as a small boy and new baby, especially interacting with her parents and friends. <br /> <br /> Make a great cheer-up movie for a rainy day and do not talk about the end (which I do not like it). After all, it was such a great movie that whenever you have to remember that the world is not a terrible place after all, you can see it again and again.
