I first realized that I first spent a total of two minutes on my life on a skateboard that I was completely uncoordinated. I always thought that it was wonderful to see cats, to know that their stuff could be extreme, but I never had a scatterboard and did not really follow the sport. That said, I thought it was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some critics have said that these two were kind of waving a bit of their own flag, but what is hell? It seems to me that these people are probably eligible to receive credit for anyone as a gift to the skateboarding world and they provide some good footage for their innovation for their innovation. This is a great way for visitors to see both at the moment and despite the age of adolescence in California, the footage that they shot showed some interesting nostalgia which could be somehow beyond the skating game. I could not understand where extreme skating came from, but these films are related to all the pieces together and give us an informative documentary. I'm sure it is favoring at least a tad, but not all the documentary is? Waiting for interested in sports or for me, anyone who grew up in the 1970s
