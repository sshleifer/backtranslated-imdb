Mr Bian is in the shape of a British TV comedy face. He has proven that you do not need to have a bad word or intelligence, a massive budget, lots of intelligence, or even something cute. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters that you just can not forget. Some parts of these episodes cut me into pieces - yes, they are not realistic and they all are stupid, but to be honest, one of the barriers to realityism, Bien has gone the way of greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. Always handle interesting new ideas - and a happy new gag - Remember that while sitting on a sofa on Mr. Bien Roof, did her green mini? Mr Bean is one thing that does not weaken - the film was not so good, but Bean has introduced a comical new ideas in the world, and children and adults will be surprised at each other's fun factor. "Extra" and "Little Britain" can be condemned - it's British comedy at its best and highest price. This turn is never old! 10/10
