In a regular mission in Iraq, a group of Delta soldiers recovered a computer hard drive from the Alkada Training Camp related to the weapon expert Dr. Walsh. After the end of his top secret arms development program, the witness said. Walsh found an alternative source of funding and established a deep research center in the infamous Belgian Forest in Chechnya, where he is developing arms and selling it to the Chechenian insurgents. The Delta's team is the Russians who sent a black opus mission to rescue him and his doctor to find him and his lab. The Delta team soon discovered that the latest weapons of doctors are a large torch of leather that has been genetically modified to develop a taste for human flesh. I saw this movie be much better than what I wanted. Many steps and lots of blood You will expect an animal to feature its more or less. Acting is great but its not passable. I'm definitely looking bad. This is an enjoyable movie for this. A good popcorn movie
