<br /> <br /> This picture contains some really impressive action scenes. Sunny and action matches well, though the intensity of the movie does not last for itself. The last scene is a little anti-final in terms of quality of action and wonderful explosions of past scenes. In other Hong Kong movies, such humor does not seem so ridiculous, and in recent years, this film is entirely in another category than most American action-comedy. Lau Ching-Waien worked as a common, intuitive police-hero who accused the disabled Superintendent of Police of illegally ordering it. The dialectics of the film have been built on the brutality of the pestilence, cold-blooded and narcotics, with many types of machine guns giving serious levels of lead poisoning to insult the police force. Leave the dead body in the world. Yue Rang-Guang is impressive as a very impressive, action piece as a ruthless gangster, where the tough boys really die.
