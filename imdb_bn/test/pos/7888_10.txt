Recently saw, Cree Uncle by the same director, I decided to find it and I'm glad! This is a great movie. Far away, it is probably much better than it seems to be given to the elements. How many times we have to bear in mind that someone who mixes the kids in the middle of the kids is mixing with the kids! And yet thanks to a perfect script it is credible. Not ideal, good or bad but trustworthy. As ruthless suits such as Worker Class, Hippie and N ** Year Hatrer and Dennis Patrick, Peter plays their respective parts unreasonably with Boyle and I can never remember that these two classes are integrated without having anything sensual. Susan Sarandan is effective as a hippie chick but everything in her first film has to do. This is true, of course the film should be captured because it is very open for Westerners and especially in the United States when counter culture itself is wide open.
