Yes, I felt that I was ruined by seeing it first. But until the next day I did not see the genius of this creation. I do not repeat a lot of what I have already said to appreciate the film, but I want to touch a new area ... ** Spirir ** Why did students give a broken glass to the students? Pocket? Most critics have mentioned that it only responds to its non-cooperation and reaction. I have to disagree. See the scene again. Huppert tears are moved as he looks playing on his students stage. The student is quite an intuitive girl (crying and voices of her fear) - just opposite of Hupper's character. After the girl was injured, after discussing the accident with the girl's soil, Hupert, a scene was seen in the film. Mother, apparently annoyed, "We've given up everything so she can read the piano" and Huppert immediately snaps "You mean to say that he did not give up everything." <br /> <br /> I thought that Huppert only saved this young elite student from his own fate. He does not want that woman will end up like her, suppress and become stern, she will be condemned in the history of life ... gradually slaying the soul in search of perfection. Maybe he saw himself on stage before being bad some years ago. Maybe he wants that when he was alive. Is he destroying the student's life, or is he just liberating him? <br /> <br /> For me, this perception has made all the difference in what I saw through this movie. Bright
