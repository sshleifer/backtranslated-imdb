When I first heard that this movie was being made, I was very excited to see it. The idea of ​​making a movie of this qualification was as good as it was, the more difficult it was. I was not sure if anyone involved in the Pope's many amazing qualities in a movie, but the film judged her memory. In my opinion, the most important work was published to the people who started the Pope. In his days in Poland, in the last days of the Vatican, this film follows every aspect of his life. Thomas Kreschenman, who played Pope in his adult life and did very well to earn emotions on him. Overall this movie was to teach, but very entertaining.
