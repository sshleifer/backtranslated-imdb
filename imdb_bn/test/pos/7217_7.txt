I am really frustrated to see William Shakespeare's love for the excellent essay writing a poor, violent and strange movie adaptation movie adaptation. But once you have seen it once, when you see it second and third time, it is growing on you, as you have come on this shock and strong performance, good conversations, excellent choreography and dancing, praising the film on your own capability, very bad Soundtrack and some (special) effects that go. Oh, and last. What a riot!
