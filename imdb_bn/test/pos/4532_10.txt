This film may not seem much to some people, but it was what I was seeing in a comedy. A moment of reducing deadly moments or two scenes, great actors, and most of the best movies that are supposed to be good. Despite playing his usual Snobby character in David Spade, he made this role in an unusual performance which he thinks he has crossed until he hit the screen with Joe shoes. However, even though some are not fans of Chris Farley, I have seen this movie and my friends and I still talk about it ... 11 years later. This movie finally told me that Chris Farley was the actual deal. He is the best comedian in my life. In some words he may be shameless, tricky, funny, serious, crazy, calm, and at the same time moving or frustrating. Not the same word but the message is counting all. Our time is truly great actor and one of the greatest great comedies of all time. Good acting, good story, sunny moments, serious scenes that bring me tears at times. This movie is based on the Horse, which started a brief rule at the top of the great great Chris Farley comedy world. An actor has captured my interest from before or after a movie. Because there are no movies in the movie or movie before. This movie is worth the time, if you do not take time to watch it, but the next time you rent a movie.
