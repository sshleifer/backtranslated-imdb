Emilio Estevez actually directs a good movie - who's thinking? I was sitting with the previous two films Estevez directed - "Wisdom" (then with girlfriend Demi Moore) and "Man at Work" (with brother Charlie Shane). They are lousy films --- acting badly, pointing, stupid and obnoxious. Estevez is a good actor but lousy as the director. I turned on this pure curiosity - it has a great cast and I had nothing to do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her parents (Cathy Bates, Martin Shane) and sister (Kimberly Williams) try to reach him but can not. Some of them have been deeply affected by Vietnam ... and they are blasting ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems new. Estevez is good, Shane is awesome (and father of real life of Estevezs), Williams is touched and Bates is just extraordinary - try to put together the family. It all makes me feel a strong end which really makes me wonder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
