The greatest year of our lives is often compared to an amazing life. They do not have to be. Their only generality is the desire to make a serious comment about the war with millions of lives. It is difficult to know how valuable a spontaneous life is. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives fiercely in the last century? What statistics should we have.) Our sense of war has changed for over 60 years. We have started to think that if war does not fight completely, war is only specially those who have fought. Especially those who fought <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I oppose all war. Many times I had examined that position. This happened when I was in Lexington in the United States, which is permanently located in Corpus Christi of Texas. The ship needs a crew that I live in is a community of 3 or 4 times. It's a strong experience, moving around her deck. He saw a great deal of action. Someone gave me the right to be peacemaker and it was not bought cheaply. <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not see the best year of my life without thinking about things like Lexington. <br /> <br /> Every three veterans pay their debts. And they paid me as well <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the army has provided equally in different ways. Everyone had direct war related problems. And everyone had to work hard to solve that problem. Rather than dealing with the war, they got more courage to face their civilian surroundings because they had to do it themselves. Everyone understands and can express sympathy with others: finally no one can help. <br /> <br /> None of the people knew enough to suggest a male lead in the moving part of the film (this could be the first part of the explosion). Derry told Herald to marry his daughter when the obvious incident. Do not hesitate, do tomorrow. Harold is hard to believe, if anyone can fight, he becomes the protagonist and athletic star of football. But for his achievements, Harold is listening. <br /> <br /> Another is when Daley calls for Ali to stay away from her daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife ?? Ideal Fair for the 30s / 40s film. Dairy did not argue at the point: She felt that she was not fit for Ali's daughter. So he agreed. When we feel about Derry in the same way, the film's trueity is revealed. Real emotions from real people I think there are deep feelings and feelings and respect in our age. I sometimes think we believe that this standard does not exist. Looking at this picture people are facing problems. <br /> <br /> Al Ali is not free from the advice, he does not want to be completely. Any time her boss talks to him, Al tied in the knot. And just so There are some things that can not be judged by professional standards: they should be judged by common general intercourse and only those who are tested by the intensity of life understand those insights. <br /> <br /> All this goes up until a scene where all the warriors fought so bravely are to be hijacked, stacked, preserved, withdrawn, and soon reused: proud of their function, value and pride. Pride He can overcome the lover he is, he fits in the mind for the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I gave the best year of my life year 10 and I feel like some movies. This is not a movie for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to drop anything over anything so personal as this wonderful human life. We should be careful not to abuse that privilege.
