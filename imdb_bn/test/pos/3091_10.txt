It would be very easy to say something about Moragata. Or maybe it is not: Harjag goes for the Sahara Desert and the landscapes of the nearby villages and the landscapes of the locals. But this is only a wide stroke. This is a credit which you do not surrender yourself, nor do you. He fully grasped the world around him, without a story, bound with certain aspects of written poetry, his camera (shooting the movie of the supposedly canceled movie) is like a pure journey. Someone might fall in this simple conclusion, because he kept these amazing landscapes, then went to a more rugged civilized culture (though the actual natural 'culture' itself is not) and able to reach a point level correctly here. Sometimes it takes time to get along with a purity, through the "creation" section, but the purity about how manipulation is done by nature or by the broken-down machine. Shortly narrated by the words, Popol Vehar (who plays for most of his films) with his music gradually adds a completely different level of syllabus. This is a hybrid film, and it is not easy, but the rewards are "The Fertile Truth" of Harjog's closest, which he is going out for his entire career. Up, by the second chapter, Paradise, leading along with spoken words, or if it is about the other way around. You are walking along the eye and pans and the word is close to religious writing, but there are music choices, how oddly saddened with additional singing and coupled with lower classical music Leonard Cohen and blind beliefs. I think each side is appreciating another, and it's something that still looks like * it does not work. It is probably the attraction of it, going through the ruins of the debris and a small part of civilized life (in this case desert shocks) which makes it so attractive. If this is only a wonderful thing for the film, due to the strategic molds, it is very unreasonable for the casual photography fan, and some strange pictures of Herzegov film. There are pans, there are long shots, handcuffs are kept while running the cities, there are a few miles away in the bus, which seems to be only a few minutes through Mirage, where the fire is completely closed and a man is recycling and talking his radar (true classic Gonso Comedy), there are still people in fake voices and a man and woman playing smoothly playing music. But, most importantly, it ends at least for me, the normal feeling of feeling for personal nature. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that HERGG will surely know why he created this image, as opposed to the simple 'how'; She had already had small drawings, even before the Dwarfs started, and she ended up going through many dangers for the end. Yet this is what makes Marathon an amazing achievement - it will appeal to anyone who comes to see it. It is certainly uncertain, but soon after it is tempting to look at it, only all the ideas and realities become strange weird vibes (yes, the word 'vibes' applies here). It's one of the really spectacular "art-films" ever made
