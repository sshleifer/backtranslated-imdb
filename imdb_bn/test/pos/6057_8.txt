I was a Marine at Camp Pendleton when D. Eye. Came out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, i-Battery). I still think that standing in front of a cluster of other marines would be seen in the Oscarside film "Star" theater in California. <br /> <br /> We hope the movie will portray everything we go to in the boot camp. But how we did the movie, we all surprised. The idea of ​​using real mounds in the movie was a great idea (I believe they were all true drill instructors). Jack was an actor like Web, he could not have just "embarrassed" like a real marine drill instructor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We all got a smile when the "problem" the employer's mother came to the camp. Talk to Captain. This will never happen in the million years, but Hollywood, and we did not release us to enjoy the movie on that episode. <br /> <br /> I went to the MCRD boot camp in San Diego during the summer of 1956, and there was no limit to what Dai could do at that time. The "Ribbon Creek" event in Paris Island is not yet damaged in the boot camp, at least not in the MCDD-San Diego. <br /> <br /> I have commented on other critics. Moore's "Stephens" surrounds her girl friend. I believe this was just the webb's acting style and although they could have deleted this part of the film, it did not really hurt a lot of production. <br /> <br /> A small note, the character (unknown) "Professor Rodriguez" is one of my drill instructors, Siggs. Peter J. O'Neill Sergeant O'Neill used to tell us that he wanted to be an actor on that day. We laugh at this in secret, but he surprised us all. He was a great drill instructor, and I did well in his bit part. Also, he really enjoy throwing a knife. He showed our skills during the summer boot camp. I am often surprised whether he is still alive.
