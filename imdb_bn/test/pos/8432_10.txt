A highly politically acclaimed play that when favorable, is one of the most intelligent and most intelligent films ever made. There is almost no broadcast in it, rather it follows a naive TV reporter, who come to realize the threat presented by nuclear power plants, not due to the spontaneous dangers, but because the purveyors are more interested in the lower line than their safety. <br /> <br /> Many Hates this picture because it is a political tract by the liberals like Jane Zenda and General Douglas Isabe seen, but if you've seen it as a drama, but it's simply great, exciting, full of well-developed, distinct characters, and, finally, a truly exciting contemporary thriller in which a suspect could move into the house. Historical note: Some people, especially those in power industry and in Harrisburg, PA Metro, after less than a week after the film was released, it is likely to hit near very close home, devastating explosions in the Three Mile Island nuclear facility. <br /> <br /> Update, 04/08/2007: In the first decade I wrote this criticism, I heard many comments on the film. I think one thing that really needs to be remembered is that this movie is not "anti-liberal" anti-diagonal, which is often tagged. <br /> <br /> The creator and they (or were) significant "Hollywood establishment" liberals, the attack of this film is not the idea of ​​nuclear energy, but the question of the greed, corruption and the fall of the human being that the nature has already become dangerous In the question of the dangers. Anyone who does not accept the reality can argue that the exposure of human beings to atomic radiation can be at least fatal. My friend's friends working for a nuclear plant for several years have even told me about the "safe" exposure levels of the official policy of my staff, which its staff can handle. <br /> <br /> You do not have to believe that corporations are spontaneously evil, greedy and often corrupt for the acquisition of wealth and power pursuit, people. And even if you cancel this claim, you can not dispute that people are prone to making mistakes. While publishing innocent people in nuclear radiation, we can not afford any wrong, and more than that, the claim to make this film is logical. <br /> <br /> If you're following it then try a little perspective. We are currently engaged in a war whose ongoing results are largely different from predicting, an incredibly expensive war of sight. Do not you think that there was a war for tackling global terrorism, you can not resist the fact that the length, financial cost, and most importantly, the loss of human life has been much higher than all the levels, "experts" to ensure our return in 2003 Came. So if someone is not involved then greedy or corrupt, "wrong done" and a very serious measure of error for boot. The same serious mistake, if allowed to be raised in nuclear industry, most parts of the world can be non-residents.
