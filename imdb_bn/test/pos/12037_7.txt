The Turner Classic Movie Channel is the month of January in my favorite actor Robert Montgomery. His films are rarely seen in most cases, mostly in his career, they were obscure - which means that TVs often have re-seen roles, they will be taller, June Bride, Knight break, Saxon skin, Pin Horse, Houston Rage Raid, Chechen's discipline (in short film he fought to take part because he was generally not a fan of general humor). It is fatal that nowadays when Montgomeri's career seems to have hit it, it pushed the films created after 1937 - which broke the original image, MGM and Louis B. Meyer pushed. Montgomery was a gifted comedian and it has saved many movies from routine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Created in 1936 by Piccadilly Jim and Tribele, it was the banner year for Montgomery's good performance, and helped MGM be able to satisfy the power of the powers that allow him to play "Danny" in the night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She lived there for five years and most of the time a woman (except Inuit women) was not with her. He was a girlfriend called Clerker (Winifred Shatter), whom he had proposed, but he heard from him two years later, he believed that he left him. <br /> <br /> When Dianesmore's world was frustrated, seeing San James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Oven and Miranda Fay). They were flying to Toronto at a business address addressing Falton. Fleton is involved in Campton, but Dysmore finds her ridiculous ... and gradually she thinks she's equally attractive. Of course, Poppas, self-important, and frustrating unnoticed Filton is not a competition (it is a measure of Owen's performance that keeps it character-driven, even if someone believes that such a barbaric industry is Canada's captain). <Br> <br /> There is probably something extraordinary about this movie - probably due to the original game. Although the "labrador" scenes seem quite playful, it serves its purpose for the comedy (the sequence of the bear beer). But the height of spirituality served Dinsmore as a guest on "Pemsman Steaks" dinner, which Oven eats with real gastar. Oven (as a small noble as Baronet) dressed - a winter suit for the climate). But Montgomery dressed in his evening dress (like joining a ball at the embassy). Loy, watching him wear a garment, likewise keeps a gown. Dinsmore's servant assistant, Inuit Kimo (Oto Yamoka), who is wearing evening dresses, is also served by them - it proves that it is Owen! Oven, who had earlier insisted on changing Dysmore's more suitable clothing at his station, the only person who is dressing for this dinner! Montgomery was the most accomplished actor of MGM's Tuxedo or evening dress (FrenchTot Tone was his closest competitor). Montgomery or Fred Astyayer was more elegant in this case if it was tossed up in the movie. Make tough decisions. <br /> <br /> The way of love can not be easily comedy or play. Clara shows (when we saw him on an iceberg, we hurried away early in the movie). DINSOMO breaks with clean? Will Irene break with Felton? The film is funny, and the fusion and Montgomery make an excellent couple. They appeared in another film together and both were in separate scenes in a second before this movie. But this will be their last film together. One last interesting thing - when credits are shown at the beginning of the movie, you see men and women's images in humor situations. They were based on John Heald Junior's artwork, the great cartoonist of 1920s and 1930s - who was the flopper and "Jazz era" recorder. This is an unusual choice - it does not have to do anything with its movie plot or labrador.
