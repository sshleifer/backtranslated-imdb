After attempting to beat the movie Viola (Amanda Bains) and girls 'group, his school Cornwall tried to defeat the boys' group. So she goes to competing school Eliarah and joins the boys team, so she takes Duke (Channing Tumat), who thinks a man screams and likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Viole like his brother. <br /> <br /> I was in the 12th night version and the start was very modern. So I knew the game well. I was very great at seeing this movie and when I saw it, my expectations crossed. It kept a lot of my favorite lines and I could see the big connection of the game. Although it was like playing, it was not complicated. I hoped it was more of a chick flick but it was good. It was so ridiculous. It pulls you into a whole bunch of crazy love stories and lies. How did you think of Viala (Amanda Binis) and how the boys thought about the complexity of living in the world. You see his room-mate, Duke (Channing Tutam), its impression. I really saw the characters being illustrated in a modern way. It also says the modern theme "Follow your dreams", but at the moment it's a packing. I think this movie was a great movie about a girl who liked football and was stuck for himself and his family and his dreams. I think this movie will be a big big break.
