The series was not really meant to be a slam against this film, because the series followed the same format. Naturally, Simon Templar ("The Saint") meets a miserable woman and comes for her help. He comes for a police detective help formed to accept a bribe. Along with this, he meets some interesting supplement letters (this time, as Paul Guilfoyle "Parry" Gates) and this is especially compulsive mystery of unraveling (some of them are really), Templar is extremely stupid and just slightly cooler! George Sanders is once again the most impressive British gentleman and he has been successful in creating a wonderful B-spy series film. Nothing special, but a sure and annoying product is sure to please the successive fans.
