This is the tragic situation of corporate Hollywood, when the movie strikes you in a movie room in a day that makes you amazed. I did not really understand how the film would end, because when I wanted to go right, it went left, when I expected a wake up, etc. then it got blurred. It can easily frustrate the Generic Suspense Thriller or easily white trash play, but ultimately it is kept in all its courses. It's a sad story, though. Not the cause of Alice's incident, but the sad world that wanders around it and throws this path down. <br /> <br /> This plot has a quiet pride that is usually reserved for the theater, but use some tightening of the pacing. However, it is a very good film, and for some reason I doubt those sour grapes from those who have scored these low scores.
