I was a projection while in the US. And remember this movie very well. We have just been set up with stereo sound !! O-O-O-O !! Well, it was a big deal in 1959. Instructions came with reels. The projected screen image was closed and I stopped the theater screen. The thirtere screen is closed for exchange and after five minutes I restart the movie and the project screen is turned off and the second screen is used as a screen call. The first stereo movie that I have ever seen and such a huge musical production is I see every time I see it to run.
