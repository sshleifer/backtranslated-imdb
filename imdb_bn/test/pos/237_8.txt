Another great song from the Golden Age of Hollywood! I liked the story of these three friends who are far away from Broadway and all the shiny stars on a small nightclub Although at the big time they are very content with their lives and small clubs where they take place. Gene Kelly plays the owner of a small club and a boyfriend of her dancer Rita Hayorth, who draws some attention while giving a magazines cover. Talking to the city as his girlfriend is starting to have problems for prison Kelly. Phil Silver plays one of three friends and does a good job. There are certainly music and dance. Gene performs a dance performance in Kelly She is walking alone on the street at night and she is looking at her reflection on a shop window. Her reflection soon began to dance with her on the street, great cinematography. Do not miss this one, great entertainment.
