The "House of Dracula" is bad and sometimes suitable for a movie. <br /> <br /> ** Spirir ** <br /> <br /> Adelman, (Onoslaw Stevens), home to Dr. Franz's house, Count Countacula of his sea house (John Carradine) wisely seeks a remedy for vampirezarmism. He started working on a possible healing process involving blood transfusion, Wolf Man, Lawrence Talbot, (Lone Chaney Jr.) looking for healing of Lycanathropi in his estate. Working with two patients, he discovered possible healing in a mold near the laboratory and after investigating the area, he was burned around nearby Frankenstein Manny (Glen Strange). Because of its involvement in the revival, Dr. Adeleman ignores Dracula and Larry's requests and instead of working on her mind, they claim for their treatment, they become clam√©tic showdown with each other. Good news: it was a rather decent film. There is a major idea that is quite creative and fantastic. As a blood disease, the concept of free expression of Vampireism can be transferred from person to person through this first film and physical fluid exchange, which will be followed by the next work, but rarely like it. This parasite has a microscope slide that is thought to be responsible for this condition. It works in some rather nicely used ideas and comes across as a nifty concept even if the execution is executed. A nonsense idea that each of the animals has at least one standout scene. Wolf Man is a wonderful scene where he becomes a suspect member of the search team inside a jail cell and becomes crazy. Dracula is seen as the primary bat and moves towards sleeping towards a prone person and then appears in the form of a human that is really fascinating. Giant rampage is well managed and is destroyed in a suitable amount. Dracula's big bat is always transformed, it seems appropriate for once, and it is fully implemented. It's a thoroughly decent thing <br /> <br /> Bad news: There are many things that were not great about this. This image integrates so much potential plot plot and ideas that it does not actually know what to do with them. There are different stories that need to be mixed together and which should be well mixed and coherent together. This does not really have any of that. The plot is rather snowy and they do not give a star a priority, and instead focus on one another and then include the last three. It seems to be a big confusion because the monsters seem to be related to each other only because of the smallest potential. Finish once a big let down, and it seems completely it has been changed in the last minute. There are some other small things that were not all spectacular and mostly contributed to it. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: This is a good film and it is mostly managed by it. Recreational style The first features of each monster are not close to the classic status, but it is usually a great attention to monsters and fans of universal movies. <br /> <br /> Today's Ratings-PG: Violence
