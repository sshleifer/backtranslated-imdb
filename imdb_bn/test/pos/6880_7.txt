Anthony Wong plays the man, whose wife is seriously ill. Due to his illness, he left for long without sex. For this reason, he is suffering from the brutal nightmare of nurses and school students. "It's a funny cat thrown with the third sparkle and viourism, it also has a bit of it because the first part of the film shows some painful killings by Wang's character under the mysterious effects of the character of the character, because the sequences of dreams are quite erotic and lazy, so I'm not complaining. Wonderful period in the tradition of "Serial Killer Diary" or "Red to Kill" Lets hope the third horror, they will be disappointed, but this look of fans of shocking exploitation movies 7 out 7.
