My husband and I both loved this picture. At first my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got to sit inside this one. But after a few scenes he was completely sucked up and finally convinced that it was one of the best movies. Kathleen Bates has not been so surprisingly loving and the rest of the cast is just fantastic. Thank you for this beautiful film.
