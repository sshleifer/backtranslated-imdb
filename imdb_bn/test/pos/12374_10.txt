This picture is simply an excellent composition in it. Cameraman Julius Jane has made especially double exposure. It has also been made with expertise, which we are using today after eight to eight years. Director Victor Suspended, also plays the lead character, David Holm. On the New Year's night, he was killed in war and legend says that in the new year's first death, he will have to act as a pure ghost as a collector of the heavens. There is a new spirit collector to be appointed every year. <br /> <br /> The scene that comes from the dead body of alcoholic, David Hallam, (like the soul leaves his or her body) (where the war took place) is a real reward for a filmloving eyes. Also when the current spirit collector arrives with his horse and car is a beautiful but an alarming scene. David Holm recognizes this soul collector as an alcoholic before life. It is now take its turn. Like a Dickens story, "A Christmas Story", like Scrooge, shows how David has led his life and works for people around him. <br /> <br /> This picture is about the dangers of drug abuse, alcohol in this case. It is based on a book by Nobel laureate Selma Loggerf. Victor Szstrom has painted some of his books, but it is one of the best results, perhaps this book is the reason for their most pictures. <br /> <br />
