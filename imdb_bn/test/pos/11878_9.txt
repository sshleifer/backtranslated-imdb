<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the level of depiction of the protagonists and the complexity of Hughes brings them to life. His wise mother, his unresolved problems with his father and his inability to single woman. <br /> <br /> has gathered in his poetry and some scenes have been caught in marrying his friend, whom he proposed later, but he was quite surprised, almost unjustly. It is not hard to see where his attraction for the women lying in love with him (and to know each other, to boot and see him!) <br /> <br /> Cerebral, fun-loving, jazz aficionado, devoted friend . It's always more than look, women move beyond its throat, deafness and minimal sight. And an added bonus of a beautiful nuanced performance by Eileen Atkins as her mam. <br /> <br /> 10 out 9
