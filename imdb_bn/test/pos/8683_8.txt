I can say that I'm expecting a movie movie and "Blurred" positively surprised me. Very nice teenage movie. In all such situations, the normal state of school life, so I can say that all this reminds me at school school and sometimes it is good to watch such movies, because when we were young and when we were coming back to our golden years, we were young. Also, guide us to think more clearly as our children should understand, because they were exactly the same as we were in the past. Try this movie and you'll be very happy. At the same time you have to guarantee that your time has been wasted.
