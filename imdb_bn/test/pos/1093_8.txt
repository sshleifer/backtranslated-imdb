I have seen that the police force is by far the most sure film. Although Ram Gopal Varma is not directed, it contains all elements of an RGB film. Dead direct dialogue, brain treatment, brilliant aspects, and excellent acting (even with little work to do in the film, even by them). Chemistry between nan and don, even if they are professional rivals but are amazing. And Indiage is not going to provide information to the small small incidents such as entering the locker, as well as when he is out of the grandfather. Changing the working conditions with senior changes is surprisingly handled. The first half became very mad, a documentary like a documentary is going on with the maternal grandmother, who works as a mentor in Jatin, which gives her the explanation of the complexity and philosophy of her work. <br /> <br /> One of the films with the most brilliant movies in India. Definitely will not be missed.
