Travis (James Franco), a young man wandering the business of the train (we can assume), who has left behind his favorite phone. It is sorted by a brothel, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when he took it to go to his city, a series of events happened that made sure to stay with him forever. <br /> <br /> Both characters have the barrier they've placed in order to protect themselves from contact. But despite their facades, it's both eager to barbarize them down. There are roughly 30 or more spoken lines, but you can stop the volume by using their faces with James Franco and Rachel Manner, the words are unnecessary. Terri's mirrors are staring herself to see a scene. You can only feel the frustration of entering his house. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is not perfect. Most of the hand-held cameras, using it to illustrate, which gets a bit confusing. Franco and the tower is mainly due to the performance and photography, script errors can not stand so much. Still, sometimes it does not really know where the story wants to go. Finally <br /> <br /> This is a film that stays with you long after viewing it. One hour after you watch it, you still own the characters from the 'what-if'. It's not flawless, but it's still you want more than 4x longer.
