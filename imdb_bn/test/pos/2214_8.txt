Brighton has a deadly play in their family chest: Twenty-year-old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts), when she fell down, she collapsed and complained of her negligence for her extra parent, Martha Brighton (Emmy Madigan) accident. 17-year-old Evey Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves his sister and reads poetry and stories for Emily. Their parents live in the basement with their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, his train and railway models. Evey mysteriously denied interviews at various universities and taught Emilie her poem. When Martha Emily recites the poems, she takes notes and shows English teacher Stuart Wari (Christopher Lloyd) who believes that Emily was a moment's genius. When Ibis's only friend James (Fran Cranz) read the notes, he immediately revealed the truth about the authority of the poem. But when Martha became aware, she found the reality of Evie, triggered a series of publications. <br /> <br /> "Love" is a very strong drama of love and the need for complex complications. The performance is stunning, and this is the first work of Lorraine Ambrose from "Six Fit Under", which I saw and it's amazing. This independent film is an excellent choice for viewers who are looking for a refreshing story based on cast performance. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Complexed" ("Complaint")
