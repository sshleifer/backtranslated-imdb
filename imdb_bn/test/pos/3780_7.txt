Pretty funny thing Charlie was still working towards his peak when he was the first brave warrior in the trap of World War I. Brave because, above all, the war was going on and it was a comedy about a serious business. <br /> <br /> These goggles are fun without Hilary or Tier Jeriching. Chaplin and his colleagues followed another successful scene trying to walk deep into the water. (From here we got the word "trench foot.") Perhaps the most ridiculous part of Chaplin was kept as an incognito tree and a large number of German soldiers were leaked, since they were trying to run a soldier captured behind the line. Edna Purviance, at that time Chaplin's main shaking, a woman who cooperated with the Americans and also protected from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> <br /> Chaplin will go on to do fun and more ambitious things but this is the best time to start his shorts.
