"Showtime" falls somewhere in the answer to what some critics say, and I heard a few months ago when I was assembled for a comedy at a South South when I was Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro. Overall, it was quite good! As "real life" crime or police go - and plot, for that matter - it's quite unreasonable, but DUH --- this is a comedy. Also, special effects, behind, sky shots and galaxies swelling, even though what's below the size of Skartzenegger's film, I think it's a little tedious and extra. 9/11 Sensibility on one side, for yourself, the piero-techno hyper-impact staff is getting older this past few years. It takes a lame option for charisma, story, and compelling passion. I hope "Showtime" has a low volume trend in Hollywood. The following trend, less use of fools, less use of explosion buildings. <br /> <br /> De Niro and Murphy are my favorite two. Their screen appearance and charisma - and even the depth of their character - has been "a joy to see" for many years. That can not be dismissed here - they involve the actors, and this movie is entertaining and appealing. I do not put my finger on it, but maybe the explosion, too much FX, and that's all to reduce the final product ??? Probably, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination that gives an idea that the film has not achieved its maximum potential. Anyway, "Showtime" was entertaining - I would probably buy a DVD when it came out - but I thought it was not that it could be all. At least I did not expect. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, but not a great movie. I gave it 8 out of 10.
