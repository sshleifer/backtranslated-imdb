'Hoot' Logan plays a new child at Lorman School, Roy Eberhardt, who has been removed from Montana. But Florida is much different from Montana. Despite the problem of mixing, Roy has discovered a major problem. A new franchisee restaurant is coming in the city and there are problems in the burrowing reverse family. Can a new baby, a Brie Larson and a runway (Codi Lynnie) prevent big business from destroying this naked house? <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty good. The original star of the movie (Logan Lurman, Bri Larsson and Codi Linley) Luke Wilson (Officer Delinco) is ok, but there really is not a very big part. Robert Wagner (mayor) or Jimmy Buffet (Mr. Ryan) is not. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy. For the first time producer, Jimmy Buffett put together the quality of work together. Plus owl was really cute.
