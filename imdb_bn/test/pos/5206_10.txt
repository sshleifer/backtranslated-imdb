I have ever seen the best and most realistic movie about World War II. German and Russian soldiers do not speak Russian because of only German soldiers speaking Russian (no English in German or Russian language English). Acting outstanding There is no love story even in Hollywood's feeling ... Stalinager should have been one of the most horrific battles during the war and there is no place for feeling or romantic scenes in this context. What you get is a movie that throws you on the bone and is one of the best unhappy ends of a movie.
