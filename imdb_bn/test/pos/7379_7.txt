It was an interesting study about social sexuality, as well as people's "dark interests". <br /> <br /> Although I can not say that the wife was a strong character - she had a wrong choice for that part, in my opinion - she was a prosperous child in search of escaping from her drool life. She was actually a rebel and her husband was not fully mature enough for a lawyer (Rickman). It is clear that he covered her marriage for her money and her sexual desires, which are forbidden. Rickman played his part with his flirtations with the youth, and his tease of very fine subones of homosexuality. The young man was strangled! When he spelled Marilyn, he told everything to his wife. She was completely cast as well. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I did not know how it came. Although roughly, Rickman's performance was great, Ridas was good, Walker was right but I was wrong. For a gay themed movie, it was average, but not least flexible. If your "Spidy Maddy Depli" spin is not nearly false for it, it is worth seeing.
