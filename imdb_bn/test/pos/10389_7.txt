Michellejo Antonioi supported the film with the help of Women's Wenders and adapted from her short story collection "The Bowling Al A Tuber". There are 4 short stories with themes known outside of the cloud, which we have been accustomed to from their previous work and relate to the Winter-themed themes which combine through the scenes directed by Winters associated with the character of John Malkovich. However, most of the stories did not offer a little or no depth that we used from an Antonio film, when the supposed depth of Malkovich's blurred vision was fuzzy with fiction, which was festive and out of place. <br /> <However, four stories can be confronted with opportunities, and very soon the romances that wish for more in the first look, probably due to lack of time (as they are still in short stories) allow more. Stimulated approach to learn definitions and characters carefully as we usually know from a typical Antonioni movie. And there is an uninterrupted view of the characters for the lack of deep relationship dedicated to immediate satisfaction of the body. Maybe you want to bring this point closer to observing modern relations? <br /> <br /> The first story, Story of a Love Affair, which was never over, Silvano (Kim Rossi Stewart) and Carmen (Ins Sassre), when asked for directions to a hotel, and later joined a cafe. It seems that fate is playing games while playing with them, but they are participating and later reconnected, but like playing games, it is often accompanied by lack of communication like L'Aventant or La Note and with its expectations <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> The character of Mr. Malkovichi plays the central role in the next short period, which is somewhat impressive for acting a girl acting in Sophie Mareswe Beauty displayed. He feels deeply annoyed and feels uncomfortable, but anyhow he dared to go to him, and to scare him out of what I thought, he had his background as he murdered his father 12 times. But close to these two bedroom gymnastics in a flash. <br /> <br /> The next little, do not look at me, the very longest of his daughter (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, by acting Fanny Ardant Probably many star stands, Gene Reno walks towards a coder at the end of it, which extends into the small universe, which is the short version. But unfortunately, Reno's involvement also leads to a slight suppression of laughter because it moves into an impossible domain with laser's rapid romantic disguises. From a lavish glass panel from L'Eclisse, was a key element adapted through a kiss, where the introductory story about soul stories was quite interesting. If there is a negative theme here, this small game is wanted, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was a small scene, our couple La Noto, Marcelo Mastrani and Jane Morou, where they painted a memorable landscape of the former Red desert. Finally, our dirt is the final shot, along with Vincent Perez, a young girl (Irene Jacob) whom she just met, and fell in love with her, was only going to understand that it was too late for a love. It seems like a relatively chunky piece, like the first story, with the characters involved in the conversation with the characters that they are walking on the streets of the city, before Richard Lincolter's sunrise. <br /> <br /> <br /> To be completely successful as a separate piece of film, they are not quite measurable as a joint effort given "excuses" for their link, a film director explores possible stories and encourages them for the next picture. There was a look.
