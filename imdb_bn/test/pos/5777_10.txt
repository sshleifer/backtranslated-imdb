This image has broken a lot and it has got fewer credits than it did. It touches on a topic that is always present in our daily lives, but it is seen as such that it does not qualify for discussion. This phenomenon can be used by carers (they are doctors or "broken promises", as a senior social worker) who abuse their position for abusing them for abuse. <br /> <br /> Promise, Patty Clauson and her family are abandoned by their parents; But soon it was sorted by local law enforcement. Confronting the specific possibilities of care, Patti urges young social workers to keep him and his siblings together. This social worker came to a senior member of another department, but his request was denied. <br /> But this phenomenon, "broken promise", gives the film its name, which creates dramatic tension throughout the film. Encouraged by the explicit betrayal of the Young Social Worker, Patti Clauson moved away from her sent home. <br /> <br /> tackles the difficult task of finding his family in an environment where the ideal is seen to be completely separated from the past; He knew where he went to the senior social worker's office to steal the case and could break them. <br /> <br /> He saw that he made a dangerous enemy. This little girl has made her and her division embarrassed, the senior social worker decided to destroy her power and authority; He is legally capable of doing something. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This topic, the client of the carers' loss, is relatively banned. It is rarely handled by the managers because some directors want to run this path that seems to be a cause of concern for carers. <br /> <br /> I think this film plays an important role in making the public more aware. This sort of thing Illustrating the image is not only commendable, but it has happened before many other kids around the world. This film is very important to change public opinion in order to get rid of the laws of protecting harmful people like "Senior Social Workers" in "broken promises". <br /> <br /> I firmly recommend strong commitment. This is especially suitable for training social workers, psychologists, psychologists, doctors and other care professionals. It is a lesson to avoid the heart that should be taken. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------- "Melissa Mitchellsen took a fantastic role as Patti Klausen, especially because it is critically critical of films like this." If the audience is not familiar with Patty's character, then the whole message will be in danger.
