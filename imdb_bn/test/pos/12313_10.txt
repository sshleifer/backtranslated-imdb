I believe John Houston's "dead" is a true classic. Houston's final film is not just this, "I know everything about film making in this movie is all about". The closely accepted story from "Dobliners" by James Joyce is a great combination of English and Irish actors Angelica Houston, Sterling Performance and People's Daughters, and Sterling Performance, which bring life stories to the public. This is a film that should not be part of a serious collection, it's only visible due to its elegant, but the story is timeless and very interesting The film does not rush fast, and it is not charged by action. Instead, the story unfolds from within the characters, who bring light and dialogue to the people. The end of the film is stunning, poetic, and hunting. I sometimes recommend "dead" without reservation as one of the best films I made.
