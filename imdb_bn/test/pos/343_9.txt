Sri Lanka ... which country I never thought I would have to admit. I do not even know that it was near India, since 1983 there seems to be a bloody civil war. It seems that the rebels of Tamil minorities are continuing the ongoing conflict with ongoing military rule. Many deaths and widespread diseases on the island for many years. <br /> <br /> The latest movie of Moni Ratnam, Pink On the Makk, tells the story of a young girl named Amudha, who is different from her. Parents raised by war and raised by a young Indian couple. Amuhaa is a bright and naughty girl, whose life tells her father that she has been adopted as a child, her life has turned upside down. Although his adopted parents love him as much as he raises his biological children as well as without superstition, Amodha can not help but learn more about his biological family. <br /> <br /> Moni Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DILS, which hides a story about terrorism and politics (or is it another way?) in a love story. This spike has the same area, but it is probably ambitious in the covered ground. The central theme related to the film is the love of all the members of the family, especially a child and his adopted parent. This feeling can be a pretty and open look, it is mostly sensitive and hearty and can be quite painful on the other hand. This is an emotional complex film, which is somewhat ideological, but the characters behave very harmoniously. <br /> <br /> This film is about 9 years old, Amyuda is turning, young actress P. come. Acting with its charm and lively. In his first and only acting role Keerthana She is a princess and a monster, always getting into trouble but someone so desperately charming could have long been crazy for her. The young actress has cast for the role, and has done a great job for her in many and often difficult mental scenes. <br /> <br /> There was an innocent name behind this chikke, I was not ready at all. Experience intensity. Such a small task has never been so much emotional, I boldly say. The film is a bold and artistic endeavor to explore the topics covered in silver screen. <br /> <br /> The inscription of Gem Ratam is fantastic, very confident and mature - I'm still the most sophisticated workman to see from this. The film is very stylish in appearance, with some excellent camerawork and imagery. A.R. Rahman provides the soundtrack of the movie, which is not as good as his classic DILS or Bombay music (based on the first impression), but still shows his excellent musical talent. <br /> <br /> I'm not aware of the DVD release for the film yet - I have seen it in Tamil with English subtitles to thank the San Francisco International Film Festival, of which the film was undoubtedly highlighted. The production is truly global effort, and I'm sure that it will be popular with Western listeners as it started to get extensive exposure. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
