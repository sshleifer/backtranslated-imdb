This movie is doing well. It is in trouble with the returning of Vietnam militants to deal with the horrors of the war. Unfortunately, the authors chose to concentrate on a vet involved in a scandal of oppression. I was in Vietnam and once heard an interview that saw it. The offender was fined and Leonore was sentenced for many years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " All the soldiers I knew personally or heard from the mouth spoke respected soldiers who even respected the enemy and believed that they could stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem is to know that most Americans oppose the war. For that reason many veterans think that they have taken some part of the honor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have given 7 out of 10 for this. If the last permission is allowed, I could have rated it 9. <br /> <br /> The most modest male will return home from crime and from war due to war crimes. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome that. I pray that in the Vietnam era more people than the public are more burdened than the public.
