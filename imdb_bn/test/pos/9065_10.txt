I really liked this original screenplay and it took me several places, loving, spiritual and just plain silly things. I did not detect "trustworthiness" on screenplay or actors and did not think about it before reading the review here in IMDB for the movie. When listening to Michael Persce's question-answer about the idea of ​​filmmaking, how crazy people, or "people" upload, as he keeps, falling in love is really interesting. I like to detect it with having no romance story in a story book and find the difficulty in it at best. I love seeing David Crimholz what he's seeing and followed his career for a few years. I believe this is his best work and somebody else, just watch this movie to see an extraordinary young actor. I agree that Gilero Diaz was truly a scene crook, and what he did with his character is a great acting lesson of commitment. I laughed and cried in this movie and I was disappointed that I did not win any prize in this festival. I do not question why. I have given Max and Grace 10 titles because these interesting, unique, creative Indie movies deserve the audience. Technically watching this movie, is it really beautiful done ?? The colors are amazing, and ultimately, it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a film in a short time.
