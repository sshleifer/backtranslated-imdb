I saw this performance on TV and it taped it. My daughter again played it over. I work out debt at all and everyone just likes it. It's just brilliant physical comedy. Bill attended here in California, (he is working and living in New York) and was conducting Flooders Flight of Stage. I was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant act. <br /> <br /> Bill was given federal advances, and my daughter wrote a letter to congratulate her, and Bill was very happy to write to her. Note back and lock a photograph. <br /> <br /> People ask me, and I can not decide whether he is a joke, actor, or shoes. Indeed he is three. I really wanted to have this DVD, my tape was lost.
