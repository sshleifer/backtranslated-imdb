It was an amazingly very good movie and an interesting concept. However, this 'twist' was a little predictable and only a little bit of a movie was a little disappointing. When I saw it was a bit annoying and confusing on the point that the only rational result was an inevitable plot, but of course the film did not destroy the flow of the film. There was fantastic performance, there was not a dull annoying moment, so watching this one is completely good. It keeps me interested at the end, and there are not many movies for me that can do these days. I highly recommend people watching this awesome little movie
