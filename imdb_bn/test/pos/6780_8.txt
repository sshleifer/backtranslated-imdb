I used to play this game after watching the trailer in old magazines ... <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting and dark atmosphere (missing in today's games / movies). The game is set somewhere in the middle of the 90's in the mysterious palace of the cat. You play as Adam Randle and your campaign will free your trapped father's soul. <br /> <br /> The game's appearance is destructive, but very different types of game. This old classic game has an action, various puzzles, search, mood and many other interesting locations and characters. <br /> <br /> This game will only run on Windows 98 and there will be no patch for Windows XP.
