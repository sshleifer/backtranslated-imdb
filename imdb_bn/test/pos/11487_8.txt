It is unfortunate that at the Dallas Dallas Theater lasted just two weeks. I thought it was for a lot of this movie The script was fun, full of subtle psychological shifts, and it was a good message. The acting was great. Everyone is a fantastic job, especially with the subtleties of the script. Heather Graham has only beautiful eyes, his * publisher * has eyes. All actors are interesting for that matter! Why it's not good to release his dramatic, I do not know - other than the studio it does not seem to have much behind a push. But it's good to work well, and I hope it will be good on video. In the first half of 2000 it must be my darling
