This film, directed by George Fitzmouris, who created many great films, is also good with its excellent standards. It's shiny with some wonderful lines, malicious, and there are unsafe Ronald Callman in the romantic lead. Colman starred in a strange English colleague's strange little boy. He is financially illegally responsible (for example, spending £ 15m of his last £ 20 in a cute little tire called George), but open, barbarous liberal, reverential to cruelty, politically feasible, irrational, and frustrating. He is so fearful that all the women fall in love with him. His girlfriend was a star of music halls, and in 1930, Dame-Mo Onde, a décion, starred in his ordinary civilized, narrow-eyed silkine by his logical clay fusion. Fitzmaurice closups were not a great user, and that day the gals had half their secrets with that terrible clinging hats, so we do not want to get better glimpses as we do with two heroine faces. The director seems more interested in the impressive Colman, however. Romantic female lead young and fresh face Loretta Young, who is not yet known as Proto-Julie Andrews, we usually knew him, but he still warmed all the sweetness of a pink garden and was laughable and warmly laughing. Full time It is clear that the need to characterize a comedy with the humorous intelligence to praise the social anarchy of snobbing the comfortable spiritual character played by the pen. This plot is just as important, as is often the case with these light and fun movies. This is just such fun.
