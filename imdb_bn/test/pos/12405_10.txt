This picture was so beautiful that I do not think I'm really jealous. After an intense situation set me kept glued. However, I saw Corey Feldman much more in this film. He just stole all the sights that he stole. This may be Corey's performance up to my favorite stars. The ending was tricky and in contrast to other movies which moved away from separating parts of the preferred supplement letters, this film goes for it! I liked that the graphic was not blood and gore but left more of the viewer's imagination. Salad I had to erase sweat from my forehead during this special torture scene with a cut in paperwork. Finally, the film works due to its preferred lead character and the remarkable presence of my favorite bad guys, James Rima (48 hours, remember?) I strongly recommend this film to break the sweat. <br /> <br />
