I love this movie I love the romance part with Colby and the girl ... Rachel (?) Her name 42 .... I was really interested in them too. I love them in movies, I want to see more movies. But there is no sad end where they can not be 2gether! = (It made me cry, but romance in them, the plot was all big. =) I was more than Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) Everything in this movie is thrilling to glue your seat. Because I was sure. Sincerely my only personal wish will be more attention between couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent end. At the end, I hated, it is better to think that his death is not about to force Colby and Rachel has a son. The final movie will be killed.
