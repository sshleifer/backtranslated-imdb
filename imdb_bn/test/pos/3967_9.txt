Diora Baird This movie is absolutely hot as hell. But really wonderful to see all the characters are fun. <br /> <br /> (minimum speaker) naturally, the main character, b, one of the bunch. If he is rejected from the colleges he applies, then this conspiracy idea to build his own college is B. He is known for making fake ID. So there is no problem with a acceptance letter. <br /> <br /> Because B's parents are hard @ $$ and he never heard of the suspect at this university, B. asked his friend Sherman to design a website for the university. Sherman has been taking a great college and fear of being arrested for fraud. He is very quick with the wicked line but his error he wants to take too much socially. <br /> <br /> Glenn, Hands, and Rory follow along with three stooges. Glenn has got a zero for her SATs and has no thought process. He is constantly offering war royals, but he gets very hot girls, which is very good in smoothing. Hands was a great football player who did not get the scholarship he received and became a craftsman to cover the lack of athletics. Rory was preparing to go to Yale from the first grade, and was not accepted. He spent his time meditation. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Photo by Luis Blake himself. If you do not have any reason to watch this movie, watch it for Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are amazing. <br /> <br /> Monica is a B love interest. In most of these stories, he is more popular and he does not even notice even half of the film. Although, unlike many other stories, B actually gets him and finally holds him. Monica is actually a good character for her own, but of course she is mainly there to worship B <br /> <br /> There are more supporters in college who have fun watching. Eddie's name is self-explanatory, and at the fun stage he ended up in meditation classes. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls head on the heel for an opportunity to go to school and eventually gets a crash on Glenn. Morris is a former military statue who has his GI Got it. Want to study rock n 'roll in bills and colleges. The final guy is known only as a Fraki student, who thinks he can blow things with his mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Love each character. I believe this movie has a good plot and despite the fact that many people say it is well done. Even the overall story seems to be hypothetical, letters assume you and make the movie awesome. Go to see this picture. I got it 9 out of 9
