I recently bought it in DVD because I did not say anything about it and Robert Carleill. <br /> <br /> Specifically, the film was not going to have special effects on Hollywood blockbuster, special effects were adequate, and the act was also fine. <br /> <br /> I found the movie enjoyable and it can not be saddened to buy it, it's a perfect length for this type of film about 2 hours long. <<br /> <br /> Do not expect thrilling explosives from the beginning to the end, this is a fairly good balance film with an appropriate enough story!
