To clean only, Matthew Ponsaly was not a real person, but a combination of two murderers was a combination of those who were both convicted and executed for the murder of two teenage girls. <br /> <br /> I read the users comments and they responded as Matthew was real. This character was based on the combination of two killers, Elmo Patrick Sonny and Robert Lee Willie (who killed different people) and the murder itself was committed to Willie. The confrontation between the other person with the will and both parties take the sworn oath, the incident of the murder also works in the story. <br /> <br /> Pijan's attitude is unique that she is not only to convict. Wait for their death and help them to take responsibility for their actions, he has reached the hunters' families so that they can tell that they have been convicted, they feel truly sorry about what they did. <br /> Everybody posted here seems to have strong faith in the death penalty. It is not my place to say it is right or wrong - death sentence with the theory gives some sense of execution, but a person refuses their freedom for the rest of the day, although expensive, makes me more sense. 23/7 (one hour of exercise) in the small room, the cruel thing they thought was a better punishment for the rest of the day - they were technically alive but refused to live. Kill someone by telling them that they can come out of the responsibility of the person who killed them (for example, Susan Smith killed his poor child by throwing his lake in the lake). I think it's ironic right that they will not get "freedom" and now they will have to spend the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> Prejean's point comes through very good stories. He paid homage to me-he guides to find that balance-he is not supporting a killer, he is managing to take what he has done. If they do not feel any kind of regrets, they will not seek spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> On the Final Note, when the ponstal wanted to apologize to parents and parents for killing his son, the girl's parents did not apologize for her death, and some of the mutters were murdered. I think the film was all over, the ponstalls killed both the kids. Prison is suspecting that he killed both - a friend who got death but not death - I think that Ponstalat delacrocus killed the boy and another person killed the girl-so that Panlett was responsible for his work. If he was responsible for the death of the girl, he probably apologized for him.
