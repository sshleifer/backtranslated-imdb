Yesterday (February 4, 2006) I have seen this movie in the theater in Singapore and have better understood about the patients passing through schizophrenia and their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Aparna Sen must not congratulate on a difficult issue, but with psychological obstruction to treat with deep understanding of their accidents, which are necessary for their help in tackling the storms of their psychology, hallucinations and their minds. . <br /> <br /> There are Huliwyd movies such as "One has flew over the Kakuro nest" where Jack Nicholson is honored. Thereafter, the research helped provide more insight into the problem and some mistaken ideas about the treatment. "Dog house," for example, shock therapy is portrayed as barbaric, but in reference to "15 ..." it has been said that it has not been so bad. <Br /> <br /> Another misconception is the use of childhood abnormalities Schizophrenia. But Dr. E. Fuller Tore insists that scholars have shown that early childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and it is believed to be some genetic roots. <br /> <br /> It has now been established that a clinical illness can be treated like schizophrenia and its early detection can be detected early. Even moderate medicines and counseling can be effective at even the most advanced stage. <br /> <br /> Actors can play their part in the same sense as Emce Sen. The role of maintaining gravity of the theme is controlled everywhere. Kanakana Sen-Sharma's stupid silence and eyes reflect helpless confusion of the troubled confusing mind compared to the pigments used in most of the films. Include mentally challenged characters. <br /> <br /> Like most of my listeners, most listeners are confused with the sudden ending. It leaves many questions hanging in terms of plots. <br /> <br /> The search for fenugreek is finished? Why is he not found 15? When the fox roars around the hole with his eyes, what actually the children were playing? Can anyone figure out this jigsaw puzzle sort?
