This is my favorite Columbo. Martin Landau (nice!) Plays a pair of pairs, one of which is a murder. This column is unusual because in the beginning, the usual murder scene did not give you any idea what it did! Written by Steven Bouchock in this episode, Peter Fawl is naturally created (who wrote my second favorite episode 'Mard by the Book'). Supporting Cast is great, especially Julie Niemer (very few ratings) and Janet Nalan as the home keeper, Colombo just gets annoyed. Paris' title is the title of Martin Landau. The mission was unlikely to be the title of the character of Leonard Nimay. Coincidence? Or a Steven Bochco joke?
