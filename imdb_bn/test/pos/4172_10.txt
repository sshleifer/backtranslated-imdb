The symbiotic gallery, the melodious melody, has hit the audience's expectations with their "soon no longer" goal. These monkees and naturally elected members of the group, were still a fine witness in your face, by farewell to each other. Today's message is true, you will run away from the cage and the bridges you want to stop are the next generation of frustrating, always new kids to replace those who are free from the chains. The film can sometimes be frustrating, because movie attacks are different from the way in America, because the thinking and the rationalists can not help but look at their own views in the scene of the head and not only their personal intentions but the purpose of continuing the craziness of American life, but those who Run for this madness Their intention to go on. The final scene, like the brave final scene in which Don Quixote's warlike Tiger exits, represents only the most confusing and impossible dream.
