This is a movie I came across in the accident. I was flipping through and it was showtime so I saw it. Now I see it at least once a month. This is a movie filled with symbols that can trash some people. Do not listen to people who hate this movie, if they want an action movie with expensive f / x, they have to rent a movie they promised. If you are in the mood for a good sci-fi, I highly recommend it. When buying DVDs, I recommend the Alliance Atlantic version of the film, which is much more than the Dimension Films version.
