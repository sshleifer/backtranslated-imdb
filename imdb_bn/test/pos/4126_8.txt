It happened to me when the final scene of the movie was embarrassed to reveal a brief description of the death of Body Holly, who is still alive in the Kyrike, Iwate, on the spot, who clearly remembers it. It should be a scary memory, expressed more stupidity by the song "American Pie", because it will honor the music day. On that day the world had lost some extraordinary talent, life had narrowed its way down to its head, and if someone thought that the three of those musicians were killed, they had survived to produce more musical heritage. <br /> <I have seen this movie for about 30 years now after the main theatrical release. Thirty years, I have some problems that wrap the mind around me. I forgot a lot, while remembering a few things, like wall cricket, who became immortal by the name of the band. But most of all, I think the song. Tapping the beat of "Oh Boy" or "That the Day of the Day" is not right, and only the threat of our moral might come with those tunes. I'm at least with the badie in that square, if they come with them, how can they be wild? It has been threatening for the fabric of society in every successive decade - the whole host of Beatles, Motown, Disco and other musical instruments. We still hear the beat and dance, so I think they can not be all bad. <br /> <br /> There was another takeaway from the picture I forgot. Meanwhile, I learned to frog a phone on the table while the other side did not see my things. I've done it for many years, but have forgotten the source till now. Well, I want to be better at 30 years or more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Today, Can not imagine reading, but it was a tour de force careerization and performance that earned Basi for the Oscars. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are capable of being members of the body, though their characters mostly sit behind the story. I enjoyed the subtle ways that other titles segued in legendary pictures, like Sam Cook and King Curtis, without ever having lived in their presence. <br /> <br /> I will always be fond of music and follow up in the Fifties and the sixties - 'Old' now call them. I think this makes me an old cat, but you can not replace the growing experience with music history which now makes it big screen. Which makes the idea even stronger that I will enjoy music until I die.
