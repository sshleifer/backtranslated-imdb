It is simply ridiculous how underlying this movie. It's one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. It is never too light, it does not diminish, it is a movie that has a great stream in the plot. Along with brilliant writing that makes this a terrific movie. Amir and Salman are violent, even Ravina and Karisma are funny in this movie. Parves Rawal and Shakti distributed some extraordinary comedy, but Biju Khot and Ajit-Bhanabe are the best ones with the intention of their stupid fools. If you want to laugh and enjoy a movie, check out this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not be so sorry. Most Indian films finally tire me, because they are 3 hours long. The length of the film is so long, but after the end, there was much more, because it's an extraordinary flick.
