In my analysis of "Toll's Coolies: Blank" I wrote that his voice is more lighter than the voice of "Trois Coolers: Blue". I think the same with this film. This time it is not a sad comedy, but the main character is much more due to Valentine's. Although his boyfriend is living abroad and laughing enthusiastically, he manages his life with light and optimistic, it seems that he may be a picture of Kislowski for a discouraged young man. The opposite opposite judge seems to be, who is very dull, a scary old man who experiences great loneliness. In my view, the valentines and judges are similar to each other, the judges have been very old and have faced many more disappointments. They share a different kind of proximity and they both discover that they can learn a lot from the other. Finally, I want to put pressure on Erin Jacob's performance, he stopped playing "three colors" - great women in the genre.
