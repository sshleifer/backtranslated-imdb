I found the movie Judas Kiss Nice. Carla Gagino's performances were fantastic, probably the best of her career. The expression of his face in many scenes was incredibly true to character, and director Guti√©rrez was exploited for his superiority. All performers and actresses were very good at their performances. Emma Thompsom was as unbelievable as usual. His acting ability is much more than what is needed for this character, so he actually increases it in the film. <br /> <br /> The story, though sometimes complex, is to entertain and look towards the end. Very very good. A movie will not be missed. A story weaved well and managed brilliantly. Film quality, excellent.
