Really, I liked Michael. Although there was "I had a pillow day, I would have to take a repression" parts were cool. I think everyone has done a great job in this film. And Nora Affron is my "OK" list of directors. <br /> <br /> It was good to see John Travolta as a dense angel. It often does not see me in a movie. Some people may call it a boring movie, but for me I like it. Angels and all
