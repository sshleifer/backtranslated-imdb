Imagery controls this picture. Characters, though interesting, eventually take a rear seat. I think the first scene is a black and white shot of the sea, which opens in full screen and in color. The water bubbles go towards a small coffin that breaks the surface. Here is the theme of the film, the death that can be taken and brought to the state of the living. <br /> <br /> To stress the people here, water is used as the ultimate consciousness of God's practice in order to get their "house" (trial day). There is a lift for the dead and for a good place. Anyone who has left unresolved or uncertain will be washed. There is no fatigue in the past, which was in the memory of one of his graves. <br /> <br /> This film is compared to O, where the brother is art art, and water is threatened and it is being used as a clean energy. That film is similar. It is known what is different in this movie and again, emphasizing what needs to be done here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree with some scenes in the scene that a David Lynch work is memorable. For example, take part in the dinner with deep voice and ornate waitress. With the back side of the fire starter scene, one gets the same emotional feeling from the setting and the strange character. The difference is that Lin Ch attacks us with the image to express the mental processes of a boring character, whereas the film seems to use the supernatural element to create moral messages. Men in black suites can not have any of them - they must be patient and accept what they accept.
