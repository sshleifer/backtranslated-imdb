"Radio Flyer" is one of my most favorite American films. <br /> <br /> Two great boys, Joe Magello and Elisa Wood are really great work, (despite the terrible performance of Hong Kong's ... at the beginning and the end ...) with DMEvans' awesome scripts and R.Donner Plus's strong and emotional guidance. H. In Jimmor's incredibly peerless music score, "Radio Flyer" is one of the first of my family ratings ratings. <<br /> <br /> It is very sad that it was a very good movie by critics of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to watch this DVD.
