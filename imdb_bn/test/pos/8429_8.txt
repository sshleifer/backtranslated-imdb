I am a big fan of the 1995 edition, which I have seen many times and considers a fine, nice movie. This edition of 1971 I bought yesterday, a little hesitant, but now I have seen it, I'm happy, because it is true for books and Austen's insights. The 1995 edition has most of the dramatic power because it sharpens many characters - in 1995, Lady Russell Snowbaby, more harmful, in fact, in search of anne; Sir Walter is more vulnerable and vapid; Elizabeth Nashik; Mary is more helpless; Mr. Eliot is more humorous; Lady Dal√≠mlal is a lot more stupid - but I think the characters in this 1971 edition are closer to the book, to Austen's perspective, and to the real people of that time. The 1971 edition also includes the main line and scenes of the book, especially the main scene in the field where the character of Anne characterizes Lucius (or Henrytida), I find it more subtle and enthusiastic than the critics, but the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with the critics Actress Anne is acting, she is too old! I am IM He watched his entry at IB and at the age of 38 at the time of the film, when his character was considered 28. I think his acting was subtle and effective.Wentworth is the right age and I found him very believable, especially in 1971, Westworth The version contained much more of his humor and teasing, one in 1995, more than the power of the sea captain, and more passion. Admira in the 1971 edition In 1995, the lack of presence in humans and lack of warmth, and Admiral certainly lacked the power of expression; I did not find a really weak element in production. I agree with others that the staging of the "Falling" scene was very wood, and It does not think that she was so wounded by such a small collapse. However, it may be pushed to the back of the head of the stone step, which, if it is really, will cause very dangerous injuries, and in the 1995 version it will make the scene stronger than the scene, where he falls further, but any sharp edge is definitely a The main head may be hit. Some have criticized that I am not an expert and can not respond, but I think no navy (Wayworth, Admiral Croft, Benewic, Harvill) did not wear uniforms in the 1971 edition, their version of the 1995 edition consisted of their uniform uniforms. I think the 1971 version was correct, and in 1995 the version always bothered me, clearly the officers were uniform during the nation's peace and the officers separated from the active duty. My parents and grandparents were carriers of the carrier and submarine officer, and they did not spend the day on vacation or on their dress blues retirement. I suspect it was different 180 years ago. Uniforms give many zings to the 1995 version and I like it, but I suspect that historically it is right that these officers often wore their uniforms. Finally, it is true, the production value of the 1971 edition is much lower than the 1995 edition, but the year (1971), the TV format and the budget are given, we can not blame the artists for this. Contemporary viewers can create emotional allowances for lower production standards, this version can make them value valuable.
