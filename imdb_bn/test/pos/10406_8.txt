NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker Masfumi Kobayashi, because he is gradually getting some mysterious and evil, which exceeds the dead body of his body. After interviewing a woman who wanted to hear the children crying loud enough to come from the side of the house, cuddling with talking to a Cubassy neighbor. He greeted the enemy, the unpleasant woman (Maria Takagi), who responded to the door (and immediately slogans in her mouth) and got her 6-year-old boy shine in a window. Curiously, both the woman and her son disappeared after a few days of her inspection (leaving behind behind the dead pigeons in the verandah behind them), and the woman who complained about the Prothom-alo and her daughter, both are mysterious that after the accident, This is a cobbler's interest and he has set a search to know what is going on. He seems to be tuning in the midst of some sinister, unexplainable and perhaps even apocalypse who with mental power and extra sensitive concepts that uncovers soon. The well-known 10-year-old Clairewant and TV celebrity, Cana (Rio Canoe) thinks we all will be destroyed, but they disappear mysteriously before a lot of help.

Overall, it's a well-made horror movie, lots of plots, some mysteries, and a couple of really unclear moments, which are good to check. My only real grapher could be to use it here and trimming a little bit and seems to go a bit too long. Otherwise, pretty good things.
