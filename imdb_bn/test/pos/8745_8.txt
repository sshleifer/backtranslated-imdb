I've reviewed numerous reviews talking about the superiority of the mini series. I certainly can not agree on such a blanket statement. If you analyze all aspects of video / film production, there are numerical places where the film is reasonably high. <br /> <br /> Of course, many comments -series related to particular areas of minutes Especially related to more threads (customs officers) and more advanced threads (such as Pakistani farmer and family). That said, I'm afraid the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones is too much forced to be rich from poverty, who "will not return." It is a much more likable character compared to these cold women, who do not seem to have many reasons for their fast turn back. (And yes, I understand ... her children were frustrated, I did not see her frustrated.) <br /> <br /> When I compliment the threads of some faded stories in the mini series, the character of Bensio del Tor is very It was interesting. An anchor for the film. The thread that changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) is nothing good. A fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I suspect that someone in such a system may be so pure, but I do not know enough to argue about the politics of the country). <br /> <br /> Mini series after watching the first episode, I actually rewatched the film. Why? I keep reading about the superb acting. I found the first episode of the short series to be unlimited unlimited to find out. Of course, this progress as a mini series progress. Now both days have been completed within just a few days, I can not agree that the performance of the short series has reached the same level, the Bolivian del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, although Armonds, Patterson, Shah, and Lindsey Duncan were very good. I have removed the police from this film from a small series. I was not influenced by the Germans throughout life. Finally, the dialogue dialogue in the movie is much lower. Especially verbatim which are apparently especially. "Be careful, you're starting to sound like your husband." "Ahhaha! You sound like Carl." Again, I found the acting of the mini series to get something very disrespectful. This was a prime example. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The other side of the picture, my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Would I complain that this film was no more? No I think it was an excellent adaptation to the format. Changes stand their own. That means, you sit in the theater for 5/7/10 hours. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Mini series: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Movie: 9 out of 10
