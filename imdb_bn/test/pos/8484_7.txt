Rare parts are attractive, and technically it is very well made, but the rays are often lazy, and forget about some important details about Ray's life. All the movies show us that wherever he is his main, and most successful, which is good, he only wanted to see some bit about his old life. The team teamed up with Jamie Fox Ray Charles in T, sometimes it is absolutely dishonest. I say, I got the jammy through this movie. Then the first half is much better then. It's more attractive, it's more OOMF, and it's nowhere near as lazy as it is. I was not really a fan of Ray Charles to get started, so I had no real expectation of the film. Ray's biggest problem was the length over. It was cut very easily with more relevant scenes, the other they used to use then. When he was successful in the first part of Roy's life, he was most interesting. He was back then humble, and a little gentleman. And when the movie could make her work very narrow, she made herself very full of care for me. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for ages as Ray. Look like rays, words like ray, act like rays. He even songs like ray! It is more an impression then, I really believe in Ray Charles He was in the heart of the film, and without his presence, this film has been a completely and pronounced bore. <br /> <br /> bottom line. Attracting at the ray, the dreadful others drool at it. When all is said and done, I was repeatedly frustrated by how everyday it seems. It's just a bookmark graphic film, because its meaning is that it is not automatically Oscar worthy. Jamie Fox is eligible for her Oscar, but the film is more than the minimum. The price of a clock, but if you are me, I'd rather keep my expectations at a comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
