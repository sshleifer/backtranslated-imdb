A long-delayed concert release, Rush-in-Rio DVD is both compelling and frustrating. This slick set of two discs shows the rush at their best. After maintaining their unique sound after 30 years, there is a record among the most gifted rock bands on this list. <br /> <br /> The concert consists of two dozen songs, a documentary and three songs that feature features - see the world. With a two-hole holder package with sleeve and a small insertion, it is very well-priced for the amount of it. <br /> <br /> I come through a Rush fan at the end of the eighteenth year at the beginning of the seventeenth year and this DVD comes in large, highlighting the era of half-yearly exhibition. If you want to be surprised then I will not list songs. If you take part in the Vapor Trills tour, you will know what they will play. <br /> <br /> Here in Rio's biggest crowd, the game is filled with huge crowd. Indeed, I was one of the first things to notice that this show was clear about. Most of these two-hour concert, listen to you and watch the crowd, actively chanting and dancing music wildly. Initially, fans are happy to give a good response to Russia to see. But after a few songs, I heard that the band of crowd was no more. There is no slowdown in the Rio's rush. Their more power! It criticizes the DVD's final edit. <br /> <br /> which brings me to my second and main cause "I hate it". Video edit is terrible in my opinion. Save for multi-angle view bonus cuts, a frenzy of full-screen visual chaos. It wanted to look like the director how he could spastic it. I change the camera angle, mean, continuously, every one and four seconds! After about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. Which is very bad, because I liked to sit in the whole program, as I was able to concert last year. Maybe the latest frenzy for this fast-cut editing concert DVD, but I really think it's a bitter and frustrating experience. As said before, I will not feel it for songs or two, but the full visual aspect of this disc is fast, or RUSHed. This is really ironic, because I've been sticking to the scenes directly from Moving Pictures, all the concert clips that are mainly seen in the rush, with little switching. It's almost annoying, visually talking. This DVD took it to another extreme. I know many Died-In-the-Ul-Rush fans will strongly disagree with my statement, but this is only my opinion. <br /> <br /> The following line: If you are a fan fan, this review will be reviewed, or any other, regardless of the review. I bought it after reading my review. Do not just expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the above mentioned things will not bother you.
