Chops Shop Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart) wrote and directed. Baharani Nature's style has earned character-driven research in films, which are like young people every day, no one in New York actually sees. <br /> <br /> This is the people who are traveling around society. They are one of the kind in the gray world, many of them feel the American legal situation of immigrants somewhat suspicious. Where do they come from? How did they get there? How do they deal with? Where will they end? It does not look like a good story, but its most basic, story about survival in day-to-day levels. <br /> <br /> Alley is a street child. He teaches and teaches whatever he can, can save money, he is not moving towards small steals. Often he is concerned to be reunited with his older sister. We looked at him at the safe house early, but he had no successful success. A young friend, Carlos Shia receives a chop shop in shades of baseball stadiums. Finally his big sister comes to live with the site with him, but he is jealous in suspicious suspicions about the purpose of his friends and how he extra money. She dreamed of buying a food van and set up a vending business with her big sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrain shoots all her pictures everywhere. There's nothing shiny or glossed about them. As this life has this human life, raw. Late is not quite beautiful, but it is never bad, and the slightest frustrating wind hanging on most movies, hanging over the same person's daily life is the same. <br /> <br /> The script is very normal and offers plenty of room and room to work on characters. Polacco is outstanding in the original role, and Gonzalez gives strong support as an old sister.
