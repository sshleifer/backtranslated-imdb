Age can not ruin the beauty of this East-West love story for me. By ignoring the famous and lovely title song and its songs, what we have is a dramatic biography of eight great people, at one point of the time of the counter-water flow associated with social harmony, intensity, war, suspicion and great courage. As a backdrop in Hong Kong, this film tells the story of Eurasian doctors and American journalists who fall in love during the Korean War and fall. As Mark Elliott, William Holden is intelligent, lusty and somewhat weaker; Jennifer Jones may be perhaps the most perfect, suspicious, and excited, enthusiastic, and hesitant, like Han Suin. Others in the big cast are Toren Thatcher, Isabel Elsom, Murray Mattresson, Virginia Greg, Richard Lu, Soo Ying, Phillip Ahn, Zaza Cartite and Donna Martel; Many of the best oriental actors in Hollywood have played a small part of the strangers. John Patrick's script was followed closely by Han's fine novel; The direction by Henry King was always as difficult. The story's determination is how much Hannah was reluctant to love Eliot, how reluctant he was with his suspicious doubts about his busy and demanding schedule and his future; And how surprised they were, despite their helplessness and interference, their affair was known. The image is physically busy, attractive and often beautiful. The mountainous lovers who are going to separate, where they are swimming, the beautiful mountain is already busy and crowded with business towns, big social events, and on the streets against timing, hospital dome and traffic filled artery. Leon Shamroo's cinematography, Ben Nayyar makeup and Helen Tertin's hairstyles, decorating sets, sound and lighting, art department, and all of the great work, it should be one of the most memorable productions in a major non-American city. All the time, and capture on film is one of the most difficult. Nevertheless, the most remembered lovers here are not too young, lovers are facing conflicts and are evaluated exactly - after that the love and the conditions set out as obstacles are not in progress. The end of the matter is going back to Marc's war; Then Han received his letter, even he knew that he was dead. They think of messages from a good wold. A world where the optimists are optimistic, the value of admission in the world, and the warmth and summer on the winds of the mountains, and on a region where beauty and personal desires can be damaged, isolated by unfortunate or evil militant forces. Verily, love is a pretty fantastic thing, said Dr. Han; And this film has stood as one of the burning evidence of that theory, it is as beautiful as a pearl, smooth as a Chinese proverb and a smooth z-set against rough background.
