I do not understand how people can not like this movie. You have Gossit Jr., the main stand by the baby stand, Shane Astin, and many other great actors. Many of the movies and movies that you do not see in today's movies are fun. It's really a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underlying film among other great movies like Let's Harry. In the early '80s, a great movie has been created in the early 90's, which will not be topped by today's standards. <br /> <br /> They tried to restore the film to Masterminds, but it became smaller with some bad acting. This was not enough for Patrick Stewart to go to the movie.
