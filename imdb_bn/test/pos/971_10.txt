I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is false, but because of that he is called "big fat liar". Although this child goes to Hollywood, the kids do not give the idea that they can do it. Also, he does not do it for fun or to move away from something, he can trust again. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was just a big advertisement for Universal Studios, because of how I liked how it gave an indoor scene that does not like kids, who do not know how great it is to make movies. <br /> <br /> it has good music and funny characters. This family / comedy is equally fun for kids and parents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
