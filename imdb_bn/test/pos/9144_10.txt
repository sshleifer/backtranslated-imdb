As a terrible fierce fan, I left Vampire sub-continuity because of which most vampire flipes have become vampires, women become restless, intelligent, and basically weak. This attitude has brought me Solar's midnight vision and I say that the vampires of this movie are at least hungry to kill the old woman and sacrifice to the kids! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born in a charming vampire game with savage intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interests me is the central location of Borgo Hotel. This is a great reason (and I went back to my high school copy to see it) in Dracula, Borgou Pass where Jonathan Harker must go to find Dracula's castle. <br /> <br /> Finally, none of my caps closed decided to make genuine impact on animals and not a bathing CGI! This is a great thing about low-budget movies, many Hollywood monstrosities plague, which can not afford garbage computer effects on computers. <br /> <br /> The bottom line ... is definitely better than underword, especially if you are a vampire purest. Cheers, J.
