It is a mistake to mention a movie of this era as a horror film. Most of the early German films are not so awesome movies that they borrowed dark fantasy from the work of German Romantics like the EAAA Huffman and others. Firts Lang's "Dir Mood Todd" (since 1921), a young man takes away his boyfriend from death, but the fate of characters in Lang's film can not be consumed by behavior. Young lovers do not claim to die, but they can only meet death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The fate could be changed - And delayed death - through character choices. Although the scene of the collection of the soul of the Phantom Carriage is really cruel, these horror images of death have been compromised with great level compromise by offering the release of the genuine giant, David Hallam, a cruel drunk, because of the opposite hatred humanity, And emotional pain spreads. <br /> <br /> One New Year's Eve Holm was hit in a battle with a drink companion. Holm must be a driver of the phantom career due to the death of the first person in the midnight stroke and the soul must be collected in the new year. The Fantom Carriage is driven by an old acquaintance, who started Holly on the road to the rubble, came to his soul and took him on a self-discovery journey. Holm along with the way her lady and those awful people who tried to help her. Perhaps my disappointment with the film's end is based on a critique of Selma Lagerlof's novel which is film. But David Holm could not escape from his fate and saw his repentance that he was too late to get his wife separated from the poison of his two children and to suffer the consequences of his sin due to the consequences of his sin. Collect their soul. He was an appropriate punishment and an awesome more immense than the evidence of abuse inflicted on others. But the destiny of the film is not a destructive nature message; Is released. The driver of the car let Holm's soul go back to his body and he rescues his family at the right time. His repentance reminiscent of Scroog's "a Christmas carol". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If the effects of day-to-day are measured, special effects are surprised and still retained, as you consider when these double exposures were made inside a hand cranked camera. Also, Tavern's new DVD restored films look fantastic
