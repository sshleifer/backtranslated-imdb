This movie was clearly written with FF VII fans. I saw someone with a friend who did not play the original game and was a series fan. From a visual and technical perspective, this film is as good as "The spirits in", if not good, from the point of view of the story, I was pretty lost. There was a major conspiracy of standing in front of the scene where the Geostigma children were brought to the "reconciliation" of the "all" three genoviases healing. Everyone said that there were about 15 children ... Hmmm ... I thought that this GeostiGema was an epidemic of epidemic proportions ... I realized why they did this (time, budget, CPP), but it seems like Genova cells After explaining how to get genoes resurrected to collect all the genes of geno cells, Chasey explained. We received the subtitle version (some fan bands from the internet) this is a pretty straightforward translation and so maybe it has been added to my confusion. It printed my interest in FF VII, but I spent some of the time reading about main characters and plot in FF VII wikis. Once I read adventure wikis child, I know things much more. If you are a video game or a saifai fan, this movie is a good flick, but like the previous review it comes like a 90 minute battle scene. You may never know which of the characters and the story seems to be visually visible visually, although some explanation may be needed. Please kindly thank you for Wikipedia.
