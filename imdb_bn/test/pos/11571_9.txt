This cartoon was first promoted after 2005 and 15+ years. I have not seen it seriously or closely in almost 10 years. Now I am an adult at the age of 30, when I see the episodes again I can look back with a serious eye. <br /> <br /> According to the idea, the cartoon partially respects classical lonely tunes, but its own original show. There are several episodes of old cartoons. For example, a singer who attacks Buster and so he just revenge on this singer's concert revenge - like the old bug Bunny cartoon. The upcoming cartoon is just like a lonely tune in a different era. If you look at old lonely tunes, they worked a lot like a lot of tiny tones. Old lonely tunes have created many social commentaries and parodies. There were celebrity impersonations. There was a lot of curiosity, taunts and dialogues. The comedy was surreal and surprise. You can just say this for tiny tones as well. Comedy styling is 'the same spiritually'. Certainly frustrating for the classics which were not working well in the cartoons few decades ago, obviously disappointing. We can recognize cultural references in tiny tunes and when we do not like something we can roll our eyes. But we do not think that lonely tuneds have dried because we were not living in 40 percent. Also, lonely tunes were real in those days, but today the cartoons are restored over over. So it is easy to understand tiny tunes in a harmful light due to our exposure to current events and generally due to our odds in cartoons. <br /> <br /> There are differences in many cases - time, delivery, and of course show duration. From two different stages they are working in two different styles, two very different situations - Lonely Tune is being created for theater in the theater and small tones are being created for TV watching kids. Even, they create an original show with the original Gaga and give the patterning even after the comedy styling of old lonely tunes and work well. <br /> <br /> As little tones were with much more time to play, they had some real moments of great animated inspiration. You just have to look at the episode of the baby plagioma episode from 1 minute to 3. There are many more. For example, any of the best comedy dialogue exchanges are animated in one thirteen when Bab and Buster are on a split screen phone, hoping everyone misses each other. Malicious sights Significantly, the development of the character of this episode, and in most cases (usually Dana Oliver or Sherry Stoner's writings) is rather good. The female characters are taken seriously as personalities and improvements, the reverse that is often considered abnormal is true for cartoons of those times. <br /> <br /> It was the first modern cartoon that has many pop culture-referential and self-referential humoras. It was the way forward ahead of her time. Tiny tunes have opened a door for real cartoons such as today's classic jokes, but instead we have endured a boring old world like 80s kids. Yes, I like transformers and thundercutts, but small tunes completely move away from them. It was a breath of fresh air. Bachashi's Space Adventure is a pioneer of new adventures of the mouse, but this real style of mini-toons comedy cartoon created style to write a real success. <br /> <br /> As a child I completely disregard some joke. For example, respect for Marx Brothers in one episode that I completely disregard as a teenager. Now I have a new honor for it. There are so many inspired gags that I have never seen that really bright. This is the kind of comedy I think of Lonny Tunnes and Family Guy. I ever noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking about the most recent episodes I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you see this show you will notice these things. Here are the opinions of some other critics I have been wrongly examining, I have seen all the episodes and thought them well, open them both as a child and adult. <br /> <br /> You can say a terrible lot of care with very voice acting. I'm not just talking about main characters, but the side letters are really good and creative done. But towards the main characters, some original characters were bright. Trace McNeil, in my opinion, his best performance in this cartoon. She has not been the same since. Rob Pulseen also did some incredible things here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was plenty. It was very medium ones. But till then it was indeed interesting fun facts. Especially when it was first publicized, it was really fun. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, I gave showers to 8.5 and broke the door for pushing the leaflet and moving the cartoon towards the new era.
