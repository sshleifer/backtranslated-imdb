Yes !! They finally got it down to perfection. What is a refreshing exploitation epic for Generation-X, it's a great idea, whether they do not know or not. After the disaster like Sgt. Getting drunk by Kabukemann, NYPD and Blockbuster, our hero Lloyd Kaufman just goes for him, the distributors agree to stop feeding and tromo trumpet. Lloyd will make this one the most unreasonable, weird and cruel trumpet film. During this time, Lloyd accepts Shakespeare's love story, turns it inside, trimmizes it, and adds value to long, lost, entertainment that is always lacking. Entertainment prices, such as Lemi Kilmister (narrator), Debbie Rokon (cooking), Joe Flaisecker (fat guy), and of course, brutal distortion and toilet humor. Tromeo and Juliet are rather a brutal story, and the definitive version of Troma universe crown gems. <br /> <br /> Years ago, in Tromaville, NJ business partner, Monty Kui and Cap Capulet started a film company called Silky Films, which would produce the supposedly flavored, soft-core film. Monty considers her friend Cape, but the caps are out of the company screwing out her poor sucker out. On paper, and books, it seems that Monty has freed his life. In the mid-90's, we have two families, who have become very dissatisfied with each other, that is, they are looking for a reason to take only one organ, or especially a life. A son of Monty, Tromso, nephew, Beni, with his friend, Marie Martini, who is very much excited about the wage wars of all the harmful, harmful capitals in Montgour, apart from Monty, he is very careful. Just like the real, there is a confusing situation, which makes Tromoe fall for the caps' daughter, she never met or did not even know about it. Unfortunately, the cap is an audacious distortionist, who does not have to break Tromio's father, there is a thing for the bottle, and of course, the parents of little mother-in-law Shensho are physically, mentally tortured, and persecuted and put in the Plexiglaus cage. Depends on the mood of a mood cap. The cap forced her vegetarian girl to marry Arunabak in London, who is a millionaire Butcher, who does not make anyone uncomfortable, with or without brown bread. With all these inconvenience, young lovers think that the best decision will be the best decision, but how will this impact be bigger? It may or may not be true, but it can not be seen how it ends, so you will never see it. <br /> <br /> "One with Leo" sleeping sleeping compared to tromo and juliet, but if watered down, too guided, big budget, Hollywood, Garbage you have been programmed to do, by all means, go for it , But if you're in a mood to do something more colorful, something that really packs a punch and does not follow the pattern of "normal" film, and if your humorous If you hate the idea babhabika just can not be in this movie. Tromeo and Juliet give mainstream all that finger. Full Explosion Exploitation with some radioactive humor like young John Waters. Along with some bad acting, Tromso and Juliet have a sharp score that includes legendary motors, and there is no mention that James Gunn has many inputs, which really brings it together. For more extraordinaryness from James Gunn, check out Lolivolov, and for further excellence of Lloyd Kaufmann, see his next perspective, Terrorism Firear Tromeo and Juliet brought us by one of the priceless exploitation of irony, and only the B-movie, King. Thank you, Lloyd. 10/10
