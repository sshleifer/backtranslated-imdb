I saw this film on A & E channel this past weekend. Mystery was right, I can not guess the culprit before the end. But I enjoy the mystery and the characters and their development a lot. Some of these were a mystery that was edited by Georges Reichthaith, astonishing Michael Fassbander and George's cousin Susanah. Actually, the story of those two characters is asking me to know more. From what I tried to do for Agatha Christie's book of the same title, I think this picture did not follow this letter. Very good performance by the actors, especially Fassbender and Kara / partner who played the female.
