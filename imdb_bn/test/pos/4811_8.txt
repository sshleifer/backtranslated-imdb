I've recently seen a Jhanan. It was not a Hong Kong movie, because I was looking for a change from the movies made here in the US. According to my modest opinion, I believe that this movie can easily compete against action thrillers except Hong Kong's traditional statues. That still bothers me, it was the main inspector character. I still can not understand despite serious characters from Hong Kong even in complete stupid-smiling-relief-nature, but if the film is good I can stay with it. Characters are not trusted even if they are. The story is fast paced and really sucks it on you. The real scene for me was the scene of the two buses of the character of the thief. Overall, a really solid film.
