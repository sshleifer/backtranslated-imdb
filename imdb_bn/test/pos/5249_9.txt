This is an extraordinary movie musical instrument. Before Rodriguez died in 1999, I was scared that I had the chance to live. She learns that she performs an incredible Lincoln City. The concert was in 1991 and I could stay there, but words were not painful outside. <br /> <br /> I bought my first Amalia recording. The musical recording is fantastic, though, seeing this film in his face and his extraordinary expressiveness and passion as he is terribly depressed singing this song is wonderful. Mary's face looked like she had surgery on Jesus. Seeing him in the film, I reminded Mercedes Sosa of Lincoln Citro in the mid-1990s to testify about the wonderful concert performance. I was sitting on listening to the music of Mercedes, I thought I was in the presence of great spiritual and musical instruments, including a great primitive force. Musical portions of "The Art of Amalia" are touching, such as Kato Velsso, paying tribute to Amalia and singing one of her in front of the packed concert hall. Musical instruments also show incredible international shoe of its musical exhibition and its built bonds. Fans around the world She is a segment in which she claims she has played in every single city in Italy, where there is a stage! <br /> <br /> Another section, Amlia said her bit. Mouth cancer and how he came to NYC to commit suicide in a hotel. Still, by looking at the videos of Fred Astaire, he slowly meant to mean that life was alive and away from his own life. Amazing! Later in the film he admits in a bold and direct interview that although he won worldwide worldwide, his personal life was pure sadness. He admitted that he was never happy. Sorry for listening to this unbearable, but w completely. A singer steeped in fado (which he translated as "bad luck" or "bad luck"). Also, it took a long time to hear more about his personal life: Was it so sad? What was his frustration? <br /> <br /> "The Art of Amalia" is a little disappointing in other major areas. My quibbles: To show 20-30 full songs in the film, yet an English translation for the last only seems to translate waste (unless not only a Portuguese-speaking audience, which I can imagine) intended for. He does not see deep pain on his face as he sang and understand the song a lot down. For other damages: There is almost no living material about Amalia's family background. There is one 20 seconds. Dr. Snippet His song c His mother (this is absolutely grand) There is a brief reference to moving his parents fr. In the countryside of Lisbon I liked to see the footage of the village film from there. They are almost completely wired as such interviews. Amalia herself (and some close friends) herself. He is not a good, but great thing. Experts from Fuudo or Portuguese culture and society are not subject to any interviews, so we do not understand the depth of its music roots. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a fantastic movie that everyone is interested in Amalia. But it's not a perfect or definitive job on the subject.
