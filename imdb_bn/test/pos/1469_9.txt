The 'Down to South Park' is going to interview with the South Park about 1 hour long documentary, Tray Park and Matt Stone and those working in South Park. It is not true here, it shows the history of South Park and what it takes for an episode. It is basically behind the scenes scene. It shows different stuff made in South Park (it was actually the comedy center that it reveals). It also shows controversy caused by South Park. It shows lots of fun clips from the show. This is a fairly interesting documentary. A fan of South Park will have to check it out. You can find it on YouTube <Br /> <br /> 9/10
