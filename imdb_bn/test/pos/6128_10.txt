My 10/10 rating course will only be applicable if you are willing to make a full and complete payment. Because you know only John Waters can do this. "Pink Flamingos" (his director debut), he portrays two families locked in war, that the most dirty person could be alive. At the end of the Divine Famine, most of the questions answer most. But far away from it, the movie will basically imagine that anyone would imagine more people than they would imagine. You had a very strong stomach to watch this movie. Even a few lines are rather mind-blowing. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, you will have Ebola virus to avoid this movie!
