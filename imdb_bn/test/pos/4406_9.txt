Anyone suddenly spend hours driving around the backstreets of north London as an attempt to avoid the awful intensity, this film urgently appeals. At the end of the 70's, what was in my interest like London and the basis of your TV version of the sky! The picture tick all the right boxes on the paper, and only the "knowledge" of the original film must end without exceeding my high expectations. Apparently, I was looking at how different London was (I lived in Islington in the 90's, land was converted a long time later). It really came across as a grimy, tatty and down-by-hill. London may still have bad housing estate, but the general feeling of this place is now clear, bright and happy (based on what this movie shows than my own memories). <br /> <br /> In the story and acting, the good top marks definitely go to Nigel Hawthorne as vampires. Absolutely awesome! He deliberately worked unexpectedly, unnerve the boys of knowledge as the total straight-facing intensity and changes in surreal mindgames puts him through examination after knowledge testing. <br /> <br /> All this was a wonderful, thoroughly enjoyable trip I find that endlessly fascinating to return to a very specific time and place. But in 1979 you are not particularly interested in London, but you still enjoy the following "Wicked" dialogue and favorite characters.
