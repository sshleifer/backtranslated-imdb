This picture is one of my favorite childhood memories. Muppets of Hollywood, singing and dancing titles (at the height of their popularity), Miss Piggy, her favorite lover, Kimit, is doing her best work as manager of Fuji Beer, and is going to be an "extra" "Akki Ducky" for a movie. <br /> <br /> Cameritt's boring Yukel number "Rainbow Connection" was nominated for Oscar for that year, but he was defeated by Narma Roy's "I Gos Like It Goes". I will choose kimriti song sometime! Get kids and enjoy this timeless imagination ... some day they will get it, sunny connection, boyfriend, dreamer and I!
