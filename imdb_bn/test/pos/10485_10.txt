This silent and neutral Danish movie is the best example of the film, and if a person exists, who can see the banquet of Babette without touching the very basic level, they do not know a person, <br /> <br / > <br /> The story is quite simple. In the 1800s, two elderly women (Birgett Federpil and Bodeil Caraar) lived in remote shieldlands, where they sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities and personal happiness to continue their long-term father's religious ministry in order to live their long life. . One of the youngest of the women is a French woman, Babette (Stefan Adran), whose husband and son died in France and he escaped his fate, so that he did not fulfill the same fate. Though they do not really need her services, sisters cook her as a maid and cook - and pass her cleverness over the years, and the unreasonable effort on their behalf enables the elderly to stay together and sisters get more comfort from them than the myths; Indeed, the whole village admire and depend on it. <br /> <br /> One day, Dad received a letter: He won a lottery and now on the village level, a rich woman His new resource means returning to France means that sisters feel that their desire is to allow them and their small group members to prepare real French cuisine. It is served in food and in the evening, which is actually a night to remember - but not for the expected reasons, the festival of Babet proved to be both body and soul, and finally the gift of love for women was in him and the villagers who were so kind to him. <br /> <br /> This picture is extraordinary, extraordinary in every way, yet not extraordinary in their presentation in detail. Along with the film's progress, we are thankful to God for their general devotion and the common fame of all their people and the scenes that Babet prepares his banquet and that which is eaten are strong, beautiful, and incredible memorable. There are a number of films that have been used as metaphor for love, but some do not communicate with the beauty and beauty of Babbet's fest, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and proves food for both body and soul. Very, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, Ur GFT, Amazon Reviewer
