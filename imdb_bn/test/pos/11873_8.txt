I must admit, I liked this movie, and it did not find all the misogynist. It can be subtitled, there are three ways to view LV Tyler Three different men became horrified with the same woman and described their stories in different letters; A man (John Goodman) tells the story of his priest (which is very funny Richard Jenkins). For GoodDance Chargers, the character of Leiv Tyler comes from the ideal Saint, the second child, Theresa. For the role of Paul Reisers (who has a narrow story story (great, great role of Revo McIntyre), the character of Levi Tyler makes sex fantasy available, until finally Matt Dillons tells the story of a drunken Douglas story next to a story of a small charter. It has been said, and everyone has been entertained. Finally, this movie is a wonderful fun festival At the end. I will not give away.
