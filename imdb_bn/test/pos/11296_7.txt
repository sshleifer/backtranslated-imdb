If Wal-Mart does not have a great DVD version for a dollar, I made it beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image was syndicated locally as a serial in a small series. For children, in the early 60s, TV stations show that almost every station on the weekends at noon - "Mr. Bill and Bozo", "Monty Gang" (Channel 4, Greenville SC) and "Captain Grandi" (Channel 13, Ashville NC - Where I saw it). It has repeatedly made such impression that I have seen it in Wall Street today and grabbed it. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You must have it.
