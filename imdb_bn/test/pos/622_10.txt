This is a very good movie. I give it 10. <br /> <br /> It is very different that it walks through a long way. The main character is silently used in the story. <br /> <br /> She shows a kill (for a snap-movie) and decides to run it (it takes quite a bit time). I will not publish the rest of the film because it will ruin the experience, but rest assured: it is very credible, well played, very intense and has some wonderful surprises and a great ending. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie.
