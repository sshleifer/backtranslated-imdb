When I was young, it was one of my favorite shows. It was all - chuckling music, stories, a talking lane, and daisies. I wanted to sing a whip song and be one of the swinging on a swing. I'm 35 years old and I grew up in Jersey, but our three New York channels got our Kephuks hook up, and I think it was at Channel 11. They just do not do such a show (I know that it's really old word by creating it), and it seems to me that I grew up with just 9 channels on our TV, but I can always look a bit cool to see. I just saw this show and saw those who talked to another person. She was three years younger than me, and she grew up in northern jersey. I like watching this series DVD, so I could show it to my 5-year-old daughter, and she could see that her miracle (but great) thing is seen! I found a VHS tape in some episodes and music CDs from the show in Ebay, and I bought them though they were a little valuable. I can not wait to get them to revive the great memories!
