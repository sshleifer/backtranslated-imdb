It was one of the best signals around and very good movies, even some were wrong, but I still enjoyed it. During this time, Charles did not fight just one or two muggers but made them an entire army. There's a lot of awesome scenes from Death Wish 3 and I've enjoyed every single moment of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to handle this good music director like Jimmy Page, and producer Golan and Globus are still doing something and Charles Branson is still performing well for Paul Carchers. It looks like Michael Meth Wish is trying to finish the series and I can not blame him and I like Charles using the song. Death Wish 3 is one of the great films of 1985 and it can not get any better than this. <br /> <br /> I am 9/10
