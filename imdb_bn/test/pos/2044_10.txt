I love this picture ...! I saw it in DVD 1000 X and I could not say enough about it. It has all, comedy, awesome action and incredible stunt / FX. Samuel Jackson stole the show at the big time. I do not think he is a moment that he is not funny! "Everyone knows that when you make a guess, you make an ass from you and donkey" !! FX is great! Bridge / truck explosion is unbelievable, even though the word is not so big! When Samuel comes out of the truck, the word seems a little less and what he says is invaluable !!! For those of you who own it DVD, keep the audio in French !!! It's funny !!! When the bad guy Sam's / Charlie's daughter invented her, the mental moments are great, it's a great movie ... It's a great movie that can not work without a fan fan ... I can also find Cutthroat Island ... the worst promotion , It kicks !!!!
