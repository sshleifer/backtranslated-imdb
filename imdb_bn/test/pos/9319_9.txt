Yes, I give it a 10 because I do not compare it to others, rather today it is known as "popular culture" which is destroying today's day. On the other hand, it has been said, on the other hand, it has been said that the film has been nicely thrown and gives us a very good look at popular theaters in the late 18th and early 20th century. There is no small incident that many plays that have played in Walcott include similar plots: The boy fills the girl with something, (usually the father or the image of some authority) the boy struggles, the boy conquers the girl. In fact at the time was known as "Chauncey Olcott Law". Any event, very loud, John Ford managed one. He said, "people silently." And, "My Wild Irish Rose," itself is a "law of Chauncey Olcott." Great stuff, no? However, great songs, great elements. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> After watching the film I'd like to know more about the bill scanning. I think he has left "Mawvorin" because of the madness. (In the picture, replaced by Chunsi Olock) and after a few years he died on a shelter. But he was Appenalty, a great star on his right, who wrote songs and plays and wrote plays for him. <br /> <br /> Who knows?
