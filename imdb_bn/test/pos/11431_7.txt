Based on the best-selling novel "The Dismissal", The Missing Star, the latest film of acclaimed Italian director Jiani Amelio, is a growing friendship between an ancient Italian maintainer and a young interpreter from Shanghai who has recruited his story through China. Vinsenjo Bonnovolinta is a steel mill maintenance manager in Italy who has been shut down and sold to the Explosion Factories China. Vinceenzo (Sergio Castilla) discovered that a control unit in the reactor is faulty and potentially dangerous, he travels to China where steel mills are found where this part was sold to prevent a fatal accident. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the film is not known about travel, which uses familiar contacts and on that journey, we have a fascinating look of Luca Biggei in China, with all its beauty and complexity in China's fascinating appearance. This film takes us to Shanghai, Wahan, Chongqing, Batu and shows a trip along the Yangtze River which shows our coastal areas, which shows that three garbage dams are completely flooded in a Chinese mega-project, resulting in a displacement of 1.2 million people. This trip faces face to face with poverty, face-to-face housing, and other children to save for themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around the relationship between Vinceenzo and translator Liu Hua (So Ling). Italy, where her obscurity with her translation at dinner meetings loses her job. When he tracks him down under Shanghai, he is working in the library and resistant to Vinsenjo's approach. Looking at his offer to help him on his trip to China, a little more than a good salary, he voluntarily agrees to accompany him. However, as their relationship goes from town to town, their interpretive skills prove that Vinceeno is not used to fool people who do not use cell phones. <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> <br /> They are confused about each other's weaknesses and the film is in their past and present life and how they reached their present position. We saw Liu's son Lynn Wang in his grandmother's house. In China's child policy, he is one of the unwelcome children who "kept secret" since the boy's father had left the family. Although interviews between Vinsenjo and the boy are casual, how the story is played has become its center. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kastelito is an outstanding actor (though this is a long-term for Enrico Lo Vero in this role). However, he is emotionally distant throughout the film, his expression changes very far away from the Hangward expression. Although Taing Ling highlights the role in this role, his relationship with the old Vincesoon does not seem to me real and the ending seems to exist only in a reality known as the movie. Even though Amelio is one of my favorite directors, the House is coming to great wells, Misty Star is a disappointment.
