Unlike previous posters, I like celluloid treatment. It looked good, and made the movie even more enjoyable. To me, it did not completely cut off from the content of the documentary. In fact, I felt the pain of feeling that I lose myself more in content. The previous poster style was justified to compare the trade of Nike; It definitely has that look. But for my taste, it really did a great job (and I'm far from a fan of Nike advertising). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, documentary film should be made. I can not wait to see the next installment from these committed filmmakers.
