For many years, there are some films which only slip and rarely see anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the 15-year-old boy. This is a handsome nephew of the politics (about 17 years old) who is a 15-year-old boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Some unfinished facts of the above paragraph have happened, so the picture is, and the one that I appreciate, we will not get all the information, the rest of our own thoughts. You'll hear this logical creation dialogue. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is a little unclear, another thing to think about viewers <br /> <br /> <br /> < > Alex D. Linz, our 15-year-old, was 17 years old when he was making this film, but could easily be small. He was on film and TV since his childhood, he is a very good actor and a very strong believer. <br /> <br /> <br /> Eshar Holayer's older son, this role is his first major part and he is also excellent <br /> <br /> <br /> Now I am the best writer / Director, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A big thumbs up for a first attempt. I hope he has a long career with our two sons as well. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDB 8 (out of 10)
