Le Cirque Rouge of Jean-Pierre Melville follows the life of two criminals: Vogel (Jiaean Maria Volontte), a murderer who slips during the transfer of police from one city to another. And Corrie (Allen Dellon), a thief just released from prison. Fate decided to join these two men to stop pulling a spectacular hijst. In the background there are Mati (André Berwick), Detective Vogel is stuck in his escape and sometimes ruthless in his way. Along with the film, visitors also meet other minor but striking characters, among them the best Jansen (Yevs Montand), a disgraced former police and an excellent Marcman. <br /> <br /> Melville has a unique style that nobody does. There is no need to watch many movies to catch him. Le Samourai, U Fleck and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made of the same cloth: the equivalent angle; Long shots; Silence; Coats and hats and cigarettes; Quotation at the beginning; Amazing heists, fatalism; Curious and immoral criminal life. Everything that's great in Melville is present in the top form. <br /> <br /> And its flaws have not troubled me at this time: the unreasonable, confusing behavior of my characters and the confusing story, which hit my joy. Her other movies, here are almost invisible. Before the Le Cirical Rule Un Fleck, which means he can not better explain the time; Perhaps I'm using it more and have reached a mentality where it will not bother me anymore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Melville created a unique crime movie. As soon as they are, they show more efficiency, reality and grace than modern technology-thrillers, where cold sticks are used by computer systems and James bond-escrow gadgets are used to stop improper crimes. Melville's criminals are not cool: they are lonely, socially painful and probably aware that they are not much better than planners. They are unwanted in society, live at night, they know that they will eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly for such a movie, the idiots are not complete with the police. Mother smart, clever, patient and even sympathetic. She does not have a villain or cliché unlike, she's just doing an old man doing his job and doing it right. He knows when to use the power and when to use the brain. Many movies can learn from him. <br /> <br /> It is down-to-earth, overwhelming style that makes Melville's films happy and puts them in special sheets as one of the film's greatest offenders.
