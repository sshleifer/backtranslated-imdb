This movie was never considered as a big budget movie, but it was a cute photo that anyone can enjoy. This will probably not change your life, but it is certainly impressive and engaging. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Quiffton Web is playing a Karmusan (which is certainly not new). However, his rating failed and he worried about the cancellation. So he decided that he is out of touch with the kids - because he and his wife have no one to own. So, he is volunteering as a scoutmaster and is doing this job almost immediately! Remember, she does not like an ugly and especially kids. To do something bad, one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. How unselfish she works towards the child, the child just wants to spend time with her! The child is intelligent and almost all shows show! <br /> <br /> What happens next and the movie twists and turn something that you have to find out for yourself. Understand that this is not a light, cute and yet closing movie that you'll probably enjoy.
