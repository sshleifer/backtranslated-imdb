Then Aamir respects Rahim Khan (Shan Tib), his father's best friend, who expressed the desire to be a writer. After winning Amir's competition, Hasham managed to bring Amir's stomach, but he was raped and raped by the brutal Asaph (Elham Ehsas) on the empty street for the protection of Amir's stomach; Kishor Amir is a witness to the attack but does not help loyal lover. On the day after the birthday, Amir hid his new watch in Hashem's bed to reveal his son as a thief and to compel him to fire his father, his conscience and conscience revealed his conscience and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians attacked Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escaped from Pakistan. In 1988, he had a normal life at the camera framante, when Amir graduated in a public college for the pride and joy of his parents. Later, Amir met Patriot Swaite (Atta Lenny) and they got married. After the death of his father in 2000, Amir received a famous novelist and phone call from Tirmin, Rahim Khan, who revealed secret information about his family, forced Aamir to return to Peshawar in Pakistan on the liberation war. <Br> <br /> I am not familiar with Afghan culture and despite my daughter's recommendation I did not read this novel, and yesterday I decided to watch this movie as a DVD. With a brief insight into the peaceful days of the 70-present day with the Taliban in recent history of Afghanistan, I have found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and liberation. Actors and actresses have great performance, providing credibility to realistic stories. The picture that we see in Afghanistan on TV from the dry location of Afghanistan, withdrew from it. In the end, I got a good movie "The Kite Runner". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Cassandra de Pipa" ("Kite Chess")
