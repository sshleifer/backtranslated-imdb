I thought it was the most interesting movie that JCVD ​​had worked for a long time. I like his character and the whole thing with the rabbit sets a different tone for this movie. IMHO, JCDV is really going to be something going forward. A little more light heart, some respect for other movies, mixed with some great fights ... I want to see more of this style of filmmaking from him. The other poster was once a desperado rip off the scene. I am immediately Rodriguez saw the connection, but it was too tricky and I want to see the film again to look more delicate cues from another movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not like it at first, but I I think it was interesting because it gave us a little bit of balance that we did not expect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director is offered to do a job. Studio boss and want the product that they want. Very few directors have a final final cut on a film. In this case, JCVD ​​genius and the only reason anyone is watching this image. I'm sure he got a film that he's happy. I knew a little about the story of those who work in a post house who is a relative. Prizebali, director works and distributes the film in its cut. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... Then JCVD ​​and Studio edited this image. These things happen all the time. He saw the final cut (which he did not claim) and his "fine talent" pride was severely hit because they hated his distribution. If this director was smart, he should have given credit properly.
