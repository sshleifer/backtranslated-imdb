My problem like Finn is that most of the film's actors are in every Finnish film. I think there are five actors like Finland. I think if you are not from Finland, you really love this movie as a new innovation. <br /> <br /> This film is about a terrible chain that strongly affects some people. Alcoholism, cold climate, and darkness can all be clich√©s, but today they are still very real in this Finnish society. Many people in Finland suffer sadness, especially during winter. <br /> <br /> The sound of this movie is very annoying. I've enjoyed it and the Louhimes' instruction was again very difficult. I liked this movie a lot, the only negative thing is that you have seen the same face that you have seen repeatedly.
