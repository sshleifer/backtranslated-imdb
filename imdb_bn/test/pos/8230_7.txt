I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. Although some of them are surprisingly cleaned (such as the most western of the era), its simple distribution and style really showcase movies in a classic and near-classic status. This picture still illustrates another example of real-life exploitation after the death of Western Heroes (in this case, Bat Masters), this film works well due to its excellent supplementary characters. One Robert Ryan has always been a strong performer - a wonderful actor who has forgotten almost sad today. The other is the universal Gabbi Hayes, who played his best role as Crusty and a very colorful deputy. He is more enjoyable compared to his many supporting roles for Roy Rogers and John Wein. In most cases, his section has been written more well and has been given to do more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some people are people who spread rumors to smugglers on the locals and work for a gracious (Scott) to restore peace and kill Wilheln. However, how the plot is implemented is much better than the average and hence the film is still fun. Just do not expect complete innovation or uniqueness - unless you just want to see Gabe Haes's best performance.
