When "Madam" decides to give his cat his successor it spells trouble. Snubber Butler Edgar in the next line to decide to get rid of the kittens In this way the story may start and the cats can do such an adventure that otherwise would not be impossible. An expedition that makes them appear charming, but not completely credible cat O'Malley. Unintentionally happy he finally helped them through many dangerous and funny situations. <br /> <br /> The power of this film is his humor and his music. Adger is simply dissatisfied, the humiliated Butler who is out to score the scores, and of course he beat himself seriously. One of the best scenes was followed by two lapets and Napoleon two dogs. The score is superb and your view of "jungle book" is almost "musical" which is not the scene of the scene, and the focus allows the audience to express themselves through the plays. And of course, we want the score to be quite a jazzi. <br /> <br /> And of course it's not just me, who loves my children too <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
