Black Water is a thriller that completely exceeds its limitations (an indie flick) which continually leads to strong prospects emerging as an acute experience. <br /> <br /> All good animal-centric thrillers, such as the gaus, the original cat person's edge, agents know that restraint and what is shown are not the best way to pack a punch. Performance is real and convincing, Kumirodil has done a great job, in fact if the Black Waters website is believed, then it uses real cracks and the location of swimming is fabulous. <br /> <br /> If you are after B-grade Gore Fest Koch romp forget black water but if you want a cute, suspenseful journey that you fear water and I do wondering what trees that trees were if I were then It must be seen.
