I do not know what I can expect from this very popular (and ridiculous) Swedish comedy and satirical group, as the film released its first feature. The more ridiculous? Well, we have four contemporaries, especially memorable family troubles, generation gap and parental specialties. But it plays drama, thanks, and plays! His epic of Epic, each episode is carefully selected from different geographies of Sweden. However, each story can carry the whole film seriously, if it is expanded separately. <br /> <br /> It is dark, twisted, heroining, but it is widely used in a recreational and exciting execution. Scripts, acting and cinematography seem to get the perfect world class, three hours into such a glimpse! It has four shadows of skill, and is easily one of the best films in the country's film history. This is the answer to "Short Cuts" or "Magnolia" of Sweden, if you want and immediately equals them! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 out of Ojjep
