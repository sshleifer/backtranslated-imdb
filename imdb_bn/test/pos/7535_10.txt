I think this movie is underrated. To me it felt like a fresh air balloon. Some people question the uncertainty of the plot, the growing order and the lack of sex (afterwards, I believe, "uncertainty" is the main reason and no drunk kids are talking dirty?); But this is not their thing, and if they are not related to the story then it is good for them. Performance is great; I really want to see more of the other movie actors. Emotions are genuine. The whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety. And hopefully you get a good movie gives you breathtaking feeling.
