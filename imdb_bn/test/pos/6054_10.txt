If I buy this and buy "thirty seconds on Toyko" today. I watched this movie after seeing Jack Web's big billboard in his dress blues at Highway at the age of 12. Always admire the Jack Web as the John Wayne type and American. Often this movie became a marine due to it, but instead it was served for 32 years in Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Army Reserve. The movie did not watch on the TV and it liked to like it on DVD itself. At least if it's on TV, I'll copy it to VHS and use it until it is available on the DVD. I have a large collection of WWII and Korean War movies and always look for new releases in DVD.
