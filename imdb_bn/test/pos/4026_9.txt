Valeria, an elegant and beautiful young lady lives in a world surrounded by her shyness and depression walls. Although she may have a boyfriend in one night or if she is with him, it does not make any difference to being alone. Valeria is also an enthusiastic woman who can take steps at the same time that a special women, Massimo, as well as fear that she can answer her questions with a "yes", "no" or "I do not know". . The loneliness of the character is amazing in the way. Messimo and Valeria take a coffee in the same room, separated by subtle sections and without distinction between each other. I can mention several sections, however, it is good to see the movie. It is useful to see an impressive subject that is not controlled by the director. Although all actions take place at a slow pace, there is no special effect on the sound, but only good acting and sensitive stories are needed. I love it
