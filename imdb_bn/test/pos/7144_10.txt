In the mid-50's, Levi's life was a very loyal presentation. Followed with his colleagues, the theology and rebellion dialogue were very good. Michael White's book, "CS Lewis: The Creator of Narnia", this time deals very closely with the frame. Josh Ackland's performance was fantastic to catch the wonderful Lewis. The film has taken a great deal of pain in the right English setting. "Jake" (his favorite name) was the first time between Luis and Douglas Gresham to develop a strong bond between Joy's son. The film "Werney" Luis (Jack's older brother) had avoided avoiding the annoying elements of the water problem, but it did not move the story, so it was released well.
