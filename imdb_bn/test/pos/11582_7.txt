I just saw Ardentro of Marie and felt that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia can be a difficult subject in any case and unfortunately sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many are angry about the nice cast and its beautiful imagery / camera work. Of course Javier Bardem is an actor who made some extra for each film he made. Not saying that he considers the true Sampredo to be the least silly because I do not think any critics personally know the Sampredo. Although still used and used in a certain charm an acting skill that performs well does not constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem only does what he does ... and even that. The camera-work is beautiful and expresses the feelings and perspectives that the movie itself is unable to provide. Here, Sampordo has been shown as a man who binds so much to death that he has left behind his loving family and is married to a woman when he will not help others to find a dignified death. Now I do not have to say anything here or happiness. The problem is that movies such as comments you can avoid it early. The film is so strong that you are often forced to discuss the issue. I found this to be a weakness for the film - undoubtedly - depicting the sampredo as an unfavorable character. Anybody who is very smart then not "get" guided towards her double-layered poem that illustrates in her family simple cousin. Anyone who leaves a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is unknown. According to the film, a scene related to a female lawyer concludes a "wrong" choice in Dementia remotely so that it means that the choice of the sampler was correct. The woman who constantly finds her, almost despises the beautiful lawyer, but suddenly Saimredo married her and she died. These choices make Samprered in a math image, it does not matter that Birdmom portrays him. Argumentative I would say that it does not believe strongly, and I think Amenobar did not wish to add this incompatible material to his film. For a young director it is still an impressive film and it certainly has its strong moment (for example discussion between Pastor and Sampredo). The camera-work is impressive and the film is well-liked. But 10 out of 10 ... no film can reach that superiority.
