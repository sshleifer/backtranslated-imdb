I'm not a golf fan in any way. The film began with a scene at the end of the 1800s at 10:30 am on 26 May. I like the old movie but not golf, in the first scene a little boy (Harry Warden) wakes up by the voice of the men. He went out to find out what he was doing and was told that he was going to create a golf ... So, I stopped the television but some excited me and came back again. The movie is excellent. We now see this young man a man now; Professional artistic golf player who is deceived with the outlook from his childhood. Then we complete the realistic focus of film Francis and the decisions that make them fit for golf. You meet his mother and father, who is so clear in this period that he wants to protect him from class things. Then Eddie helped Lowie win his enthusiastic words and a little pushing Francis. Do not want to give too much. I was up to 2 AM Please see this super movie.
