I'm sorry, but I can not help it, I love seeing iron eagles. Now, do not misunderstand me, I'm not saying this is a great movie. No, rather, I will make it that it is an endless recreational movie. Due to not being in reality, there is a point missing to cut the film into pieces. Of course the iron eagle's plot was ridiculous. But I believe the target audience had children, and I was sure when I was young I found this cool. Now I just find it pleasing as criminal, the Road House like Kinda. This movie is part of the Great Pantheon of the 80s, for the children's acceptable-adult-energy-structure films. You must d. A.R.Y.L.L, Real Genius, E.T. Remember etc. If you ask me, the price of the DVD is shown only by showing Doug and Notator "Side Journey". That whole order was so stupid! But, at the same time, it's ridiculous, funny, perfectly 80's, all the best things. So the bottom line, Iron Eagle is a great 80's guilty pleasure. Hair style, dance, music, dialogue, fun as it is all hell I have an iron eagle in my DVD and it was the best buy for me at 9.99 dollars. If you love to laugh at dates, comedy action movies, it must be seen in one. Oh yeah, and I think its plot was the 1986's other combat pilot action photo, slightly more than the top song.
