Cactus Flower which I call a "pizza movie" - it's a personal favorite which never fails to be satisfied. Perfect for an evening at home with a pizza. <br /> <br /> As many people here have recovered this plot, I will only add amendments to Bergman's character, Miss Dickinson was a nurse-receptionist, which means he was a skilled nurse - and therefore an educated person - just " Receptionist "is not. <br /> <br /> Bergman's performance in this movie and the movie itself - was mostly missed at the time. , But today's audience will be surprised by its range; It's not just an illogical humorous time, but the ability to believe us neglects our character's own feelings and expresses them clearly to Tony and us. The general plot stretches credibility, Bergman's performance is compulsory: honest and complete trust. <br /> <br /> Jack Weston's performance as a stand-out for Macthur's old friend and co-conspirator Harvey. We could not provide any jingars like Weston, and IELL. Diamond script gives him lots. For example: "This is a big, messy, messy false class." Weston is respectful to a little sticky character because he has expressed warmth that allows you to forgive the mistakes of his characters. <br /> <br /> This image is a fairly straightforward adaptation of Abe Barroz (which was adopted from a French game in Barlett and Gradie). The role of Broadway Mathur is played by Barry Nelson. Bergman's Lorraine Bekle and Henry Brenda Veccharo. It ran for 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated by two Tony Awards (Victorio and Burt Brinkerff, who played Eger). <br /> <br /> For me, the film score, legend Quincy Jones is another highlight. The original theme (time to love is anytime) is performed by opening and off credit by Sarah Vaughn. It is inspired by various arrangements throughout the film, especially in the romantic piano music record shop that haunts the vomit speech. Jones has also made popular songs for the night club scene (Sir With Love, I'm a believer). Like all the elements in the film, the talent, taste and professionalism are clear. <br /> <br /> According to me, some modern romantic comedies can hold candles in this classic. Finally it is great in DVD. When calling for a pizza ...
