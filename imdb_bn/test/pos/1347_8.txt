My friends and I saw the movie in Austin yesterday for the AGLFF (a movie festival). This movie I saw the best of this year. It was a great comedy - very original and heartfelt - and as good as hello! The audience laughs throughout the whole movie. Texas is a big state - in small towns a lot - and, of course, most teenagers have grown as "fat girls". I know there will be many people in this person's personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin D. Jesus were great - they were so great on these rolls, it seemed as if the script was written with them. And talking about the script, it is very good writing (very believable), and Ash is a wonderful actor (the expressions of his face awakens me alone). This is an independent film - but let's not fool you ... it's a good one! Seeing this qualification of work from such a young person, really inspiring.
