Wow, I saw this movie on the Sandane Channel, and it's really diverse. I can not be a film expert, but perhaps it's the most diverse film, I've seen as the average movie fan. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came with him, that was a great imagination. I am a fan of Japanese plays, and often actors from movies. (Matsushima Nanco, for example, the lead of the rim, is a major J-drama star.) But it seems that this is the first picture of Kiri and Shuiichi. I must say, if they really argue here, they do a great job. <br /> <br /> Kiri was a very sympathetic character, I thought it was easy to relate to it. She was kind and sincere, probably not the most popular girl, but worse than some other attentionable women. She was kind of a classic kind. I hope he is doing more films, but it has been a few years so maybe he has no plans. <br /> <br /> The end was odd. I'm not going to give anything, but the rest of the movie was a shame. <br /> <br /> Very different, but very imaginative and unique movie. I would recommend this to Japanese horror fans, although I warn you, it's a bit bizarre than the ringer. However, I will make it 7.5 out of 10, basicity, imagination, good characterization, above average acting, and just plain being intriguing.
