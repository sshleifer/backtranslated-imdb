Always in my favorite movie, it has been seen three times already. Israel has done a great job to solve most of the problems of life, Israeli humor, and seriousness, and Israeli problems. Universal theme wants to be acceptable, and you will be taking for those. Good humor, and it's Character Charisma, which produces this film magic, and says a great deal about Israeli culture with Oshri Cohen and more about arrogance, conflict, and humor. I highly recommend it to anyone, and it is also the most important of any film, but also the perfect film maker, family movie, perfect film for boyfriend / girlfriend, and Israeli culture, as well as to be acceptable. And imperfection <br /> <br /> Great great movie.
