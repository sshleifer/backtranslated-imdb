Gore Houdes beware! This is not your movie. There are very little blood and guts in this small nail cut. It is basically a version of open water that is functional and effective. But what makes it different is that we really like three leads (unlike open water) who find themselves in a tree when a crocodile flips their fishing boats and municipalities in their guidelines. We do not want any harm to them. So when they start to fall into dangerous situations ... we really care about. <br /> <br /> Now I like the killer creatures flickr, but I was not very impressed with the primary lake placid (although I'm still waiting to see the ridge and hopefully this is the best!) but this little bugger has worked and well Did the job. Its fears are creative and it only debates for the short cry of the cycle and the short stint of realism, so that I will not be disturbed. <br /> <br /> I feel like reading a true story that inspires these three people to catch fish and the two end up in a tree when their friends die by crocodiles. But the thing that always influences me out of the movie was that the spider did not eat the friend. No For hours and hours, he wandered around the tree and pressed the dead body to the tree friends. It seems to be, if you come here, it will happen to you.
