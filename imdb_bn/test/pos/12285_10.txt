It is clear that the amount of the film's value with the format (mini-DV) is over. In fact, the filmmaker embraced this format and included in the fantasy story, which I have forgotten that I have usually seen 35 millimeters of film. This is the main application of indie movies like Clark and the work of Robert Rodriguez combined with the superb "new adoption" in the romantic comedy genre. "Film at brick knot" is an honest film by honest painters and it is a nicely described story. There is not a single point in this movie where I felt that there might be a scene (or have to be). Conversely, the director really pulls out extraordinary performances out of genius actors and is not so in very limited situations. From the page on the screen, this movie is a worthy and relevant story that hits many levels (creative, technical or otherwise). I highly recommend it for those who are enjoying a movie or those who are looking for a little charm in the medium varnish otherwise.
