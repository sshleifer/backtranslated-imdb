Some academic obstacles arise against those who do not like this movie - those of us who do not hold the original can enjoy it altogether. <br /> <br /> My husband who never saw the real "I do not want to see a girly movie." I assured him that "women" is not just a great movie, a girl is not a film. She was a great time. He was very happy to go and enjoyed it compared to the "boy" movie. <br /> <br /> Spinner: I think the new finish is good. Maybe not quite as fun, but it was nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what is one thing to love men ?? They are our son.
