Some people think there were bad TV series with these harmful effects. (It was illustrated in 1977-1979) but in fact, look back at those years and think, "We did not have computers at all." So if you think about it, it's rather a good tv series. <br /> <br /> I always show a bad rating, but does not kill. The network did not. They reject their theme as "Superhero Network" and leave a short spider-man series. If it goes away, it probably can work well in the 80's and if it's really lucky (and I'm really lucky), in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> No one else wanted to pick this series up <br /> <br /> <br /> However, Jolie is old (or young) Nicholas Hammond, the sound of music fame, amazing spyder-man's secret identity as Peter Parker on the TV screen. Aside from the series Peter also deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country, and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> When the series has gone out of the timeline (which Peter has already graduated from the University, and when he gets a bit, and uncle Ben has already died), the audience's actions, mysteries, and letters towards Peter and his change Ego is treated with Spider-Man's attitude. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's Robert a little frustrating. F Simon does not see anything like JJ Jameson, Betty Grant is not a Betty Grant, but a hot African American girl (who reminded me of Hello Berry, who is one of the happiest women on the planet). One was not very bad. <br /> <br /> But considering the time, and how much drama they fill in it, today's bad tv predicts. No way, it's entertaining for today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
