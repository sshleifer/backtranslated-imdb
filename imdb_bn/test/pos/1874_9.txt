Now, the parent company of the Sci-Fi Channel has made some obscure films (the house of the dead, the house of all the souls, etc.), but when you completely leave the job of the great master actor / writer and now the director, Bruce Campbell, you are ready for the independent horror films of the TV Best of the best! I usually hate this movie, in my previous review, the house of the dead 2, I could not believe how horrible the movie is! But anyway I like this picture, I love this movie. Violence is good and so is the black comedy of the movie and I recommend that it is a true Bruce Campbell best composition! Well, since there's just a few lines I can say what I want to say about this film: ijajakisepha jejejejeje enaeksadiephaenaeicaesaesadieephaenasiephaenaephabhieica DJ keelaelajauesaenaesaesaeicaeicadiesa siesaesaeenaeecaeenaeecaenaeicakeca hendacandana jakda eicaecajeenaenaeicadablueicaeica enaeicaesaenaephaekae phakhkhada sakadadaja ephajedadiephae
