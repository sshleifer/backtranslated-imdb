Babet festival, for me, about healing: Correcting the conflict between soul and body in spiritual Christianity. This old community of remote Denmark has no proper understanding of all the gifts made. They have made the Dualism of Saint Paul extremist and not "soul" life, but rather "the life of the flesh" At the young age, older sisters were both afraid of love temptations and temptations of life outside their easy village. They, and their parishioners, their former leaders, and sisters of sisters tied the narrow biblical explanation. The elderly church has become bitter and controversial, and sisters do not know what they want to do. Enter into Babylon, a French stranger, and to whom he can show kindness. They knew that he would eventually bring them back to their generosity and give them a fertile soil in their dry, dusty religion. Bachat will give whatever he has, and in this process, our sisters and their flock can change lives, sacrifice, sacrifices, how much sexual experience (like eukaryast bread and liquor) and why our true art continues. When they can forgive each other and forgive themselves, they can focus in God's love, which is presently presenting them in front of a firmly. As a minister and an artist, I can not highly recommend a movie. True art and true grace !!
