This film has been going on for several years in my mind, one of the best films I've ever seen. Acting fantastic I saw it twice and still confused in some parts. I can play a certain part of time so I want to have a copy. I'm interested in buying a copy of this movie, but I can not find it anywhere. If I can think, I do not have any advice? I tried to search the e-bay, Amazon.com, the internet and completely frustrated. I did not see Turner in classic movies, even in American film classics, and even asked whether my community has a copy.
