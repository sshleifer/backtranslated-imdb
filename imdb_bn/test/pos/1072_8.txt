Last night I saw this movie in Menarbes in France - we are in the Lubon Valley, which is covered by vineyard and of course wine makers. They have been shown to all in Slil de Polyvalent so that they are shown.

One of the Langedk Communist Village. He got a lot of smiles. This is unusual in France - loud smile. There is no question that they are going to the war of terrorism-globalization! SM
