Carrier Criminal and Criminal Boss, Abel Davos (Lino Ventura) has been hiding in Milan city of Italy for more than 10 years. In his absence, he was sentenced to death for his crimes in France's own country. He condemned his life in Italy and the police stopped him, he decided to return to his old stomach ground in Paris. He sent his wife, Therese and two young sons to Nassis, Hubble and the next command, Raymond Naldea, made a final decision to raise their new life fund in France. Haysters receive fewer than half their francs, less than their sources, despite this, and both of them leave the police, they make the Nasis, where they hide briefly. After stealing a pleasure boat from a local, they keep the goal of inserting them in a tourist place in San Remo where it will be more easily mixed, but they are stopped by armed customs officials on a secluded beach, ensues out a shoot and threads and Nauladi is both killed. Davos, who is now injured with two children in the tower, will easily show the police, so he urges his old friends to send help in Paris, but since their old friends went into hiding, they have gone and they are not interested. They risk themselves, so they send a little time thief, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to rescue him. Dave is very hateful that such a low thief has been sent for his help, although he quickly stopped it with Starc, he figured out why he was caught, but their betrayal did not stop there. <Br> <br /> Clas Taus Risks (Sky the Big Risk) for the screen were written for screen by former death row prisons and crime writer Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Scyllien), Ventura is already on board for this project , Someone unique to managing the Giovanniwanted project, Ventura has advised an assistant director, who is working with former Youth San Jaze√±os Georges Ranajuke during the previous project called attention syutake in the cloud. Sautet immediately agreed and left as they say in history. The suite has made a fine gangster film, which plays a great deal on character and relationship. While Davos continues to hide, he has long been able to reflect his friendship towards past, present and future, his friendship does not seem to be what he thinks, what will happen to his now deceased wife and her two little boys. As a character actor, the fans always surprised me, both policemen and criminals are both comfortable and confident, their world's exhausting performance is excellent and strong, because their world is moving around it, such as in the run-of-the-mill of loneliness and loneliness. Ventura's pro-wrestler uses a lot of ex-profession because he spreads Parisian hoodlums throughout the day. Like Stark, Belmando illuminates other stories in the film, on the road trip, she talks about her raised relationship with the girl. With her simplicity, she brought disaster to this woman that she was the only "Volvo" and "the only good thing about her left to me", as she hit her aggressor, and she is also happy to see her fall for him anyway. Bellmando's performance was abandoned at that time, since Gordard's Boat de Souflee was released just three weeks earlier, Gordard received the credit for the discovery of new kids in the block, in which he was there for his multifaceted, all-seeing and commendable films. The snout image is an interesting affair with a very interesting location, the film has a very clear dialogue, the sultry likes to work with the audience more strongly to work with more firmness or attention, this silent fan will say the need to check the need for future suits .
