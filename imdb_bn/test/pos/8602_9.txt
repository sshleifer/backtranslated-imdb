I did not really concentrate on the big massacre of the story (although the horror images are very strong at the beginning). I was really taken the story of the girl and her family. Imagine living your life knowing whether you have a time bomb with a ticking away inside of you. I was really silken to reject Yasuko's "tarnish" by the bomb. The most pictures with me when Yasuko stood before combing her hair mirror, silently watching it come out in clumps.
