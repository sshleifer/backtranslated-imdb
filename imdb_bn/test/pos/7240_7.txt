Often seen in the story of Agatha Christie, her progressive, many defensive conservative attitudes - the role of women from the role of heritage and the role of belief in the supernatural people. You can find many elements in "Nemesis" - but you can also find an old fashioned mysterious mystery that keeps you in dark for a long time. Also lift "Nemesis" on other series entries ("They do it with the monument", "4:50 from Paddington" etc.), it is true that before and after the release of the killer, you can actually feel the momentum, and finally, Jane Booker Anytime welcome to protect my body.
