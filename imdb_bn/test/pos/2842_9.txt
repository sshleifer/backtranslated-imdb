<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When her voice is still high, Shell-threatened Betty as she incredibly effective. Actually, he was so effective that I often wanted to be a little more crazy than that because his created reality was so credible. <br /> <br /> m for the first time Jelvigar has been called to carry the film and he is more than equal to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock ?? Although foul-methad as usual? Wesley is fairly subdued. He was able to exemplify his mental strength and sometimes it is sometimes patronized and always when needed. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting interests: the first time you see the bettie, it's almost like the Wolf of the Wizard 'Wizard of Oz'? Then he later compared Danothie when he said that he never came out of Kansas. Was Doris Day the most known for any song ?? The best-known 'soundtrack was there, and then Charlie (Morgan Freeman) described him on the occasion of Doris Day. <br /> <br /> This is a very playful film with supporting cast, with good performance by everyone. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful ending that, on the contrary, it is actually approximate. <br /> <br /> For any other reason, view this movie only for listening to people's voice listeners: Morgan Freeman.
