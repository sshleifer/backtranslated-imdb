I like this movie. To be very fair, the film starts very slowly, no letters are terrible sympathizers. It continues in this way for a good half of the film. <br /> <br /> However, if you are patient then you will be rewarded. The first half of the film provided adequate compensation for the second half due to the character's development and / or lack of sympathy. It's a bit like a roller coaster roam - a slow, climb over the movement, and then the speed, twists and turns, and a few surprises. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Merrill Strip is wonderful. She is the best actress of our time. If William Hart is good, if the spots are a bit wooden. Ronnie Zellgiger has done a great job, which Jerry McGuire was no perfect for his performance.
