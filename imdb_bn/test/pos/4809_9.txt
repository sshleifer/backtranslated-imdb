I just bought a john (running out of time) in the DVD and this is a wonderful movie that I must say. In terms of gun game, not really action-packed, but definitely exciting and malicious. I do not think I saw the good form Andy Law. And editing this photo is very good execution. If you are a fan of Lau or H K Thiller / Action film then watch it now!
