This movie, directed by Oshima, a notorious comedian of "The Released of the Sense", is a sex and an illogical controversial film, which was banned for a while. This film started in Japan in 1895 and Ricky Shaw's wife played the very beautiful Kaziko Yushiuki, who is in love for a very young person, who treats him kindly. The man, Tauji, came to him while he was asleep, though he soon intends to persuade. Soon they are having an affair and plot to kill Seki's husband, to stay together forever. They, and a good throwing him down. However, they did not recognize the dead husband in the village around the husband! This picture is apparently very stunning, use the shadow highlighting this story for the passion for passion. Mrs. Ususuki (who still turns actress) her role is particularly good. Its not like sex, but in the "state of greatness". What has happened is our imagination ensues. I found this movie to be incompatible with the mood it makes very often. A little weird but that goes with the region. I would recommend this.
