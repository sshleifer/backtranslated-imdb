Because of being a great Moroccan Island fan, I would be terrible without Ron Gilbert making it. The boy was surprised! Although it's not as good as the first two, but it's my comedy. I was a little nervous about the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine, and that it was a CD. But it all came together, and finally it was interesting to hear the voices of your favorite characters. I particularly enjoyed that Sword returned to the war. And the whole story about finding big chained rings was incredible. Go ahead and try these two CD adventures. And now we can rejoice because the monkey Island 4: The real escape from the monkey island is coming! This fall!
