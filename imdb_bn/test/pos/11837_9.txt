Tappin this comedy about an elderly old father (C. Ober Schmidt), who decided to collect his raised children all over the world. Davis is working as a chorus girl in New York when he found out that "Father" wants him. Hmmm, it sounds familiar. Davis's notable talent as an actress preserves so much other comedy because he hates British countryside with his Brazilian American personality. The other is not sharp as Davis comedies, but the value of a look is still on. Ray Milland lost her long lost "brother." Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, and Haloel Hobbs are also interesting
