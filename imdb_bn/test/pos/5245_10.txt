I first saw Big Trill in the Viennese Film Museum. Immediately I was amazed by the high quality and unusual layout of both images and optical details of its beautiful detail. Who has ever seen a documentary style with John Owen? And there's a lot of time, you can actually see around the screen, there are a lot to see! One is ever grateful that the scenes are often fixed, because every single shot is made so well and you want to take it. Even acting plays good and well. The picture is wonderful running long time, you do not want to miss it a minute!
