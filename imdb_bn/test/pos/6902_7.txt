This movie was fun, if the board was over. <br /> <br /> It is mainly followed by two grave-robbers curious romp in the 19th century England, who are victims of vampires, bodies and dead Rosswell trafficking. Foreigner (I have no idea what Roswell Alien is doing there, and the producers do not even think of me.) <br /> <br /> But was it funny? You bet Even Ron Perlman, who directly kissed the DVD Death, was very good as a priest who became an enemy of the enemy's rivals to the body. <br /> <br /> A genuine example is a good example of what you can do to see this sunny little movie, and if you're not big on both sides of the camera.
