I did not expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies that I thought it was only on television because I wanted to see it. I underestimated this movie of course. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a man who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they had better playing letters. This was especially a great scene when Fake (Dennis Hooper) and John (Daniel Rochuk) were talking to each other why John Jemi was killed. How did he explain that he wanted to feel the control and why he was bothered to hear it. But he loved the girl who faked him. When Feck felt repented, when John felt nothing, Hell was proud to do what he did. It really makes you think about people. Kino Reese did great work as Matt, and Sky was good in law. Calling him 'Caloris' and it's strange to see him as a Validictian like Clarissa. Every actor plays great ..... acting It was real nice for a change. It was a great movie and I would definitely say I recommend it.
