The second part of the unexpected ATOR !! Rapidly operated by JOE D'AMATO, all types of exploitation have been explored again by subgenres expert, and MILES O'Keefe. The film Debbio budget will be lazy or short. Although not a good film at Entouroso, although there is no fun entertaining, it is 2, it has something, it is something that is intruning. Its presentation gives you the original explanation of our ATOR with the first part of it. The script is incredible, bright ROY Thomas like any comic book. Sword's Dell has so many wonderful elements inside the world and invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals-monkeys - monkeys ... this is a brilliant interpretation of Villen's role. The final fight is very good. Maya violence and lack of blood, but this one is good. It's not boring. It has everything that was lacking in ATOR 1. Be charmed with me !! 4/5
