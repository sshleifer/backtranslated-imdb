Haines is excellent as Brad Cadet, who believes West Point is something that he really comes. With Wayne Point and the local beauty of Joan Croftford, he has shown Henes' simple, cruel humorous personality. Great fun for the first half. And after the character of Henes, surprisingly touching it goes a long way and almost all of them are moved by fellow cadets. Against the new, submissive Henes Navy, Bill beat drinks to play in football matches and despite a broken hand, the game conquers. This shows great, passionate entertainment, delivery at the best time by MGM in Hens's formula film. William Bakewell also scores as skinny follower. In the next decade, it will be played by handsome-but-Gon by ClarkeGebel, Curry Grant, Gary Cooper, and others, while others will take the names of Carroll Lomber and Marion Davis's beautiful-and-odd names. Winning the West Point!
