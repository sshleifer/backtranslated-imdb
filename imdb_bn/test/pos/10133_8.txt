It was unusual: a modern-day movie that was pretty awesome. In fact, it was so nice to believe part of the bordered part of it was so nice. I saw this real-life story, I was thinking, "Nobody is this beautiful, this tolerant." Primarily, I'm referring to the role of Ed Harris "Coach Jones." I think they went a little more towards their character, but on the contrary it was even better: in real life she showed worse than what she wanted. It seems strange to play the role of Harris, because he has been working for playing nasty, dishonest characters for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, I never complain about a nice, good movie and see a bunch of nice things - money, kind people. These people made their friendship, love, and compassion known as "James Kennedy", which is known as "Radio", a mentally slow middle school run by Cuba Gooding Jr. This story occurs in South Carolina in the mid-1970s. Gooding also does an excellent job with the introduction. However, I want the role of a psychologist-challenged person in San Pablo, "I am Sam", one and a half times like this one character is enough. Then, the boy shouted aloud loudly, loudly loudly, <br /> Note: It was interesting in one of the documentaries in this DVD that in the real life, the "radio" film turned into a month, its transformation.
