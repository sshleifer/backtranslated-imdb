As soon as I saw the advertisement of "Changi" on the history channel, I knew I would love it. This ANZAC spirit is fantastically captured - you will die if you were not a companion around you. The characters of "Changi" were strong and in every story they brought something different and Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but Australians were just as simple soldiers as they were decided. Direction, screenplay, acting and setting were all done with nicely plotted plots. Humor was the key to surviving soldiers, and it was very good to see a small series of battles, in fact it was a bit of humor, which is usually difficult to humiliate without being humiliated. From what I read about Changi Poovi Camp's soldiers, this story is very realistic for six years in Australia, British, New Zealand, American and Dutch men. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war. 10/10.
