I can not stand in the program or other HBO programs as "very graphic" or "unnecessary graphic" or "unwanted nudity / violence / sociology etc." <br /> <br /> What do you think? Prison's life is not PG-12. The "void" graphic content is true from the life of this situation. There are co-worker rapes / killings / drugs and fountains in prison. If you do not like it, do not see the program. I am certainly not a fan of prison rape, but if I leave the show I will be surprised and give less credibility. If the captives do not curse, it will be only silly. Sure it is a void language, but it's real. <br /> <br /> The show is good, some of the viewers .... Not too much, I guess.
