I bought it for a shooter !!! <br /> <br /> I bought this image for dollars and I saw much worse !! <br /> <br /> This is a Scottish ski-fi film from Mark Strickton and Making of Making (Western Hykikal) is only 8000 USD. Eight grand !!! Do not pay for half a minute of Hollywood !! Yet ---- this is the best fun movie made. If you want things like retimat you're in for a treatment. This rough voice and some rough character with hard oaths. I did not mind, but my daughter's friend !! The actor has done a fine job and it is interesting to see people who I have never seen or seen before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The effect here is OK, but the weak of the space is weak. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At least it was not predictable and I often closed my chair while blowing a head to my father !!! All right, so this is a small metaphor for other sci-fi, but it's a great effort for this budget and anyone who is thinking of making a science-fi film for 8C does not know anything about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good sign for a good movie, extra symbols for working very hard, extra extra symbols for making really interesting. There is no ideal calf here, all the problems of production have finally ended up being lost on stage with a movie. But no comment why? Continue scoring!
