An alert by the hill forest, young happy campers, a park ranger and a hidden image. The ingredients are for a horrible joy, and the director / co-writer Jeff Lieberman does an adequate job to acquire it. It is a horrific horror story of formulas, but in most cases executions are executed games and stories (which are quite basic in a trim sense) are effectively said in some reality. Perhaps a little more exposure was not misguided, but Liberman made a detailed description of the technical flaws and growing tensions, a smiling environment created by Moody Visual and Brad Fidel's disrespectful linking scores. Whenever that was very cued in the horrible whistling, it would be a really unpleasant knowledge to settle with a beautiful backdrop. Cinematographer Dean M. and Joel King are an interesting job too. There are lots of styles, even with its minimal scope and build up slowly. Sometimes pacing can be a stop-and-go matter. It is not particularly violent, but it also has a short screen, even if it has a little screen. The next Chase scene and growing fear are working well, because it is coming alive with the darkness. You are cute killer / and you get little to actress George Kennedy, but the wonderful turn gets her white horse riding. There is a favorite bunch of performances; Deborah Benson makes for a strong, dashing heroine. Greg Henry, Chris Lemon Ralph Semur, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin, and KT Powell, a mere throw of credible delivery. The final measure is rather altered, but the end is one of the kind that you think? "Is that that?" <br /> <br /> A well engraved back-up slash item, which can make it very less secure that can actually separate from the norm.
