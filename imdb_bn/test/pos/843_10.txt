I look forward to releasing this DVD for some time (and this follow-up {Female Prison Scorpio: # 701's annoying song}). I enjoyed the first two films of this series. Just after watching this picture, I must say that this is probably my favorite three. <br /> <br /> All these three movies were directed by Sunita Eto. What's great about them, though, they all feature the same lead character (surprisingly performed by Miko Kazi), they are very different from each other. <br /> <br /> The first movie (Female Prison # 701: Scorpio) is a common woman in the prince movie. But Scorpio's character is very impressive - many spaghetti is very memorable for the opposition heroes of the West. And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> The second movie (Female Cavity Scorpion: Gelhaus 41) is a real tour-de-force. A large part of the film is skeptical of Scorpio and six other kidnapped prisoners. <br /> <br /> This movie (Female Prison Scorpio: Best Stable) is the third in the series and the last heard of the listen ITO. Much more drama as this one crime drama. Again, our heroine is run. But out of this time, he has managed to maintain the normality of a certain amount of his life (talking relatively well). When he gets a job, he finds a place to live, he makes a friend out. But, of course, everything will eventually be unveiled. FPS: There is a more straightforward story in the Boston Storm, which is said to be more exciting than the predecessors. But I found it fascinating from the beginning to the end. And do not worry: there is still a lack of sightseeing in this movie! But I think these films have exceeded the most exploitation film because more annoying elements are played only in the stretcher tones except for the use of shock value in your face. Yes, there was a clear moment in this movie where I cried aloud. But I do not think they are better than the quality of the story (well, maybe one or two times). I've enjoyed many films about this, continuous build up of Scorpion's myths. This entry-level character development is much more widely used than the previous two. We can see that he is more than a stone-hearted revenge agent! <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier in this review, followed the fourth movie. Miko Kazi was also portrayed as a scorpion, but he was a different director. Without giving away anything I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stables is completely endless in this way as to make a sequel unnecessary. The fourth film is still quite good, but it seems that it can play the lethal triangle of the mind as an unexpected footnote. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to someone who is interested in Out of the-General films. FPS: Can be enjoyed in standstill pieces (like the first two movies) in the Weststate, but if you have not already done so, then recommend others first.
