It's a cut on other types of genres: Actually suspicious, intelligent, brilliantly played and apparently stunning. Yes, the plot may be confusing - but it partly creates a punch like this. If you can see it twice. You will see almost twelve times when you see it, when you first see this sharpness. <br /> <br /> This picture does not come from Korea, most of the Western listeners in a country are not very familiar. Although there are culturally specific film elements, the underlying themes are universal - crime, anger, loss, insanity and punishment. All of these Lead Su-Jing's su-Mays are run nicely as the main character. Also the special mentionable eligible Yum Jung-AH, who delivers a deeply insane and unsettling performance as stepmother. <br /> <br /> If it's a scary moments, it's not really a glimmer since most people would imagine it. It's a more mystery mystery story with an element of mystery. It grips you from the beginning and will eventually keep you guessing!
