At the Chicago International Film Festival we saw La Spratrice last night and both of us were very moved by it. This is a lonely hunting story and a miss connection that the desire for intimacy conflicts with fear of revealing more about ourselves. Three leads (as Barlow Bouloula Valeria, as Brigit Killian Flavia, Andrea Range Masimo) are all excellent and dynamic among them is very surprising. <br /> <br /> After watching movies that deprive old women, Flavia (who is a professor of law at the University of Rome) looks nice and beautiful and sensual and seductive and strong. We believe that when a small female 'mix' enters, the elderly woman will be jealous of the little woman, the man will leave the small woman for the old lady, etc. However, mental truth is quite complicated in this film, however complex. Highly recommended.
