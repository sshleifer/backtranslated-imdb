The most intense and powerful film I've seen in the year. There are other films before Vietnam veto but this is nothing compared to the psychologically heart-shaped film, as a common American suburban family, separated in the sea part of 1972, which has thrown into Vietnam all our collective regions. Cast A ++++ Fantastic with four actors (Cathy Bethes with a stand-out) provides riveting performance. What is amazing about this movie is that you can not take any side, but understand four letters and sympathize with them, although there are four different views and needs. Here are some scenes that are so strong that family concepts and feelings are expressed (such as clash between boys and mom) that emit emotionally and pain in the tears. I actually shouted in this picture, I rarely do anything. The horror of a stunner! Many overlooked films that should be seen. I rated this topmost piece of a 1996 film a 10/10. Especially today in this day and age, our country is very scared of the horrible war, our title shouted out of oppression, but our youth and women are returning with deep mental illness, due to the deep pain of their respect line. To see a film.
