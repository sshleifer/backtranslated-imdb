I have never seen a show before with so many stories, mysteries, mysteries, and hard hit tensions. But I watch Barley watch TV but I own this show every season and it's amazing. Each episode plays extremely well, written and designed. At the end of the ceremony, I felt the stories are being brought too far to stay in prison, but the actor dragged it. Sopranoes sucks bigger than OZ In fact, no cable network, HBO or any show can only hold candles in the OZ. I want to come back for a more season. If that happens, then perhaps they will kill every character in the show, but hey, we all have to go. As far as the letters, I used to tell Orelli and Alvarez to be my favorite. Both were firmly strong together, but their personal stories I felt that Beach is one of the strongest except for hers, but still ... However, always the best program, sometimes the best network, sometimes the best actor, PERIOD!
