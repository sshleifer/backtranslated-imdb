Although I feel strongly that the Sitter is the best Gene Kelly film, but it's a pretty good one. I liked the song and dancing and ending how I learned the song. My favorite part is without doubt though the jin's dance with his changed ego. I love watching two genes Kelly for one price. It was really talented Mr. Kelly really. This is a movie that I think everybody should see at least once in their life. So you go out of it and found it to see it today! I'm sure everyone has a genuine Kelly friend who has their collection in this movie. So go over their home and pop some popcorn and enjoy!
