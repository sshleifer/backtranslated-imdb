If you want a movie with full emotions see more; Dramatic and fun, and wrenching emotion scenes; I can safely guarantee that very young and not able to see very human movies, now without any tear. Acting by two leadership is hard to believe; You will swear by two young men who really enjoy Muscular's Dstrropai (Rory) and Cerebral Palsy (Michael). Fairly simple, I've ever seen the last two appearances; These two very credible characters as well, and the feeling that you have been stimulating the dramatic purpose or sympathy has not been "just" tossed. As "Extra" DVD releases their "Scenes have been deleted" (with an alternate end) and an "Extended party sequence"; It is difficult to understand why these clips are not included in the final film, because they have added the rest of the film and are not unnecessary in any way. But without reservation I can sincerely recommend this picture to anyone; The one I've ever seen is the very best one.
