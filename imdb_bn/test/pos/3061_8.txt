This is the reason I will be able to buy this movie due to the DVD. I thought it was very funny because it was no real plot. It is not estimated to be an Oscar winner film. I appreciate those films. Kerry Elves was a very attractive Robin Hood. I do not think of my favorite part of the film because they are all pretty good. However out of peace !!!!
