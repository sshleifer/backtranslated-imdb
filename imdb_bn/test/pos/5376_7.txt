I have been interested in this picture for a long time, especially after reading a few online reviews of the DVD version; However, I keep suspending his shopping due to excessive cost-tags and a complete lack of relevant supplements. When it was printed out earlier this year, I finally gave it - but the whole order (which included most other highly-qualified titles) transit is lost! Thankfully, the DVD has been reissued at the price of the court - and I'm sure I picked it up! However, it is a weird movie and a perfect slipper: The first is a misleading, but interesting, strange story that forces the small city to strike with the inherent generosity of both the atmosphere and the evil spirits. -Over. A small cast completely responds to a terse, absorb and intelligent script: Response Stradd Martin makes the conversation sound especially with his nuanced performance as his doctor actor / witch's coven head; L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (both of whom have made this movie!) Give firm support as non-nonsense sheriffs and their comic-strip Afsosonad Assistant. <br /> <br /> This plot combines the elements of previous films related to witchcraft and is not only the title, but it is not only the obvious title: The city is supposed to be spelled, which can not be identified first, for example, in Luis Bonuil's supernatural surreal, a certain bourgeoisie The family feels similar afflictions as outgoing fingers (1962)! The 'discovered kids' angle was probably taken from Villas of the Damned (1960); There are so many movies - especially the latest wine - where the satanic shows of a Dickens Coventry are shown: The City of the Dead (1960) to The Devil Rids Out (1968), but the modernity of the work has happened in Didi America (though distant surroundings) and older Dices (for finding a 'Renaissance') revolve around, the film remembers most of them as Rosemiers B (1968). <br /> <br /> Intriguing scenes (as a result of many fogs spoken outside of exorcism, where the diabolic events occur in a decorated room) are specifically presented to make them completely unreasonable and highly effective - especially in an army tank (! ), A devil doll (a concept which has been death over the years but here, it is an unauthorized frisson rises A surreal dream sequence (Crushing a car where the car is kept inside the ice chamber constantly, they can not be buried!), Where a sequence of wings invades a suspected member of a bomb attack, riding a medieval night (!) And length 'black mass' finale (with documents, they 'took' red dress with the corresponding child - presided over the program black ka Dr Martin without wearing) cult mass suicides, which ends in! <br /> <br /> The picture can also provide frustrating screens. From a major Hollywood studio in Colombia, it is refreshing across a title (though at least budgeted production), which can go completely against grains (i.e., the film is quite weird - expanded and scored with editing)! It's weird, that such an enthusiast - and cinematic - awful proposal {SIC} should come from a TV director, which is often related to the West and other family fares! However, with the same theme, the imperialist Crissover Lee / Peter Cushing was almost contemporarily cooperated, but Knight (1972; which Lee himself had created himself!) - I was shown that 20 years ago I miss out on a local TV, and that is what MIA Has been there !! <br /> <br /> <br /> This review of Satan's brothers will certainly include rebels, however, concise summaries and artwork on DVD cover can keep everything aside!
