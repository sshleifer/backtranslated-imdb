I was about eight years old when I first saw this film in 1946 and it gave a deep impression. This movie did not scare me for more than 50 years due to lack of a good word. In this 50 years, I think that the only scene spread, it was the killing of a little girl and helpless policeman, which he called "little n -----kid". While displaying the film, these words were replaced recently on TV, there are probably two films, or someone has broken the heart to change the scene. The film has long been used to make my opinion south, and so far I have come here to visit 'El Paso A South City' for the closest closest movie. The stand that seems to be extreme, but the story is a little more. When the movie was recently shown, it became clear why it scared me for years. New Zealand is about to start this movie. The film is made up of what is being shown, the image was created only after one or two years after adding visible events to its realistic credibility. Terror is not provided by the aliens, but people living in our society at that time. : Recent visits have helped to influence my eight-year-old mind. When this movie came, the only school I went to was present in the presence of most African-Americans. The victim saw as a girl in my class. It was like a real kill. It created a horrific scene that is very bad. Perhaps no one would think this review helpful, but it helped me.
