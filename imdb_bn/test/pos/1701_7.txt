Well, many of us agree that this is a poor effort to rebuild, but at the same time it also has its own movie. Do not blame me, 'American Wayroll In In London' is a great movie, but 'American remake in Paris' as well as a good movie. <br /> <br /> First off, only real matches are TITLE, 2 American backpackers and WEREWOLVES. Along with these three things, 'American remake in Paris' is very well separated with its own special combination of humor, action / courage and fear. Most of the people who say this movie are better than the original, today's generation youths think that any movie that was created before 1990 is almost impossible. Those who grew up at age 80 could understand what their old films and what has added to today's horror films. Many people do not realize that, except for the classic classics, including B & W, the horror will not be like today's day. Now I'm getting a little bit beaten up ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " That said, this is still a very entertaining film for watching and I recommend it. I give it 7 out of 10. Maybe it might be a little liberal, but I tried to recreate the classic and saw a much worse effort.
