I have seen both films and I have seen without any doubt that the re-election is best, I know that many would refuse to give feedback to the devotees, probably not likely to like this rebuilding, but I think it was good thinking and clearly scary, it was a lot better I'm going to see it tonight, the real reason is that I've killed the kids, I mean the ones who do that in movies ... But one of these children has at least half the chance ... The only bad part of this movie is when the child (jil) sounds walking around the words and checking someone for jumping, obviously no one on his right will do it. At the time of the bidding, I found the only thing with the movie, and maybe even had to make suspense there, I did not want to pay too much for those who did not see it. I recommend that you do this instead of crying and saying worse than the original, it will be a good film for the boys, because it shows us things which are most afraid of us, but when I was in the movies, 70 years 10 adults over age saw this, and I think they enjoyed it when they enjoyed it! I out of 9 out of it 10!
