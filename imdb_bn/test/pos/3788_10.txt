Among the longest of Charlie Chaplin's longest films, he kept Little Fellows in the pitch of WWII, where he endured endless patience for his helpless colonialism and the endless life of groove, where the soldiers had finally lived for a period of time. To defeat the enemy and usually top their death. Chaplin's character is curious to do something like a blind fight in such a bright comedy, but the adultery that he uses in the film also makes the uncomfortable situation very laughable. <br /> <br /> The best of Chaplin's films, small films and otherwise, it is full of bright and memorable scenery, where the scene is where the pistol is killed by a piece of chocolate on a board, when he gets his helmet shot off, the scene where He and his fellow soldiers are sleeping in the water, opening the beer bottle and lighting the cigarette, and of course, cross the enemy. The. These scenes are the most memorable of show-stupors, Chaplin scenes. This one should not miss!
