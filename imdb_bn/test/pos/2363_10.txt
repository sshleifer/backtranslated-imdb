I just saw this (last weekend) and it was absolutely mountainous, some of the scenes can not just laugh! Dennis is sometimes very weirdly thick, and only the wise things to say ... but at the same time he has been very calm to influence his girlfriend (in any way he is arrested!) Beach scenery is very cool ... until the time of Ravi Calcutta ..! Not the greatest movie ever of all time, but there is nothing to remember about the rental of Saturday night (as I have done). Although you can search around for it - even though I was lucky, my local video store was its stock.
