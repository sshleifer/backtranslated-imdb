The elite movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery is long delayed to be released in DVD format. Before that, the same thing can be said for the extraordinary film, rape case. I can only hope that my comments inspire some entrepreneurial souls to make two Elizabeth Montgomery films available to many of their fans in one DVD. I believe the role of this wonderful actress for one unfortunately is stereotyped by his role of Bewitched and, consequently, the more serious acting role is not available for him. I am sure that if these two films are perhaps released with Legend of Legend Borgen in the form of a Trilgio DVD, then how much will their fans set their direct record about his serious acting ability.
