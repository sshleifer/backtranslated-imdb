"House of Dracula" is nothing new to offer a fatigue or thrills or a new twists way of already tired tales. A year ago, the film's "House of Frankenstein" created a fairly good series of accolades. In the "House of Dracula", you can see their production of 1945 production prices, otherwise the factory may take their toll on potentially scary movies. In the series, stock footage of the previous films in the series and then from the end of "Ghost of Frankenstein" to the end, only "El Chapo" flick is created. There is a shy of studio and producer that they got top quality talent and quickly ruined everyone's time and effort on the money back project. But at the end of WWII all the trends across Hollywood seem to be running. What happened to all their harmful disguises to appear as a dinosaur in some unknown Saifai film of the 1950s. For the reference of both James Whale and Valleton's day, the real mood and atmosphere of this type is going on. Keep in mind that the makeup genius, Jack Pearce, who actually did medical research to make all our choices, was shot shortly after the release of this particular movie. A less qualified makeup man named Bud Westmore was appointed as Universal head of Universal in Universal. Mr. Westmore does not deny the power, but the horror films are not just fake. All right, watch or not. Watch this movie but only as part of the Frankenstein series's chronological order and you will see how it will end as a comic lesson for Ette and Costello.
