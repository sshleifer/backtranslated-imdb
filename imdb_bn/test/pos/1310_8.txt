I have never heard of Mishima before watching this movie, and although some of it is a bit tedious, I still hold myself to watch it while repeating the box. At the beginning of the film, we behave like a famous Japanese writer as crazy and publicly act as a sepuku. As the film progresses you are gradually included in the twisted argument of Mishima's mind. At the stage of his life, four chapters are presented. Each chapter combines two opposite descriptions itself, the first one continues the story with the scenes of the filmmakers and black and white is displayed. The second story is an adaptation of the scene from a novel and it is pictured as the fifth color and impressed. There is a different novel held in each chapter. In each chapter, the description comes back to the present, because Mishima continues to lead her suicide. This means that the drama and tension are ultimately maintained. <br /> <br /> I doubt many people will bother about this movie as annoying and art-house. What I respect, it's not a movie that wants a line of action and a strong story. On the other hand, if you are a person who tells a wicked person the story of his life in the mind of Philippe's beautiful photo of the protection of the glass, then you would love it. I like it <br /> <br />
