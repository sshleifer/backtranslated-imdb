I really liked this movie. I do not like it because it's a great soundtrack 80th best film, but I found that it has some worrying moments. They are just moments; Not the whole film This is not necessarily "less than Zero". <br /> <br /> Believing in the scene is dealing with common problems like betrayal and more difficult problems. This problem is not easily solved or forgotten by characters. Some scenes can invite standing and invite reflections of your teenager experience and how those experiences have influenced the attitude of a person's character and adult. <br /> <br /> You can think about the problem of seeing this movie and facing young adults. , And about your own experience. Or you can concentrate on looking for boys only for their virginity! :) By no means it's a good movie.
