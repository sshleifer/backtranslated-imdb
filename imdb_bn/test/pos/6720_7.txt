Like many other critics here, I was surprised to see many negative reviews in this movie. In the previous attempt by Dan O'Bannon, the earthquake of 1979 was 'Allian'. Because this and 'Star Wars' do not mean that in the context of the artistic 'used' or 'dual space' style system, it does not mean that it is <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> British heritage and tradition of science fiction - especially Hammer and American International features such as quorumas (especially 'Quotermas and Pitt', 1967), Doctor Who and The Day of the Triphis Saw (1963), does not work if Gary Anderson ( 'UFO', 'Space: 1999' and 'thandarabardasa'). But some other critics of the novel 'The Queen of Blood' (1966) by the author O'Bannon and 'It! Instant Source for Beyond Space Terror (1958) - 'Allen' (1979). This movie is supposed to have some 'heir' elements, but it is likely that the film is an instant comparison fellow - a 'American Weowolf in London' and 'The Company of the Walls' (1984) - 80 of 1981. The movies of which are accepted by 80 Joe Zeitgeist during the 'seek-back' sharing. These three films had grasped the previous avatars, but their themes (because they could) had sexual relations and at the same time they recognized the tongue of their project's comical aspects. Blue Nelson's 'Volvo' played mostly in floating psychological memories in the 80's, when 'American Weowolf' called his theme as 'Coming-Off-Easy'. It is called an artistic license and these adaptations of these three films 'Screen' franchisee, 'You know what I did last summer' and less than the next play under 'Final Destination' is not less valid. But this tin-targeted, film seems to be part of the box office trend, where 80 films of 'Life Force' belong to a canon of British scientist - even if it is written by an American. <br /> <br /> In different ways this film is much better than the disaster and the attack of the alien ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'deep impact') and 'solutions' do not remain in the gun - war, weaponized payloads and testosterone On the opposite side of the pole, it is fortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron Tarkowski and Lem did not check even more closely before rebuilding 'Solaris' ... <br /> <br /> The goal of this movie was funny, not ponderousness or stupidity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
