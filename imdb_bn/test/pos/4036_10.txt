I thought that the story came in very good places. I liked this movie a lot. If you are going to be angry with the Bregte Fonda movie, you can only rotate. I was a bad idea of ​​ragging on movie stars. Apparently nobody seems so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my first DVD in my room. How much i like it I will not start online arguments with someone I do not know, and it will be on top of a movie. Someone might recall what they said about the story, but I would be happy to recall my shame. However, if they think that I am not eligible for retirement, they may feel that they are not worthy of one. But I can not control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right path. Hey, they do not have to make a recall, but I would greatly appreciate it.
