Being a fan of time travel stories, I am surprised that there is no 'device' that sent Russell Johnson's character through time. He only appeared in 1865. This episode was a frustrating part. I enjoyed the 'change' the premise of the danger in the future by past change. I was interested in using other 'Twilight Zone' episodes, such as "Note Time Lake the Past", "Once Upon a Time", etc. while traveling 'device' during time travel. Perhaps Russell Johnson's character is played in "Execution", but it was more acceptable to fans like me. Sci-Fi fans know that a letter will sometimes 'die' in travel periods. Plots 'Twist' can be applied to all types of stories in this type of story. The only error that I could comment for this episode was.
