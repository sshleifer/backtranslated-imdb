I was disappointed with the American rimak in this English mini series (2000). Although it follows the plot line very closely, it originally started moving out of the heart and soul. There is no mention of adding 'messaging' to unreliable heavy handfuls ... so my suggestion is to eliminate the modern remix and keep it in the original. It's much more, but gripping and completely well done. Explicit, complex and textured, without selfishness of the promotion ... and it has been shot nicely. <br /> <br /> I have found that these ruthless remixes of foreign films get so much fanfare in Hollywood. History liability (Although I received some eloquent praise for Benesso del Toro ...)
