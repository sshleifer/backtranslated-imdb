Bloody birthday plays on innocent silence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Fryman), Curtis (known as Billy Jacobby), and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), was born in a planet on the same day. Besides sharing a birthday, they will share the love of murder (and they do not like what they kill). Young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy play a pretty good part of this unimaginable giant but they never know how to get to the chain. But they are not all fools. This is a fairly good horror, it is not very unrealistic, there are some good moments of suspense and well illustrated the role of kids (though raised up-ups are quite funny). I want to see her good value, (I own a copy myself).
