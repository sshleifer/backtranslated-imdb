Expectation of Hitkouk's caution as well as the prospect of making a false studio film was expected. Certainly some of them hoped for a delightful mood of her most riot, obsolete movies, harmful black comedy, exciting mysteries, manipulation fun, and an amazing surprise. But what they found is correct: Strangers in the train <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the cross-motif motifs have been created, but its immediate effect is that the Guy prevents the whole line of progress in the making of his life, and therefore is interested in representing or joining society. Guy is Architel American, the working class boy has done well, influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome Bruno is his destructive opposite, gay, violent, 'European' (he lives in a big house from his father, and lounges only to dream of killing). Bruno's life is repeated, round, and the guy goes straight ahead. Bruno's achievement (to represent Marie-round-round) and to threaten him for transferring Gunner to his state (breaking the law, hoping to kill (Bruno's)). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> War Criminals War. The picture of all the authorities in the film has been criticized - Bruno's father, a man whose cruelty we see a glimpse of, but its true horror is constantly directed into the film (especially in the painting of Anto Clara - from which incredibly strong negative energy will come from somewhere); Anna is incredibly Mackievelian, self-serving father; The innocent judge who does not think of lunch after executing; Tennis commentator whose smugly authoritative comments are always wrong Like the Robin Wood, the legendary mother of a hatred is far away from her father and father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the most spiritual film of the hit. When Gaia is in her plot, she is directly pictured with romantic music. But whenever Bruno is cross-border, the atmosphere is keranivilyak, malicious, much more fun. This is Hit's first true American film, America's primitive conflict repeats. Poor men try to puncture small boys balloons, or throw off their miry-rounds. Prominent professor of mathematics sang songs about goats. Adult society materrooms panic over the elegant Syrians. Washington is a painter who, like an additional line in a huge desert beneath a huge sky, illustrates hunting painting. When we see a slow, sunny Bruno in the ocean sea shrouded in a tennis match, one of the greatest, and funny scenes in all movies, Maggat's perfect picture. Just look at any scene with Bruno, and it gets intertwined. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous growing failures - see all these balloons (the hits were clearly seen by the Third Man) - as well as in a more staid environment: Washington will not have the same look again. Strangers also, VERTIGO, however, hits the most excessive sex movies - as well as fatal, there is intense homoeroticism, there is a remarkable game with 'races' horses; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Suitable producers, the critics make him famous for the first time, to show him what he was a great artist. A lot have been made in Bruno's Norman Bates prototype, and the HIT demonstrates grave anger over the audience's detection to kill Bruno. There is a tragic painstaking continuation where Bruno lost the lighter with which he wanted to drain down Guy. The pain of relief and relief from the audience, I was a partner in support of the insane murderer. It was naturally funny, a little annoying, and very openly about the real reactions of similarity and success. And the hits meet the curiosity lane - listen to the fun music and excessive compilations, and kick yourself to take yourself so seriously. <br /> <br /> Stronger is one of the five hit films of the hit, and is therefore the best movie thing. Dialogue is so weird and bright, I can not believe it was Chandler's writing. Patricia Hitako is an amazing reflection, she stands for her cheeky father as she taunts the cheek. Fairground Finale is an extraordinary, exciting, sore set piece, black comedy and symbolic place. If Bruno's final words condemned him in Hell (according to Catholic attempt Hit, it is believed to be associated with Hill): compared to the same end of the killers), we appreciate his honesty, giving himself an infinite priority to the gear's self-confidence.
