The first shot of love's consequence is perfectly set up in this playful and dry film. A travelleera slowly carries the focus alone on the camera outside the image alone, behind a huge suitcase behind it. Like the central character of the film, we do not know anything about him and his primary explanation, his profession, the suitcase content could be out of the mark. <br /> <br /> Love results are movies. From the title you could expect a Bergmanesq break from a relationship. Instead of us, it is a key character, a child, a life of mental exile, apparently to cut himself off from the people around him. The film can be classified in any way, I will call it a mystery, because we are involved in working with Tita and what she is saying about it. What we know from the beginning is that he is 50's cool, composed and elaborately dressed. He has lived in Swiss hotel for the last eight years, always paying his room fees during the period, but rarely shows interest in the staff or other guests. <br /> <br /> With a couple of her only real companion she plays card games occasionally. Couple, it is transparent, hotel-owned, but now everything is gambling away and they have only room left. Their money, ancient things and love of each other was their predecessor and Tita seems to be identified with their plight. She once had it all, but is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother's long-haired surf instructor dropped out to see him occasionally, but he looked more intriguing than seeing his inspection. They consider him as his best friend, although he has not seen him for 25 years. This long-lost friend now brings together a telephone engineer, the repair network that brings together a lot. Meanwhile, Titas phone calls his wife and children are quick to refuse to talk to her. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film Tita takes an unusual step and starts to open up to a young Bermaid from the hotel. Tired of emotionally embarrassed, he pushed himself towards an activity that eventually seals his fortune well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Thongping Techno Soundtrack reveals a lot of hidden information because the tender has become more secretive, Looking at the final half-hour thriller, Tita gives her mask slip and she will face her work results again. With a visual signature of Felini, the end, dramatic yet flawed and the visitors once more abandoned the purpose of its purpose. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 01-06-06
