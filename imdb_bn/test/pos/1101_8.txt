All right ... So, in 15 minutes there is no dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> This picture came to me in a padded bag from underneath, Sharpie encrypted the information in front of me. I was sent by a programmer, and mode love, from the festival of North America as a potential starter, in love with the distant Moscow / Carloie heavy interface. <br /> <br /> I just thought "this picture is not for us" (no dialogue in the 15 minute minute) but whatever the observer is.
