Mystery and its solution were a great silent pride. Although I have some questions, maybe I could not pay enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed a neighbor and why? Who kills the girl and why? <br /> <br /> And some minor quibbles, they should show off the stop at the hotel for the switch. The switch should not be shown, but they were going to the hotel in the gym and the girl, Jim was going to the bathroom, coming out and Bartender told him that his girlfriend went to the car without him. <Br /> <br /> Then Jim is sleeping back in the car and looking at the sleeping woman, and the little girl on her back seat <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I wish, it will be pressed, I want to see it again.
