I like both of these versions of Dorian GRE and MGM versions Both of them grow up to relate to Dariyan (not the original book), adding a little girl at the beginning of the story, and this is my only complaint. As an Harry in the MGM version, I especially like Angela Lansbury as Cabin Van and George Sanders, but Shane Bryant is very good at the MGM version of the TV version as Dorian (I think) and Haram is more ruthless than Hatfield: I think Brian's novel Dorian is more true . In the end, it is a very good adaptation of the novel (it also indicates to men with Dori's liaison, such as the Wing, which is not possible in the MGM version).
