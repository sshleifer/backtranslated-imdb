[Warning: Contains Spokes] <br /> <br /> Husband and wife Wali Ulderski (who has given instructions) and Maya Forbes wrote, this indie film is one of the best romantic comedies in recent memory. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr has given a break to play whispers, the man who wants to put his partner in bed and allows him to do the same. Julian Nicholson, who was so good at "Tuli", he played superb and weak with a fantastic gloss. Very bad he will not get recognition of his deserve. <br /> <br /> Good supporter supports too much performance. The last year's "Bad Santa" became a memorable act of Lorraine Graham, perfection, satirical perfection, Brian Cranston (TV's "Malcolm In Middle"), in some funny, unpopular moments and Andy Richard's genial role. For those who fall for a mother - Helen Slater is known as a faithful woman, though she plays a believer female. <br /> <br /> "I'm not surprised when I see another man." Here are some genuine smiles. The first attempt of Ed's futile sex has received some great lines, and a man has a troupe that tends to be tweaked by male fantasy as one of the most real reactions of a man. <br /> <br /> The picture is not unusual, but I like that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought about it, a lot of Ed's character. If the style is given, you know how well Elise's plan has been destroyed even if its goals are not good. We see how the couple works through this strange situation. Initially, Alice and Ed are turned into by this idea, but then the human element sets it. <br /> <br /> I appreciate praising Forbes and Bhojodarsky as a cheap sex romp. Yes, there are gender and nudity, but here there are real emotions. "Other people" of Alice and Ed Friend does not want to be casual sex material; They have great feelings. In one case, many feelings. It's supposed to be a lot of curiosity, no need for recharger-slater sub-navigation, and Alice really does something extraordinary. But it's forgiving because Mahara and Nicholson have created such extraordinary intimacy and honesty - check out these scenes where Ed Elise's underwear shows a reaction to the drawers or the response to the end of his exam - no matter why we can enjoy their little game , We are going to succeed in this couple. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this image is a little, if available, promotions and a limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedy often relies on strange, radioactive and unclear tensions, it would be better to learn from this cute and funny movie.
