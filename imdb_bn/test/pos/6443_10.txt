Tom (Tommy Pender), an orphan boy, who worked for a pair of Shady Chimney Sweep, Mr. Grimes (James Mason) on false charges - working with a real thief, where the false accusation of stealing from the palace - and runs The owner of Tom's only Alibi House owner (Samantha Gates, a thin, pink-blue-eyed, tall, hazy hair), I'm sure this is why I initially saw as a boy. He and his dogs jump into a river and a witch turns into their water-breathing cartoon characters! Under the water, she made friends with Shahrukh Khan, a boy from childhood, as a child of water and rescued. <br /> <br /> In 1850 a very interesting and always fascinating story, which should appeal to all children. Animation (42 minutes for 85-minute HBO VHS print) is average, but it is more preferred than most modern day animation - even computer animation! My only true cell is a plot hole created by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse of "High Cocktail", the film falls into a scene with octopi swimmers, then confronted with Tom and Jack with Terrence. It leads to a scene where the killer shark (voice by the meson) takes our heroes to the trap. Shark thanked Tom, "Young Tom, your ugly mug is very nice to see you again" - but for the first time in the HBO print Tom Shark fills! Most reference books are listed as running 92 or 93 minutes and it is formerly available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so the possibility of HBO print edits and / or time constraints is more. Adding insult to injury, MGM 2002 full screen in DVD, 76 minutes printed! Hopefully a restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> This image was copyrighted by Araden Films 1978.
