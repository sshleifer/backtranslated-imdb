I did not know anything about this movie before I saw it. It seems to be less than 80 known teenagers. How was it hurt in different ways than many other films of this era? <br /> <br /> I noticed how slowly this movie was made. It does not make one setup to put one single kill in showing characters. It takes time to build back stories, keeping a little bit of mystery about what can happen. I almost did not start thinking that nobody in this movie will really hurt. But in the last 15 minutes everything refers to the climate order, and then it gets rough graphics (it was a bad time to take a snack break - I could not finish my pizza after starting it). <br /> <b /> letters also seem to be slightly more three-dimensional than a lot of cheap scary flicks. In the opposition to the leading stereotypes of what you expect, the conversation mostly moves towards the level. For example, this girl's popular, Shobby, queen-bee does not always insult the girl, but she is able to doubt and give some consideration to others. <br /> <br /> So, in short, I felt that this film was somewhat original than I expected and was even better created. It attracts me, keeps me interested, and then lets me give it to me. I said, it's pretty cool at the end, but most of the family is friendly. I do not need to own it, but I'm happy I discovered it.
