I saw the PP on another night. I said, I was very impressed with what the film was like. It felt very much like a documentary. I think the film also highlighted the realistic possibilities. Vietnam's war in the film reached where China was involved. What if that happened? I think these scenes will be the same in the movie. We were camps in this country earlier ... and still ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for everyone ... especially radicals ... <br /> <br /> I'm saying that if I'm in that position That was that I would just lie off my ass. I love America and his grand fight (Wink Wink)
