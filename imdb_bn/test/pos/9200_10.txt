I usually did not comment on movies or TV shows but had to post comments about Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Naturally here in the UK we have 2/3 near the second season and I see the last series of season 3 (in other ways) I'm still gladding 9 Friday every Friday. <br /> <br /> From the first episode of the first episode I am the big fan of this show and all the 3 seasons in my own DVD, yes I can not wait to start season 4 October. <br /> <br /> So why do I love this show so much, to agree with the good posters .... James Kahn, I know a person can not create a team but the Big Ad Deline was made for Ken or perhaps It was different, I read that producers are considering Martin Shane for Ad Dalein ... in any way !! ! I also agree that the character of the Cane is very soft, I do not like it very strictly, Big Bad Eddie, which we saw in season 1 and 2, looks like he has mellowed. <br /> <br /> I said that any person is well-contributing to the team and certainly other council members Josh DÃ¼hell / Danny, James Lesur / Mike, Vanessa Marcel / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda, even Outside of the Cast members, like Charles Lill, Honey Gonner, Gundier, Jillian Dillin, Dean Kain as KC, like Mitchell Langley Mick, who can keep the character 6 or 7 times in the season One day, just as they are in single phase ena. <br /> <br /> <br /> This show contains everything, plays, actions, mysteries, smiles, romances, glitches, glamor and big celebrities who often play themselves. Many people may disagree, but one of the best shows on digital TV and I hope it can last for 4 long after season 4.
