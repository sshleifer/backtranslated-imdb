Why All Negative Reviews ??? Do you expect a movie like you want to be a homepage ??? We had a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me. Not an oscar contestant, just entertainment. You can really see how the movie can look, especially the internet will give everything today. I remember it was first released and the net was still new. Crazy and scary thoughts when I saw it for the first time; I was 15 years old and thought that someone could keep your information on the computer and destroy you. But, who can say that it does not happen ??? I do not want to invite a film neutrally to the movie, until I'm confronted. This is not my style. Average acting, suspicious and again, very entertaining. Sandra Bullock like Angela Bennett is very nice. This is my favorite movie because it's like computer talent, which I think is very interesting. It would be my favorite among all the movies I released in 1995, but I could not see it until 1996. My rating, 9/10 because it's a little slow.
