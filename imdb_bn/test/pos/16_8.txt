I went to the advance screening of the film thinking I started the 120-minute Chiegie Line, the silly plot and such a vulgar performance that made "The Postman" one of the most harmful exhibitions of our time movie. But I was amazed. An appeal to the audience to appeal to spirits that Costner has found a film to find out. It is astonishing that Ashton Corkar could work in such a serious role. It was astonishing that a movie was played and really kept my own emotions. I have not seen this coaster from 'Robin Hood': depth and complex emotions are full. He seems to have done the terrible role played with Kutcher's "Butterfly Effect". These two actors came up with a serious, attentive attitude in this movie which I saw in one of the best movies of this year. No, this is not an Oscar worthy movie. This is not an epic, or a deep social commentary film. Rather, it is a story about a simple subject that is enlightened in such a way that the audience brings a higher level of sympathy than the possible thought. I think it's a good film to make and I'm very surprised by this work. Say!
