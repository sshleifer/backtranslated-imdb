I am new to gaming, but if this film is close enough then I would have started soon! Last year Jane Cain grabbed it (only a trip made by my husband) and I love it! Even with a non-gamer like me, it's fun and accessible - so finally I started to sit in my husband's gaming group. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give a plot description, but if you are a gamer you will have to see this movie - and if you are not there you will have a great time despite yourself. Of course there is "jokes", but most of the movie is accessible to anyone. My only complaint: It was too long and it would be available on DVD. Soon, perhaps? ...
