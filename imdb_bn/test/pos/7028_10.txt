I first saw this movie after many years with my mother. I thought I would hate it, but to my surprise it is very impressive that it's cool. We've spent time recreating some of the movies ("Silvia? Yes yes?" Or "I'm sorry, you have to see that baby." Sometimes we see something we do not want to do in this world.) Every time my finance cracks up I imitate blue. Also the music is classic and fun to sing along, especially on the road trips. Of course I do not accept any of my male friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. I seriously see Dirty Dance once a month or more and it's just as good every time as it is. Jennifer Gray is also very cute in this movie. Its really bad his career really does not stop.
