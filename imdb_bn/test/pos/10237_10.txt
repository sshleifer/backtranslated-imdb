Nightbride is not only great, it is also unique, even taking pictures of other barracks, which do not lack basicity. A wonderful orientation for a book is a wonderful adaptation. It has several subtle symbols and references for horror patterns. Sure enough, thinking a bit, if one is careful. And, do not forget, a nice music score. Well, like special effects, naturally some old ones get faster, but this is probably the only error. I've seen it again just ten years later, and I still find some to recommend it.
