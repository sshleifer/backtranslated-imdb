Romana movie festival has been screened this morning for the newspaper, "NIO E Napoleon" is easy to love. First of all, it can depend on great production quality, nowadays very little Italian movies can do with wonderful settings and costumes. Cast is very great. Director Virus calls the young leader Elio Jermano "a young de Niro". Now, of course he's going too far, but sure boy can work. I liked his performance, and he (Tuscan) did a great job with accent. Daniel Auteuil did a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte. It's really awesome to be played in Italia, I hope to see work in Italy again soon. The supporter cast did very well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore might likely prefer the possibility, but they all gave good performance. Even Messemo Cichrina, known for being well-known in his own Moroccan films and trashy TV reality show, looked really good and was actually fun. Below is the "Dive" Monica Baluchi below. Sure, he was a little better than usual, but he was able to see the complete irrelevant (and the word) of Barrenesses Emilia, which included a good degree of dictatorship, he used his own umbro accent. Ladies Fryo Scarpeli and Niege The script itself is clever, very strong lines laugh and some very emotional moments. Sure, finally I'm surprised. The message is flawed: political ideologies that say full film may hate you blindly, but if you are more intimate you will learn that your hatred is like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, so that Suddenly it is hard to hate him; Then, in the last few minutes it says that it would have been good to shoot in the head at the beginning. Personally, I dislike these ideas very much. "IOE Napoleon" is still a lovely movie, which is the best presented in the festival yet (Fu and Hacks). My rating is 8/10
