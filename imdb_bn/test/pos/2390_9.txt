As an independent film producer of Long Island, and there are two theatrical releases under my producer / director belt. I always talked about how much I can learn from Fred Cr√©pender's product so that I started his "Eddie Monroe" as his inspiration of his fantastic budget, production, casting, settings and expertise-talent. My heart went out of his character, it's story and perfectly The trick / switches have ended, which brought the plot of the film to the ground! Places are surprisingly selected And the passion of the people of his character, he and his filmmaker brought together the realistic link of my bond with all the elements of Mr. Carpenter!
