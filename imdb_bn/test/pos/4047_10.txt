This is probably one of my favorite films. It tells the story of a girl named Garda (Chelsea Hobbs), who lost her mother at a very young age, was bought from her father. He loves the son of Kai. However, on his birthday, the snow queen (Breedgate Fonda) kidnapped her father's owner and uncle. Gurda went after Kaiy, and followed him through four seasons while trying to rescue him. <br /> <br /> I thought that this story was an excellent adaptation of the story with great performance. It has a great effect and the story fits together and is easy to follow. I think it's a great movie for all the families. I saw it that it has been seen every time and it has never been tired so I gave it a 10!
