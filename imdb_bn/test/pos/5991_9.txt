This movie is a hard-to-be out gem! This is Juliet's story, a general general cleaning woman who works in the company's big corporate office, and Rooney, similar president. He does not see any notice of him, at the same time, if he gets hurt at the same time to detach his company from him until he gives any notice to anyone till the plot. He has lost, nobody wants to turn on and discover Juliet when anyone believes. As a clear woman, no one cares for her, so they say disrespectful things in front of her and are skilled enough to help her helpless and helpless boss and are smart enough to use. The complexity is wild, he feels with five former husbands and fathers, he does not have such a common thing, who are still crazy with him and he thinks he is not so impressive. This movie does not follow an optimistic path and it does what it shows you. There are some pretty moving moments along with acting fantastic and side-by-side. Appears on the working class more intelligent than them, almost the same "Gossford Park" has shown that the top crust is not psychically cracked. I highly recommend this movie See it! 9/10
