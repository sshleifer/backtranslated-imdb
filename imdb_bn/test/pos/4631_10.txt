I think this movie was one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is ridiculous and chemistry between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There is not a dull moment in the movie and Debbie is always beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is about Shobber Maggi (Debbie Reynolds), who has filled an inferior Joe (Glen Ford). He immediately disliked him, but later he tears his clothes, then he returned with him on condition of going to one day. They finally end up marrying their dates after one kiss. Joe and Maggi go to Spain and they can not find anything in general but physical attraction, so Maggie proposes that they do not live as men and women for a month, which means that Joe did not allow Magby to kiss or sleep, Jo Its frustration is a ridiculous plot and a wonderful film. Can not be missed.
