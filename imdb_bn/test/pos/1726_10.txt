Like most people who commented, I was born after the last Sylvester MacAf and so I could not compare compared to the first two hundred doctors. I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of TARDIS and series. Since then, Doctor K and some of which have seen the old episode of old episode, but, like a doctor, there is a need for a resurrection to continue the series. 21st century doctor who is great, I think Martha was superb, almost a match to the doctor and if anything goes to Jack, he would become very cool in the CommonSale 4 or 5 series. <br /> <br /> To talk about Jack, the torch is also bright and you will see both of these programs (though it is certainly more suitable for kids). However, if you stress that it is not the same and not just a doctor, please stay in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
