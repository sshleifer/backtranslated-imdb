Michael Jackson is amazing. This short film displays the highest quality on the music video and can not out-bit this 'King of Pop' masterpiece! It shows Michael turning into a zombie and street dance with some spectacular danceography. The story is great, the scenes are amazing, the music is superb and the clip is fun, eye-popping, spectacular and a real spectator. Today, everyone is doing the same thing in the music video with the dance and film-based storyline that he invented. This Ground Breaking video will be remembered for MTV toast and always the greatest music video of all time!
