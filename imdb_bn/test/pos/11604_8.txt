I bought the DVD long ago and finally I went around watching it. I really enjoyed watching this movie because you will not have much chance to see such a much better quality Bollywood movie. It's been a great job but I want to say that it should be paying attention because it's easy to get lost. When you start watching the movie, do not do anything else! I would actually suggest reading these reviews with the viewers ... who are with spoilers before watching the movie. Raima Sen's first big performance which I saw. Aishwarya was easily at her best times. All the performance was strong, indicator and cinematography ... watch it!
