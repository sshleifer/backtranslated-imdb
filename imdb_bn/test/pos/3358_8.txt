I'm a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing that will ever change. I got all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and every time I see / see their brand new. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is replayed with a specific episode, Man and Hour, Enemy Between Gates, Battlefield School and many other different edges. Instead of Captain Square, the role of the new general was a brilliant step - especially when he did not cash the check (which rarely happened). <br /> <br /> It follows through the initial years of receiving equipment and uniforms, start-up and training. All in all, this is a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two draw backs. A German German cant pronounce accent (a come, German letter like us can not pronounce "wa") and two known Janet Davis instead of Leisure Fraser welding. I like other movies like Lease but he does not carry it properly and Jeanette Davis may be a better choice.
