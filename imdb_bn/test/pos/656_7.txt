It's hard to find a movie like a 70-year-old John Vincent's movie, it does not cut like a desert. 'Blue-blue' dresses are being dressed in their hat tricks, failed recruits are sent to packing. Vincent stops in a bar and Richard Cere comes to a very young age who has returned as a hard-core Marine 'Ryder' in the Pacific. Gare's character has already thought about awakening and depression, and after stealing his 'blue' uniform, he took advantage of Vincent's innocence and beaten him in Elioye. The character of Vincent, whose name is Marian, takes the Garry outfit and suddenly becomes Marine 'Ryder'. Marion leaves the way to the Hip-Weiming, and Norman Norman Rockwell stopped in a small town. In the local caf√© he met Rose Hoodkins, who immediately caught his eyes. While with Hudkins' parents, Marin draws all sorts of attention from the city dwellers. Mr Hoodkins suspects Marion and wonders how a marine 'rider' may still be innocent. This story brings Japanese internal camps, because the 'hunting' of the dacoits is the victim of three escapes. Marion was shot accidentally during this shoot. But still a happy ending, which made me a bitfuddled. I liked a little more drama! However, it captures JMV at the top of its 70's performance. BUSTER and BILLIE, in the mid-70s, Blue Marin and White Line Fever had amazingly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heart-breathing at the same time !!! During the course of his career, he made a lot of quality films and continued it with the best TV show AirPlay in the 80's. He did a very good job as a hedge, silently watched his way of behavior (in his uniform), he traveled all over the country. He must have done some stunts - after the end of the film there is a frustrating river scene - and it looks like he is throwing me in the river! But in reality, at the height of its popularity, this film can do more with the talent of JMV and its beauty. Innocence can only be so attractive Evil, as searching in "Buster and Delivery", is much more dramatic! However, Glynis O'Connor is as delightful as Rose. The whole look of the movie is like Norman Rockwell painting. Outdoor scenery is fantastic - should be impressed in Canada.
