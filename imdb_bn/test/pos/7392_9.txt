I think this movie is different from most movies. It was exciting in a way, and it does not matter what others say, I say, I am surprised at the final solution. Of course it does not see !! Although it is sad, it is valuable to watch. I can not think of any such movie! Actors knew what they were doing. If you suck this movie you will probably tell what most people will say. But, if someone says that this movie is general, I absolutely agree. And Norman Raidos should also be noticed more. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm scary but I liked it very much. It was a mess, but who care? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
