Fantastic film! Wow - this is really a treatment. I can not believe I discovered a gem of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She can learn things she does not think of, and the couple can learn something After spending time a bit unclear. <br /> <br /> Just believe that you are so perfect for their portions that you see this happen in the real life before you. <br /> <br /> Newcomer Emily Grace is really beautiful, yet she has done a fantastic job as a lazy alice. Emily gives you the feeling that she understands what she understands, and you can see how she can see how she develops in the film. I'm sure we will see Emilie in more movies in the future. <br /> <br /> Contrary to saying something else, lighting and photography were just perfect. The edit is very well done - the right way to combine highway images that give you the feeling that you are traveling with Cast on their road trips. <br /> <br /> I did not see it on the big screen, but I can only request everyone to come out and see it. More movies like this * just * what we need to do. <br /> <br /> SF
