I can rarely say it a great movie but it's entertaining. In my case, I was released this movie, some of the film's age was similar to the junior campers. My camp year memories come back to see my picture. There have been some surprises in this movie, such as taking the camp director to his bed and leaving him on the road, some leading to jump over trees or lakes. There is no other trick. When I went to the camp, campers and counselors pulled similar stunts, such as running underwear, flag pole, canoe wars and women's cabin raid. After I grew up, I spent the holidays in these girls' cabins, which I was participating was carefully guided by counselors so that we could not find women embarrassed, but at that time I thought it was real and fun. That is the MEATBALLS (MB). <br /> <br /> <br /> MB is not only about the beauty of the camp but also the beauty of being young and discouraged. Megabytes give pre-adolescent, teens and young people a great example of living in their summer, without having to hook up with girls and girls, without any other worry, they can have fun as soon as they do with hooking up with boys and girls. High school and college The opening title song goes, "Are you ready for summer? ... there is no book, no books, and teachers do not see dirty ..." It is well seen by summer school kids. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed two campers spas and fixtures. What boy, nerd or joke, did all of the camps spend trying to comfort some beautiful campers? What people do not want to take by other campers and consultants? Although these two characters are at the top, I can bet everyone who sees this movie but can not like these two. These two characters are PEARUTS to Charlie Brown and three companies Jack Triper and Larry Dallas. I would be disappointed that most of the visitors carry the competition for Spaz and try to "stomach" the competition for even fun dog eating dogs. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie was the usual looking kids and consultants. A super model for conventional clothing consultants or campers. Jumping behind this image and seeing this movie and when it seems that life like this movie was fun.
