I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone. Damian Chappa and Jennifer Tilly have played their role fully. Only the characters take you to the movie. The instruction was also excellent. The most creative shot that I've ever seen I was stuck to the screen throughout the whole film, one was not slow. The film has a lot of action-packed scenes, cars, and so on. The film is the only best way around the surroundings. If you like real movies, see this because you will be at the full end of your seats. I keep this movie on my top ten list, because the movie does not have any slow moments and it's my type of movie 2. up thumbs up, all the way !!!!!!!!!
