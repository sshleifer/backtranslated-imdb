This show is my favorite one. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lorraine Graham is the perfect friend of Larry Gillmore, Rory's best friend who is single mother. Alexis Blaylele is one of the best and intelligent Rory Gilmore and the best friend of Coco Edena Rai, like Lane Kim. I love the wicked dialogue, it shows what makes it unique about the show. Emily Gilmour and Edward Herman, like Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is one of a kind of watch dance and band members watch as a joy. The community, Miss Patty, Babbet, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Dose, Kirk and others are always very fun, playful and interesting, which makes the sunny one-liners stand out. This show has been so old for so many years that it will not be old. Gilmore Girls is a real and clever show that keeps you watching. How good it is I give this show a 10/10 rating.
