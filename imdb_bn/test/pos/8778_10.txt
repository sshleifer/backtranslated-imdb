I consider Sabotruk as Hitakoich's first "American" film, because this story has completely happened in the USA <br /> <br /> This picture has a brilliant view. The Stateau of Liberty Scene, pouring water from the Barry Kenn Bridge, the water fall scene is amazing. This is not a mistake of hitkook that he did not get the actors he wanted. Hitcoak originally wanted Gary Cooper for foreign reporter and Sabotur's leading role. But Gary Cooper was not interested in a thriller. Another reason is not big for Hitco because he was not the top manager. Though Rebecca was a huge success, most of the success of the film went to producer David and Seljnik. For example, David and Seljonik received the best picture Oscar for Rebecca. And Hitako did not get the best director Oscar for Rebecca. After the Foreign Correspondent (1940) Hitako began to draw some attention. But the public gave him less budget for Sabtur (1942). Hitcoook tried to get Joel MacCrya for the film because he was willing to work with Hitko again with a lower salary. He enjoyed working with Hitako, a foreign journalist (1940). But he was unavailable. So came the role Robert Cummings. Hit coke was called "a suitable actor" by Robert Simings. I thought he did his best. She was a lesser known actor when she refused to play the role of leading male role in much less actors. <br /> <br /> As the female leading leading, Hitler wanted Margaret Sullivan or Barbara Stanwyck for the leading role. They were not interested. So decided to play the role of Universal Priscilla Lane. I read in a book that it was one of his favorite movies. <br /> <br /> I like the scene of Blind Man's house. That's my favorite scene. If we hear close to the dialogue of the scene happening at Uncle Phillip's house, then we will see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) was reading the character of Barry Kane while entering his house. When Barry entered his house, he heard Barry's hammer. Through the conversation, he realized that Barry was not a criminal. We see his ability to hear through those scenes. For example, Barry gets the sound of a car "Is it coming in a car?" Uncle Philip says "I think two cars." Uncle Philip was right. We see the next scene 2 cars. Presley Lane has done a fine job of keeping her role. He was no big star. But I was really good at its performance. Another bright scene in Uncle Philip's house where he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin), "Are you afraid, Pat? That makes you so cruel?" I thought Auto Krueger played wildly villain. HitKo wanted Harry Carey's reputation. But he refused. Harry Care is famous for his role, "Mr. Smith goes to Washington." I would like to mention more about this picture. But I think my post is taking too long. <br /> <br /> Each hitcock movie specializes in its own way. I'm sure Hitachi fans will like this picture. I rate 10 out of 10.
