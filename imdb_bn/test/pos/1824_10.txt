It was 1983 and I was 13 years old. When I was working with my parents, I saw Valley Girl on HBB one night. After it was over I immediately wanted to talk to someone about it. My best friend also saw this and it became our favorite movie. Until we can read it we saw it until every weekend. We got up and started laughing at our parents and laughing late at night. We start worshiping the main character Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah decree. I'm not saying this great classic. Although it's for me personally And I realize that the whole Valley Girl Talk has become boring, but it's 80's. But in the heart of the movie deeply - it is a love story, and a familiar but good. The girl meets the boy and has an instant connection to both sides. Julie's friends do not like her- she does not fit, she does not go to school, there is no money. The football player loved her with her ex-boyfriend though she is a blurry. He sacrificed his life-his happiness for the happiness of his friends. And he has this really cool supporter Hippie Dad. It was Nicholas Cage's first movie and his first acting role. One minute he is absolutely delightful and the next incredibly touching and romantic. His friend Fred is very funny. If you are a teenager at the age of 80, then you would like this movie or at a very short time it will bring back memories. This is not my favorite movie, but it is one of my favorites, probably my top ten. I look forward to releasing this DVD from DVD. You need to sign a petition to be released on DVD, go to the Dobor Farman's website and if you like 80 music, there are 2 soundtracks in the movie.
