One of the previous reviews of this movie is "For the big fans of lead actors or foreign romance / adventures for Hollywood fans ...", as it was not enough to love! Anyone, after watching this movie, complains about Kaneri's accent, or historical animosity, or the lack of political motivation or lack of any additional film concerns, does not just like movies. See it and awed by the stars-strength of two leads, exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the true escapist film brave courage. This is proof that Hollywood can use it as "when it really wants to". A tough 8/10
