I would probably call it "Devils Run" and the kind of movie that's equivalent to it, though it's probably a bit better. I love the horrors of the 70s and most of the material I love is making other movies so that it was easy to enjoy. People on their holiday stumble across a small town where some of the people seem to be gripped by hysteria. It seems that the children have disappeared. After the initial attempt to flee from this place, the family has stopped at the city end and found their way, but did not find the house before leaving home and Mummy and Dad died. It seems that there is a different kind of center in a senior citizen community center in our town, they are all worshipers of Satan and they need the children to renew their lives so that they can continue to serve them. No one seems interested in giving up their kids for this initiative. It is fairly enthusiastic that it is today's horrific and strange phenomenon, such as the Gourmet Bull, or the thrilling events that people today are trying to jump over the movies, which seem to replace real fears. As Toby, Hann Kimbo (Alvy Moore), a Sheriff deputy who reads UFO magazines, and known as LQ Jones Sheriff, and is a very famous character known as the father of the blocked family, from our "Green Ask" And Stringer Martin acted as a doctor who doubled his work to inform his fellow villagers. This is a good thing but sometimes a pressure towards the confusing, but works fairly well and is recommended for the 70's awesome fans. 10 out 8
