Good movie, the role was especially directed from Eri Ibin (Lumbubba) and very well operated. [2] <br /> <br /> It also shows how the Lemumba was cornered by the Belgians, the United States and the United Nations, and how they did it with the 'Communist' people as they did with Nicurama, Kennit, Niere, and many other true African leaders. It shows how Western countries promote democracy and have some other behind their mind. This is the story of injustice, struggle and cruelty. <br /> <br /> It shows how Lumuba can not control its people, yes they were her people, but before we blame her, she got enough that she appointed someone in her government like Mtutu? Or her colleague had other things in their mind, find out and watch the movie! Surely the mule did, before plundering the country for the next 35 years, he escaped from the country before he disappeared. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> There should also be more explanation about the country, the Congo Kinship (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was formerly known as the win under the Mayutu. He explained if he could keep the second largest country in Africa. What was going on in Tashom and Katanga? If you see the movie, Tshomamba was going to control the Katanga region (if I was not mistaken), the world's largest copper producer. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch. . You'll learn something new about Africa, it's the leader and its people and probably your eyes will open why this continent is involved in war.
