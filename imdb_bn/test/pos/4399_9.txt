This year I saw the best film in 2000. Cohen brothers have never dropped me before, and they did not even do this time. <br /> <br /> This is one of the rare movies of today. Wicked, intelligent and widely entertained. I left the movie with a warmth of my heart. Of course, there are a lot of coherent stuff - weird letters and special gadgets, well-developed plots and magic camworks. However, a cohen film is not the same as any other cohen photo, if you ignore their general quality then <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was a great surprise for me that Clone was very good. But the real master performance in this movie comes from Team Black-Nesson. But the others are fantastic. <br /> <br /> A movie which is accompanied by a lightweight comedy with musical instruments that develops its story cyclone and music of old time - harmful with intelligence and intelligence. Thats a very impossible combination. But it's just what this image is like
