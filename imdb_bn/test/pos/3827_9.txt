To get started, it can be my favorite of STOs. Besides the critical comments of Stuose, I will throw a little more: gaining the technology, when the enterprise blows its photon at the top of the blaze, they hit directly (I believe) to be strong so that there is a problem Very little damage can occur with the Roman ship, so that the space is in conflict with the vacuum. <br /> <br /> Some of my Romulan Commander Romulan "Protocol" or a problem on their beliefs on their leadership, as long as it does not war with the attacks of weak targets (outposts in neutral areas). Also, I do not think that the commander will fall for basic or simple tricks such as Kirk played, such as "playing the dead", or falling down, which does not seem to force him to attack when he enters the enterprise. <br /> < Enterprise: I am surprised that after seeing the methods of attacking before the Roman ship, Sullu will say, "Are they surrendering?" When it first attacked the enterprise. <br /> <br /> In an emergency, when the speaker can do the repair only under the control of arms, it can repair exactly how. <br /> <br /> In the final attack, I think the roman ship was not too long (so long as the speaker couple could reduce the ace and return to the weapon and the phototon turns torpedoes and burn them in the fire. I used to, but I had to work with certainty technicians and budgets). <br /> <br /> From a positive side: This is a good play on the Rouollan ship, which introduces us to the Romulans. The great view with the Styles is a good deal of human knowledge of the Romulans people. There's also up to its conflict right with Spock. I used to see the character of Styles for some time, if it does not have anything else to add strength. <br /> <br /> It's just fun that I talk negative and crazy, (I'm sure there's more). But it is as good for me !! "Balance of Terror" I have always been at the top of my ST ranking.
