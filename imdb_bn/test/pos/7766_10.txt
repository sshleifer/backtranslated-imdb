I try to be different in watching my movie. I can easily enter "Pride and Prejudice" as I enter the "Appearance Laws". Love Jones is my favorite of all time, it's the standard through which I judge a modern city romantic comedy. Feeling very good, riding on Lakeshore Drive on the motorcycle Nia and Darius's shot is one of the classic 3-second movie shots all the time. Of course nobody remembers it. When it comes out, I can be a new reflection for the construction of modern city films, good actors, guns, etc. The film industry disappointed me at a certain degree, sometimes you were drumming, or roll bounce, or Tyler Perry's "Why I Was Married" So whenever I see "my people" presented in a very professional and stylish screen, I pop into love jones. Any movie that has been made, which many people have, and opinions for it. But it's my personal best. My favorite line from love jones "baby, I just want to come and talk !!"
