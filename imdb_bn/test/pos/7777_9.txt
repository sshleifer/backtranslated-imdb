This movie did not play much in the theater. It is a rich, transformed love story, credible, all-human character, who is very busy gaming and recognizes their heart as true thinking. One of the most delightful aspects of this movie is in Chicago, hip, artistic, educated, middle-aged African-Americans, who discuss poetry, music and literature. Another is his royal fiona, Lorenz Tate - and if you are half his fan you will see this movie! His adult lust and weakness is perfect for Darius's role. Nia Long also shines as Nina, who loves Darius to love him, but he is afraid to break the "rules". A great movie to watch curled up on the couch with your sweet!
