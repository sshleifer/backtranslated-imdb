This movie has hurt me and I love it! Love! It haunted me for the day I think that Erica screams together and cry together kind of character. The most horrific sexual scenes ever caught on film. So far Hanck's work is best. He is the only living director to redefine Kubrick's speed. Violence in this movie is fantastic. In a word, the image is about self-animating. In one sentence, the film is trying to stop hating yourself and it is looking for love to find a hopeless hope.
