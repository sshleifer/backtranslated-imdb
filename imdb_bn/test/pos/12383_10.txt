This is the first then good. The movie is open with Sheriff Sam. Then, Sam and Anna packs up the bag and go to Tropicana and the tokens along with the jack tags. <br /> <br /> People shoot, get glasses with throat, get screamed by anviles, get killed by snowballs, stop arms, anti-frozen molten, icicles down the neck, hurt with the face, stabbed with icicles, eyes gouged out, head explosions, drownings, hangings, lobsters shoved in the mouth, slit throats, frozen death, pot and pans, fingers are closed, iskl by mouth, bite neck, explosion of people, blaze Usaragolakaguli, and is moved in misranakaridera. <br /> <br /> Snowballs are sunny, they put it on a blender and turn it on, then say it was 'fun' they put in a waffle thing and burned it. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie. Then they start thinking about another way to kill it, and frost answers, 'it's not nice' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 10 stars.
