Uzumaki is a strange film, but I felt that some lines of the story could be dedicated. There is no reason for the development of a character that has separated me from the film, which is satirical, because it is all together, because this film captures you with a lot of little spiral effects and stunning scenes of infection. Initially overall cinematography throws me out, but if you use it overall you start to see the beauty of this curved movie. This is a great movie, if you look for a finder with too much material or deep money. This is a terrific horror movie which is not really awesome or suspicious but in some way ... eerie
