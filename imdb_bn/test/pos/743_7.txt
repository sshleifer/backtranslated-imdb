The young, aspiring nurse Mrs. Charlotte (Rosie Holotik) was sent somewhere to do a psychotic shelter. During the 3 days, he encounters strange events, even one of his bedroom patients, even though he is still there. Brain patients keep a little eye (usually by the judge), but there was an old crazy BD (Ria McAdam) of my choice. The storyline is fine, and the acting is surprisingly okay, but after a short time it becomes a little more. But, still fun, quirky, weird, and original. Note: The thing inside the basement is very awesome, so the title is a small banana.
