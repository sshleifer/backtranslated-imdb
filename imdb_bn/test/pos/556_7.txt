Susan Sarandon and Natalie play Portman Adele and Ann Auguste, the single mother, who is "visionary" and her glorious, progressive girl's work. Adele, want to start a new town in a big city, move them to California from Wisconsin. <br /> <br /> Some serious and sad moments are exceptional, not particularly memorable, unless. It pushes some mental buttons, making sure that. The best thing to do is throw it a solid, and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in leadership - even if their characters are once one dimensional. <br /> <br /> It may be good, it can be bad. <Br /> <br /> I gave ten to seven.
