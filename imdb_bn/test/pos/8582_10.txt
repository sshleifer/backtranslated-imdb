After just four days before purchasing the video, I have seen several times that a great movie. Yes I'm Colin Fit fan and Colin is his usual talented, natural gorgeous self. The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fasie (Sammy, Nomi's 7-year-old son) was very special and was very normal to see. They were fun together in the sunny and touched my heart strings. The scenes I liked most were sitting on the shackle of Sami and Matt Wall, and Matt then lagged behind a wall in a sunny fashion (I would not publish the content of their discussion to not waste the plot). It was also very humorous that Matt, Colin and Fishi were perfect in this scene about Sammy's sexuality, and so strange to the adult and child that could be very normal. At the end of the scene, Colin's words and face were so happy and all said! Only bright. Credit certainly, of course, Sammy will have to go to Fassy Roberts for his artful painting. She played such a lovable and cheeky child character. The two actors were just perfect together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nii) was completely balanced, and I could no longer agree that it was good to see chemistry among them, showing love, excitement and of course passion. How their blue romance shows how growing they are, shows how their cultural and social divide affected their relationship, and it was good to see how good it is to see how Colin and Nee sensitively discover, see and accept how these differences are matte and nimi. Was there. This makes me correct on TV and guesses the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Matt's weakness and Colin's painting on the side of the teenager were also fully illustrated, so I found that when Matt was so meaningful to Samyari and looking at the child, he (Matt) felt that his romance with Same Sam Mother Nami / Was going on the path of relationship Sammy did not feel very frustrated, angry and frustrated with Matt for this behavior, and as a result Sammy and Nomi threatened to damage Matt's special relationship. The special character of Collins 'entered into the character of a character' and was shown to the audience in different aspects of the character, there was too much evidence and a pure magician to look at. I should know that Colin has so much good relations with young actors (see, 'My life is so beautiful' and 'Missed film'). <br /> <br /> I like Matthew and his relationship. His wife, Jenny, was both nice to show the dark side and tension between both the listeners and their marriage, and it seems like 'Happy Merryes' are not quite what they think from outside. <br /> <br /> I will not forget to mention a devotee whom I used to think very interesting, seriously! Nimi's mother and family were also happy and emphasized the importance of Nimi culture and its condition. <br /> <br /> <br /> Give my review credibility, what I want to do is just negative comments that why the script writers break the matte's car is enough Quantity was not explained, there was only a vague suggestion from Niemi, something was wrong in her heart. However, it did not stop from enjoying the film far away from me. I would like to tweak the tape for second tape. <br /> <br /> I think it was all in this picture, amusement, lift and I like rich colors and sunny scenes. The film makes the cold winter day warm and laughs :-)) There was all the necessary ingredients, smile, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama and warm feelings are a good factor, yes, there are many delicious Colin Fart moments in a 'wet shirt' With scenes of very cool Colin, it can not be missed by a fan; what else can she do ;-)) <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie ;-) I will recommend it to any fan of the Colin Firth
