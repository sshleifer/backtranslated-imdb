I rent this movie without hearing anything about (or reading) this movie. What a shame! This movie is intelligent, malicious, ridiculous, swift, and really ridiculous. The letters manage to get better, based on very heavy on tired, tired stereotypes. It was refreshing to see. I did not think marketing would help turn this non-mainstream movie into a hungry-intelligent-comedy mainstream. These days are so rare these days, with the quality of conversation and the ease with which the actors extend the magnitude, frustration and comedy. I think the actors could certainly take part in this rich thing. How the National Treasurer was first in the box office for three weeks can be mentioned - It is so weak in many ways to mention it so weak. I'm guessing that I'm happy that movies like "Saving .." are still being made anywhere.
