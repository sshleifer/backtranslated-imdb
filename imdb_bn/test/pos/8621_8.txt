JFK junior's new information was very hard to come and this fine movie was very low, but it was a pleasure to see. The welding was very good and the script was good, though it was also good to have some documentary choices. My only complaint was that it was not long enough. Perhaps the two-point film could tell us more about his "pre-George" day and his relationship with his mother, sister and other relatives. Some of the books, "American gold," Richard Blora has improved the film. WTBS should be appreciated for such an entertainment movie production.
