I'm a 55-year-old gay white man. Since I do not watch TV, I watch at least 250 films a year, mostly in DVDs. Keep notes of the movies I have seen and rate them. In December 2003, I saw five films just like eight films. So, I got eight times more ratings than at least 700 other recent movies. Mr. Bell is more modest in his film version. Eight are a great movie. And, this is the result of two "first" for me. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie for the first time, and in the last half of my life I started crying and crying, something that happened to me before. (Five minutes into the picture, I knew it would be very good.) When Jason heard whistman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, this is one of the film's cool kisses, and the scene in the film's most harmful and unforgettable scene. When Pip blows the candle at the end and the credits are rolling, I'm tired. I am glad I love the happy ending. I started crying. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the preview of the trailer and TLA and thought, "OK, this 800,000 dollar or so Indi is really great?" So, I immediately saw eight again, something that happened just three times. And, EIGHTEEN blew my shoe again once again, so more. Then I saw the "The Making of Animation" documentary and was completely overwhelmed by Cast and Mr. Bell. <br /> So, I thought I would again look at eight people again by managing commentary. I have never seen a film thrice a night. For the third time, at 3:00 am I knew that I just enjoyed a great movie; So far, eight of my top 20 films are now # 10. And, in a very small universe of the great gay or gay-subtext film, Brokeback Mountain, eight, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> thank you Mr. Bell! Eight bright and fully available, a fantastic cast, a nicely moving, different score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, complete suit and crawling song. I can go, but I will not wake up much more. <br /> <br /> This picture must have been nominated for the Oscars, of course, for the best picture. Without exception, performance was all surprising. Miss Guill's lovely, proud voice had a wonderful epiphany. And Sir Yan McKenel? Drops Surprisingly <br /> <br /> In one year alone, one reason for the horror film (some of the $ 200 million in diameter) is one reason, it is a subtle, magical, unique and surprising, perfect "fiberage egg" enfolding an unforgettable heart. Finally (I'm committed), my second "first" - I never commented before commenting on any movie. <<br /> Thanks again, Mr. Richard Bell! Breathing talent Give this guy 100 million dollars for his next picture! He turned 700,000 US dollars into one of the best 50 films of all time. If I had cash, I would give him a $ 75,000 a year's living and match up with any fund raised for his next film. Mr. Bell is already a great director at the age of 31. Can you imagine him at the age of 45? <br /> <br /> Intelligent and Wicked, gentle and cruel, intelligent, cruel, yet mad, cool and thrilling, gentle, hunting, unforgettable: eighth, greatness.
