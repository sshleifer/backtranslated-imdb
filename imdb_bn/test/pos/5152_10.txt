Anderson Anderson "Du Levande" is not entirely original as the antagonist of the previous movie "Sanger franc andrew washingen". There is still anarchical totality of the movie. Some movie-making conferences have still been cast: Most actors do not see anything like what they expect in the movie, and the shots take a long time. Most of the time the camera can not move, but people go around it. The shots start somewhere and many times build up in amazing proportions. W.G.Sbald comes to mind the literary mind with the same technique. Many of the suspension scenes during the time of investing each shot are really high. There is a story and not - the viewer is allowed to develop into his own mind. This movie is positive. It is determined not to see all of these negatively and at the same time social injustice will not pass. One of the messages from me is that all the failures and accidents are not always serious. Awesome movies.
