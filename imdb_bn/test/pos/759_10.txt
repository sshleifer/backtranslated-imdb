I got this movie, because I did not come where I was. I waited patiently and the wait was worth. I completely fall in love with this movie. Chemistry between Walters and Grint, as they worked together in Harry Potter films. The woman who exercises her tolerance, truly religious mother, she truly believed me and how profusely she was, I think she plays a great role. I only wish to see it in sex scenes or more. LOL, but of course we must use our imagination how it went down. (snickers) I totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want to see a good movie Rent this movie. I really liked Rupert a lot and it's great to see Harry Potter watching movies, though I love him as Ron Wesley. The whole cast has done a great job and I hope Rooptart will work out of Harry Potter to expand his skills!
