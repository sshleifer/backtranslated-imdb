This is a well-designed piece made from the favorite master of every terror. Naturally, the technological elements are outstanding for camera work and lighting (especially for film time). I did not think the first part of the photo was very exciting, but the next thing must have been made for an exciting scene after each other. <br /> <br /> I do not like about this movie. Farrell Granger's role is to Gane Henes. Somehow, I did not find him very trustworthy. On the other hand, Robert Walker's brutal 'bad guy' brilliantly as Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend it.
