Movie observers often say that three memorable photos of great movies <br /> <br /> The scenes will be considered really great. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Broadcast News <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James Brooks! Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have ever been good <br /> <br /> I love this movie for a lot of reasons. This is great because it makes you laugh <br /> <br /> and it makes you cry. Albert Brooks is a lot <br /> <br /> Great line and many unforgettable scenes: # 1 (sunny) "I <br /> <br /> I can sing and read, when I read, I sing," Midnight train < br /> <br /> Georgia plays in the background. # 2 (smiled) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Harun's <br /> (A Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything seems to be controversial about journalism. Finally, # 4 (sunny) can forget this scene where Harun <br /> <br /> publishes news on weekends .... ridiculous. This film will win Oscar! <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
