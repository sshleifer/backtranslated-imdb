This is a mysterious vision of hell in our contemporary world. Due to the social criticism of our shallow, commercially-based values, this film creates an extraordinary view of the "war hell" clich√©, which is concerned by the captain of the Special Forces by a mythical journey raised in Cambodia, whose goal is (uncredited) a rogue colonel, Behind the concept of trial. When I saw the apocalypse in 1980, I thought it was a deep flawed composition. In particular, I found the final part of the journey with Brando, which contains the heart of Conrad's, which is rather annoying. Finally I found the Apocalypse Redox now and errors were taken care of. Of course, the best film in Redx, certainly one of the best 100 films, made a perfect masterpiece. Brando's performance is now complete and complete, probably less mysterious, but more deep. Martin Shane is one of the best-acting ensembles ever involved in the heart. It's great for a great Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. to spot in the primary screen performance, which eventually means how they will play prominently. The work of Robert Duval, Fred Forest, Lawrence Fishburn and Sam Button was greatly enhanced by additional footage. If you have never seen this movie, leave it for the original and direct Redox. I hope we meet all the gaps in the deeply flawed potential masterpieces that could get a gang from New York Redox to Scorcese.
