My opinion by Clint Eastwood and especially John Malkovich is a great performance of his best one. Malkovitch incredibly on the floor at the bottom right on the floor it was a nail. Eastwood is Agent Mike Hargin, an elderly and senior secret service agent who has finished his barbarous fraud and followed routine recruitment. But in the first activity seems to be complex and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al-A "wacko" were sent to investigate a threat on the president. Like a fate, Harbin suddenly lost a misguided almond, but a professional lone sheep to choose a large bone with the White House. Hargin entered the "booth" world, so he expressed unreasonable attention to the bad people and unreasonable praise for him. Horrigan was JFK's top agent and blamed himself for Dallas, Texas when he was killed and what happened in Texas. Now he thinks the current head of state will have to stop to join the presidential body list. But this killer has turned on the table on Horrigan and now he is hunting for a life or death game of cat and mouse game. Who will win? Who will die? Pres-save It is a time against the enemy to protect it from the enemy, which can go to any person. As a nail better in my favorite secrets service movie and well
