There was so much hope for Teleton Retro that I would bring it in the air, but instead of doing these shows, they do not get those who are not fit for treatment, they are some things that I saw in the air several times ago. <br /> <br /> Centurion was the highlight of my pre-teen years. I know that may seem a little cluttered but it is true. GI Duck after daw Joe, Jack Rockwell is one of those cartoon characters that I really had a crush. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that Teleton Retro is not seeing the same way my generation people. Otherwise Teleton Retro would be much better than it.
