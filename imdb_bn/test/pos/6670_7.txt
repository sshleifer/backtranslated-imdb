What are the people ~~~ I can hear? A cry of Kevin's cry? Well if you did not shout for 'normal suspect' then I would recommend changing your prescription. However, this is not a first-class movie, it's a very well-produced story, which is almost believable. What do you think about an alien perhaps you? All the acting top things and the first I've seen a balanced, satirical alien. I can say only enjoyable and for the whole family (if not for the scene after the movie). Seven star
