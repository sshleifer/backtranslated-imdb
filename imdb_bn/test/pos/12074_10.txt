Anne Margaret did any work in film making history. I felt she was Mrs. Fray. Anne Margaret could be one or two films, which was not seen after her debut in "Pocket Full Character" with Betty Davies in 1961. I think its been fully rated in the industry. He was nominated for the role of "Who Will Llie My My Child", but he was ignored. He was snubbed like he was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in "Knowledge of Kernel" and "Tommy". After all, I think everyone had a wonderful acting with all the children "who would love my children". Yes, this is a sad movie (as can be true story), but good value of time. Thank you.
