As a longtime fan of the studio Ghebli and especially Haibo Miyazaki movies, I went to the movies from the very first day. When I left the theater, I had a strange feeling that some were absent, feeling this "witch" I was feeling before in all Miyazaki movies, but I could not say why it failed at this time. After thinking about the other Goby movie, I can understand the reason: Most of the material in this film was a great Miyazaki anime: intelligent characters, wonderful what animations, a great soundtrack protected by Joe Haseyashi and the warm story tells you that a high quality Japanese animation film Viewing experience. However, there was a lack of two components: a deeper story and dramatic. In the "Totoro" case such as "Spirited Away" or "Princess Monocoque", it is not really necessary that the story is really necessary, but the purpose of this film was to entertain small children with a simple story line. Hands, this story was simply very patronizing. The character was not developed, because I could not connect to the original characters, the dramatic scenes were limited and not very long. I hate to give only 7 stars for Miajaki's film, because I could have given 10 stars in all the previous films, but at the moment it was not a great "gazelle" experience.
