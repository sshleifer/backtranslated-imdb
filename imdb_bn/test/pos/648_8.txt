I found this movie on Netflix and added it to my queue. When I got it I was not frustrated because it was fun when I saw it in a local drive in a local drive. <br /> <br /> This is surprisingly made with your startup. Various characters begin their journey across America as they "Honky Tonk Freeway, on America's wheels." It was a strange comedic role for William Dewan because I reminded him of Kennedy in the 1974 TV movie "Missiles of October" and felt that no one could pull that drama along with that dramatic character. <br /> <br /> This reminds me of "Dick Van Dyke" in "Cold Turkey" where Van Dyke plays the local minister. The role of Deyen as mayor, minister, and activist was ideal for small towns, so it considered its character to be fun and real. <Br /> <br /> There was also a target of the loss of families in Howard Hesmman and Dave Gar's Vivis. Anyone who visited small and small children across the country, (we still have there?) Will appreciate those scenes. <br /> <br /> The scenes of a small city struggling to survive reminds me that I grew up in such a small town, but they managed this impressive and humor which you often see in small towns. It is tragic that many small freeway systems make the cities disappear and give a ridiculous view of what they have to do to survive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a lightweight comedy which is not without any special message but laughable surveillance in America in the early 80's. Looking at the best value if you need a bit of good pleasure
