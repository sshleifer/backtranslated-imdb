I was blown away by this film. I am a person who risks with movies, especially sometimes not appealing to me, and I am told to pay this money. I mean, wow! Even my young children enjoyed the film (at the time of 5 and 6), although I am sure it was not focused on their age group. <br /> <br /> This movie was also clean, which is very nice plus. It feels great to sit in a movie that you enjoy with stupidity, violence (except for a brief scene) or anyone else can be morally objectionable. <br /> <br /> This movie has brought you next to the journey so ready to believe because you are acting great. You feel the huge feelings illustrated along with the letters. <br /> <br /> I will never see a golf movie at the edge of my seat, but I will not be able to help how to become interested in this one. It has nothing to compare with me because I have not seen golf before reality or golf, but everyone here has done a great job to keep mobility and emotions economical. The score has also been wonderful; Excellent, excellent score. <br /> <br /> If you do not think this will be your kind of movie but see it. You may be pleasantly surprised. I was certainly.
