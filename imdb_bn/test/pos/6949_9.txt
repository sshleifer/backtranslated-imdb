This is one of my favorite movies. Rip Torne and Tantu Cardinal's performance are excellent and their performance with the reality of movies, scenes and movies is quite strong. Look at the truth and say, this is logging, mountainous people, who refused to give up their life in the name of progress and development. Horse music is very unique and some of the scenery adds an eerie quality. After watching this movie for the first time, I had to go out and buy video and soundtracks. Overall, a cool kind of movie with panic explosion. Both the trials and their role in Cardinal are very credible. In the same category as the winter people with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, this film is another favorite.
