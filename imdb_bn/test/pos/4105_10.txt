Throw is commensurally selected and balanced. This cinematography is excellent. All music is suitable for musical accompaniment and it is suitable for plot lines. Making a musical version of Hilton's story is a welcome change from re-creating a plodding. We add seasons to the actual scene depth of the actors and the magnitude of each scene. I can not agree with the critics who ignored this fantasy of this movie. It is a silver screen silver! If you can do this, then find it - and its magic lets you carry everyday concerns, which inspires you to find your "lost horse".
