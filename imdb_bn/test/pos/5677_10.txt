Black water has been the best Australian movie I've seen for many years. My girlfriend and I are gripping each other's hands, jumping all the right spots. Open Water is a shark film as it is a lot as a crocodile film. In other words, animals are only part of the conflict, the trap where people find themselves through their situation. Wonderful how the director's Andrew Trauki and David Nerlich look unforgettable how to wring up many mysteries and terror from such a decent state. And when I talk about terrorism, it is not made artificially, but in the vomiting moment created in artificially, but when you ask yourself, "How will I feel in this situation", you will be less touched by the fact that you "fool intelligent" Will take you Performance was fantastic, pacing and gorgeous cutting was great in mangrove, and the last moments of the film looked very good. It should be a fitting feature first debuted by two proud people who are first proud. Go and watch this very nicely shot and acting suspenseful film.
