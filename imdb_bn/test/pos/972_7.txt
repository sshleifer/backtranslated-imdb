This is not a life-changing movie; It's an epic, or something like that. But it's entertaining, and it's fun This is a movie that the whole family can keep an eye on, and at this moment there are valuable kid-appropriate movies which do not have a love story among them! Without trying to impress the audience, it tells a good story in a light heart, especially in these days, like many movies. It has received some good acting, and the music used to fit quite well in movie content. Acting is very good, the actors are comfortable and credible in their surroundings and most importantly, the joke is actually funny. I want to recommend it to people of all ages - it certainly smiles me. :)
