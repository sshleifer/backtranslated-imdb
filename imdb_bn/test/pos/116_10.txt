This is the more intimate story of India that the maximum decision is taken from the male, the wishes of the woman are not given any attention, for example, if the husband and wife sleep together, how will it be tested for the husband, can he control his wishes, and not give pleasure to the woman . And in such a scenario, women always have two choices, either taking these things and taking them into their own lives, which generally do not accept or accept it, and try to mold the material to satisfy themselves, which is a movie Creates! <br /> <br /> Fire is a brilliantly organized story of the second option, that women decide for their own decisions, not for self-sacrifice, but to serve others. Since the complete concept of justifying the lesbians did not find a acceptance among the Indian audience, but if a person sees the whole film from the corner of self-expression, then the entire debate is not raised.
