This wonderful movie was created in 1949, it is quite surprising that Hollywood was generally the collective head of sand on black and white issues. The film has a firm determination to take this scene, because it does not insult the viewer for most of the less-known cast and extraordinary intelligent script or find simple ways of white racism. Plus, a decent budget rather than a movie, and a fast running time, it does a great job! <br /> <br /> Joanne Hern√°ndez (this great actor who played the role of many films in the era) is a proud black man who is accused of killing a white man in the south. The crowd can take care less about details - they just hang on a hanging. And, despite his commitment to the law, a lawyer in the city who agreed to protect him also estimates that he does not want to tell the truthful and genuinely truth - until he tries to convict and convince him of a legal hangover! Thankfully, a young white man (Cloud Jarmin) started to discover the truth by starting to wonder about the innocence of Juan. At this moment, the best character of this wonderful drama has been started - I have played Elizabeth Patterson (the old lady who later congratulated Mrs. Trump). He steals the wishes and stubbornness of standing alone for the black person with the sole conscience as a white person. At a surprising point in the film, a crowd is trying to push him to the past to kill the prisoner, but he is standing firm and forced to retreat. There's a lot more in this complex but intelligent written story, but I'll leave it to you to see it for you. If you have a chance to see it with your kids - it will open some extraordinary dialogue about how far ethnic relations are coming in 50 years. However, for a great year in 1949, Hollywood finally addressed the head of the ethnic rivalry, such as the thirty-first-century Fox has also released "Pinky" - equally effective about racism, different marriages and even rape. Powerful film! If you can see both movies.
