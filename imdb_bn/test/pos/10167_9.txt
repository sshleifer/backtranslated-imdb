A movie that gets burned according to ancestors and former ideas - it's a remake! It is on doris day! He is singing! Hitkouk's second crack, 'The Man Who Knows to Two Much' is his most humored movie and entirely a perfect masterpiece in his own right. <br /> <br /> It's more than one picture of Doris Day. He did not even give his career best performance over James Stewart's own, but the whole film was protected around his character instead of his character. After all of this, a movie which is both music motif and plot device. Casting better than his generation's most popular singer? Consider: Day's Joe McKenna left her career on stage to sit with her husband and raise her son. It seems to be a mutual decision, and he does not seem unhappy. But with his concerns about Louis Bernard, Stuart saw him look at the carriage of the horse, which means he knows that Bernard was not asking a question about his career. It is clearly a repetitive joke among them - he responded with a 'rate-of-rate-rate' which refers to this abusive identity, it seems that he has some secret dissatisfaction with his prison and both of them have realized it. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> < br <> <br /> This is a cruel scene, both actor and actress who depict power imbalance in their marriage - trying to control and control their responses using their professional knowledge, just as they are trying to suppress their voices in their medical career. Repressing singer carrier <br /> <br /> The power of this word is shown in the Ambrose Chapel sequence, when its high-trained transparency and volume are to be governed by the mix of female drums - they almost work as a warning of what will happen to her if she continues to suppress her talents. . At Albert Hall, he needs to cry for practicing his impressive lungs, which protects one's life and at the last stage of the embassy, ​​his talents and fame, which allow him to identify their son. On the contrary, all of the activities in Stuart's brain are reversed - his visit to taxdermist has ended, he goes behind the church, when everyone goes to Albert and his efforts succeed in killing the killer, thus depriving police of potentially useful information. Only to save Hane from his envoy, his job is to join his wife's voice, when he really succeeds in making something useful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The singing opportunity, as the first musical instrument in the 'Best of the Best' movie Works, McCain predicts nightmares to consume; 'Do not really see us in the future' It creates a way to finish nicely, in which close bonds will divide the mother and son through music, to save the day to the diris. <br /> <br /> Make the central feature of the film's most famous sequel - to make efforts to kill Albert Hall. This long soundless sequel can be the only great thing that Hitcoko can commit to the film, the very expression of his belief that movies should be visualized. We see people conduct conversations in this sequence, but we do not hear a word they say. We do not need to - say everything in the image. It is also the sequence of his most subtle mysteries, the pieces are moved along with the songs being gradually moved. Editing incredibly tight, the music matched perfectly. There is not a frame from the place - which is not directly related to killing, gives the viewer the idea of ​​the environment, the geography that is going on in these things. It is slowly created, but in the end the mystery is almost intolerable. When Joe shouts, it's not just relief for him, but for the listener. <br /> <br /> The Ambrose Chapel sequence is diverse, especially useful for anyone, especially for the service. Sticky in the quad of unauthorized churches. After seeing the first light of Albert Hall, the order of the embassy seems to be a bit flat, but for the second time it seems more effective, the final fight of the gun battle really benefits from the beautiful use of DayGyeong in the background. Music-ambient-noise at 'Rear Window' The whole score is fine, which allows the music to move effectively from the screen sources. <br /> <br /> Bennard Miles is a low-arch arch, a little harmful, but dry intelligence. He outshone by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, walking fine lines in those sinister and sympathizers. When her husband gets hit by a cigarette, she sees smoke in her cigarette - her position is to revive the outer outer part of England, but her obvious gangster's mullah, but she's clearly on the soft side of the hand, and probably the feeling of maternal mood. <br /> <Stuart is nice, though Hitco always throws him as 'Averman', seems to be a director, but it ensures that Hitkoke had a great view of his audiences. Stewart is a trickster intellectual who supported the fascism of Rap, who is a voyeur who misused his girlfriend in the Rear Window and a continuous necrophiliae in Vertigo. The day is nothing short of phenomenal. See his reaction to the news that his son has been kidnapped - he never increases anything, but he does not sell it. This is one of Hitako's most emotionally successful films. He does not let us forget about what's wrong for McCain; They feel the most complete human being of all its central characters.
