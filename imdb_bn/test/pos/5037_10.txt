John Travolta was excellent as "Michael" by the same name. I do not think I could have been a better illustration. The movie was fun, yet touching. Michael is a very "human angel" (if he is like them). Andy McDowell spanked his role as a reporter, he believed the belief goes away. Bill Hearts and Robert Porterlow are great as fellow journalists, proved to be the proof of every Earth's angel. Supporter cast every nice, especially the elderly woman (I do not know his screen name), who played Michael's mother! Over the years, I have seen several movies ... I have seen this movie a few times!
