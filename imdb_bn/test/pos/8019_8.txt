A very intelligent and exciting thriller that does not depend on the action but the situation, which is rare all these days. I will compare this picture to The Day of the Jackal, another movie in search of a dangerous international criminal. Acting across the board is awesome - Iden queen mischievous person has played a rogue role like the terrorist Carlos and the navy has its disguise. Donald Sutherland plays the casual CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kensley plays an assisted Israeli official in this plan. It's a very intense and effective movie, and considering how small steps it has to be. The first half of the movie has been set up, because the Navy is ready to disguise Carlos. The second half is an unhealthy worker, character and action coming out of their circumstances, thus making it more gripping all the more A really tight film that should be ignored.
