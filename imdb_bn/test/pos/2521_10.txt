I saw this best in VHS the first 10 years ago, and the quick explanation of the strong anti-establishment-society of anger-children was in my heart. Director Hector Babenko is a humorist who has found a fine connotation to tell the story of how the inferiority of the children's childhood kills childhood. Even the exotic kids have their innocent beautiful dreams. But corrupt reality never gives chance ... <br /> <br /> Recently, thanks to the publishers for the DVD release, I can now keep this great movie in my favorite collection.
