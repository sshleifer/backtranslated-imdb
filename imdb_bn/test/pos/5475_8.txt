Wolfgang Peterson has instructed the thriller that Clint Eastwood is working with Secret Service agent Frank Harrigan, who meets with a clever psycho (John Malkovic) in a cat-mother-mouse game involving President's protection. Mitch Layrie (Malokovic) disturbs the agent with the contact with Hargin, as well as a frustrating comment about his skills, as well as secretive protection of the President providing secret services. Agent Lily Reynes (Renée Rousseau) tries to keep Härgens stable; But he is convinced to stop Layerie from facing the threat of assassination. Very good FX and fast speed plots sustains Eastwood and Malkovitch are fantastic. Russo has a way of getting your attention. The noise outside this firm cast: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
