In my opinion, direction, editing, lighting and acting (minus Franco) were very good. I must admit, I am pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film. I did not expect much as the camera angle, sound, etc., but the image in this area was not bad. <br /> <br /> After seeing the picture, I personally became frustrated with both of the characters because I wanted these two letters so badly to reach each other. And I felt the character of the Travis (Franco) was not really influenced or they did not change after the suicide. Although, perhaps it is likely because of the lack or disability of James Franco for publishing emotions (any kind) in this movie I saw some other Franco films, and when I call it for real emotions or facial expression, it can not pull it. He has shown the only positive outlook in the film, there are more people likely to see this movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the Terrell script of the Rachel Minar is well done, and he is moving forward to a more brighter future. . I can really see and feel the sadness and emptiness of his character, and it makes me feel for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie was good for a small photo, but eventually you are seeking more. I only wish to see the letters develop a little more, it might just be a bit willing. Despite that, I hope to see more films from director and crew in the future. :)
