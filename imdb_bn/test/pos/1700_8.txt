I've never seen "American Wayroof" in London but this movie was very entertaining. While renting it I thought it was a horror movie but it turned into a comedy with some horrifying aspects. I think the sequence of transformation has been done nicely but influential, the best scenes were where effects and light off each other are beautiful, thoughtful. Transforms remind me of many variations of VeraVal films, but Virupal itself is very disgusting and not like a dog. Gore: I believe there is a lot more in this movie, which really shifts away from the horrors, when each frame has blood, then violence is seriously difficult. <br /> <br /> J. Heart (8th grade)
