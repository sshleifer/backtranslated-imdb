When I was in class eight, I first saw this movie and I remember it had a profound effect on me. I saw it again almost a year ago (now I'm 29) and it has still moved me the same way. This is a great film that depicts the struggle of "policy vs. progressivity". Viet's character is not an idealist teacher who is superintendent, Mr Skiffington's no psuedo-raistist leanings. How the story is that older people often oppose the barricade and more specifically represent the struggle for cultural change. Often at the cost of children. When this war comes to a warming end, Pat Conroy loses and Progressism wins. Right? The child who wants to leave him is better to know him, to make the "real" world and classical music more open. Other teachers at the school earned respect for him and he learned a lot about himself. A great film with a heart-breaking end. Anyone who enjoyed this book for reading the book of Pat Treaty, "The Water Is Wide" It will be with you!
