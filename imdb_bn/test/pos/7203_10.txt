I love this picture, the audience I was part of liking this picture and the 7-year-old girl who was with me liked this picture. We all laugh, crazy humor, and laugh at the feeling of leaving the movie as it finishes. I can easily see why such a big box office in France was a success. I'm planning to buy a DVD, so I can see it again and laugh like all the bits I missed, because I used to laugh so much for the first time.
