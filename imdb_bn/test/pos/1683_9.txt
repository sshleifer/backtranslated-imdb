I was amazed at the quality of this movie, especially after seeing adult-oriented adult images - 140 (?) All of them! Really, a boy instructed a movie about a boy. I'm also looking forward to watching the Look Eberl movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was a little too much. The time spent taking a step at the OWA showing conveyer failure (and reluctance) has passed. Caleb did not try hard enough. Oven, so young, could take Caleb more easily and later decided that it was not his choice. And Owen still learned "valuable lessons" about corruption and politics. Instead, she does not give herself a fair chance to learn about her sexuality. And what about poor Caleb? Ovens can have a good effect. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the oven, although the film appeals to show Wan as a hero, who fights against perverted corruption. He was given the opportunity to have fun with Caleb, who was amazingly beautiful. Oven was not allowed to go along with political distortion. But he could try to have fun with Caleb, and he went away even when he wanted. It was clear that Owen was in charge - nobody forced him to do something that he did not want to do. But he could have been more fun, and with a very hot boyfriend, I hope Luke makes more movies where young people's interesting characters are more fun.
