Bergman's regular Macon Fond Sido and Levi Woolman acted as a village couple, John and Eva Rosenberg. The story is a common couple who start with fights and up. John is a sensitive person, but an escapist who isolate himself from the world. Eva is a real woman who is annoyed with the lack of her husband. Because John is responsible for fixing their radio, the upcoming battle senses. Of course, the war came, and the movie was used by the enemy and by their own government, through an impressive study of their transformation and attacking each other. <br /> <br /> The musical score of the film, but the soundtrack was the sound of war. Palting backgrounds in one scene The sound of the fly by guns, explosions, and aircraft was unbelievable. Now and then, as soon as Bergman encounters, various events happen. When some violent incidents happen, viewers zoom out to feel violence instead of closing down. Very well done movie.
