This is a spectacular production! I saw Shona live twice in Chicago and my only problem with production was that I could only understand fragments of what was happening. At the stage consists of three giant catwalks and platforms and be aware of the steps you are going to at one stage from one part of the stage to the next. As always, it is a thought-provoking sensory overload, with 15 camera captures high definitions with efficiency! The footage was excellent, I think one of the best concert DVDs of all time! I hope and hope they will release it on the Blu-ray of the HD-DVD so that we can resurrect this messenger again.
