Forever Strong One is one of those sports movies you can actually see. It reminds me of remembering Titans because it has comedy, sadness, and just extraordinary. I saw it on pre-screening and all my friends liked it and easily put their top two sports movies. Acting movie is great. Although it is worth remembering Titans but it's something unique about this movie. I definitely feel Oscar worthy and get many rewards. Everyone must see this movie and it's worth your $ 10. I would see it again when it comes to it because it was good. I could not say a bad thing about movies.
