The film "Dead Man Walking" is not about death penalty, but about people involved in the death penalty - murderers, whose children were killed, who was his spiritual adviser and what would happen. It says with little fanfare but with stories and stories of many sensibilities. I have a DVD, and every time I see it (Often, it's not a simple movie to watch) I'm also impressed by Team Robbins and the whole cast. So express that it can be a documentary, so mandatory you can not take away your eyes, so fine and yet powerful ... "Walking Dead Man" is not small to a nice composition. If you do not complain or do not complain against it, it does not matter (or even have any opinion), this film will definitely make you think about the issues. It shows a bold screenplay and blinking in addition to being confronted with face-to-face until the face of the director, and everyone who is involved in the film closes it - there is not a scene that is false. An excellent movie, but do not expect to see light for some ... If no blood or violence is shown, the final scene can be more graphic than anything imaginable. You get dragged into this movie and become a participant and have a character to identify with almost everyone. 10/10.
