This is one of the rare movies, which is appreciated instead of the usual Hollywood trip. It's really a roller coaster ride, we followed a lot of people following a crowded 500 euro note lot. One asks, 'What will happen' but it certainly is considered to be a butterfly effect film. It will make you laugh, cry and bite your lips. I like it every minute! Thanks to SBS Australia, thank you for showing the movie and the cost of reading the subtitles. The only disadvantage of my mind is that I can not book a holiday on the frozen land - they all seem very depressed - that would be the cold weather. Both ways, watch it - it's worth every second.
