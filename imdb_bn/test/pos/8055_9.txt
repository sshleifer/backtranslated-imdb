"Phoenix City Story" was a brutal, ruthless knockdown dubbed as "the worst city in America". Film album Albert Patterson of Patterson led the murder of the crime syndicate of Phoenix City, which made a bid as a way to clear his departure to corruption and corruption for the state attorney general's office. His son John Patterson lifted his father's metal after his death, and won the post, Fennor City cleared the primary item in his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Carlson has created a movie that has the power to shock even today. This film is so uninterrupted that the film is actually hard to see. We saw the crime syndicate beating and killing so that they could get what they want - between women and children in beatings and assassinations, and especially one scene, the death of a little black girl wanders, especially annoying. This is not an enjoyable movie, but there is very little money for the viewer to reward for sitting through completely annoying events, but it's a good and full of angry energy film. <br /> <15 minute proposal has a series of interviews with Fennrick City real residents, some of which are portrayed by actors in the fabulous section of the film. It gives the movie a quality of essentials that carries the description, so that we think we are seeing a documentary all the time, a feeling that casts the film at the preferred position of Carson. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see this movie, but it's a film that fills you with feelings of religious anger and then you feel helpless because you can not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> At grade
