Tex Awayer as the Director of MGM cartoons was one of the most glorious moments in the history of the cartoon in the 1940's and 50's. His cartoons were very weird and spiritual which was very strange, which was later celebrated in Musak Movie. When a man sees a girl, it is impossible to stunts and non stop actions were trademarks of these films when the eye popping out. <br /> <br /> It is responsible for Avaries and is one of the best Cartoons for its best. Droopy is a mountaintop and he is determined to get his people, ... even though in this case it has been a wolf who escaped from the jail. Throughout the film, despite many insane stunts, the drapie holds the crew until the wolf goes away until the dope is almost everywhere! Loaded with funny mess and smile, it's a great cartoon.
