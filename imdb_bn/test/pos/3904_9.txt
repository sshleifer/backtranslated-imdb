When I was very young 25 years ago, I first saw the Content of Money Out. Because I'm an enthusiastic fan to marry from childhood, I like to see some of the things that I played in Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie (and still) was a real behavior - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her screenplay as a victim of rape and suspected of prejudice in The Legend of Lizzie Borden. Her performance as The Victim In Kate, a horrific woman detained in an isolated house during a storm, followed by a killer with brightness. If you like exciting mystery thrillers, it's a movie that will keep you at the end of your seat. Another remarkable performance is noteworthy, Einstein HackHart who is frustrated and the owner of a suspect house. Unfortunately, like most of Miss Montgomery's movies, The Victim is not available in DVDs, and I believe that although it was released a few years ago on VHS, but nowadays it is a rare event. Ten years ago I was lucky to be televised and was a nice copy of this very good movie. A must see!
