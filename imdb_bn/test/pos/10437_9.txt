I saw this movie very shortly before the movie. If you ask me it is not eligible. It's the fastest Times Readmnt High, but in depth, like the American penny. It handles the same subject as both movies, but in a way that it holds some grains true. The end is sad, but how is life? I think everyone will see it. I have it in DVD form, and it took so long time to find it too. That's something that should be said, and the other thing I'll add is finding that soundtrack is quite difficult. I believe they stop it, but this movie soundtrack is amazing. It includes Comodore, U2, Deo, Rio SpeedWagon, The Car, KC and Sunshine Band and more.
