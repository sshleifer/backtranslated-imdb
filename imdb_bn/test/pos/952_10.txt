Gilly is the winner's best film and the biggest blow to his career. .... I did not watch Telugu movies so I can enjoy this movie more. The story is about a girl who wants to run away from a pottage. The local people want to marry him forcibly! Since he is a detective, so no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay came here to play a wrist match and decided to help him. How the rest of the film helps Vijay, and how the girl finally escapes from the whip of the goonda and Guan's political joke. The movie ends in the end of the movie's thriller moment. The victory of the Kabaddi player is always good. Trisha, Ashish student, a group of friends of victory have done their job efficiently. The fame of the film release should be given special mention. The character of this villain is well-illustrated and the illustrated figure is very well illustrated. Surprisingly, for the first time, I finally felt sympathy for Vilen. The dialogue "Hi Chelame" has really caught up with the people. Vidyasagar's music is bright and the song 'Apadi Padu' is all rage. Darni will have to be credited with such a beautiful spice film that will not die of hard-witted fans, but will also enjoy ordinary Tamil film viewers. Around the world
