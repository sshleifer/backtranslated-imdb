Alan played the best bit of film and his throat melt around his left cheek and his throat change around his left hole while placing his knee. It was brilliant to see Alan's left left as a cat's elbows in the film and look down. <br /> <br /> Allan was very upset when he got bored and admitted to the vamp on four eyes. Sofa <br /> <br /> I've been laughing about the glass rage bit for a while. A brilliant idea by script writers. Allen must be brought back to the Eastenders so that he can do the same in the Peggy. <br /> <br /> Allan is back, and this time he armed with a razor. If you see a girl and she pulls you down and finds your knickers down.
