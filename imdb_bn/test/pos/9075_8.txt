My mother always asked me to sit down and watch this movie because it was her darling, I would never do it until I got caught on TV one night. This movie was great, I can not even explain it. Just Cast is not nice (Julia Roberts, Kefar Sothreland, Kevin Bacon, William Beldwin and Oliver Plat) but the story is amazing. It's weird but very scary and it makes you think. After this movie I was left silent and I was amazed at how well the actors and actress were all five of them. Where did William Beldwin go, he is great. You must see this movie for someone, you will not be sorry if you have not seen it. Amazing!
