Do not keep in mind that 'National Velvet (1944)' is not a bit hackneyed and sometimes uncomfortable, Clarence Brown's cavalier story is a loving and very likable story with a good morality. After achieving modest success in his appearance at 'Lazy Comte Home' (1943), young Elizabeth Taylor, 12, revolves around his first major role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolteacher with horses scary. Although filmed in California, the story is adapted from a novel adapted from a novel by Anne Baggold - a small town is set in the English countryside, and technicolor photography is fully utilized for presenting vibrant and handsome natural scenes of blue sky and green trees. Mickey Ronnie made the top billing as Emil Taylor, which is a distraught former jockey with a terrible purpose, with whom the relationship of young velvet feels the dignity and opens the new, hopeful chapter of his life. Although he has struggled in a consistent fight, he must recognize the horrifying experience of the horses that are afraid of him, Rooney is as intense but enthusiastic as a passionate young man for his very valuable evidence. <br /> <br /> The ability to play, because of this, was probably limited, at this young age, because it was probably a good thing to see Elizabeth Taylor eyeing Anatoly Biolas. His more psychological sequence, where he demonstrates courage and honesty in front of disaster, strikes one by one and achieves only "trustworthy" sensory-neutral concepts that have been effectively bothered since then, every unusual inspirational sport film ever created. Despite this, Taylor is a bright eye and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was not unfamiliar to being a child-star. Anne Rave played a very important role as the mother of Velvet, once a famous athlete who did not just switch to the English Channel, but none other than Mr. Taylor's own father was lovingly trained. I liked that Mr. It has never been said about the final seconds of the film, Mrs. Brown correctly decided that the young man must first maintain his own discipline instead of exploiting his late father's memory for financial gain. He undoubtedly done the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> This image has reached the Grand National Sweepstakes, where at the last moment Velvet decided to run her own horse, PI. World famous competition. According to the spirit of a Latvia man, he hoped that this nation will win, but will become ineligible later - because he was frustrated before the girl or the horse broke out (what a stupid rule!). This extended race sequence has been done very well, effectively the nervous system's nervous tension of pre-race second, and the confusion of events that are in the same position as Rooney's character, trapped behind a long spectator and anxiously waiting for someone to provide the correct updates. It really does not matter that we know it's the hardest thing in a difficult race to double a stunt - in a few scenes we can clearly see people with a weird appearance - but the positive message is the same. The 'National Velvet' that I have inspired the imagination of millions of young girls for the last 60 years, and the power of inspiration has diminished with time.
