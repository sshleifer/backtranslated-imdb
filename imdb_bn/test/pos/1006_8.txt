[Spinner Controller !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner John Arbakal came in a group. They basically had no life. What they did was around and counting ceiling tiles. John even organized his fat dress according to the color and fabric. He needed a life. So he enjoys a book about this topic which tells him to meet a woman. There was a great place to start a single 'bar. Unfortunately, when the music started and hit John Dans Floor, we saw what disco is dead: John has killed it. John tried to take girls at the next video store. He ended up feeling in the mouth. Literally. Laundry was not a prize, when John and his birthday got a glimpse of each other's underwear. John tried to do all the buff at the beach, but soon he was angry with a real buff guy, who left Jon's feeling, again, down in the mouth. Literally. John then tried to take the girls walking and jogging. No Benefits. John pulled out a guitar and sang the blues. Unfortunately, when he cited his cat as fat, a fat guy walked and jumped the guitar of the zone. It was frustrating <br /> <br /> For the people of fortune, an advertisement spread on TV: an advertisement for the Lorenzo School for the Personality. This ensures a useless person to take some simple steps. Appeared in John and Garfield classes. This TV did not show exactly what he did on TV, and what he did on Lorenzo TV did not work as well. John sitting on a beautiful girl named Mona. So while learning about Laurenzo himself introducing himself, trying to counter you and pretending to speak foreign language, John and Mona wanted to know each other. They all forget about Garfield, leave it together. At home, Jon and Mona just sit in the verandah and talk. Gerfild jealous of Mona that he would take away the jinn from him. Garfil highlighted the future: Jon and Mona got married, she left, and soon she gave birth to a story of Garfield, who was very happy to bring a little bit of age. Do not stand for Garfield at the present time. He tried to free Mona, until she started irritable behind her ear. But then the zone learned that mona cats were allergic. So basically their relationship was about to end. But they still saw each other and Garfield was sure to stay with them. <br /> <br /> Another sunny garfield TV! This one was created during TV's Garfield and friends running. Garfield was slimmed down somewhat. Somewhat Since the beginning of the 1980 cartoon. Attempting to pick up girls in the scene of the scene is funny, so the fat stops the person's guitar in the zone. Good ol 'Lorenzo back as music garfield.
