Compared to Britain's war, this is a real movie with real character and a real plot. Britain's war is primarily a documentary with Lawrence Olivier and Michael Kain, but the real heroes are Spitas, The Hurricanes etc. Here, you have two well-done characters (three actually) and a real plot. I firmly recommend it to anyone, even those who are not particularly interested in war movies. It is well illustrated, and wonder if the director could do what I was in his big capital behind. And I do not think it's more sensitive. This is just as real as a fictional life in combatants, with real feelings and real life - in a great movie.
