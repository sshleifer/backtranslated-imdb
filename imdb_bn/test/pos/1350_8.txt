I could read the picture and thought that it would be nice, like a Saturday night movie. I did not have some great hope, figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a completely bad experience. <br/> <br /> This conversation was perfect, most actors were great and it flashed nicely. Ash was perfect in Christianity, something to touch was nice to see her ability to turn an unwanted moment. He has transformed this character into something that we have seen before, but instead of turning away from stereotypes and focusing on the discretion of character. Jonathan Quoyet was amazing to see again, I do not know what he would do after the train. Ashley Phinck Moni, a great young character actress who hopes to get more work. <br /> <br /> There are moments that could work, but not all the bad times in the movie. My friend described it as a gay angus / Napoleonic dynamite but it's more than that. This is a study of a character, it's a pain in a small town, it is a pain, but the pain of the pain (which only clears the age) increases humor. I would like to see Ash Christian, Ashley Finck and Jonathan Kout more soon.
