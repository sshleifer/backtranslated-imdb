Many of those who have been posted here, I do not have movie literature. I stumbled across this movie by accident (surfing the channel), and could not surf away. This is a truly incredible movie, praised by critics and those who have made it happy on this site. The actors are horrific. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her drunk Boris is sweet and patriotic. You can not help but feel the urge and regret of the father of Baris because he has made his son objectionable as a volunteer to serve in a great war. <br /> <br /> Others have made this movie so good, so I'll mention just a few scenes that move me. When Boris's brother told his family that he had broken faith with his brother and married Tatiana's disguised face "Tashiana", then his betrayal came to this betrayal (although the part of the rivalry could be done through rape). You are afraid that the rest of the film can properly destroy cigarette smoking products in the context of Tatiyana and brother or any other disaster, to eliminate immoral origin. Since it is not "French existent movie", the next does not happen. Thankfully! <br /> <br /> Another scene that tears in your heart, when an anonymous "musician" soldier saved by Boris returns to Boris's father on the death of his son. He unwittingly broke the news from Tatiyana. I can not apologize to this scene ... Tatiana still finds the poles and hopefully Boris will still be back home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said that Boris's brother is a piano as a Soviet challenging piano that anyone who stole his brother's wife must be stolen. Undoubtedly, at least one movie he got "Tender"! At the end, when Tatiana finally confirmed that Boris died, he is fully optimistic with the future for the future. You can not even imagine the tears and catheteries that you will move through, when the survival of the war, with their own loss, first saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Unbelievably. Go see it.
