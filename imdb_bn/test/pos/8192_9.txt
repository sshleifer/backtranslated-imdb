<br /> <br /> <br /> This historic movie was so refreshing. Although it can stimulate the real event, it shows the silly nature of Emperor Quay, which he later was notorious. And there was not a single person generating a computer. I think China has made so much epic films. The dress and setting was beautiful, the performance was excellent. Dignity versus death is a major theme of the movie and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I've enjoyed a brief introduction to the terracotta fighters, a 3D map that has captured China's victory with every soldier. Emperor Kui was later involved in her life-size terracotta fighters <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the scenes with Vamana, she was a very small character, even if she had a small scene. <Br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
