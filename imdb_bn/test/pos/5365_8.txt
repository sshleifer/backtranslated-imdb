I saw this at the 2003 Stone Brook Film Festival and it was very warmly accepted. In this pre-WW2 film, a couple of German rocket scientists are working on the Scottish Isle of Scarque, which is a glimmer of horror in horizons. The invented characters on the island are invaluable in their creation and their illustration. Shawn McDonald is specially remembered <br /> <br /> After increasing the speed of "Scottish", the audience felt at home with the people who have been delighted to see the Germans working to link the link to their island with the mainland. A rocket based mail delivery. It seems unlikely that this film was based on an actual story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
