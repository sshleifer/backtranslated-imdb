I just saw "everything enlightened" at the Telluride Film Festival. This is a really remarkable film. Very emotional, fun time and heart warmth. Bring your napkins! Who among you enjoys a movie that enjoys the movie, I think remember the finale of "Babbit Feast" and "Notebook". The stories were completely different, but I had the same mental strength to bring tears like this picture. <br /> <br /> There are no spoilers here. The summary, i.e., IMDB, describes the journey of a young man in Ukraine to follow his roots and find out the village of his father's house. <br /> <br /> The dialog is in English and Ukrainian (and Russian, I believe too). This is for some amazingly linguistic oriented moments, explaining a character, more or less believers, depending on the situation for the English speaker of this group. <br /> <br /> Scenes are wonderful and musical score deals with the amazing Eastern European influence. Be sure to keep your credit for the ultimate tune. <br /> <br /> This is the first expedition of Louis Scr√©ber's directorial debut and well done. I've seen this movie 9, in a long time, one of the best movies. I highly recommend it.
