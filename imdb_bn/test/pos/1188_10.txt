I saw this movie in the theater first. I was 10. I just saw it the second time and I would say it's amazing. Music, dance, acting This is a great story and very well called. When I saw him in this movie, I fell in love with Trat Williams during my childhood. One of my favorite parts was when his mother started shouting for giving him his pants, and finally said, "How much do you need?" (Money). That was classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> Wax Best If you have not seen this movie then I can see it again. It is timeless. It will do all the great movies; Laugh, cry, and worry.
