I thought that a dark knight was great! This is a 10 claim! In a statement made by one user, this movie actually takes dead WERE. Returning to a living life is a zombie regardless of the method or reason of living a dead person's life. In this film "Junk" is used to threaten the girls, do not eat from them, such as traditional Zombies A certain star in the horror flicks of this movie 80's. The score and the atmosphere are quite cruel, and the audience is keeping the mystery across the grave scene. Acting is believable, with the awful expression of unexpected philosophy. Although I enjoy all the jumbo flicks, this movie is usually a refreshing change from the "meat-eating junkie" movie.
