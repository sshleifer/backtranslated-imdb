I rented this movie, but I was not sure what it would expect. I have ever seen that I was happy about this best Brazilian movie. The story is rather weird and easy, and above all, very original. We have Antonio, a young man living in Nordernea somewhere in the northeast of Brazil, and are deeply in love with Kareena. The main contradiction between the two is that when Antonio loves his little town and does not want to leave, Kareena wants to see the world and refrain from it. As proof of his love for him, he decided to go out and bring himself to the world. He will keep Nordestina on the map, as he said. And the way he is incredible it is. This is a good movie; It may be a bit confusing for some people due to some different editing, but I think it also improves the story. It's just fun, and it makes you feel better.
