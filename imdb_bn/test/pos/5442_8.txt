A political actor (Williams) was forced to run on the post of political campaign and after the resignation of the president. But suddenly we win and make an interesting spell in the office. "Man of the Year" is not the most fun movie and does not work on the best but small scale. After being hit with "Good Morning, Vietnam", Williams teamed with Levision again. Both have a great chemistry and seem to work off each other. I'm not compared to Scorsese and DeNiro but you can get pictures. Although I did not speak enough to spit there and see the movie in the theater, I would suggest renting it. This movie is a comedy but there is a great ridicule, if you like movies like "Dairy Movie 4" but this is not for you, take your brain to see it with you. - ***
