Andreas is a weird, inhuman place, where everything comes to mind the perfect. She has given a good job, everyone is kind and gentle to everyone, and she does not even get too much trouble to find a beautiful girlfriend. But the undiscovered city Andrades soon found out that a perfect commercial-type world is not really Paradise. One of the best movies I've seen this year really is one. The intriguing plot is fully supported by smart direction, where each single element (cooler incomplete photography; cold cooperative design; unreasonable performance; gradually, highly controlled camera movement) helps in creating a unique strange environment which keeps the viewers at the last end. A satirical, satirical, bitter comedy that makes me laugh, is only able to do the best films. Nothing new, perhaps, in the analysis of the modern day human civilization, but with a really wonderful idea, a smart job that will be rarely forgotten, from whom it was fate to see it. Just amazing in the metro underground, the scenery is beautiful.
