I really enjoy this movie. For the first time it was Turner's classic movie. All the actors did very well, but Brenner again stole shows like the previous one (He's so sexy!). This is one of the films of Brian's passion. Actually, this is the first time I have seen him smile because he plays a very strong role in a very strong, big life and other movies. In this movie you see both a strong man, a strong and sensitive side. Bryaner seems to be a "woman" in this film. Brenner consumes glass cups and speaks in his Russian tongue. It is amazing that it makes me crazy love. I never understand that Brenner and Care (both chemically good) together with a movie star and then Brenner always dies in the end, it reminds you of "King and I" in a way.
