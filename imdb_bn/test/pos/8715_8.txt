I have found that most of the Brigade Films have failed to take full advantage of its attentive screen attendance. Unfortunately, he had played a bit better role in the unbelievable quality films, which had real surveillance. He deserved them and was able to show his complete cinematic power when they came in his way. As Genevieve's "Love on Love", there was a clear exception to the tendency of our light, flexible cars, because it was an interesting, artistic film by any reasonable measurement and it was a 28 year old Bibi who was the most lucrative of her. Another "In Parisian", a striking, orderly comedy featuring an extremely impressive Brigade, that an aspiring lady discovered that incredibly beautiful young wife could be confident of being faithful. There are good performance here. Her playboy husband, Michelle, played by Charles Boy, "Princess", another good supporter with cast entertaining efforts. Like Brigatier's Bartoott, I think of him as a kid in the fifties in the way he sees this film. He was 23 years old at the age of 23 and was ahead of his time, better than any other actress in the period, among which was Marilyn Monroe. Her curvy, colossal sexuality, wide-ranging bosom-baring, skintight dresses appear, just jump off the screen. She was more lip and intelligent than women in America, almost fifty years later. With their career and still being firmly involved in feminist politics, they are close to a bunch of strange lesbians. On the contrary, sex cats were sex workers, intelligent and clearly independent, it was long before it became fashionable, but while fully understanding the power of its exceptional womanhood, she used it for a higher purpose than selfishness - she believed love. A picture still can not do justice to her. You had to see a room cross in his thin but lively form (with its 20-inch waist) a little light. You had to see that wild blonde manie, her big, brown, seductive eyes, and heard her as full, pouting lips spoke French. At the end of this movie, she closes the camera, winks and flirts with twinkling her beautiful orbs. What a baby! For the fans of Brigatiera Bartoott, do not miss "Unane Parisian".
