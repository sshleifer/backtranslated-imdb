True, this is not John Saluse's best film (brother from another planet), but it is not completely forgotten, if there is no other reason than his message. The children of Wild Things, like Batman, are killed in front of him and leave him in 'Anonymous' named 'The Zone' in the corrupt section, where greed and violence govern most. Instead of traveling around with Champar (Robert Davey), Wild Thaik fought for justice, so his chi and yelli used to use cat prints, sometimes burning in the fire. He became an urban legend, a modern day Robin Hood, and a hero for ages. His best, wild things alive in 1987
