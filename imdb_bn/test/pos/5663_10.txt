I think it is incredibly difficult to write reviews of any kind of full review of Geogione, because it is one of the audience's dependent, complex, poetic and philosophical films, which are worn on the brain, while trying to enjoy their shells and getting their core together, There are still many things that are out of the doubt of an artist and outside of doubt (which is, Hope person, i). The first thing: this is a specific masterpiece, even the industry that has long been in the long run; Second: It is one of the rare "dark" films that are more sad than dark poets, even romantic, attractive and sad, such as Peter Brugl or Kasper David Friedrich Art. As the main part of the film, some have called it Kafikian, although I do not agree with it because it is far away from Kafkaar's wrong logic and the examples of Edgar po are much more: dark and scary, but by touching our most gentle strings through the soul . In fact, the poetic aspect (which is much more important than the description), GeioGino is the story of eternal peace and love that can only be attained through the infinite childhood of the soul. Such souls are usually branded as crazy by our society, but from other perspectives, they all have the quality, when they are "raised" to be lost: the goodness of God's love Actually, GeoGino is a very Christian film, "Be like kids" (Maternal 18: 3) It is really a hidden tag-line, although the film is never related to any morality and focuses only on Christian philosophy, God is beyond any human moral. Nevertheless, I think that such a ghost that "tries to steal childhood from Bootnat's rare living soul" portrays the "old man", but it has the right to think and think about it. Do not try to look for some hidden symbols for Zieragino (though there are some), a better look for ideas expressed by letters and their behavior, and learn from them. Also, I can not mention that the film is excellent photography, especially due to the use of color filters, incredible performance, excellent performance of all cast and the atmospheric beauty of the winter hills, which reminds me of Brugl. "Hunters in Snow" Also, interestingly enough, the view of death as an old woman with a black-colored horseman in a cart reminds me the pastea (plug) from the painting series of the painter Theodor Kittelsen, which populates the population of a small hill valley in a small town. Is it an event?
