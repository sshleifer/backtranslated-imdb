The film does not take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you will get lots of fun (until your murders are really bloody and do not seem to be top priority with your horrible extra cheese)! <br /> <br /> This image looks at every horror fan and then fingers them. It knows it sucks, and for that reason, it is the best of the "Children's Play" series and away. <br /> <br /> It makes the corner of "Stupid Humor" so good, you find it more than just laughing it yourself but with it And, believe me, you're laughing all the time, it's laughing again <br /> <br />
