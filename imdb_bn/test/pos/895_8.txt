Laura James is playing a magazine photographer sent to Africa for a photo picture. There he is met by a couple and other swinging couple. They all live in this huge, very tourist hotel with a huge swimming pool. One night they have a pool party "live real" with local dancers complete. It is very un-politically correct and very ugly. Later, Emmanuel finally got to shoot his photo, which became a drive-through, steam-in-car-safaris (though the photography is awesome). Throughout the film, every man he met is going after Emanuelle. Photography is very well done in this film. There are scenes with cascading waterfalls, giraffes galloping and ancient ruins. The film is only worth seeing for Niko Feenko's only soundtrack.
