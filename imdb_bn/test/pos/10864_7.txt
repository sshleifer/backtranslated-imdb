This film is labeled as "gay love love story" labeled Pride and Prizudis as "direct stories of love". <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is lesbian, but her story is classic buildup, a journey from an early age to adulthood, from maturity to sexual innocence, self-discovery from personal blindness. The camp has stylistic elements in the direction of film, but it is not a barrier; Rather, it helps to underscore the staged and dramatic parts of the life of the main character. <br /> <br /> Those who know the Chancellor of Pride and the BBC version of the Prezudis are sure to be surprised at him here. Rachel Starling starred as the main character NAN, and Kelly Haus, her lover, Kitty Butler, all the proponents. Chancellor may have played Sally Hawkins, who plays Jane Butler. This picture is not for heart disgust, but it is not a part of homosexual ads. It's a real story, a comedy and drama, an engaging story with charming characters, and good value for watching.
