A small film filled with secondary actors and a "star", not with a bad performance, a badly distributed line of dialogue and the heroine of the most warm "heart" story with cold violence? <br /> <br /> This is a jewel, a diamond, a little precious jewel in the West which unlocks the American spirit and legend. West Greek heroes do not settle like hikk or cody or mester, or yarp, but daily people and women, peasants and farms, businessmen and miners and woods, Joras and Barakpis and entertainers of the day spread out. Wealth, some calm and calm, for some religious freedom. This is probably a very spiritual story, although no special religion is promoted, even non-Mormon Cowboys depicted by Ben Johnson and Harry Care Jr., even acting in kind and developed ways to everyone. The story, irrespective of religious feelings and beliefs, and when the wagon trains come on solvents, they go on their way to promoting tolerance and charity. And like the real Biblical fashion, like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, the guardian angels sent the Wagon Train, who, after all, went to the head of the evil temple with the Claude Dynasty to compare with their Garden Snake. Eden, and what it is sad after that they will do. It is a sweet folkloric story in the West which targets every goal John Ford targets. <br /> <br /> Nowadays I have a Western Santa Claus whose red group is covered with a die drop quartet, whose red stocking cap has been replaced by a brown statue, the gift carries a burlap bag and carries a coil of the rope. In my Santa, I gathered a Winchester rifle with a shoulder, slit it on his shoulders and the Coulter Revolver in his waist. People at the office ask why my Santa has to carry guns, I only reply, "Snake!" After all, the Christmas season is one where everyone will get what they deserve? <br /> <br /> After fifty years, especially after 911, the philosophy and attributes shown by the character and story of this movie are still relevant today as it is today.
