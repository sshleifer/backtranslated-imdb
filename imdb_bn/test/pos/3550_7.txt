Sure, it has an abusive moment, it's an art house, live-action fantasy game, but it has moments of great beauty and humor. Omnibus film is always a problem, but I was always interested in an interest among them. I will now rate the sections individually. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Disease - "A Belo In Monthly" - This section can loot the film very well for a few people, because it is the worst of the entire group. It's hard to follow, mostly because it tries to follow a clear plot (a hackneydid). Photography is unaccomplished. The best thing about this is the homosexual homoirotic bit that it does not do enough. This segment made me very nervous about continuing. 2/10/10 Charles <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The film has a bunch of best painters, mainly in a stunning black and white color. Segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Jean-Luche Garde - "Armide" - I chose to make this very harmful movie bolder for the Department of the Gordard and Altman. With Gordand, I thought that was much more impressed than me. I can not claim to have seen many of his movies because almost no one has seen him, but judging from what I have seen, it could be his best work since the '60s. This is the most fun part of the film and most artistes have done. Bravo, Gene-Look! 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Julian Temple - "Rigletto" - a very interesting segment, it is quite predictable. Still, this story about a husband and wife who cheated on each other in the same resort is illustrated with long, intricate tracking shots, which are based on the exact duration of dance drama from actors. It's also a great self-referencing joke about Omnibus movies everywhere. The final scene is very weak. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a little, but nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> It involves an insane haven residents presenting a theater performance. Music and images work well together, so at least I can credit it for being a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Frank Roddam - "Livedsted" - Somewhat unfortunate for the Seychelst segment, this segment is very similar. You might guess from my phrasing, this one hit me more. It's a young man and his daughter is going to Las Vegas in a fatalistic ride. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Kane Russell - "Nissun Darma" - Perhaps the most visible interesting segment, it is one of the most fabulous worlds than reality. This is a beautiful story of a fallen angel. 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> - Derek Jarman - "Deputy Learna" - I've heard a lot about Jar√°n, and I have seen from him that it is the first part of filming. Hopefully, I can see more in the future. This one is music-video, but it's better than the Altman's segement. An elderly woman is concerned about it mainly her small day. Performing and using various film stock representing both time and passion is very nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> End. It's simple and effective. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Overall, I give it a tough 7/10. As you have heard bad is nowhere near.
