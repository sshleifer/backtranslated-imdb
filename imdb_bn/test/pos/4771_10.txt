It was in the 1920's. And a person named Walt Disney was on a mission: to satisfy the family and children all over the world with one thing: Entertainment What did he do He made cartoons! Goodbye !!!!! And he created a character that is as great as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. Ha ha Oh boy <br /> <br /> Two movies Mr. Disney himself wrote: "Planet Crazy" and "SteamBet Willie." This review will focus on the 1928 feature, "Steamboat Willie." <br /> <br /> As I learned as a little boy in this movie, I always wanted to watch this movie. Well, in 1997, I hired an old VHS that had a lot of Disney cartoons on them, the mouse played !!!!! Mickey Mouse !!!!! And guess what? That was short, and I liked it !!!!! Shortly after returning the tape, it started in the old Disney Channel (Note: "Old" Disney Channel) on Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a great cartoon; This is a great way to make Disney stuff from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 big, true !!!!!
