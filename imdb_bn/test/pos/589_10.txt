I started muppet movie, but only half Because I only saw this at Mrs. Kelly's Friends House. The song was best and Muppate was so Hilary. If they believe that Rainbow is the end, anyone can create it, no matter how small, no matter how green (which was included in the trailer). <br /> <br /> Kitmeet is my favorite opponent (which means the main character describes) and so are the other Muppets. Mel Brooks was amazing when he played Professor McC Crossman. The scene where Miss Piggy preserves the work of Kungfu on the men. It was very cool. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Muppette movie is the best Jim Henson film with the perfect character and people will be interested in his successful movies.
