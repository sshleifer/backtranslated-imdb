Yes, this is one of the best performing television movies and I do not expect less than Joe Sgt. One thing for these critics is that I was also a great fan of the Carpenters, I could sing all the elements of elementary school and middle school singer and because I used to do most of the music from the song music song. I think he was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and this kid / songwriter wanted to sing and sing music - I wanted to meet this woman I was looking for. I will never go, he died three weeks before the incident. And yes, it affected me because I did not know anything about Anorexia - and did not fully understand what happened. <br /> <br /> When I got this TV movie produced, I could understand quite well. Perhaps everything from Karen and Richard's life is not open to television viewers, but while opening the parts shown, I could understand a lot from the music industry of that time. My objection is that I am writing that time and "now". It was a very informative and heartfelt appearance among family problems in the music industry, though some one learned this abstract thing. <br /> <br /> These pictures are not for fun, they are open to open a door and show us something. Here was a wonderful woman that the whole idea was that her talent was based on the weight. She was fine. I did not know that. He received mixed messages about his love for his brother, his parents' love and the music industry that gave more attention to his appearance / weight. With the start of MTV it got worse. With the 'American Idol' it's like festering a pus in an English accent. <br /> <br /> A wonderful TV movie, I'm sure that after someone else can give it an HBO treatment but in any other way, learn many lessons and the absence of another wonderful genius.
