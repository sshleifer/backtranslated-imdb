I do not think why everyone hates this movie for junk, it is not true that a trail is an irrelevant, yet what they can do for a signal. Because I think it was a siege (Rodney Dangerfeld): Hey everyone was going to kick and then there was a dancing gaffe and it was the first picture rating (R) and the second one after the end of the cadash (PG) It was still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
