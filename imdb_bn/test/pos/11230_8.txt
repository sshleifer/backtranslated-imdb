"How does it depend on how you see it?" We are "Northfork" priest Raven. Harlan, we're half in heaven or half of hell. The Polish brothers' film is an ambitious subject that allows an intelligent audience to sit, if it has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The entertaining levels bear visual and strange imagery that the film realizes, which is obvious to a less obvious social-political and religious lexicology, which is reflected in current social values ​​reflecting the revenge of Americans. The image has been taken too much (the coffins arising from the depth of the lake created by human beings are living, the inhabitants of the habitat, who are "crucified" on the floor of their house, the angels who need to wear multiple glasses etc.) and strange pictures (half animals, half the toys that survive , Door bell which makes the musical outputs the perfect finer, a blind angel, The tractor has to write, etc.), can make viewers unfamiliar with the guest and absurd tradition of literature and art as a non-Spooling to wonder what the entertainment Entertainment. There are better credentials for European films in this case, but Hualien actually made such film in "Cat Baloo", a few years ago, Lee stood up against Marvin and his horse wall. In a view of the citizens left in the city of "NorthFork," Kenny and his wife paid tribute to Kenny and his wife for the picnic in the ranks of "Citizen Bought" cars. <br /> <br /> <br /> Is the film uncomfortable or unexpected for film-gear ?? The most interesting legend (one of the best I can remember) can be heard as a voice at the end of the credit. The directors seem to be able to leave the best moments they might have with the movie in the last minute. If you are patient you will enjoy the film levels? If you bother or consume Polish, you will miss its many tastes. <br /> <br /> What is this picture? On the most obvious level, a city is being evacuated for a dam and hydroelectric project project. Even graveyards are being excavated so that the body of the dead can be shifted to a higher graveyard. Real Estate Innovators have surrounded the lakeside property with 6 people who can get rid of the city dwellers. 6 seems to be the only conscience, and so chicken brides are able to order soup, others can not supply anything to them. <br /> <br /> The next level is your Christianity and it is communicated with the dude. Most are apostate Christians, but many hide the motivation to bear the cost of true Christian principles, which is the example of the priest. Many people want to accept the kids without taking responsibility for such activities. <br /> <br /> The next level is discussed with you and the angels near to the angels, and each other. You understand that the unknown angel keeps a comic book on world Hercules and dreams of a mother, finds him a strange angel named "Flower Hercules". Although the filmmaker suggested that the flower is an expansion of the young angel's erroneous imagination, the next step in the flower believes this option. Are you really in the angels - not God, but of the Holy Spirit? So the world is not in the world. The camera's soft focus is proven in these shots. <br /> <br /> In another level, Irian's toy carrier became a real plane to bring him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> the final level social commentary ?? "Countries are divided into two types. People and fords people in Chevy." Is there a difference? They think they are different, but both consumers. <br /> <br /> It is said in the religious report, "Pray and you will get" (Word of Fra H. Harlan, cited by Angel Flower Hercules). To consumers, the film says "What we do with our birds separates us." (There are also wings in each 6 manufacturers - one piece / hood feather is stuck in their hat band but their actions are often different from the angels by a different reaction of a scratch on a car. <br /> <br /> The film is not the best American film but certainly It certainly breaks a significant path - fantastic visual, interesting acting (especially Nick Nolt), and a load scripts Offering different levels of entertainment for mature audiences.
