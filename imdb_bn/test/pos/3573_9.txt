I went to see this movie with less hope because it was the only one according to my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have previously commented on other Colombian movies, and I agree that Columbia's films have the same project, and always try to reference the average porn people, especially trying to joke from continuous crossings. But let's face it, the language used in this movie is not particularly exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how people talk. The storyline and the pacing are bright, and it can be spread to any country in the world, the acting was great and it was a script for me among the best produced in Colombia's land. I think any person in the world can get beautiful and more entertainment with a beautifully comedic Black Humor. It reminds me of films like hijackers and others. I highly recommend and hopefully this will show more people, as Colombian films seem to have begun to focus more internationally than last year.
