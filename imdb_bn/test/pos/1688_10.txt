When I first saw this movie in mid-January (2005), I did not like it. I thought it was very weird and thought that the main star, Judith Lite, was part of some of the acting. (Of course there is certainly true) and then I saw the bit again the next day when it was re-broadcasted and I felt a lot the same. Then I again saw again on Sunday (March 20, 2005) and I really started enjoying it and this time I taped the whole thing. I shouted even the first 2 times, but the actor was actually crying and I was a big fan of him. <br /> <br /> This is a very well played and completed TV movie. Judith Lite is one of my favorite actresses and I think she works great in this movie! I keep watching over over. This is a sad movie, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie then I would recommend it! This is not my kind of movie, but I enjoyed it! A +++
