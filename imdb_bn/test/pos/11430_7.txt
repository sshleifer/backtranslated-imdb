The increasingly friendly story of Italian maintenance technician Vincento Buenavolenta (Sergio Castelito, who can be seen as the famous King of Prince Caspian and under the leadership of Martha) depends on The Dissimal by Armino Ray. ) And a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They actually put a wrong foot, then their ancestors were disciplined for their mistakes, and wanted to tell a Chinese representative that the slow translation of whether he had bought the faulty tools. Vinceenzo wants to do the right thing, which is rare in these days, and potential buyers to advance errors, as well as to tell the implications of those who can bring their purchases, and the fact that this agreement is still going on, That's what sets things right. <br /> <br /> But in spite of looking for a quiet machine in China, which means hidden, and probably disappears without a trace. With Liu Hua's initial reluctant support, they moved away from this coronation town to the city, which is seen in less visible sights in China, away from Beijing and Shanghai, in the city of Wuhan, such as artificial steel mills with backdrops and their smoke stack with atomic vegetation scenery Point. The strong Yangtze River also makes a look. On the other hand, the usual touches of style films like tourism come to play, such as culture, ideals, food, and essentially, the world also knows about strangers, that only if someone tries to try and connect. Some romance hints have been given in two leads, it is probably likely to be a major point, until the movie is delayed (Hey, the opposition does not attract?) <br /> <br /> As well as the main industry plants and factories, We can see various cottage industries, such as the Simstress, working in sweat stores like the environment, and I also believe cotton with the formation of the noodle. As a film, it gives me the opportunity to travel without leaving my seat and gives credit for it because of not giving judgment from the moral high ground in the exploitation and preferences. Any other film / cross-cultural cooperation where dialogue is compulsively doubled and abnormally discontinued and is really hard to take part in dialogue (and I will not give names here) for movies and movies based on the main languages ​​of the conversation. Some of the supporting characters can be very kind, always open their arms and foreign doors, but I want to imagine that perhaps in more rural areas, people are generally sincere, friendly, and basically can not get it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think some elements that I think are important I do not think it could happen to others. The importance is one place in something else, and its foundation depends on the boundaries we set. So giving us limited life, I think I should lighten a little bit, save and save, and sometimes I can ignore the illusion that ignorance can be blessed.
