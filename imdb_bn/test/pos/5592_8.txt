I really felt the film was ahead of its time. A potential daughter was such a strong, professional woman. He knew what he wanted and was diplomatic, but was firm with his mother-in-law. Mother's role played extremely well (you just loved her hatred). The need to control the life of his son is his nervous evil. If you are in a relationship where you have been tried and lacked in it (and everyone who is involved) it can be close to the house. I have had many years of watching this movie and it seems that this plot and dialogue will work in 50 or 60 films. It is difficult to see because of the dynamism of mother and boys but I want to see it again. I'm hoping to find one in the old movie channel but there is no fate yet. Trying to buy it was in vain (I do not believe it on tape or DVD).
