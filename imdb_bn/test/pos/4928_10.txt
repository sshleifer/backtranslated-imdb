The little cartoon that is a little tuned and I like it as a child and I like it every minute. When I was four or five years old my parents bought the video how I spent my vacation. I saw it over again until every word was new. Well, a few days ago my three-year-old cousin came and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old rest of my childhood. <br /> <br /> I smile a new smile but I laughed how much smile Each little tune movie and episode comics are based on frustration and based on skeptic humor and are wildly successful. Bugs, babies, plagiarists, drunken pigs, and all of Fifi, with a little help from superstar, plucky duck and charity pigs, the bugs and bubbles endure amazing events from white water rafting and only travel to the monorail's best entertainment park and the Elimira is a Safari. In search of beautiful cats on the ground a strange search. <br /> <br /> Some of the classic humor is standing in this little toe adventure and the best painful comedy I've ever seen. Hampton and Plaki arrived, Monorails roamed and left) Pliny's disappointment was my favorite gagnetine monorail thing. It does not matter if you are tired of tears when you do not face language and nudity. <br /> <br /> Little Tony Adventure: How did I spend my vacation. Charles Adler, Trace McNeil, Joe Alaski and Don Messi's voice. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
