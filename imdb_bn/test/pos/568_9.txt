I just saw the movie, through Netflix. I was confused by the way the movie was described, but in the end, it was good. I was removed in different directions while watching this movie. I was filled with hurt, hatred, anger, bitterness, pain and finally relief. Look at the young accused accused will break your heart and misunderstand you. The smoke of the police makes you cringe, because the Rodney King came in the light of light, because of the police brutality, this picture showed the total lack of moral fiber in this police. And they hurt this boy, and get away with it, just make you more. But, you have to say, I fell in love with the attorney, Mac Guinness. One of my favorite lines, when he told us there was a hole on the police ... the police said to him, keep sucking the stick of the cancer. Mac Guinness told the police, "I always have cigarettes before sex ..." I told him that I was going to screw him. <br /> I have a new honor for some of my laws in this country.
