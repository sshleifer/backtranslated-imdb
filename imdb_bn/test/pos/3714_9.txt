Based on the short story by William Faulkner, To Solaris is a top genuine short film, a movie that has enough stories, passion and great cinematography for a feature film, and of course you're finally seeking more. In this story, two dirty poor Mississippi brothers, the only single child, soon enough to volunteer for Pearl Harbor's attempt to wage the war in Japan. The younger brother, younger brother Jonathan Fur, did not give up his elder brother and tried to enroll himself in the army. Ron Perlman has given a mess, but to touch the children like the army colonel who decided to help his child. <br /> <br /> Because it's only 39 minutes long, it will be hard to find this gem (it's probably limited to festive circuits for now), but remember the name Haroon Scendor - this picture marks him as a director to visit.
