In the mid-1950s, it was a very entertaining middle-aged, which packs a whole lot in the 96 minute running time. Most visitors will quickly draw in this story and experience will be quite enjoyable. Not just more than a B-Western, but really an epic, the budget was decent and custom despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only box office draw. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwick were past in their love and looking for work, Stainwick was 10 years away from new popularity in "Big Billy". Brian Keith and Dian Foster just started. <br /> <br /> Ford Ford's small Ranger (Robinson) gunman decided to sell the sympathetic Sheriff as he was killed, who played a small dancer named John Perris. Parish is a former Confederate officer who goes west for health reasons. <br /> <br /> Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and wishes to achieve the rest and promises his wife Martha (Stanwick) with good promise. Twenty years ago he was engaged in war His brother Col (Keith) came from Texas to help him spread the giant. Lee is blindfolded for clear hoax between Stanwick and Keith, but sensual girl Judith (Foster) is understood by what is happening in their home. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mr. Parish promised his ancestor Caroline (May Win) that he would go east. Caroline modeled on Grace Kelly's "High Noon" character, stopped joining the first sign of the problem and simply disappeared from the movie. It leaves an open and open path to develop Judith romance. <br /> <br /> Violence begins and movie continues, Parish is able to apply military tactics against his enemies, who reduce his power and determination. His main real fight in the middle film with the main gunwoman. Ford played one of its standard characters; The modest person who condemns himself in self-defense, who eventually becomes agitated and brutal, but finally gets excited (his role is very much in "Shepman"). <br /> <br /> Robinson is such a wonderful personality who maintains his personal integrity despite the shadow of his personal integrity. And enough to develop his character, he gets enough lines and screen time. <br /> <br /> Stanwawk has the most difficult role to play and she is not only believing as a seemingly faithful woman who is planning to replace her husband with her two-face woman. For this reason, not enough time is allocated to do more than express it on both sides of the letter. That said, a talented actress could work even better with these restrictions. <br /> <br /> Dian Foster is a wonderful surprise. He must be reminded of both the physical and acting styles of Carroll Baker in the audience. Although Judith is scheduled to play in accordance with the 1950's session, it is allowed to be difficult, but after every major collision, violence should be broken), Foster shows an excellent range. He expressed a growing attraction for the parish, but it is so neutral that it is only in retreat that different sources click here. <br /> <br /> The real problem with "violent men" is that it tries to be a step in both Western and the study ethics of character. A lot of things happened on the screen because most of the steps ran and many characters get only an impressive treatment. This is not a serious error or a reason to avoid movies, but it can be significantly better in the absence of unnecessary letters like 20 minutes or the time of the caroline. <br /> <br /> Again, what will I do? You know I'm just a child.
