In the middle of a documentary about her parents, the filmmaker's mother died, but she is continuing to create a series of stories that she did not expect. The fruit is a absorbing play that holds the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a preferred but anonymous spoken audience unknowingly gives viewers the privilege. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Never pay for it. Although Hollywood topics are hidden in detail, the Doug Block story takes the form of everyday life. For those of us who were aware of the life of our parents, we (or when we arrived, but when we were very spontaneous, had their own independent life), the 51st Street Street gives fair warnings: There are wonderful things in the background again, but if you enter there Be careful though if you want to. <br /> <br /> However, the audience continues to slow down for the details of their parents' past. It is not a warning for those who gave a glimpse of the parents' parents life. This movie makes the mother happy to make her conscious decision within 50 minutes as a wonderful and encouraged but self-confident person. The film's producer's special success is to see the audience actually in front of the elderly parents and grandmothers. We all know that our parents once were young and strong, but mother was 51 in the street. The filmmaker and his sister, who are far away from the time of their growing up, are finally away from the film, but this is more due to his own unexpected nature than his paintings. Autobiography has made this autobiography dramatic, intense, and unforgettable, making sure to send viewers closer to their own family albums, but feel more hesitant to look at the back of the photos.
