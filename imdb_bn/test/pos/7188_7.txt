The upper line sums it up quite well. Comic's best resources are its visual mess and sound-joke (which is almost impossible to translate later, so the comics are the best in their original language). <br /> <br /> Both of them are difficult to capture in movies, so they will not be as good as comics. The movie is a different medium than comic. It seems like this movie works wonderfully well in capturing laughter fun. <br /> <br /> The word is very good and sometimes fun (an amaelie referenced in djuice!). I mentioned that I saw the French version. If you do not see the French version or the lack of French language constraints to you subtitles, then the word jokes will probably suck. <br /> <br /> Slapstick is okay; It's a very simple form of humor, and when it's not really funny at the age of twelve, it raises the spirit of comic books. Other visual jokes, please save the movie for the old audience, they are often quite funny. <br /> <br /> The acting is absolutely above, but again, it's not annoying to capture its attitude, Depardieu and Clavier are not really implemented, because some people think they did not enjoy their role (I did not notice a thing). On the other hand, Jemel Deobz and especially Cloud Rich influence an artwork. It is fun to see it Again, I fear that it will not be fun when the voice is dubbed. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie as a whole, much better than ever. This is not a classic and it does not have Asterix's twelve task dethrone as my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still valuable. French version, that. 7/10
