Mark Walhurck as a great role, imitating all his songs, imitating his perfection, and figuring out a dress like a rock star. When the band comes to the opportunity to play their "idol", then they jump on the opportunity. But the role of a rock star can not be that it is cracked ... and the relationship may change .... You must have achieved this movie which you can not achieve as the theme of what you think once you get it . Overall, a really good movie with great performances from all the actors and two Lead, Mark Walhurgh and Jennifer Aniston. It made me sad, especially when Emily (Jennifer Antoine) met Chris of Seattle and saw the depth of what he had broken. If you have ever dreamed of becoming a rock star or group, then you should see that the life style is shiny for a while, very lonely and ultimately you are not what you want.
