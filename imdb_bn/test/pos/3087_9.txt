I remember when I saw this movie. I was a kid for a friend of my uncle, and one of the children suggested that we see it. It seemed like it was a 'prince of the thief', he was returning to the video recorder, I was ready for a boring few hours, I was disappointed, I would admit a pleasant, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Do not everyone know Robin Hood's legend? I'll explain a little bit. Robin Hood is a Saxon criminal, trafficked here and there, and gave it to the people of need, always beautiful maid inspires Mariyan and hurt Nottingham and Prince John's sheriff. The basics! Now, take a review. <br /> <br /> This movie was released in 1993, and Robin Hood is a legendary and especially a Prince of Chave of P ---. <BR / </ p> <br /> Following the fiction, Robx of Loxhelb was first confronted in Arabic prison during the third century's Crusade, and in those days he was called "Moore", he escaped with a cunning in Selimet, Asneeze. <br /> <br /> After fleeing, Assigne called Robin a foreign exchange student in England to find her son Hu. This Robin oath! Robin returned back to England. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> She said, even the goldfish are all dead. Frustrated for a familiar face, he found Belle Jazz Maggie, the faithful blind slave Blinkin of the family sitting in the toilet. <br /> <br /> Robin must lose all the bad plans of Prince John and Ruttingham Sheriff with all the stories of Robin Hood who are charging and charging helpless taxes on King Richards' reign. He is away <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with the movie Mel Brooks, there are some small ideas that they might expect to have previously indicated. Finally, this person is responsible for the death of Dracula and is responsible for it loving and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful wonderful comments, are in the right place throughout the film. There is no more than a minute of laughter. <br /> <br /> Kerry Elves (incidentally the only English player Robin Hood in a movie), who will tell many of you from Princess Bride, present his shiny fascinating twinkle eye presence in this movie and do a great job. From unexpected heroic posting, from a wicked sexy perspective, he's really amazing fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Through all the way through the movie, a joke on his face continually changes: on his left cheek, on his right cheek, then his cold, then his forehead, it starts before returning to his original place. Based on Alan Rickman's pottery, it was a fine joke, when he starred in Prince of Chibs <br /> <br /> Roger Race, like the lazy Sheriff of Rogerhingham, is surprisingly flexible and nasty, and has a great line of pictures around it <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Here are some faces, you'll be known from other Brooks movies. For example, Robert Ridgely played Hangman, another film directed by Bruce, Blessing Saddles, to play with Hangman in this movie. She likes to add subtle references to her earlier films; The Hard Brooks fans who die with most of the film will easily spot. Those who have seen history in the world, they will recognize the song 'Man in Titus'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and Marion Schuoge, the mail itself (playing Rabbi Tackman) is a link 'It's Good To RA King', one of the lines in the world's history. "<br /> <br /> Amazing ridiculous, even with a few lines that can give them a deeper depth of warmth and humor. <br /> <br /> This picture is so beautifully warm and fun that all of my own views are all expected. There were no scripts, but some scenes were completely corrected by actors, such as Latrine (Tracy Ullmann) praying for Rottenham in her bed , And he falls to the roof, wherever he wants to land. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "You can sing for yourself in a tight dress for a few weeks or at least for yourself." <br /> <br /> The rating is P, which I say is hummy. There is no bad language in the movie, except double access and no less than violence. Actually I'm not saying anything strange, except for some comedy war scenes. <br /> <br /> is a funny photo that adults and children alike will enjoy!
