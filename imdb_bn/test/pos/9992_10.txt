I will share my review with the maximum of 100% (if it is perfect) in the following five sections: ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual experience: [100%] This is a very interesting movie. I had a great time watching it. The dramatic effects on golfing scenes very good shots and green were quite amazing. I love watching old wooden golf clubs and bags. <br /> <br /> Director's work: [70%] Bill Paxton is associated with acting but this image shows that he has a talent. Did a decent job. Acting: [90%] Shiite Le Bauff Francis was very good in his role in Umie (this guy could play well). The rest of the cast was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value: [100%] I enjoyed it every minute. It was very modest. <br /> <br /> Script: [91%] based on the real story and so it makes the film even more special. It was very interesting from the beginning and at the very end, liked each scene. My advice: Surely all sports lovers should specially look golf (you all love it). Looking for a nice entertainment movie and not anyone hates it anyone can see. <br /> <br /> _____ <br /> <br /> 10/10
