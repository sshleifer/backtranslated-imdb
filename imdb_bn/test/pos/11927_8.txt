This came as a huge surprise for me. I never heard of when I saw this movie, and the headline really refers to something other than a great terrorist / hostage situation at a high school. The toy soldiers have a great time from the early 90's, where action movies were light-hearted and very enjoyable. The action is good, the plot is interesting and the way to the top, the bad guy is a horrible disgusting douchebag (which is great), in it's Louis Gastein Jr., this is just an emotional movie that I totally enjoyed. <br /> <br /> You like the action but you can not forget it. I give it a solid rating of 8/10.
