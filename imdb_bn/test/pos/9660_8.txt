Perhaps it is probably the best film about the 2002 Romanian film. I recommend being an intense drama with lack of action and thrill. The film focuses on the life of the world on the coast of Bucharest, does not pay much attention to the shape or character of the character, but rather the anger that he and the other characters do not pay much attention to, he simply fills the main character. The heading "Fury" means anger rather than anger, but actor behavior can be regarded as the movie in both senses. Rather strange story of love (usually not a romantic, rather a modern subconscious concept) is in good shape in the end. It's an impressive picture, and good for catching night life in the cinematography suburbs, thus creating a beautiful movie to see it. <br /> <br /> You will not be disturbed for a minute, I promise!
