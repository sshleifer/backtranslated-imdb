There is no plot. There are no central characters. There is no moving camera or close-up. In fact, this movie does not follow any followings of the mainstream tactics used in the mainstream film. However, Roy Anderson's Du Levande is an extraordinary part of the cinematic story. It's human psychological sensitive appearance. <br /> <br /> Contains a series of Vintettes, Roy Anderson gives us an insightful insight into all human beings. Fully protected shots have been created, added yet with full tone, yet playful, music, judgment, they represent a host of characters as their daily existence. Some are taken to sad, unlimited, or other Nordic cruises. <br /> <br /> This is the journey of a small thing that makes us human. Instead of top stories or visual tricks, everything is omitted from the minimum minimum so that we have only focus characters. It focuses on the important aspects of our life which creates us; Our dreams, our frustration This can be accepted by others, as we can accept as a person. <br /> <br /> The color of colors and death-pale makeup emphasize only their own stories and reminds us that like them, we are all alive. There is no joy or light on the end of the movie tunnel, yet you get out of the movie with the meaning of life. Songs from the second floor, la levende, is a truly inspirational part of the film, more accessible than its previous movie.
