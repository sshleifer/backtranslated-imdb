I read on the web that this film is being rebuilt in a theater feature. Finally !!!!! It's almost about time to work together on their Hollywood in Hollywood. The big studio is always frown at the lively stuff, writing it all with Oscar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss' Emmy Award performance is probably the role of my best film. Any actor who touches this role will not be the same (unless an academy award already sits on their metallic basis). <br /> <br /> Jericho is a backdrop for MILE, a fine social dynamics of our world. This is about the release of people without validity, and the power of human spirit beyond all obstacles. Imagine being a pragmatic prisoner at the age of teenager without any chance of parole, he does not know that he is probably the fastest runner in the world. ... what will you do? <br /> <br /> This movie is going away without feeling cheated on any level. Completely thrilling, engaging, emotional, and a "rolling stone" soundtrack which kick ass !!! <br /> <br /> I will always be made for big screen ... can not wait! !! Already I have been seeing my VHSP copy again for many years.
