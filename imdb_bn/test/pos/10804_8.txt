This movie does not provide any background information for http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/. We have shown a snapshot of the fall of Danton, his cheating process and the fall of the death penalty, but if someone does not study the revolution in a big way, then understand what characters come in (Fquiair-Tinville, Filipau, Desmolinos, Raspice ...) and thus what they appreciate May be: Danton and Joe Blobb visitors can be the same person. For example Robespierre & Desmoulins had close friends from their youth, and this explains how Robespierre works. Those who know these facts, they will easily look at themselves and appreciate this good movie with strong acting, no-nonsense sub-plot and time-reconstructive actors. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but all have a good job, even 'demented' painted as just the kind of psychopath. There was a time of 'Terreu' killing, the importance of which was not fully documented, and since most of the parts - driven by ambition, greed and personal disputes settlement, San-Kuloti was unknowingly fed as a subsequent breakthrough step against tyranny. .
