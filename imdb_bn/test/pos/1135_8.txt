I really like the show !! As a part of Greek Life, I can say that some things are very overwhelming, but overall it is still quite funny. <br /> <br /> Entertainment is a favorite lead character, her room Hilary and full cast entertain her own rights. I like it as a personal focus, as well as focusing on interpersonal relationships with the organization. <br /> <br /> This event covers it and they do it without any damning or bad thing (what could be in Arabic? family?). <br /> <br /> My favorite capi (of course), rusty roommate and most of the trunk. This show is a great launch pad for them and I'm excited to see any door open it. <br /> <br /> Please renew this show on ABC Family in the next summer. I love love love !!
