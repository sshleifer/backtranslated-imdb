Famous actor and director John Houston has asked his daughter, Angelica Howston, for his more expensive rent for "Himshit" and "African Queen", what would be his last movie. In fact, this film was released after the death of Houston. "The Dead" based on the novel of James Joyce's novel, 1904 tells the quiet story of celebrating New Year in Dublin. Houston, her cast and her screenwriter, along with her son Tony, made a movie a gem. The novel is one of Jos√©'s best works (as well as the only filmable). This photo is a tribute to Houston's genius. He took a small, beautiful story and made a small, beautiful movie. Donald McCann and Angelica Houston shine (although "shine" is very decorative, very shiny, a sound description of their quiet, understated performance). "Dead" reflects the love of the Houston family for Ireland, and in its quiet, peaceful film, a worthy final film for a legend.
