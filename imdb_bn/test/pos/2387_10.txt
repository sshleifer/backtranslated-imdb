I liked the film "Eddie Monroe". The film was such a thing that I'm interested in seeing it. I especially like the plot twists along the way and end up wondering. Craig Morris Brad Pitt has both appearance and talent potential. His blue eyes reminds me of Paul Newman. Fred Carpenter takes the movie to a new level. I like cast. Music score, cinematography, talent, position and script were awesome. I love seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director. He gives 200% of his work. The film has great textures. I hope Eddie Munro 2 will be there. I would like to see how Nicklett came out after his turnover. Fred Carpenter Eddie Monroe Hollywood Level
