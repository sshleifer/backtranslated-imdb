Hamfrey Bougert looks very young in his first acting role, works well, but after his career he only indicates an accented lisp. Still, he is very good as a new aircraft motor's idealistic young detector and very interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> <br /> As well as this journey, as a confidential sister of Bogart, Austrade Allwin, Bradley Page producer Barbara Leonard Cosmetics, Jill Kennedy, Gilgin and Haloel Hobs as a trusted (and wise) Butler. <br /> <br /> <br /> McLeill was both a star (silent film starring) and Bougert, a cellhole in 1932. Bougert was a slow performer at Broadway stage; McLean was sleeping and would soon be seen in the production of Sky-Row like photos. Yet they are both very good here. Appears in this photo, but McLean is 30!
