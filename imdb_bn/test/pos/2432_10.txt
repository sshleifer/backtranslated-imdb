This movie is a very enjoyable tribute to Bogart and old detective films. Really a ruthless beauty as Swallow Anastas as Robert Sakie Bogy and Michelle Phillips. <br /> <br /> However, the most notable part of this movie is the greatest beat of all time ever dance scenes in Hollywood. A well-known professional trainer commented that nothing else in the movie would come to the tide of dance. <br /> <br /> The scene, which ends as an important part of the plot, takes place in a beautiful mid-night nightclub and makes all the accounts interesting. Pumping music, rolling curtains and fingerprints, free-flowing miracles and beautiful costume - and a wonderful twist involving seductive Sybil Danning - creating tension and excitement at the very end. <br /> <br /> Three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers led the beauty of foreign beauty in the mid-1970s, as the leading beaten dancer, Kamal Alamnaar. He picked up the famous Armenian Guy Chukurian to travel his orchestra on the street. Garar's shoes are live bands which perform dancer scenes. If you see the trailer on this site, you will see a glimpse of Kemal (playing a finger on the back of the cyber denning). <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a fan of beaten beat fans, then you will see this movie later and if you are a fan then keep it very well after viewing it again.
