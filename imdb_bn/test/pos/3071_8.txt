I first saw Robin Hood: In 1994 in Main In Titles I went to see it because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw this movie's trailer and smile in mind. When I saw the movie I said it was better than me. It's not too funny, it's a pretty well made movie with beautiful sets and costume and very nice scores of hummer quality. Acting in the film is also good, fun as Carbie Elus Robin Hood and Trasy Olman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blanckfield, David Chapel, Amy Yasebak, Megan Kavanagh, Erin Alan Crumar, Matthew Poretta and Mel Brooks. But Ryan Reese has managed the best part of the film as Bad Sheriff's Rottenham. The film has the best scenes and best conversations ("King is unlawful forest to make wild flood in it", meaning "killing a wild pig in King Jungle"). All words are up and a sentence that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Might in Titles is one of the best in the books of my book Brooks today, and I can not say that I've laughed a lot about such a movie. It's just an odd smile.
