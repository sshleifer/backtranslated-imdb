Actor director Bill Paxton followed his promising greeting with Gothic-awful "fraternity" with his family's play drama about the 1913 United States Open, where a young American Caddy came to play against his Bristish statue to drown in his modest background. As "the greatest game ever played." I'm not a fan of golf, and this scrappy underworld sports flicks have been influenced by a dime dozen (most recently "Miracle" and "Cinderell Man"), but how the movie fascinated it. <BR> <br/> The movie starts with some creative opening credits (imagine the Disneyfied version of HBO's "Carnival" and "Rome" animated opening credits), but gradually took his first number of hours. Once the US Open thing was very good after taking action. Packeston does a great job and shows a check for the result of effective managerial growth (I liked the rain-thickness of the day on the open day of two days) which makes the plot go further or adds some unexpected psychological depth to the workplace. British Harry Warden has some compelling character development when a golf course is scared by the image of the aristocrats in black suits and top hat who destroy her family cottage as a child. What he sees in the face of pressure on the players' mind is a visually visible one. Golf, a painful boring game, is definitely brought alive here. In order to create an exciting time-piece atmosphere in London and Boston in the beginning of the twentieth century, credit should be set designer and clothing section. <br /> <br /> How do you know how it will end? This is based on a real story, but these series follow the same template together at the same time, but Paxton keeps it better than the average show and is probably more of a genius behind the camera. Despite the formulas, it is a great and easy movie that can be found in viewers.
