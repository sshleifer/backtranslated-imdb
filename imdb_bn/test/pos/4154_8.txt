The story of the Golden Door is a Sicilian family journey from Old World (Italy) to New World (America). Salvatore, who hopes for a more rewarding life, travels hard through the convincing ocean to leave his own country in Sicily and lives in a country whose rivers flow with milk. In short, they believe that the dreams of their prosperity will be fulfilled by risking everything for the new world. Imagine the new world imagery, cute and extremely fantastic. Rainfall of silver from heaven appears on Salvatore; He hopes how rich he will be in the new world; Cows and onions are shown twice as much as the size of mankind and resources are suggested by the health and the rivers of milk are swimming and those who produce new earth flowing through their hearts. All of these images are exaggerated with letters and nicely commemorate the great realism that reveals the story to the audience. Apart from the dark reality of the citizens of Sicily, contrast between these illustrations helps to provide the new world with hope based on the flow of the ship. <br /> <br /> The journey of New World is often shot entirely in the dark, especially when the sea melons roam and kill almost people. The dark reality I mentioned in the Old World and the journey itself is the new world. The Old World is somewhat portrayed as unreal and primordial. As Salvatore scrambles, he showed how much he had stuffed (donkey, goat and rabbit) to get the necessary clothing to enter the new world. I think it was rather interesting that these people believed that they were in line with a specific dress code to accept the new world; It was often recommended that people be able to fit in specific stereootype or mold to be recognized as morally appropriate. When the ship was leaving its home country and started its journey in the new world, the picture was the most powerful picture. This shot shows a visible scenario on the crowd of people who portray separation between old and new worlds, which gradually seems to be different from each other. This shot also recommends that, despite being known, being separated from people, wanted to divorce from the condition of their previous dark living conditions and wish to enter into a more committed world. <br /> <br /> How the new world looks, the Old World seems dark and dark compared to the bright snowy New World. I think it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never seen through the fog of Elise Island, but hidden. I think it is a deliberate directional choice that denies the purpose of the Statue of Liberty: "I'm looking forward to your poor, your tired, hungry day", and it seemed like a joke about how the people had to go. Coming to New World Once they reached America, they had to go through abusive tests (such as delawing, mathematics, puzzles etc.) to prove themselves worthy of the new world. This test completely changes the perspective of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother feels more violent than treating her with the most difficult time of adhering to the new world laws and laws. Where the new dreams once gave their hopes and hopes, the reality of what New World needed was the fact that it was insulting and rude. Salvatore did not change much more than his attitude, which he felt that the new world would really be in contrast to the new world of despair. This attitude is shared by those who are voyaged with him mostly. Their character was very disturbed with an impressive dream and made a further deal with a dark reality that had to be taken. <br /> <br /> The image seems to give a powerful commentary for preparing yourself to enter the heavenly and civilized societies. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence prerequisite. Following these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stubbornness from domination. Perhaps there is a commentary on how America learned from the failure of other nations and therefore these problems were purposely established in order to not oppress and destroy. Although the rules seem rigid, they helped to protect and protect the people there.
