Alex Benedict (John Cassettes) is an orchestra conductor having a secret relationship with his Pianists. When he does not leave his wife, threatens to reveal and threaten him, he sees that there is no alternative to killing him and committing suicide. It is very bad for us to have a detective detective. Colombo (Peter Falk), in this case. <br /> <br /> Another razor-sharp episode for Stephen Boocho series, followed a wonderful detail with wonderful details. We kill Wilne and set her Alibi for about 25 minutes, and we're totally mad. Then when Colombo appears in the scene, it gets better. <br /> <br /> We first saw Colombo after the killings (by default). This time he is vucted with his new dog. Purely, comic relief scenes are generally the least weird ("Feeling fit" for the nude model, Colombo feels uncomfortable). Colombo is sunny when he is deliberately bumping his quarry trip up or down; But many authors make him mistake in the suspicious light when he is with the suspects. Bukko, on the contrary, shows Kalmoba a little less original scenes with his new pets, which combine in funny and intelligent stories. (And I'm grateful that he did not put pressure on a fifth line in order to find a name for the dog in order to find the Colombo, as long as we learn, the dog is unnamed.) Bocco has given Columbus some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Fok makes the most of them. He was particularly good at the place where he expressed unbelief that anyone could kill himself, less than this bright and beautiful young pianist. And he plays cat and mouse with Cassavetes better in his scene. These two long-time friends and associates are expected to close each other glaringly; And that's what we get. How Alex Benedict can not help but praising the spectacular smacking Colombo, despite that, the bright detective tightens the noise around his neck. <br /> <br /> When Colombo questions Benedict's graduation mechanics, of course? Of course! ?? She asked people to look at her own beat-up hip. And when Benedict Hollywood saw Columbo before rehearsal, of course? Of course! ?? He playing the piano "Chopsticks." And what our respected Lieutenant has to bring to her, but the hunter's typewriter still stays with suicide suicide notes. <br /> <br /> In Colombo, there is a startling little girl (Don Frames) and a beautiful view of the beautiful Blyth Dancer, who plays Cavendish's wife. Mirna Lau is very nice to be seen as Danner's mother, though she did a little work on her minor role. <br /> <br /> The director Nicholas Colashanto (who has worked as a coach in "Cheers") is credible, although he led almost all the other "Columbo" directors by adding one or two stupid flourishes. The focus starts to return and the scenes end in the beginning. Then the bits where the Casavites see the crime where he saw the crime scene? And we see a zoom-in shot reflected in its sunglasses. There is also a scene with Mirna Fairy and the old fogies group which is carried out terroristically without the cosets. <br /> <br /> These are frustrating. This is a fantastic entertaining episode, that kind of made me a "Columbo" fan.
