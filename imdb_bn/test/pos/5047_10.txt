It's not just a lot to say other than a best composition. This picture contains messages that everyone will have to take heart. Especially women will not surround your people's dreams - respect them - that's how you loved her first! Death plan will live in the grave. Those who fear the fear of carpe diem will wake up. Even our Lord also speaks about this when he punishes a person who burns his talent that he can make a mistake and displease the Master. Take a risk, get out of the boat and you'll walk in the water. Life is not a journey that ends in the grave but is within our mind and spirit.
