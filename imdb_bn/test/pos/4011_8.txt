I used to watch this show as I grew up. When I think about it, I think it's pretty good. If you asked me, it was a beautiful show. Any time I think about it, I do not remember the very best balance sequence and theme songs. Without that, everyone is ideally cast out. Also, writing was very powerful. Performance was very grade. I hope some networks will bring it back so I can see each episode. Before I wrap it up, I want to say that I will always remember this memory in my memory, even though I'm not sure whether I saw every episode. Now, in conclusion, when some network ever returns it, I hope you catch it before it gets better for a day.
