This movie is great. Stylish, fun, well played. I saw it described as a 'lock, stock and two smoking blossoms' and 'reservoir foos', both of which describe excellent. The plot is easy, but it does not stop from enjoying. Carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and a nice drunk gentleman in Miller. Set and costume is stunning, and refilhingly unusual for a 'costume drama' in music and camerawork. Sensitivity and sensitivity it is definitely NOT !!!!! My recommendation? See it, popcorn sit back with a huge tube and have a good good time.
