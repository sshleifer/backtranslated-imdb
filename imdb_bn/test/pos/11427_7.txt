Mad and Bali is one of Stan Leyell's mockery of the popular film, it is Rudolph Valentino's blood and sand (hence Stain is Rubber Vasselino). Though he was partially incompatible (though he did not explain how he defeated the vapor in the beginning), it was, according to him, the beginning of the best sequences as a dance with the law-enforced wife Mae Laurel, was ultimately most of the time. Another interesting section expresses concern with his wife Carmel about her unwillingness to romantic romantic in a female fatty, while his wife Carmel is waiting for her, which shows her next innocent character, Oliver Hardy. Mr Laurel is valuable for anyone who is interested in starting his first job before him, before his lucky document.
