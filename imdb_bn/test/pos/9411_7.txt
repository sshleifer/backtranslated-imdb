Yes, it's an impressive one. But it is mysterious and entertaining, and one of my favorites; There are some excellent actors in the film and they do a commendable job that gives plots and characters limitation. David Soul is attractive to see the role of 'bad guy'; I thought he was quite credible - and rather cool - the more paranoid CO Robert Conrad is a longtime favorite - I think he has taken his character very well for life; And I saw that Sam Waterstein has star quality in all of his films - movies or TVs. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie frequently but our tapes (copying a VHS TV I get) are so poor quality that it's hard to enjoy completely. This is a movie I think they should be on DVD; It's probably not universally sought, but I'm sure there are many people like me who like this movie, so there should be a market for a DVD version. I hope!
