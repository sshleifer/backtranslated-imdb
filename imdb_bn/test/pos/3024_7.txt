When I first released it looks like the trailer for this movie and it looked pretty cool. Although I did not get the chance to see it though. I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should see it. After all I love the "silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en", and if you enjoy this movie, you can find "The Cell". The idea of ​​the whole story is very interesting. Going physically into a murderer's mind, I can not imagine the world of living them. The acting is quite decent Jennifer Lopez I was not the only one that was great, but she did a credible job. I would recommend for a scary thriller. <br /> <br /> 7/10
