I was a fan of Jeff Bridge so I snapped over the DVD without seeing it before. I immediately became a fan of Kevin Spacy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The bridge builds a nice doctor (you * want to * talk to him about your mind) and spacer's expression and gesture role is perfect. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the clinic defense and the complete human characters is pleasing, especially in the delicate of their behavior. <br /> <br /> The last bittsweet - I like the choice of the proto, but the final scenes (with the bridges) disturb me.
