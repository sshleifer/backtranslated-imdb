It's been a difficult time for me to know just how wonderful this word was. Once you see a film that just stick with you. The movie "You Are Alone" (for me). The film is my head and my heart constantly. I repeatedly repeat the scenes every day and analyze them and go through the emotions again, as I see for the first time. <br /> <br /> there is nothing that I do not like about movies. Amazing soundtrack !!! The end was perfect. Very emotional stirring !!! <br /> <br /> I congratulated Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest ever. I admired the power of Britain (what a powerful woman). <br /> <br /> The tag line "When your most dark moments come". We do not know what we are able to do. Everyone said that I will never do it, when in reality we do not have any idea what we should do. We are very capable and delves into the subject that directs this movie. The honesty of the film can be my most favorite part. <br /> <br /> Thank you for the perfect part of the garment industry!
