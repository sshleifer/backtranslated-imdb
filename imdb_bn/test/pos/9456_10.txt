When I saw the first preview for this, I almost passed out of excitement. I was the longest fan - it turned me into Shakespeare, so a modern adaptation made a dream come true. My expectations were not frustrating. <br /> <br /> basically follows the original story and it means complex! I do not even want to try it related, the plot Summery will probably cover the basics. Imagine a girl who pretends to be a man in a boarding school and thinks about the possible situation that may be created. I will not even refrain from questioning the legitimacy of such a plot; The reality is not the point of the film. <br /> <br /> This is really ridiculous. Almost every scene comic sets up nails. Quds to the author, director and actors of this calculation. <br /> <br /> This photo is star Amanda Bains and she carries astonishingly. She can not be super-cute, a vixen and flawless comedy. I would greatly appreciate him for not being trampling like many other stars in his movies or public life today. I'm happy to leave at least one decent young actress in Hollywood. Okay, I'm locking my soap box ... <br /> <br /> Channing is tight, yes he's hot and flip-up like Gorilla, but he really smiles me! My favorite scenes in the whole movie when he was talking with Olivia before talking about cheese and then talking about his career method <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Inin debutant is the link between letters and classic evil girlfriend, monik, <br /> <br /> Overall, lots of fun, laugh loooots, and a very interesting cast. Maybe it can not be compared to the original, but it highlights the modern versions of other plays, of which I hate 10 things.
