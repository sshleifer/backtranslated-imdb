I agree with msinabottle; This is a very nice movie. Here are some conversation snippets: <br /> <br /> Russiai (San Connie) at Eden Pedekaris ("San Connie"): "You see the man better, how he draws water? When a bucket is empty, Now, you are full of power, but you are ruining it, and if Islam spreads out of your bucket, then dropping the drop. <br /> <br /> Royals: The English has paid very well in the past.Pedecaris: Well you will not have your way with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have your head for this. Royals: Roosevelt This President Roosevelt - will he try and accept himself? Pedecaris: He must be! He is a man of grit and strong moral fiber. Do not kidnap women and children! Royus: What kind of rifle does he use? Pedecaris: A Winchester! Royals: Winchester Winchester I have no knowledge about this rifle. Pedecaris: You will be. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): American Grizzly Bear is a symbol of American character: energy, intelligence, sharpness. At times a little blind and lazy, but brave beyond all doubt. Oh, and one other feature goes with all the previous. Newspaper reporter: That, Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: Loneliness. Bear life out of his life alone. Indomitable. Unbeatable But always alone. He has no real associate, only the enemy - but as none of them is as great. Newspaper Reporter: Do you think it could be an American feature? Teddy Roosevelt: Of course. The world will never love us. It can honor us. It might even fear us But it does not love us. We have too much myths. And we're blind and useless at times.
