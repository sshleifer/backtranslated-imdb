This is a Christmas movie, though "Christmas in Connecticut" can be any time of the year, because it's a soldier's story that spends an idyllic time with Marth Stewart's type. What does he think In fact, the woman represented by Stanwick repeatedly has a popular magazine column about a farm life with her husband and child. She has no farm, no husband, no child, she reveals her many recipes. They belong to the owner of nearby restaurants. His nonsense editor at Sydney Greenwich, when he strongly advised the soldier Dennis Morgan to entertain, he helped his lover to use his boyfriend's farm and he moved himself and the rest home. Even a baby has ... well, actually, there are multiple. Causes burst, and the sheets become increasingly difficult, especially when Stanwalk falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful movie and even if you are very depressed, you can lift it right "Connecticut Christmas". Barbara Stanwyck is surprising as the career lady becomes a homemaker. Despite not being dazzled like Crowford or Davies, she was able to play a role - it could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cold and / or sexy and it looked easy. Above that, he is always attractive and alluring. Dennis Morgan is a handsome and charming solider; As an extra bonus, he got to use his Irish tenor. Fianc√© Reginald Gardner is all business, and you can say he is not right for Stanwyck. S.Z. False uncle / genuine chef is funny, especially because he can stave off a pancake in front of the audience. <br /> <br /> I can imagine the effect of this delightful movie at the end of World War II. It was a real bacon for the good times to come.
