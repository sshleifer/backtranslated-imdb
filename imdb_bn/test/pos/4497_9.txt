I did not read the novel from which the movie is based. So I can not comment on the absence or comment on whether the change has been made. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, I had an excellent experience showing curiosity. When I look at movies other than other cultures, I learn how our other people live and live in the United States. <br /> <br /> The actor of this movie from Afghanistan and from other countries of the region In this first epic film, there are three little children, they had their first role, they were wonderful. <br /> <br /> The scene of Kabul was shot in different parts of China, I guess that this area is the true place of the same book <br /> <br /> Mark Foster directed and found Nevrland, he is here with the same magic Created by <br /> <br /> The first rate of production is the first rate. <br /> <br /> I got a better movie than the nominees and won the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Image is sub-titled, it is very clear to read. This is a correct PG-13 rating. Spillar Alert --- Child rape scenes are very well managed. <br /> <br /> But I can not give it a 4 star rating as a common plot and story line, we have a very suitable movie for many, many times, non-less. br /> Rating: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
