I saw many small movies in my day. Often I'm very short of them (too little time for visitors to spend time with viewers), very "arts", or lack of a clear scene. I can say no to this thing about Starcrossed. In this review, I will do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers, but I guess the reader understands that the theme of this film is brutal of brotherhood. <br /> <br /> With a short film, the story is fairly simple, straightforward and easy to digest. It is clear that the film is trying to enlighten the light of the most deeply embedded tabs of modern society. This film has every respect. During fifteen minutes running, I felt a ample sense of emotions myself. Only through short dialogue, the audience's quickest personal momentum and this star is dragged into the cross brother's thoughts. <br /> <br /> Starting from early childhood, you can see a very close relationship. There are brothers. When the film goes on in the next scene, the nice acting and honest, sincere acting will remind the audience that love can come in the most unexpected and rigorous way. Because of the progress of the relationship, viewers are primarily replaced by feelings and emotional troubles, since visitors suddenly realize that there can be only a possible solution. And after the resolution the heart is dyeing. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind will see this movie and exploit its message. If nothing else, the restoration of our deepest beliefs on brave and honestly shameful and secretive sanctions of terrorism challenges the viewer firmly and honestly. Although the film is only 15 minutes long, it is presented to the audience for a long time after the credit roll. This is probably my favorite little film that I have ever seen. I can not recommend extremely high.
