Tim Burton, the man behind the original Batman film and Bitlucus, has been increasing the world's Batman, which is more than the original, more than the original. Firstly Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batmans enemies. Some of the stories in the dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well in the rattle and the way Penguin works works the same way Joker works in the same way. The set is stunning and immaculate. There is so much dark path in the city of Gotham that you can not know what is happening or at any other time. The only thing which gives it a bad name is its script, which seems to be broken sometimes and then is not restored for it. Team Burtons brought superhero films to a new state in the direction. All Superman films and other Batman films beats by a mile. Although it has been banned at the start of the new batman on terms of realization, but Button's more original manager than Nottan
