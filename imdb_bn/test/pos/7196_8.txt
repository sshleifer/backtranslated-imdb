I just found a copy of "Mission Cleopatra", which you do not think easily for a person living in the United States. So far, I only watched the first 10 minutes of the film, and I can safely say that I saw the first * Live Action Accorix movie laughing in about 10 minutes. <br /> I'm watching the dubbed version, and Dobing's work is a bit annoying, but I think the book of this movie is very fun and true. I found that the people here said that the dubbed version is worse than the subtitle version, it can be very good and if I can see the subtitle version (also on my DVD), I have to come here and I will have to change the reviews. Although it stands, I see it as a very entertaining movie, and it is more than the mess created from the first movie.
