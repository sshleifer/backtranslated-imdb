A beautiful adaptation of Pierre's X-Harmon Melville; Or, unrest '. The comments here make me wonder, it makes me wonder what can be the amazing negative feedback. <br /> <br /> The shock value about this image is at least objectionable - a small story that is out of proportion. The story of Pierre's fall - and later the destruction of his surroundings - which are widely displayed in his characteristic, indecency and idol worship. I separate this movie from the conversation and any other soundtrack, and in a continuously emotional epic, converts a fundamental traditional story with controversial twists. <br /> <br /> I can not stress the importance of ignoring everything, I have heard about this image and I see, as I did with open mind. You, I hope, hope I will be rewarded in the same way. I felt the edge and nervous from around half-hour marks, but the film was far from scary in any traditional sense. It will leave you with 1,000 ideas, each one of them is annoying and thrilling. I know I'm scared here, but I think about the negative perception of this movie. It's the best I've seen throughout the year.
