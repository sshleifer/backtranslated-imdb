In my opinion, a movie can be rated best by the number of 'best scenes'. Probably there are at least 80-90 scenes of the entire film, which is probably defined by someone else or the other as 'Best'. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful composition. Duration I know it's been a long time before it, probably because it is a box office bomb attack. However, I think that any generation can relate to this movie and find a good smile. <br /> <br /> I am impressed that Mahmud is a part of the movie. His role is not 'pic', but it is good to see that he is cast in the best Hindi film of all time.
