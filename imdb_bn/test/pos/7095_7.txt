At the beginning of the film, the girl mentions her mother's cancer when I feel most affected about "One True Things". As the sadness of the subject, it was a fresh change in motion instead of blindness with the disclosure of the film's "love story" "conditions of sincerity", 2/3 of the serious illness of the character. <br /> <br /> Marily Strip, Renee Gelveser and William gave a very strong performance not to go to the heart. The characters they play seem to think; They are not perfect people. (Arguably, someone might not think of the character of "Martha Stewart" as the character strip but throughout the whole film, I think her character is great in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "One truth" is a surveillance, uncertain family drama that ultimately grows tears.
