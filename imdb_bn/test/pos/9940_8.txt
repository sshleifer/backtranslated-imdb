If you are okay with the decorated works of the Italian Premier Director, then you can take an incompatible story line and a dazzling style? Then there should be a great time with your opera. If you do not, then you do not <br /> <br /> <br /> Christina Marcelle played in Betey, a beautiful young opera great, who got shot as a star (the production of Macbeth's ant-guards) was hit by a car. Is Macbeth a product that carries a curse? And Batty soon discovered that the star he is no longer star is no exception: shutting down the status of a killer status. Theater ?? And forced to look at the poor rickshaw as a perpetual killer (who prevents her eyes from tapping down her eyes!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Betty The identity of this murderer has been discovered, and the truth about its mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Opera is a crazy movie, its rebellious plot-turn, death scenes, and the end of the beggar's beliefs. And when director Dario Argento is not for one, we say, the line of the conventional story, this particular gyolo is so dismal, and many of its trademarks feature stylish touches (the highest maximum maximum), which is almost as it is, with each successive film What can see (he often paraded his previous work). <br /> <br /> This picture is so funny why! <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> Argentina's camera movement is absolutely unbelievable: in the gliding, cropping and even in a wonderful sight, the opera roams around the room; Verdi's musical power combines the combination of Claudio Simon's score perfectly with greatness, which properly grandsiens in spectacular visuals; And some of the extraordinary sets-pieces (including Sergei Steventi's Furious Gore FX) prove that no person will make death better than Argentine (test the stunning death of a character, where a detective in a room at a bullet slow speed- Go through the hole, and directly into their eyes!) <br /> <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, 8 for IMDB Jantar round.
