Overall, this entertaining and weird film. Do not try to feel it. There is more holes than a computer may have with a story, but Robert Seimings and a cast of minor characters make fun of this "harmful" story. <br /> <br /> A different show than the popular TV and then the 1993 film is not looking for a madman, but an armed Nazi Sambot named "Frank Frei". When a defense plant in Long Angeles blames it, "Cummings" ("Barry Kane") blames him and goes to find out the person who opened the name (fries) to remove his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so is very exciting and interesting. Then came the story of Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin"), and it started vomiting some sad conversations. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did this work with his female character, I was surprised that there was a source of how the woman spoke. Lane's character had a little hair here. <br /> <br /> Actually, the villains operated by Auto Kruger ("Charles Tabin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry") were the best in my opinion. ..just fascinating Kruger's performance and dialogue were especially good. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this picture, Hitko has seen the well-known "North North Northwest", then you will get slim in the end and really enjoy it. Instead of a climatic view of Mount Rushmore, here's a memorable memory of 10 minutes at Liberty State. Naturally, the camera's angle of Hitcoak is great and fun to watch.
