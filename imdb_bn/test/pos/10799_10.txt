From offset, I knew it was a horror movie, motion, painter, indigenous personality in the Dallas area, character diversity, director Oliver Stone and of course E. Rick Bogassian ... The film started on Friday (the proposed spy at first place) and a radio in Dallas Starting with the station, their number one talk show, The Barry Champline Show (talk radio host Alan Ba Hosted on the basis) ... Barry (Eric Bogassian) is an abrasive radio talk show host and his work is so compulsory to report on the sensitivity of his show to the radio show that he shows ... he has a bunch of social deviations. Trying to reconcile lonely, weak, vague phone callers who are publicly vulnerable Been mad, Barry Champpellen is only effective in dealing with these socially disorganized rather than just conforming to this advice ... New Technology Lawless Dallas Radio serves a barbaric purpose for the listeners and takes a backseat to distort most ideas, "Baseball Scro, Orgasms, and People's Poles !! " Talk about it <br /> <br /> The whole matter is a dryness-addictive diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia !! This high profile canon sheet is something that rises on the barry champline !!! The rich patches, the lack of unwantedness and pornography, the parrots and the elaborate growth of the overall pop culture have become an unstable ammunition for the warlike battlefields of Barry Simlline! <br /> <br /> This film setting drops two thousand feet to the perfect ideology. The center of Dallas has a passionate feeling of cosmic awareness, through which there is a significant section of the Ku Klux Klan 20 miles away !! ... The game is located in Denver, where actual events occur, and other small theatrical plays illustrate the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Where this photo is held in Dallas, I thought it was a great choice !! ... This movie contains the horrific and erroneous misconceptions of American Jewish people through which they control banks, their programs are different from others and their intellectual literature leads to distortion! This preconceived notion compound Barry Champlain's overall hesitation !!! Barry Champplen's personal abrogation is shocking and responsive to his alcoholism, and his disgusting and political controversial nature is returning to its final condition, which is why this film is so credible! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Laura, her girlfriend, her producer, Barry will always think that anyone always misunderstood !! Allen, his ex-wife, Barry's suffering and selfishness, but Barry could not leave her feelings for Barrio without a personal feeling. Dallas radio audience is a molten pot of socially wrongly transferred reverse bates which humbly submits to their own real flaw !!! ... What do Barry Champplen do with somebody's own hand-up, Barry Champplen? ! Her audience's ignorance becomes the Barry Champlain's pet project for the deprivation, solicits, improving and finally determined sinners !! Barisal collapse of social culture conflict! <br /> <br /> This movie is superb !! In my opinion, Oliver Stone's best illustration with Platoon and natural birth killers .. In your statement, it tells you how wonderful a movie talk radio! ... story suggestions and acting and acting and co-producer of Erik Bogosian are only obligatory !! Camera angle, dialogue, hunting character image, all the top notch. At the end of the movie Dallas Skyline's cinematography is horrific !! There is a doubtful difference in Dallas as a mega metropolis ... so now, like Los Angeles and New York, counting the number of children there, low cost housing costs and cutting budget means that a significant number of people will die at this time next year. Guy !!!! ... as a large metropolitan area of ​​Dallas, its state is uncertain, by which human rebellion is going on !! The city has its listening radio listeners, who gave a surprise scream of nationwide air wave communication! The criminals in these movies! Those who want to meet the big bad wolf, the ghoulish tableaux derelicts, and their growing curiosity morally "America's Neighbors"
