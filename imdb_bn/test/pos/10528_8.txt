In the 1980s, Channel 5 in New York City was shown when I saw this television version of a Christy Mystery story. At the time, I was surprised that it was not shown on Channel 13, the public television station that most Masterpiece Theater has shown, but BBC documents from Dorothy Shire's "Lord Peter Wimie" store and The Monstone rarely deal with British intelligence stories. , The stories of the Revolutions of Victorian and the Edwinian era of Sherlock Holmes The stories were discussed, so the stories were involved in getting stories from Channel 13. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Desperate on the deceased person, who spoke the last words of the title of the story (The novel was originally asked why did not ask Ivan, but later Bomaranj Klou was reconsidered). , And detect a crime of those who surround a suspicious doctor (Eric Porter). Despite the father's warnings of the protagonist (John Gilgood), the hero (James Warwick) and heroine (Francesca Annis) continue their investigation - even more complex and more dangerous Became. The danger of suicide by the suicide of another suspect has apparently happened, because the killer started to censor two amateur detective detectives. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie, though I was too long for one night, it's better if it's divided into two categories, like Entertainment Weekend (Joan Hickson, or the next Miss Maple episode with the Harculla Pierreot episode) ). But it has its power. The right use of Porter as a major suspect, and subsequently a cute scene in the film where he seems to be spying with the mystery investigating young couple. If you are with the film, then you will be a fantastic surprise afterwards. <br /> <br /> But it's failing. When dealing with Christie's novel, the statistics of the story must be in a rigorous schedule so that the reader may understand the secret of the plot. I will only add that if you hear the conversation at one point and how a young boy almost dies (but not all), then you will come together all the pieces of the story and get the inspiration for the villain. <<br /> </ br> <br /> Telefilm is eligible for one of the best programs based on storytelling and its long time, except for its long story, when it is suddenly based on his novel Renaissance.
