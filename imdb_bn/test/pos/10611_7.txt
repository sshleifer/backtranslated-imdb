I saw a preview showcased Marigol a few days ago, and it is found in a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable film. When it comes to filmmakers and investors as well as after the movie finances disappear, it is a successful American actress in India to play a low-budget film. The opportunity to face an Indian film shooting near him would have led to a small dancer. As Indian films are involved in a significant amount of singing and dancing, it is a problem for Marigold, which has two feet, the personality of the person is so powerful and it is worth mentioning that he can rarely listen to music, feel alone, love lover, for love Suggest him. <br /> <br /> "The word" - the word, not a person - means "love", and love - person, nor the word - seems to relate to the emotion related to it around him, whether his production assistant, Who presented Martold to the shoot, the film's atrocities and arrogant formulas, or the rebellious and objectionable Marigold presented himself to himself. Soon, under his expert education minister and respectful treatment, Marigold finds his legs literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> I would say a word for people who do not know the use of songs and dance in Indian cinema. In contrast to American musical instruments, the story progresses through this dance number, such as the events of conspiracy are exposed and character transitions collide with dance. It should also be noted that Indian dance is much more than mere movement. An essential part of this is to apply the feelings and emotions of the dancer while telling the story of a dance. The main purpose of this dance and dancer is to. <br /> <br /> The Marigold that reached this stage is displayed in a stunning dance number about the Middle East, when Marigold, while doing dancing, has to show her love for film-in-the-film, love for love. This is an amazing performance of Ali Larter, especially when someone thinks he is dancing to his film or encouraging his character's feelings through dance. It shows her skills as an actress, as well as how hard she worked in the role. <br /> <br /> Of course, romantic movies can not work without trustworthy Prince Skimming. Salman Khan playing the role of love fits the role in T. Even when it is proved that he is not so funny a prince, he does not lose the sympathy of the audience. Salman has been ruling Hindi cinema for many years (sometimes known as Bollywood), and it is good to remember that his first major role was love. She is completely charming, sweet, adorable, sexy, and weak. For those who did not face them before on screen, be ready to hit mega dosage with perfect magnetism! He and Ali have created a lovely pair of Larter, and played them well as well matched. <br /> <br /> Will they be directed to work their problems? As we hear the last song of the film, the truth and the imagination, a lovely blend of reality and metaphor as it does not seem possible. At last, I am surprised by some Sriram viewers, but they are satisfied. The songs are used very tricky. They are in Hindi, unclear titles, for film-in-the-movie sequences and on other occasions in English. But their meaning is always clear from context and dance. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very satisfied romantic comedy - yes, it has a lot of humor. Indian position and costume gives it a fairy tale quality, a story that can be compared with a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Indian movies, then do not hesitate to try it. , It's a nice introduction. It is not only clothing and jewelry (which is not quite impressive), but also vibrant colors and globally, not only the sound music but also the colors and vibrations of Indian films. <br /> <br /> If you are a lover of Ali, you should see Larter, your selfish, demanding, portraying a "high-conservative" woman, because it is still an attraction that inspires the love of two men. Do it. If you are a girl, then you will wear Eli's lovely clothes and a leading man enjoys behind her animal. If you are a man, you can not just praise Ali in his sexy clothes, but learn from Salman Khan to get out of love with a man like Maligold.
