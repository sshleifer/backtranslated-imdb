I have seen this movie once, and I look forward to seeing it again and again. Dear David (from Belgian), why were you annoyed to write a comment on this movie? I just think we can think about you (after reading your comment), you are a non-sexually watched person (like Erika in the film), and the new movie you are coming out is not ready. I guess you are a little old, and sexual expression is not part of your "visage". The Cannes Film Festival is still the best movie festival, and I'm happy to say that this film was rewarded with Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabella Huppert is fantastic, as always, who will do this movie like him? One of her best performers ever The music is superb, and once Michael Haneke puts reality on the big screen. This is a topic like 95 episodes of Dogma. Try to see it. <br /> <br />
