Martial art films were huge in Asia in the 60's but America was caught with the increasing popularity of Shah Brothers films. This film was first presented in America under Warner Bros Labels and it really started a madness that became a flood with 70 martial arts films. Most of the followings will be relatively pale, but some were cool and many of the drug the dragon (which came out soon after) became a huge success story and created superstars from these fighters. <br /> <br /> Go fast after almost 40 years and this movie is still up until now. Most of Shau Bhai's films were as good as today, and they really said that no films were made for competition in competition with the days of Shaw Bros. <br /> <br /> I do not want to look like martial art post, and for anyone who does not see porn for plots, it is similar to MA movies, and most of them are a huge fight cluster with short stories, this is an exception. It does not have a wonderful story but there is a. <br /> <br /> The main person of the iron cast is actually standing among the cartoon heroes of the film. He never brags and he does not fight because he can, he is often seen as weak and most fighter, but when he is to fight, he is the best living. I really like this character. Bad people were very memorable and war scenes were so amazingly presented. Even a small role can be seen as a huge mongolian with Bolo Ying, and say that I am at the top 5 as the greatest martial artist film star of all time, he was also mentioned in the above mentioned Enter the Dragon. <br /> <br /> As I said, the production is wonderful, you can not beat the shaese, I have seen a lot of things in 70 second movies, the color was good and this movie stood alone and stood up. Others up When light is lit with a haor, he is a fist of iron, his pure beauty. <br /> <br /> The music was fantastic too. Two different art forms were so common in martial arts films that were in western Italy in Asia. The countries producing these films were all styles but Japanese films were creating waves that Spaghetti was in Western Italy. With these differences, the style of these two styles is neck and neck. Films such as 5 Finger of Death have been found to be easy to fight, compared with the Sergio Leoni cowboy stand, and the music combined together the juniors together. Here the song was borrowed from Irananside, but it was still very original. <br /> <br /> Many movies were inspired by this inspiration, and when I see it, I can see the effects of Bledport on Master Kilder. The most obvious movie was influenced by Bill Bill, which is my greatest ever. Many of the quinine sets used are full copies of complete viewing and he used the music from this movie, although the song he used was Music Music from Eonoside. And the fight scene at the end of Battlefield Bill Vol. With the help of 1 Bride and O-Renne, at the end of this film, the producer of the well-wisher than the Cai Hao and the Japanese Thag war. <br /> <br /> I have seen many martial arts movies, even some are good, but for this continuous fans, we must see. You can not make mistakes here The film starts at a slow pace but takes 15-20 minutes and does not come in slow motion.
