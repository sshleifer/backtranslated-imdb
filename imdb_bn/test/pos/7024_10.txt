One of the best movies of the 80's, Darthy Dance is a low budget movie with high-budget income. A soundtrack that you want to get up and dance is a love story that we all want that we can live (if you are a woman), this is a movie that you want to get up again. <br /> <br /> The music, which runs the movie, flows well with enthusiasts and emotions from the audience. 60 hits like Antis Redding's "Love Man" and 80 hits like Eric Carmen's "Hungry Eyes" by Frankie Wally and "Overweight" like Eric Carmen's "Overload", Dirty Dance is a mix of fun and passionate The young teenager of the shameful teenager shows the transition of a dowry femininity, all of us hope against the beautiful backdrop of all the summer romances. Bang wants more. <br /> <br /> "dirty dance" will not be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes plays her role as Penny, who is a dancer who can challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts. Patrick Soow is more than a fantastic job and shows more and more of his skills, as an actor, but also with dancers and singers. And Jennifer Gray is as bright as a child, when her transformation of the dance portrays the transformation of her condition. <br /> <br /> To all, the Winnie Dance is one of the best movies of all time and at least the observer is valuable. It is doubtful that the first bits of the first title of "Ben My Baby" in Ronot will not catch your attention and you will not get attracted to the magic of sex dances and musical instruments.
