Poor fight is one of the best political, government, and written TV dramas in just 25 years. <br /> <br /> The acting is amazing, the text is spectacular. <br /> <br /> The real truth is that we are not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological, and radiological attack on the ground in Dir War America. <br /> <br /> The Wanted War should be made in a major motion picture - it's good! <br /> <br /> This TV drama reveals how the British intelligence (MI5 and MI6) tried to revive the conspiracy conspiracy of terrorist plot and innocent victims - because of this involved in the Iraq war in England. <br /> <br /> The views of various parts of London are also spectacular. <br /> <br /> Must watch warship !!!
