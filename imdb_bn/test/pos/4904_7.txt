Loveful and interestingly interesting to look at Garfield's radioactive, successful performance (a new type of rebellious acting style that will carry on Brands and Cliffs and carry after war). But all those sisterly affection are a little frustrating. Priscilla Lane is a brilliant, compelling actor, but other sisters do not really register (though they all are allowed to tart and mock) and I'm buying a male character other than Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a great actor, but there is a lack of weight in the movie star with Garfield's tough fortune Mickie Birden, and this film suddenly sends out. (Imagine Jimmy Stewart or anyone else.) Also, I was not convinced that Garfield would make a final decision (at its own minimum) on his decision. The film required half an hour of running time to make the action more effective; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It falls short to be a classic, but it has a few classic moments.
