I would recommend this as the most successful attempt to make a film in the Soviet Afghan war. And it's very honest and responsible pictures from the uniform and human relations related to weapons, routine of war and small details of the mid-Asian landscape. In 1989, after the withdrawal of non-combatants in 1989, they were shot in Tajikistan. The Italian star Plakido Major was perfect in Bandura's land. Other characters also looked very naturally, especially the drunken club managing officer :-). This scene was eventually awakened but could be the result of a civil war in Tajikistan which began with the film's shooting. All the movie teams were even ever exempt under the fire. The last scene is completely the type of "Haraki" behavior and reminded me of the famous phrase from a famous Samurai film - "We won all the wars but lost the war". This could be the metaphor of the fall of the USSR - the great country is allowed to return a small harmful child back.
