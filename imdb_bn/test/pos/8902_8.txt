As a faithful Astrix fan throughout my life, I would like to say that "Astricas and the Vikings" are probably the best works of aesthetic films. It got some funny jokes in it and animations are fantastic. Since many have mentioned that it does not really follow the comic ("Astrics and Norman's") very closely, but in many ways this is also right, because this book has come to my mind, the fun of the sixties culture, and most of it is today very Dated <br /> <br /> I've really surrounded the wrong way, even though how they incorporated a Disney-style plot, the film takes a lot of focus away from the Estonian and Obelix. We have a misunderstanding boy, not fit with Yastafors. We are a tom-girl girl who is not suitable because she wants to behave like a man, father. They meet and fall into love, but their love is threatened because the boy is completely embarrassed to be honest with the girl, but ultimately win their love. It has been the plot of many Disney (and, fair, and other studios) movies which is not funny and the plot was 22 years old. I mean, they even gave a fearsome animal Sidekick to JÃ¤sterfires. <br /> <br /> I could not find this derivative and clichadi, but it really made me unhappy with the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> I think that this film was fantastic, I thought that despite the way to hijack the plot, I still think about it very much.
