This product has received a lot of poor reviews, it's actually good for her age. Note that this is not a BBC program, it was only licensed by Grenada Venters when the Zen Austen collection was released from the DVD. <br /> <br /> How does it compare to other adaptations of the same novel? Today's best known version is Amanda Route as Captain Frederick Warwickworth as Ana Eliot and Kairan Hinds of 1995. That film was a short but a good snapshot of a story - the previous version, the same roles were told four hours stories in the same story with Anne Firbank and Brian Marshall and went on to a more exciting pace. <br /> <br /> Firabank is a good 10 year old for her role, but she's very nice - a man like Marshall Ventworth, a man frustrated in love, and bitter about interference. And the hidden people in cast also contribute - Michael Kulawar, later Cadfile Harvill is seen; Richard Vernon, later seen as an Admiral Croft in the galaxy in Hitachi's Guide; Nawl Dyson, formerly at Mrs. Mussorgov in Cornish Street <br /> <br /> It is a matter of criticism that the hairstyles are a little confusing, and the clothes are awful! Still, this should not be deterred from an extremely addictive Austen adaptation.
