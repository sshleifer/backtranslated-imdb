Much of the political thriller was presented as a part of the majority of the film, with a few improvements in the main character, which was much appreciated, until the tears burst and the strongest connotation that "experience the silence of the sheep." Or "six knowledge." Egyptian Egyptian husband Vithan Witherspoon and strongest armed interrogator, Iglal Nour offers a strong demonstration. Unfortunately Jake Gyllenhaal is handed a more bi-dimensional character and has been presented many times before other movies that have been struggling with a stereotypical representation of mentally broken CIA analysts. At the beginning of the spectacular scene with an explosion similar to a scene at the end of "Savings Private Ryan", the uninterrupted scene was used so effectively to reflect a consequence of violence. This script gives a little more attention to the mindset of "enemy" but does not really allow viewers to understand much, but lets viewers look at stereotypical characterization. Cinematography and photography are a bit frustrating because the "Zerhade" or "Blackhock Down," unclear, raw vicarral presentation does not allow viewers to live in the movie, there is some distance in which the viewers keep watching the intensity of the emotions occurring on the screen. However, overall, the movie eventually re-reviews itself, providing a measurable look among the potential complications and consequences that visitors can use in the United States, and the complexity of presentation.
