Another popular screening of the British film at the Century Theater in the Collyvill. A well-designed, firm drama is never developing developing plot and twists 'in the story' ... piled up as false! A masterclass, played by a neutral cast directed by Julian Fellows, the first executive director. Tom Wilkinson is always a great performance, but a good change by all actors including actors Linda Basset and John Neville. Our audience was mad at this film, some of which are shock events that make you 'jump'. A good tight production in about 80 minutes, is probably produced in very limited budgets, but a success, which should be returned again for the big screen. Some of the specimens for the film seem to have been set in 50 seconds (according to Nigel Barchin's novel), but obviously this is not the case. Recommended offer.
