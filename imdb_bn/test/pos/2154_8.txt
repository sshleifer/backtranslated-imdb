I saw this fantastic documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is highly decorated and well-crafted, illustrating Harry Nilsson's life and career in the most satisfying musical genius of the 1960s and 70s. Although I was familiar with his famous works ("A Lone Lists List", "Without You"), I learned about this person's brilliant writing and beautiful singing. If you love music, you will get a lot of interest in attracting you to his world, which unfortunately his success has increased and his past disappointed him. But sadly, he was fully devoted to his family and you would feel happy to show this person. Profiles were effectively influenced by Nileson's own words and through his friends and colleagues (Rock of the Rock of Humans) who loved him and respected him. Do not miss this!
