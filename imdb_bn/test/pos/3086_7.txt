This is a fun movie and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays a tee Robin Hood. This, of course, vs Bad vs. Nottingham's bad Sheriff with the usual good vs. vs Robin. Humor is sort of in your face stuff most often, but still works well. When you do not want to think more about a comedy for the night, it's a good rental price!
