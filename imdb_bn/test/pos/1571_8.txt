Works professionally with young girls on the run, I found this photo is amazingly authentic. I have never found a friend who does not lend his friendship video. Here's the classic theme: The age is coming, the mother / girl assurance, the limited favorite of the aggregate, the good samaritan, tragedy, every life and many levels or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a gun we know how she uses it, she has some contacts) and it does not end in the clich√©. Cast really "sold" their role. It is adult charity and audio little charity. Take 15 minutes to attract you in this.
