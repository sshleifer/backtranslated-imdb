Recently "paggetate flats" shown on cables, a small film that packs many. Instructions with Harris Dawn Style. The screen of Mr. Dawn and Deen Fine made a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie you probably want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The story about a young L.A. doctor who made a mistake and paid for it. After being released from prison, he wants to hide in a small town where he thinks he will forget. Bad choice! What is the Thomas Reid eccentric flat found in the desert hell? After landing the job as a tender for several times, Thomas met a beautiful young woman, who clearly wants to stay away from anyone. The young doctor is called for help as Sunny's boyfriend Randy, shot dead by a drug vendor. <br /> <br /> We can know Randy's family. His uncle Dean seems right, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Each of the family is connected to Snicker one evening. <br /> <br /> Performance is good. Vincent Ventrececa Thomas, the man who went to LA training in the small town instead of smuggling. Alexander Holden Sunny, a young girl with an extraordinary aspiring to flee in the neighborhood. Kevin Alejandro, Greg Henry, Brian Austin play well in McLinn's family. Nicholas Tururou also contributed as a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the director with a promise that will judge far from this firmly-formed movie.
