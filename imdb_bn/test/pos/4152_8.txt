This is not a movie that is not worth mentioning. As the 19th century, the incredible poverty in Sicily is shown as 20th, which is a life style that makes people dream of America's "new" world. The Mancuso family lives in places where there is no bathroom, only a stone cottage can be placed in the harsh, uninterrupted stone of a country that can not even provide a single leaf blade of green grass. A surplus sequence indicates that the standard men are standing on the top of a steep hillside under a drunken mountain, exchange 'sign' in exchange for a sign in the top of the stone in their mouths, which they should set for the new world or where they live. It also shows that people are killed in fishing boats, actually taking a breath, the situation of Alice Island, where their journey has not yet ended, they have been interrogated and interrogated to prove their 'fitness' to enter the United States. No ship is shown in the logshot, or indeed any shot that will mark it as a large, marine fishing boat; Detecting America, New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty, which do not show any views, Elise Island can be anywhere in a country. Perhaps the most amazing shot is watching a hundred people from the camera crane jam together; Slowly about two-thirds of the screen's left screen starts to separate from the third on the screen, and we realize that the people on the left are in the dock on the ship and on the right, a strong statement of the society is fragmented. Although we have been scripts with caution and evidently have followed the full original ship of immigrants as a combination of specific family / circumstances, it still has a strong documentary feeling. Nothing is happening in dramatic terms, it is not for multiplexes popcorn brigade but it is a really great movie for everyone else.
