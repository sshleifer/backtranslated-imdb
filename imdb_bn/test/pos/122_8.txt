Overall, a well done movie. There were some parts that made me fool, and the parts that I threw my hand, but I got a little more with me. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is suffering from someone serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it, tell me that the clear references to the trial by the fire in the Ramayana, beyond what has stood for this film. Ramayana is an epic Not a 200-page book that puts women down in India. The movie divides almost two daughters into a very unique Indian family. Though "the free tradition of family tradition" seems conservative India, but I can assure my reader that I (the people who lived in Delhi for 12 years) found the whole episode that the bells did not roam around. I mean some things and some work is very true, but some other stuff is just the right way off the mark. Especially today <br /> <br /> Delhi complex. India is complicated. The director tried both easy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can imagine a movie about American Indian Americans. Or say french english. Seriously jerking. Even the servant spoke prominently in English (though with a hint of conversations in "credibility" language). <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the Leads is obvious. If you want it hot, it's a movie for you. I think it is the largest savings in the past - the development of true real life love stories. <br /> <br /> If this picture was about Radha and Sita, then it got a complete sign from me. And being about them, it could create a fine statement. But outside of this movie it can be said that this is India, and this is just like the Indian society. And as regards that as soon as possible it failed. Take everything you see with a pinch of salt. India's dark secret information is not being disclosed Only two girls are in love. It's exactly the same everywhere else.
