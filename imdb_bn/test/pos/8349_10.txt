Since watching the trailer in "The Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Saga", I thought this movie would be great because I'm a huge Disney fan. And guess what? I'm fine This film is a very successful heir to the original "Lady and Tramp". <br /> <br /> It tells the story of scum, lady and scum boy of the tramp, who want to survive rather than be wild and free. A housedog life Although the movie may not be as good as the first, it has a great morality that you can not find it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that this movie is not for everyone, but you who hate it, I can say that you do not have such a spirit and I suggest that you will not see it again. But hey! It's really a remarkable story, with excellent animation, music and stock-studded voice trips complete with Scott Wolf (five party) and Alice Milano (skinny). So if you do not watch movies, why stand? Go and grab the copy !!!
