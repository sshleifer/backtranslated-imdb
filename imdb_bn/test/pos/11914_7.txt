The toy crew is a real work film but what actually stands is that the script writer and the director attempted to accurately portray American counter-terrorism forces. Just check out the last credit - a dozen US military officers and officials are listed. The film accurately portrays the FBI as the hostage of hostages, but it denies their presence at the time after the US Army's Delta Force (known as Anamy in the Pentagon as a film) still apologizes for the President's Commissions Commissions Act. US Code. In the end, the US military forces properly dressed and armed. Even using AH-64 Apache for air support - which may seem a little too high, it is not terribly unrealistic. Much expensive and authentic good movies portray American counter-terrorism forces with fewer precision.
