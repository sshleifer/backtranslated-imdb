Nick Runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books ever read. I probably had very high expectations from the film, but the movie was not good enough, the entire setting seemed realistic. Nothing is fancy. The dialog was not very interesting or strong, they were right. The film was not a bad experience, especially in the last 15 minutes, where it was real emotional and even the most difficult people would probably cry. But my imagination was much better than a movie ... I've been crying more than reading a novel, watching movies. But overall there is a good movie for those who do not have your readers to visit them. But readers-novels will be a better experience, so if you want to watch the movie, first read the novel and then compare the movie.
