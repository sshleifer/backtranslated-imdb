I thought it was really a great movie, especially it was a jitter filler for me. I was bored, got it from the library and I really enjoyed myself! I have seen this twice in two days and as much as I like it I have seen more. I thought that this plot is going to be pure, but it can finally be said to be true. I like the main characters and I thought they could cast well and you can see true friendship. I did all they did a wonderful job. The last was good. And you really hate the bad guys and you really like guys better. Which is supposed to be like a movie.
