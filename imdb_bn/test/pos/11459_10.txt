I must say that. This is one of my favorite movies to watch Halloween. Halloween party, horror acting, Miami-style decorated people and extra. Great Great Great !!! <br /> <br /> ********************************** ******* <br /> <br /> My random 80's is a huge place in my heart for the horror of Flickr and it came out of my heart's strings. I always pass this flick to Blockbuster and always laugh at the cover of the box. Now every weekend I will grab a random movie which I have never seen before ... It was Angel Turn on a weekend. She seems to have been taunting me for several months. So I increased it and spent most of the movie below the blanket. <br /> <br /> For me it was terrible and poor. Not just acting! The things they brought for this movie were surprising. I can honestly say that the best part for me is that Suzanne (played by a co-star Iv√°n) watched her lipstick tube locked through her nipples. It was random and I liked it. It was enough for me to stay awake all night to see the lazy Angela flavets with Halvey and listen to the voice of its vague giant! <br /> <br /> This is not one of the most tricky or best acting horror movies. But the cheese of 80 and it got all the elements you needed. Katha Goth Kid, Virgo, Shot, Naked Girls, Horrible House, Bad Performance, Oh I mentioned nude girls? All the elements were there and were put together that made for one of my fave movies. For filmmakers.
