There are many people on this type of 80 films, but these people can not have age. I was just starting college while releasing this movie, and I am really grateful at that time and my friends and I still make a joke about certain lines in this movie. As soon as I like Jeff Spikoli, the character of Sean Penn in "Fast Times", I really enjoy the character of Chris Pen, "Tommy" because he has a keynote speech with the main character, with which only a linear series is opposed. Spicoli Chris Pen will probably have to use this for his inspiration to pop the film into VCR and lose some weight. Yes, mistress with Randy Quaid, the Vietnam vet character appears to be a little bit from the place, but she works firmly in the role. If someone does not see this movie, but like any other movie like "Fast Times", I highly recommend it.
