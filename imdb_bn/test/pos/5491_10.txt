I saw a lot of my action thriller in life and it's obviously the best one! There are very few movies that I consider a few times and it's one of them. Everything in this movie is OK: As Clint's extraordinary actor, Ren Rousseau (its a very rare combination of her non-stupid female partner - sad, but true!). Of course, John Malkovich is very much appreciated for his excellent villains, but our Eastwood's primary friend is not played by Dylan McDermat, who plays a complete role in my view. The soundtrack is pretty cool - but not sadly released a main soundtrack CD (Producer Shame!). The plot makes the result of the conflict between the sensible and the Malkovich continent. I give this one 10 stars!
