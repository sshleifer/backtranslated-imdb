I have seen this picture last night, and I have to say that I like every minute. If a parody of Bond-Esquier films is taken in the spirit, it's really high. The film's true comedy has its obscure disregard for political purity. These rage movies are used for anger, cultural anxiety, and almost ridiculous macho-ISM major comic effects. It also considers the agent to be illogical and formulas with OS 117, and when agents lose some distinct formula, Agent OS 117 constantly learns hard (like Arabic and how to run a traditional device). A few hours after the movie ended, the laugh made me laugh ... and I had to say that I learned something ... interesting ... the French vocabulary, which probably was very annoying with my professors. Use. All in all, I thought this film is excellent. Very funny and I have ever seen that the first movie parrodes all aspects of the real spy movie.
