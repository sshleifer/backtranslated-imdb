I've seen this movie many years ago, and hated it completely - I could not wait to finish, and wanted to go out, but a girl sleeping on my shoulder. Do you know I have never forgotten this movie, and more, I would say it has been going on for years with my image and music. How many movies in the movie house I cried and laugh, then I forgot to hit the road ... I saw it, I can not even think! Rare Davis is a film like Venice that enters your consciousness and manages changes in the sea. French is like an art, and movies like this prove to be true. I give it 10, 3 I have seen it that night.
