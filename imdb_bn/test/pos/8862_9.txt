Antarctica, Winter 1982 A team of American laboratories was surprised by the helicopter behind the dogs who were behind the dogs trying to kill the Norwegians. All the Norwegian were killed and Americans have nothing, but a dog, a few of the body and the question. Which I have ever seen at the beginning of the greatest horror / thriller movie. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end you feel, the pain of acute pain. Helpless and out of the land of no man alone. Enno Merrron was nominated for the Razzie Award for his score. Why I do not know that as far as possible I can see his score, vague and very good. It really gets you in the right mood. <br /> <br /> Great acting! The best performance is probably given by the dog, which is just amazing. I can not say anything less with Russell and the other two legs. <br /> <br /> Do you think 1982 and special effects are not the most influential? Well, think again! You have not seen it all until you meet it. Bodyparts fall off and change the nature of animals ... Rob Botine stands as a milestone special effect makeup that stands today in a great work witch. <br /> <br /> The movie does not get a big response when it hits first. At other times alien films due to big screens and so it is not very well-known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody asked me to hear it. However, the film has survived twenty years as a prominent film on video and DVD. Longer than the twentieth century and the movie except the haircut is still very up to date. This movie will be considered as a classic. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt if the movie is not my favorite. I saw it several times, but it was the first time I saw it. As Norwegian I do not like this movie that McArthur calls Norwegian Sweden!
