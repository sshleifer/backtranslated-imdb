First, be careful a word. The DVD box describes this picture as a comedy. I do not think there was any purpose associated with a film other than morons marketing. Although light and somewhat funny, it's not a comedy and if you hope you're upset. <br /> <br /> I never even heard of the movie and there was absolutely no hope other. The two DVDs I picked up were frustrating, I was very happy to see this movie. Acting, writing and direction were excellent. Before the Nazi acquisition in 1940, the story is clearly interested in me because you do not usually watch movies in France's final month. It gives some insights into parasites, which release very quickly and agree to share their favorite country. Alongside, Isabella Adjani has a very well-behaved plot of selfish and weak actresses - who looks extraordinary after all these years. She finds a poor sap to kill the former lover and then take the fall. He escapes from this damp fisherman and is accompanied by another boyfriend - a high official official run by Gerard Depardie and Vassel. In addition, a mistress of a Jewish physicist tried to crush the deuterium out of the country was introduced and eventually it became the main plot. Most wonderful twists and turns in the story, light sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some really suspicious moments. Together, they make a nice package, please make sure.
