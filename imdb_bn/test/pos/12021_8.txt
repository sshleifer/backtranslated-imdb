Although I watched this movie as a childhood, I already knew the story of the hero-thief-ticker and Shepherd who escaped from New York prison. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film follows more or less credible truth stories. This so-called so-called historical movie, which is a temptation to influence, this film is resisted and should be praised for filmmakers. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, very poor performance, and Tommy Style is ideally cast. Just like Steffle Baker, Thief-Baker and Alan Badel are always good. <br /> <br /> Because this image is related to the truth, it is suitable for viewing by all the families.
