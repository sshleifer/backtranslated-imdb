My and my friends used to go to this house on Friday night to get together in one room. This is the only program that missed us while opening. One of the best comedies I've ever seen if it's not the best. David Jason was brilliant and compared to Buster Keaton with his cute stunt that was pulled off his traitor many times. I can watch the series watch DVD again. He had an amazing ability to see the stupid things believable and this series shows how much his genius in so many different aspects. He is a typical "Trip and Paul guy" and I once remember to see the trailer where he shows people how to professionally. Of course he is one of the people to teach this industry. He showed only glimpses it in other programs. Pshaw, this program shows how talented he is. Why David Jason forgot to create another series, it was one of the best works for my mind and I became a fan since this series. It is said that he did not like it because it lacked his initial career. My mind is better, perhaps it would be the right decision when he took it, but now his career has progressed, I believe that it will be a good time for him to have a good time showing him "back to the secret life" he does not see That's full of blunders.
