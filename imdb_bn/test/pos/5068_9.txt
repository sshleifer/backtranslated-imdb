A very good political thriller about the excellence of terrorists about the use of terrorism and political repression to terrorize terrorism. <br /> <br /> This story is compiled, where two families are adversely affected by terrorist incidents. <BR> <br /> This is one of the best roles of Merrill Strip in these years. He is a cool, calculated, driver of the CIA who allows this thing to go. He is out of George Bush-Dick Cheney School to fight terrorism. When his episode expanded, Miss Strip certainly waited for a prize during the Oscars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jack Gilenhal is our hero. A CIA agent who can not really accept what can. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who really has a heart and it costs him his life in this well managed, fine-tuned movie. <br /> <Alan Orkin appears briefly in a conniving senator section. Mr. Arkin seems to get well with the age.
