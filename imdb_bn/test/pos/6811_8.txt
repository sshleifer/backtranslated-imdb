A new style for Lamas first- no tattoo, motorcycle or carpet. I, miss them, for one. But it's a serious movie. He plays an FBI profiler who lived with the bad boy of his head so long that he did not believe in himself. Gary Bushy is a great actor or someone else I do not want to meet in broad daylight. Christian Clock fiercely followed Lamas to pursue the serial killers. A wonderful incident happened after the story, which at least did not end at least. It never comes - there is always a more level of story. Clock and Lama start out as the best guys, turn into bad guys and somehow end up the heroes. But it is definitely worth the rent price. A candy bar for maximum enjoyment, popped and throwing a bag of a soft drink. You are going to the movie!
