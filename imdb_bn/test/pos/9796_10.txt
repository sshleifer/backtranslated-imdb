Where do I start? I first saw this movie in 1995 and had no idea what to expect, I actually played Eliass Wood star while filming at that time and it was highly recommended. I sat down and saw the film once and did not know what to think. I saw it a second time after a few days and floodplain is open. Sometimes I did not cry while watching a movie in my life, and I was fascinated, I was beside the side of every higher and lower film, on a mental roller coaster. <br /> <br /> <br /> Many At the same time, the emotional character of ours, the great sadness and ambition of film, the curiosity of childhood and innocence, which was once but now but no longer. Except for some, this film reminds me of my childhood (except for abuse) a few days ago when I removed my childhood a few days ago and even I did not even notice, I gave it up a completely, a life. Radio Flyer awakened me and suddenly realized that I would leave without it. From that day I want to change my life and myself immediately. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, for the last 6 years and I have changed so much, so much so Well, to hug and save yourself that part. I have really found out who I am. I do not think that this was the real event of the right movie in my life at a critical moment, The Radio Floyer really worked a bit more and I still see it as an incredible work in all its aspects. Incredible movie <br /> <br /> I can fail to mention the song while closing. I'm a great fan of Hans Geimmer and it's one of his most beautiful works. The depth and depth of the amount of emotional expression he has placed on this photo is a great part of what makes the film to me. Like a subtitle of a foreign language film, its film will take you through its bright music, a cage sheet in a deep emotion. Always find the soundtrack, I am sadly erased long ago, I will never find it, but after working with Hans Geemma's Visitors guest book, I worked wonderfully after chatting. See this movie, let your emotions save, do not get annoyed with the last trivial repression, and be the child.
