Subbaria brings much concern with the upcoming "peak" of the last oil supply. World population is increasing, so oil and electricity are in demand. As we extract oil and energy, we produce a "peak" to come. More oil is claimed, less oil is generated. Inevitable results conflict, and major changes. <br /> <br /> If you are new to this topic then this movie will be annoying and dangerous. The effect is so serious because you may react with the first anger and denial. It needs to be seen. Outside politics, beyond optimism, mathematics is incredible. <br /> <br /> Focus on Sabaria, because our suburbs communities will be the most influential when the energy skyrockets communities. The intuitive argument will tell you that it will make it difficult if it is not possible to maintain the efficient community without the traffic on the coast, it will be difficult to avoid the big cities during the crisis. <br /> <br /> Peak oil is no longer a matter of survival and the discussion of survivors of the rooks. We think of this problem as soon as we think. This image is a handsome, coherent look.
