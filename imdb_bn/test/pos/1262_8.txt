It was a great movie just for 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of filmmaking in this film and I am glad Nalan preferred to take pictures in black and white. The plot is still entertaining that still keeps you involved. Even the dialogue was good with good acting. It reminded me of what was coming into Memento by not growing sequence. How did I try to use the main character, as Kobb told him that "everyone has a box" that he kept his personal things. Also, the Batman logo on the writer's door was ridiculous because Christopher Nolan would later lead Batman Begins and The Dark Knight to play two great films. In the end, there is such a great turn that I'm not going to fall for someone I have not seen, though I think what would happen if Kobe gave the youngster De Laud's credit card. I liked the copywriter's copy of one of my favorite philosophical books by Plato. This is definitely a movie that needs to be viewed once to get you the full view, plus it is only one hour long. Where it started it has a circular aspect where I have started which was fantastic brilliant.
