Hayo Miyazaki's films about the story have always been hit-miss-me, but with the characters of simple animations against the background of artists, they are fantastic in front of the eyes. Ponyo bathes with the character of a formula, so I want him a pretty doll doll and the scene is so beautiful that it does not find the place where the wall is made. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I did not enjoy her last two wide releases, Spirited Away and Haoul's Moving Castle. It was very young, more for kids and adults just coming to enjoy the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed by the score of Hessecie, who also scored for the top. - Two movies, this time around was not nearly memorable. Although I can not remember the score of Howello now, I still think it's the best one I've ever heard. Ditto Spirited - Although I think it is very complementary to the film. Maybe it is not as good hunting because scores that are more kids hired than ponyo. In any case, this movie is still under surveillance for fans of Anime or Miyazaki.
