I'm not a fan of this brand of amusement - stereotyped characters act on their way through police and robbers. But there are enough desired characters to maintain interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is comfortable, but actually the movie-carrying dancer Dan Stockwell, stole every view as the mobster (name Tony, no less) per head. <br /> <br /> Stockwell's performance is because I am writing this review (and the only reason I would recommend it), actually. You will be tickled by the time of its screen. He managed to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche, perfectly crowded boss plays with curiosity in the right place. In fact, there is a complete joy to see Stockwell - 'double acceptance', and a motivational case and a real 'look' in the Feders is a master. <br /> <br /> Mesa said: A good movie to watch while lavender folding or eating.
