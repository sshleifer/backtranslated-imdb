I am usually aware of the movies around the 6/10 mark around IMDB. People like IDE are thinking about what they are talking about and what they like. I think the strategy of review is "Hey, if I like this movie, would I give more scores than I would like to give now, because I do not like these movies" Then again people judge differently, acting, Or maybe more value base on stories or guides. Anyway, I landed the plane here - I hired this movie before and it was not time to watch, I did this morning. <br /> <br /> Wow! See this movie. I am personally interested in the unusual / death experience to read the bits nearby, so I was hooked automatically. I'm not sure of the comments here that there was a quality vain - I disagree - the acting here was pretty fantastic - I think this was the only time I did not think Julia Roberts, it was good to see 24 Kiefer Sutherland (currently during this review, DUI Giving prison sentence for it), and Kevin Bacon plays an interesting hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like direction, environment, acting and choice - most of the story - especially the idea of ​​karma, and "everything we do" is to say, to quote Nation Wright. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
