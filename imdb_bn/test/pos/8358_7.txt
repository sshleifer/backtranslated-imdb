Aslan Adam or Leonon, it is commonly known among English-language audiences, King Solomon and his army defeated a load boy, and started an epic war, although I'm not sure who they were and the film was not very helpful. Establishment of truth However, after King Solomon killed these sons, Princess Maria, Bishop Osirio and Commander Ant√≥nin were forced to sign an agreement that would allow King Solomon to show only everything. Princess Maria is married to Solomon, and they are sexually, while at the greatest wedding ceremony of all time (only two seconds long), Antonov married Marian, and plans to rebel against Solomon and get some sweet revenge in the process. Antony and his guardians attacked Solomon and killed Solomon, though his pregnant wife Princess Alumunia escaped with Antony's protector with her protector Rostin after the greatest labor of all time (less than 5 minutes or while traveling around Bush). Princess Almaty gives birth to a little boy hiding in some bush from the guards of Antonia. Unfortunately when Rustin tries to restore the little trunk, he sees that the child has taken the lion's pride as his own! Years later and the evil Antony has now agreed to treat her subjects without any kind of mercy, Princess Mary is born and she has a son but Roostin still kicks in to try to unite a gang of rebels to overthrow Antonio, but it seems that With the help of the disappointed legend Leenman, the more vivid man than the man <br /> <br /> Who can help the Turkish-Greek co-... natuka product nataca managed bayatana Pete was conducted as a kind of film, I found it worse sunny, but at the same time very entertaining. This script does not seem to be important to itself, it's a pretty funny movie, it continues like a rocket and never gets silent or annoying and English conversation is a delight in the context of what's happening on some conversation screens. None of this gives any idea, we were created as a story of a boy raised by the lion, an evil king, betrayal, dark family secret information, the lion's homeland which was raised before the lion's baby was raised. Scenes of war, scenes of torture where posts are tied to people with cane, inside the ancient castle interior, which contain gin wire and jamnastic rings, stupid bad guys, all of which have faces and they are a central character like a jaw line. A house brick can be dug twice, its hand may be covered in acids (this acid can eat its way through the steel tragedy but a ceramic is stored in the world!) And a concrete floor falls more than 20 feet and does not maintain any serious trauma! Aslan Adam is a horribly entertaining movie, I do not think I saw another picture which I can compare, if you are looking for something serious, forget it but if you like 'very bad' - good type movies and funny, laugh and If you want to entertain Aslan Adam should be on top of your list. For the bad movie fans, 100% of the gold and the taste for the different and bizarre. In frustrating direction, Leiyuan is simply long in its long, long long, long long, long long, long long, long hair. <br /> <br /> At one moment the children are fighting with the fugitive tree in their sand on the grass hills! Using a 'branch' in the Leonman Pole Vault is a point where it is surrounded by a point where it is almost a long tube! Then bloody bloody pack seems to follow Lionman, but the dogs used to be the most harmful dogs, sometimes like different species of different species! Aslan Adam has many different views which are simply ridiculous, stupid, malicious or three that I can go to forever. Just when Lionman is jumping and flying, then flying it all over, end it. Aslan Adam has most of the blood, even though the actual graphic is not cowardice or cruelty, some stabs and some have hands-on hand, such as those found in graphic. <br /> <br /> Technically, Aslan Adam is a beautiful ropy, time-wear is bright and sophisticated, featuring purple, yellows, red and other bright colors. The war scenes were cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to do as much as possible. It seems to be more appropriate than a classical ballet rather than an action film, and it is another bizarre aspect of Aslan Adam. Acting was bad, even you could say bad acting dabbed. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam has started from the beginning, pure gold, there are a lot of choices, smile and enjoy this film. Just end it really end. In any way, Aslan Adam can not be considered as a good movie in any word, but it is a fun hellfire. Maybe I can prove that I have not dreamed at all! You will see the best Turkish action film about a man raised by lions, duration. A signal span is quite popular enough, Lionman II: Witchqueen (1979).
