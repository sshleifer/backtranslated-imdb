** Spirir ** Looking at a little more excitement for feeding narcotics in the local game reserve, Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn and Maude Dermed, Grace's boyfriend Adam, Andy Rodorida, decided to go solo together in Aphrodite and desert, human habitat, Australian mangrove swamps . <br /> <br /> Their swamp guide Jimmy, with Ben Oxenbuld, at his motorized boat helmet four people upended by a giant saltwater crocodile who quickly grabbs and drags down Jimmy down with her horrible. Grace Pat and Adam were finally stuck on a tree in the hay, which resulted in the hanging of Pat for the life of a skunk boat. The rest of the picture contains hungry and fixed crocodiles, a cat and mouse, or a crook and a human, which ends in a mud bank showdown with three grassroots, where Jimmy's dead and immortal body finally comes to his rest. <br /> <br /> Both the film's director and the actor became more dangerous during the swirling crocodile. We see almost half a dozen killer crocodiles in the movie, but each of them hurts you, and the hostage is Grace Pat and Adam, on the right. <br /> <br /> The giant reptile always unexpectedly does its harmful act so that it comes with crack attacks, it will have more impact when you do not come to them, as in the last ten minutes of the movie, when you do. From the beginning you will be surprised that the crocodile attacks will eventually survive and finally tell them about them. The end of human conflict with crocodile was about the weak and most unrealistic part of the film. <br /> <br /> Crocodile who was both strong and effective as before, seemed to confiscate or swim for himself because of not losing his energy or speed with his own jaw. The only survivor of the mission Actually the killer crack was so effective that he could not catch them even after he attacked his victims or predators. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " All the food and mammals living in the sculpture were four-dimensional, to attack Grace Pat Adam and Jimmy, his pirate domain, which he felt was a noble ruler. And to give courage, they had to give their lives!
