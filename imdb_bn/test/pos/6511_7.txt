If you like stupid comedy like a plane, you will love this movie! This is definitely the style of aircraft and horror film. A funny picture! It has strange cast of characters in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Ivan Marriott, Joyce Girwood, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Slater and Eric Roberts Special effects are hokey, but I think they are supposed to be from a stupid comedy. Apparently there are two versions, one on blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. A preview release on the website appears to be signed by the director. There are some fun behind Michael Jackson with scenes illustrated in Nureland. The film was filmed in 2003 and it has fun in the pajee rate box.
