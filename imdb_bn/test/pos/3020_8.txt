The cell is full of plots, holes, and well-played. But there is no reason for this, Director Tresem Singh gave us the most visible stunning movies. The whole plot is just an excuse for fooling the turtle and taking a serial killer's mind, a little frustrating, delightful, breathless and mind-blowing photos <br /> <br /> <br /> This beautiful movie is coming For a long time with you will be there. This movie is a perfect case for "suspension suspension" theory. Forget the stupid plot, just let your sense fade with the image. And J.Lo tarsem looks more stunning than adding the rest of the work. Cinematography is frustrating, music hunting and clothing are just stunning. <br /> <br /> There are fewer movies and less work on art. This medium is not a canvas now, it is a big screen and celluloid. One of the most refreshed movies of this decade. Cell must have a watch. A bold new step in creating a movie. <br /> <br /> <br />
