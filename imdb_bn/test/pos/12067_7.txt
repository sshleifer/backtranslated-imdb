Many situations are like comedies, "The War at Home" is better with each episode. The letters start to become real and I believe in them as their family. I agree with many that the first few episodes were not funny; I'm sure the show will be canceled for the show. However, "Middle Middle In" and "Arrested Development", "War" provided many necessary live action comedy for Fox on Sunday night. And when compared to the rest of the seatkom, "war" is a better choice now. <br /> <br /> its appeal, at least for me, is in its real situation. Thirteen is sexual. Every child does not like how to turn their kids around. Parents fight and call each other's names. But instead of relying on being "average" like many shows, everything is fine, which is the best number of rules in the code. <br /> <br /> A isolation from the show is described in the scene. Flashback's "Arrested Development / Family Guy" style works quite well, but the description may be much more. <br /> <br /> Check out "Home at War" for anyone who wants to see Sunday night. Especially considering what other major networks at that time.
