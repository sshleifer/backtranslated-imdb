<br /> <br /> As Harold Lloyd fan, I agree with the comments of other critics, and then I think "Movie Crazy" was his best sound film; "Cats legs" is a close second. (But, this is my opinion). <br /> <br /> This picture stole a show from the beginning to the end of a "hot" and in many scenes, George Barbier (the crook that elected her elected mayor)! (Especially at the end of the film). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the last few minutes of the film, Find out his true feelings. (And yet, there is no "romance" - kissing etc.). <br /> <br /> It must definitely watch a movie!
