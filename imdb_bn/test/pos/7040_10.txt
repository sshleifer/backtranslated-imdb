Meatballs is a comedy comedy that is impossible to count with so many laughs. <br /> <br /> There was an earlier predecessor of what happened, Murray only controls the screen that can be described as comic efficiency. Triper Harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the past 50 years. The greatest of all times, when she needs to be smart, when she must be stern, and care when she is fit, Murray infuses the tripper with the SNL glint in her eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best comedy one screen please.
