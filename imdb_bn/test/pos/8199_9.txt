I will accept my ignorance about the existence of this movie, until I see it on a cable outlet ad. I was very impressed with the film's novel structure. I do not understand this movie in any language, I have a sense of shine with intelligence and intelligence. I think this is the quality of the film. It was apparently stunning. Actually there was the entrance. The Chinese theater movement, used to increase the development of dialogue, is so attractive after watching Western films, where the actors traditionally pay more attention to the conversation. This photo action comes to you without much explosion to get attention to you. It's so emotional that it's human action here. The film teaches me the history of one of the world's best tourist attractions, which was an impressive soil of China's first quay umpire, which is very impressive. It thought the film was an international relevance beyond the great moral themes of the film. This is a movie that I can comfortably recommend to different friends and acquaintances.
