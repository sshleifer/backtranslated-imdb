I'm giving this movie 10. this is okay. <br /> <br /> But not 10 that you want to give movies like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This kind of 10 give you a movie which just makes you smile, over again! It's the most horrible written and directed movie, but it does not fail to entertain it. It has the effect of most amateur, yet you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie on TV today, and I did not want to go! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br />> Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! <br /> <br /> Bad guy 2: Yes, we will not do it again. <br /> <br /> (There is no response from Manisha) <br /> Akshay: Come on, forgive them! <br /> <br /> Monisha: I do not know <br /> <br /> <br /> Akshay: You are a beautiful woman, even dead people can be excited by you! And this young man is alive! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I used to break their hands and feet And killed. However, just forgive them. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yes, if you do not forgive them, then you must be very proud about your beauty! <br /> <br /> Now a conversation is a real masterpiece! This movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are many stupid and unrealistic situations! The bad guy (Munnit) can do something basically. He can kill a sand from his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from behind him and easily disappear again. <br /> <br /> Every actor turns away, then from Akshay, then from Sunil, then from Arshad then Aftab then from Nigam. After the director it is the main rule, so that every person is given the same screen. And then there are all the powerful pendants, which can even go right without you being hit on a harmful car! All these things make it an enjoyable movie, and I can see it over again. I think this movie can go into the comedy Hall of Fame if there is one. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is not trying to be fun.
