There are pages on this movie that many people miss if they are not alert. You really have to follow what Leald has to say and to present the film "Why" presented at the end, she will have to read her character. This is not difficult, it is not certain how different viewers accept it. I think that this trip was planned, people are not understood to understand it the same way, it can often think of your own personal relationship with Liland so that she feels a little better. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, but its essence can never explain the real explanation of the film. It is dramatic and worrisome, a great idea, but the motion of the movie is often miserable, even in its intense scenes too. I think it's probably Leland, he's calm and almost calm, even for all his grief. The film portrays Liland in a way. <br /> <br /> Of course this is attentive and if you leave it then it attracts you but there are some recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has many fascinating conversations, she is not ordinary but another prophet. Whatever he said, is not a revelation, many people mentioned whom I know mention, I even saw a few things. Perhaps the liland is a unique and attractive character, perhaps for Ryan Gosling's paintings. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said,
