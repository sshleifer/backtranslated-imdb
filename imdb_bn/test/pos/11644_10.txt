I have seen this movie many years ago and it has sometimes kept me in the list of the best films of all times. When I first saw it, then I started life's passion for justice. It gave an interesting perspective on the death penalty and gave me some things to think about. <br /> <br /> When you have a cast like this, you can guess that it will not be imagined. To this end, I've never seen the SunPen play the best role (I'm Sam). She does not glamourize her action while doing nails role, so do. He thinks I manage to maintain a barbarity across the movie. To the end, he does not try to show anything more than that. He is a sick man who pardons his past, but still creates excuses for him. With the help of Susan Sarandan's sister sister Helen Prison, she is able to free herself self-worth as a convicted (and guilty) murderer. His character taught me how to teach good wishes to others, and how much of a person's work can be forgotten and forgotten without excuse for them. <br /> <br /> Supporting Cast was top. I was surprised to see Jack Black's little cameo in this movie today! I love this movie for personal reasons, and it's just the art of cinema. And, in my opinion, this is a rare exception when the film is out of the book.
