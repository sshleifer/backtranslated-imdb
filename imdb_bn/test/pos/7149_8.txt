Amateur cameras work on one side, I thought the film was very different, and unlike the blogs and posts I read, I found something completely different than the others. The story revolves around a very religious family and their relationship with their church. How they must abide by all the strict rules and regulations, but there should be problems in keeping track of the girl, how to use boring thoughts and bad language to others. Yet he prayed a lot as his family. Then one day they led a church picnic and are in an accident. From there the father and his brother changed; What is dismissed by Jesus and being "saved" Warning: Head Spoiler Alert. Or so we are led to believe. I think if you watch this movie only from the point of view of the girl, then pay attention to the end, you will find that we, the audience, think that it is real facts with parents and son, all dreams, and the girl's Pov. It will explain many actions illustrated by parents and son, which were completely reversed about how they lived before and why Peghe was involved in the murder of Peggy, etc. Etc. See how much that pie is perfect, but go back and look at the cake makes Betty. Until all evidence that Caroline Pi was removed. And the scene where he saw his dead parents, kept each other in arms and his brother, all of which dying depressively, even in spite of being toxic, fits according to the order of dreams.
