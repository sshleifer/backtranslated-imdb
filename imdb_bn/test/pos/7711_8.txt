This is the fifth part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tell us more about 'Matrix'. During this time, they introduced the train (Kerry-Ani Moss), who is a detective about a detective to find him. With great black and white animations and an interesting story, it is again a great animated 'The Animatrix'.
