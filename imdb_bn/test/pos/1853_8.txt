When I saw the movie trailer, then I loudly said, "This image will throw a bomb." I said about that MATRIX and look at what happened there. Now I am not the box officer of a stretch box, but I have a great panic about what I like and actually suck. In this case I was blinded by my complete and complete indifference towards David Duchovney. I write this to you in a different way: I do not like him as a person (from what I read in his interview, he incredibly preferred pre-Madonna and fulfilled himself considering what he did X-files) or as an actor . Playing God is really a poor film but he thinks that for some reason he deserves big money on the big screen. But I'm happy to say that although these things can still be true to man, return to me is joyful and it has its heart in the right place. Bonnie Hunt managed a beautiful story and she has been calling it with classes and grace. This is one of the most romantic movies I've seen and although it may seem a bit sad and addictive, but give it a chance and you'll be hooked. <br /> <br /> I said it should be (and it hurts me) because this image works so well due to the story and cast. Duchovney and the driver here are so wonderful and trustworthy that I honestly wanted to weep with them. After his wife died, Duvovini came home and entered the room of her house. As always, the family dog ​​looks at the door waiting for his wife to walk. His shirt's collar is still not blurred with blood, Rob (Ducchini) tells him that he is not coming home. . Then he called the dog to him and they seem to share the cry together. The dog cried out a little and then cry out loud. And this is one of the most real moments of pain I ever have in any of these films. You can feel her pain and at the moment I have forgotten that I was watching an actor that I do not usually like, and I felt that I saw someone I knew knew that her loved ones had to suffer. This powerful element. <br /> <br /> Another power-supporting cast of the film. Bonnie Hunt has added a ethnic melting pot of Irish and Italian characters that share a common bond. They shared a pub named O'Releyley's Italian pub. That's a delicious name in itself. The Critical Cultural Heritage Scale is titled Carroll O'Nore and Robert Logia. These two proud old men who love their homeland but love their grandchildren and nephews (I think). And the character played by that mini driver. This scene is ripe for the comedians and Hunt does not miss anything here. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt and James Belusi will share some interesting moments together, such as middle-aged married couples and Balushi gets the top point, because he humbly acknowledges humility and a stomach shows his wide KEG closure for laughter. With three or four children in his family, little time for him and for his wife. And Hunt again manages this with the perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> It is a great story to find true love, real love and friendship and know how fortunate the family is in power. Come back to me is a wonderful romance and although I still do not have any praise for David Duvvorni, I must admit that he was perfect in this role and I could not play anybody else's character. He was sensitive and credible, and the film was not good for him, not only because of him but he definitely added this smell. <br /> <br /> If you're hungry for better romance and you want better tears, then this is the film for you. <br /> <br /> In 10 minutes, 8.5% will see what I'll see with Bonnie Hunt in the director's chair.
