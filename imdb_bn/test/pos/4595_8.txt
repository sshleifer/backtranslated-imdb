I have not seen a bad release after a movie. And it's a shame, because it's the most fun movie of the year! You will be able to guarantee a big release from the director of an office "Office of Space" with a line, but there is no advertisement, no posters, no website, they even suspect that they are coming out this weekend. ? Mike Judge's Si-Fi comedy is set in 2505, but it can be true within 10 years (if things continue to run) Luke Lynn Wilson and Mother Rudolph became hostage in a secret army exam and retards the full zombie heart of the future. This picture reminds me of Woody Allen's "Slipper", "Robocop", "Apps Planet", "Blade Runner" and "Network" and late great "Pturama" Try to see it before fox burned all the prints!
