The comedy's scripting is mixed by any movie in recent years. Characters are attractive, even if a bit predictive. Comedic timing written in the script is enough to plot a well-laid underworld. When you are sure that you know the end .... SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, although the small set probably would not appreciate any more delicate references, but of course they would especially appreciate a Galle scene! Great movie!
