First off, it must be told that I have come to this movie not for the music; Actually I find it overwhelming. Really, I was interested in the psychology of punk tribe. At this time, the documentary did not do fairly well. An inconsistent aspect was to show innumerable scenes that were played in the songs, and the ampex running in the hypead-up band and the rebel crowd were shown. If you've seen the first such scene, you've seen them all. This superfluity song is made by song printing for some songs. With this, the audience is able to connect mentally with a little band. Songs are more interested in quarrels than the words presented from the lecture. I do not know why all the songs are printed. Music trends are slow (harmful eh ?, many references to musical motion) film flow The next band's interview was not proven as enthralling or ridiculous as the first two, when there was also an isolation, although there was also interaction with insightful fans and the band. Overall, a good movie that I'm happy I saw. <br/> <br /> Favorite quote: He tried to hide the fact that he drunk peanut butter on himself and could not break the glass. <br /> <br /> Broad Punk Generation: Although their disrespect, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and enthusiasm of narcotics are often laughable, but ultimately it is understood that punks are just sad children who simply rebel sophomoric songs and philosophize and politicize (black Flag, those who ignore a little less confusing than their colleagues) revolt seen through naive attempts through.
