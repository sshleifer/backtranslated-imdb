I really liked this one. (Speakers ??) It was really a good plot, the main female of this film is really Keval. <br /> <br /> Despite this she is the only survivor and her lover has died, it seems like much like a ninja scroll. Another kick ass movie ;) <br /> <br /> See it in Japanese with subtitles. I do not know where editors learned to speak English, but for some reason all the translation techniques could get an F. Subtitles are more accurate. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Repeatable: 9/10
