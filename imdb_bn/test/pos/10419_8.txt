After the recent visit to New York, I put this picture in a row all day, and I could not believe I never heard of it anywhere! It has all the makings of a classical classic, starting with characters. They play an accredited role from every part of everyday life, but their performers get so humble and fully realized (the performance of Peter Stormer and by-ling was particularly strong). Their interactions are tragic and ground, at the same time a delicate, playful humor (which is sadly) very rare in American movies on this day. Writer / director Ramin Namima has done a wonderful job to weld together together in a fun and moving portrait together in this scene. Highly recommended!
