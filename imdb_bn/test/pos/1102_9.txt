I have seen this movie through an actor agent, and it must be consistent with a great deal from Stuh. Overall * tones in Australia, * which are properly dark and moody. <br /> <br /> I think the little boy in the film was excellent. Most kids actors * ham up * and embarrassing but not in this case. He was really very good. Regarding the * ultrasonism * thing mentioned by Jinggo, well, I think this movie is 'weird'. It's going to be a real weirdo film, weirdo location, storyline, strange thing full time. But against 'bad' 'good' is weird It's hard to think of other movies like this, but it's not like CARS ATE Paris, maybe it's a repetition, but I think it's like Hammer's movie since the 60's. It certainly has a fun mind that works behind her. <br /> <br /> Zingo, about my question title too. Why modern love ?? anyone? Also, Zinggo, when you are talking about Australia, what does "God Farjeken" of Huma mean? Eager
