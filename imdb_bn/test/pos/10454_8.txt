When I was in the 10th grade and my friend was late in his house and roaming around the wire and started watching this movie. Because we saw it because it was fun and because it was boobs. But then the end came and we were just sitting idiot completely. I think one minute after watching the credit roll, he has just prepared such a "hello dude ..." curiosity. It comes from 80's teen sex comedy to the stupid realism so that it guards you. I have tried to rent this movie for several years and I could not find it - and no one saw it except me and my friend - it seems. But now it is available! I highly recommend hiring it and binding yourself.
