Anyone who first saw Ali Ji, his full motion picture is 'Ali Ji Indahouse' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The wall comedy must be closed on the big screen. Starting from the end <br /> <br /> A satirical plot, ridiculous character and a ridiculous script, which all make riots for Ali Ziey's fans. <br /> <br /> If you have seen him and do not like him, then avoid this movie like a plug because it is exactly the same. For everyone else - see it Aiiii! 7/10
