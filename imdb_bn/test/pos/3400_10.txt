I've always heard of this great mini series, but it's been the first time this week in July 2007. I can see why so many young actors have started their career. The story is playful and gives wonderful insights into before and during the civil war. I care about how improving the letters and their lives in this period. Some of them had stereotype, but they helped me to see how people thought in the 1800s. Many historical events were thrown in the story and history books were interesting to see come in. Dresses and sets were fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed watching both parts of I and II. Part III is a disappointment.
