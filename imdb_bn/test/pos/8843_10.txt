This is one of the most outstanding horror movies I've ever seen during my life. Forget the exorcist and other other hip horror movies. John Carpenter has created a tour-de-force horror epic with a remarkable astronaut, including Cart Russell and with a remarkable special effects and a great soundtrack that will always hunt for you! After 17 years, the best thing about this movie does not seem to be fresh and new, and you will not get many such films. In 1982 it was against ET. And of course it failed and there was a box office bomb. Over the years, video and TV sales have been created and a culture has been created by many new fans. Finally, this movie is not harmful to me and to me like it, it is close to you pants and a horror movie to me. Long Live John Carpenter !!
