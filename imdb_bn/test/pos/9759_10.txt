Jean-Pegate, Joe Herman, and Neil Strakan - all impossible heroes and living. Junk's strong and strong gene is the only genie to take risks of genes and other captives, whose power and determination are to save life, with hundreds of miles and quiet self-discipline and proven power, Joe Harman ("Oh my word"), only the worst suffering pain is fantastic Noyle Strahan, who trusted the jinn without hesitation. Her good humor and firmness inspired everyone around her, and those who are rewarded with her with her courage. Beautiful scenery and musical score adds adventure. Despite the length it was not annoying at me. This common man has done a great deal and it is based on a true story. Some people borrowed my VHS a few years ago and I have never seen it. My lesson, companion learned, and it can be found when buying another copy. It's a shame that the miniseries is not the DVD.
