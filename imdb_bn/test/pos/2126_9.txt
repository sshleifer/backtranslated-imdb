I think this movie is different from many others, it shows family of girls who actually care about each other. They may have errors, but there is no place for miserliness and misery with these girls. Try to find that TV or the usual movie. Girls' girls see a breath of fresh air - dressing beautiful, women's clothing and shoes. Discrimination that pale and fade with clothing in today's shop, i.e. mess and jacket, etc. The story line is running with a bad thread, but this makes it more realistic and interesting. I know it's animated, but it still gives you a feeling that the family can stay together and okay. I likewise recommend this movie for boys and girls.
