Prote (Kevin Speacy) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be a remote planet on K-pack. His psychologist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) is trying to help him when he is trying to understand the protocol and he is trying to find out whether he really is from K-pack. <br /> <br /> This movie does not really fall into any particular genre. A large part of K-Pax is the drama / science-imagination, the other part's imagination, plus, add a dash of comedy and you start getting everything about keypacks. The story (as you see above) is not too complicated or deep, but it still offers some plots and wrapping which they can still surprise me. This movie does not have any special effects or graphics and there is no need for them, but the music is great in the film. A techno soundtrack with a great piano piece ke-pack makes sound saif-fai and some scenes make excitement. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacy is playing the heart of the movie and playing a very believable alien. Planet K-Pack, with great facial expressions, makes mental, spacy a delicate task in the main role. Jeff Bridges Dr. Powell, supports it and tries to understand the proto. The bridge is excellent in its part. Bridges and spaces are very well-stocked and they should have a lot of experience. Dr. Powell's wife Rachel Powell, starring Mary McCormack McCarthy plays her part well, shows disappointment for her husband's departure and dedicated to her patient. Alf Wudder Dr. Powell's co-star Claudy Villars, we do not really see Claudia very much, but overall he plays right. <br /> <br /> K-PX "PH-13" violent image, and short language and sensitivity ", and that covers it." As far as "violent images" go, we do not see too much. Blood is there, but it is all: The language is as follows: 1 "f" is the word (wo, only one!), 11 "s", and some use in the name of the Lord is vain, really not bad. "Sex" Comes to the protocol Dr. Powell As the K-pack reproduction shows how nothing works, nothing is terrible, it just seems like "your symptoms are." The content level for PG-13 film is not too bad, it can be worse. <br /> < In conclusion, K-Pack is not a bad movie, it does not have to stop you, but it's enjoyable and kind of fun to watch. It's some fun part, sad part, really sad part, and, well you know what I J This is a story of a psychiatric hospital patient, what do you expect? For those who are looking for a good play for you, all of them are well rented, which you can lag behind and relax, K-Pax is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you have already seen this movie, like it and are thinking about getting a DVD, I would highly recommend it. It has loads of additional loads and even an option ending and deleting the scene. 8/10
