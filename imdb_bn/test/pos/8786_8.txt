Barry Kenney (Robert Simmons) has been wrongly accused of hijacking an invader for the sake of creating a pilot for the war. He runs the run, meets Patricia Mart√≠n (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and joins him to find and bring real culprits. <br /> <br /> There are many things wrong with this picture. Robert Cummins was a good actor but he made a totally wrong impression in this role; Priscilla Lane was beautiful but never a good actress; The story does not give full meaning to understanding (and rambles for longer than needed); It wears a bit more of its patriotism (but it was made in WWII fully hanging) and it does not end. It should not work but it should be done. <br /> <br /> It's your oddity to keep the odd lines and letters full of characters. For example: Lane is talking to Simmings (when she is in love), "I could see you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane gave a villain to his lunch and briefly joined a circus troop during the coming and lanes. Hitkoc's order was always cool (as always) - he threw some really amazing shots and sequences - especially in the Statue of Liberty Climax. <br /> <br /> This is not one of the hits of Hitako, but it is still very good and interesting.
