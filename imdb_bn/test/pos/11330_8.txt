Two hours ago I was watching this brilliant movie, which caught me in prison with photography. It is fully understood how it won the best camera award in 2000. Closed-ups have watched it. Close the walls, people and many other things. Warm color light (which is usually done by the director) gives the film a warm environment. Mainly it is seen in only two people. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes with almost all the time movies. Each of these themes represents a particular atmosphere during the whole movie. Silence and character of movement movement slowly. Some scenes were a stretched moment or a serious up close. Maggie Cheng was so brilliant that Tony Lange was not worthy of the prize for his extraordinary performance. I wonder how many dresses were wearing in different scenes. The story is related to the history of Hong Kong and the 1960s. Especially at this end it prevents me from understanding some details. In short, I would recommend artistic film fans to watch it in the movie.
