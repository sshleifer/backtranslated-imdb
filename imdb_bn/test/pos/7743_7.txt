For many years I used to think that I was the only person on the planet who saw the Tempest, and I am glad to know that I am not the only person who has searched for this sleep anywhere in the movie's travels. Shamefully based on Shakespeare's play, Tempest is following an architect (late John Cassettes is one of his best performances), his work and his growing marriage (to real life spouse Jean Rowlalla), who is upset with all the shiny decisions. In the competition of the rat, hell and his daughter (Molly Ringwell, her debut film debut), and new girlfriend Iditha (a bright Susan Sordon) live on an island. Although Paul Majuro is credited as director, the film is in the hands of the Cavitates ... long scenes have been shaped without cutting, feeling the feeling of the conversation ..., self-motivated story story, it's definitely the end of his show from the beginning, and if you His work is not a fan, but the film seems hardworking long and neutral but if you are a fan, then the prize There uli. Cassavettes are surrounded by a first-rate cast ... crackle with intensity of his scenery with Rowlands and an enormous contrast in his view with his wonderful chemistry Rowlands with Sarandon. Ringwald blazes on the first episode of his film, and the performance of a scene-theft as Calibanos, manager of Raul Julia Island. Julia, the song "New York, New York", stopped the show with Liza Minerali, a dancing with a sheep shepherd. This picture is sad and sad and funny and intense. Yes, it is a little long and confused and works a little harder than it is (a screen call is at the end of the film), but it fails to attract those who prefer something different to them. filmgoing
