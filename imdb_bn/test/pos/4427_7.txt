Video Vault Shane <br /> <br /> My architect: A son's journey 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn is not rated: 116 minutes Vault rating: 7 <br /> <br /> <br /> What matters will be of the ancestral Philadelphia follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kane "My architect: The journey of a son" because he is his father, the famous architect Louis I. Kan, has been dead for 30 years. In 1974 a train station and several families left behind. <br /> <br /> We found that Nathaniel knew only his father, from his immediate inspection with his mother, whom we saw, we are told, he is deeply loved. This movie may be more likely to see a boy than his father, and perhaps his own work, so that some of the finest structures are hidden. <br /> <br /> Be sure, Louis Kahn was a gifted architect, but "architect" is a cold word. The man had a sculpture on a huge graduation, who spoke about his craft in terms of silence and industry ventilation. <br /> <br /> Among his major works, the film is lovingly searched, the Sacchar Institute (1965), The Kimberley Art Museum (1972) and Memorial Capital Complex (1983) in Bangladesh. Nathaniel got in the film for the first time in Dhaka, but could not find the man. <br /> <br /> While working in New York City, this image has greatly benefited greatly due to the many public footage. And as Professor of Yale and University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's contemporaries and associates helped the filmmaker to help the father-in-law of the flesh. <br /> <br /> Even, visitors do not seem to be particularly comfortable in the environment. North Nathaniel Khan is looking for details. Not good enough <br /> <br /> Where the director meets different mothers with her half sisters, she can feel tense, hurt and pain in those years. Someone may expect to explode in their anger, but only the camera protects them from their militants. Each of these children is apparently lost. <br /> <br /> It can be understood that Khan, who thought of being an accomplished perfectionist, never became wealthy. Instead, he became notable. As he dedicated his family to his family. This is a great tragedy and great thing. <br /> <br /> April 28, 2005
