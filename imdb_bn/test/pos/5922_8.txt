Billy Wyder continued the firm footing of Charles Linberber's biopic in the 1950s, an American American pilot who became the first person to fly exclusively throughout the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart played in linberberg and he was very old, yet he still comes with warmth and self-confidence, along with his trademark down-to-earth goddess that made him a symbolic film star. Wildor firmly mentions, to give a clear description about how he decided to take Lincoln to the challenge by maintaining balance in the background with humor and drama. This is certainly not the best of Stewart, but it's a jewel of a movie. It leads your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an American. Overall, it's just plain good.
