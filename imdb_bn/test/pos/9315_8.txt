I've heard a lot about the twins of Porno Holocaust and the Living Dead Twin. Both films are exchangeable and in the same film, the same film is depicted in the same film for the change in the dresses (and their acceptance) for each movie. If you are waiting for D'Amato Genius to appear in films like Boro Omega or Death Smile's Murders, then you will not find it here. Yet there is such a charm in the film that the fans of exploitation will not be able to resist. Where would you see a zombie / monster and mixed sex with her huge dick that strangles and chokes death of women? Just from D'Amato There are some beef in which many people die. The picture is set on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know that there is no subtitle version, so if you can not speak Italian you do not know what you know ... but who thinks properly? In all the truth, Gore fans will probably move fast through hardcore sex. And if someone is watching this for only sex, definitely will be offended immediately. I can only imagine modern day porn fans coming back through the output of D'Amato and I am coming to this torture! Between the two of the two, I'm far better than the boyfriend's night of the living dead. However, do not bother to see if they are cut. Porno Holocaust hopes as low as budget. Even the monster does not look good like the character of George Eastman in Ethiopophagus. The movie is laughing and valuable to complete your D'Amto movie search.
