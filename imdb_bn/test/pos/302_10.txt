I decided to increase my review for all my favorite movies. Like other war films focused on the show, the Apocalypse now takes the audience headstrong. Just spirituality makes the body uncomfortable, but you can not close your eyes. Joseph Conrad's Heart of the Darkness of Off, Apocalypse has slowly slowed down his hero Willard (Martin Shen), perhaps Kartez was crazy. The production of this film was notorious for her delay in providing rainless monsoon and Brando performance (she reads her lines from the coupe). There is a documentary named Apocalypse Night: A filmmaker's apocalypse that everyone sees as doing this work. <br /> <br /> The first image is the most popular and popular in a movie. The helicopter plaque is heard slowly and Napalm is dropped in the trees, the song "The Last" is heard by the door. The next shot is in the Wilder's bed with the fan, so the helicopter's word matches the fan. We know that he is a special mission for the army, most of the killings. When his next mission was given to him, he got annoyed. "Charging a man by killing him here is a quick ticket to the Indy 500." The person who was to be killed was a respected colonel who became mad and separated himself from the tribe. Kurtz is ordered to do this abominable job that is performed by this man and he will stop me. Will not go alone to the wild. He is carrying a boat with various soldiers and they come across various wars. On the way, they met Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilogo "Hurah" about the war. Wald manuscript that Kilgore is crazy, what could be like Kurtz. There are many scenes that the Wilds have become crazy: the attack of tigers, innocent Vietnam killings, nonstop rains, pounded dead bodies spread and death of his crew members. He reached the cartridge compound, he greeted the village people and a hippie photo journalist (Dennis Hooper). Instead of killing Cartz, Willard began to talk to him and his conscience began to suspect what he needs to do. Cartes, want to die on the other side. He is tired of war and wants to go down as a soldier. When he got together, Wald killed him with a mosquito, a torch was sacrificed by a few men. Once they realized that their leader was killed, instead of killing the Willard, they called them their new king. Wild rejects this proposal and releases them. <br /> <br /> Here the cinematography is absolutely exciting. Color grains are free, something that is rare in old movies. I can see it silent and admire the beauty of the scenery. <br /> <br /> Acting ensemble is awesome, with everyone playing their part well. Many criticize Brando, but I think he has ruined his role as a sad madman who is fighting the war. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and score provide the mood of hunting and film. When are the rumors of the machines that they use sound like that guitar roll? There are many parodies of this film, but my favorite quote comes from Magpie Simpson when he explained to Homer why police behaves like a statue of the same name in the show: "Your character provides humor for the show, like Um, Marlon Brando is now apocalyptic." Those who watched the movie know why this sunny.
