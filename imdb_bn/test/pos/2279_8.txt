The film received less attention than "their own league", perhaps its only "name" star. But the female professional baseball was only eight years old, the existence of Midwestern cities, both Japanese baseball and financial support both in popular support and popular support. That alone would make it a good movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Baseball" shows the events of Japan-ball life: Regulated cheering, respect for umpires, pressure of manager's corporate owners, extreme conservativeness of the game - and no hot dog players welcome. <br /> <br /> It touches on isolation that any Guy-Jean - but especially an American joke, is not the most familiar person in foreign culture - living in it, Dipan Nippon. And the Japanese, on their behalf, is not comfortable around foreigners and it shows in different ways ("Guy-Gene Strike Zone", an American player complains, "Bigger than Buick") <br /> <br /> The script has not won any awards, again "Plays of improved drama" can play with the theme, but I have found Pok more enjoyable than "League". Those who want to see another angle of this great sport are specifically recommended for them.
