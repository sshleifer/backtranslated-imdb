I'll be old because I saw the movie for the first time. I'm watching it again on HBO again. This is a very common movie that after two fall in love with two people, it is seen that their husband and wife have a problem. The plot is very thin, but the actor has done very well in this film. Christine Scott is running for Congress with Thomas and Harrison Ford is an internal affairs policeman, both of whom are in unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. I love soundtracks. Perfect fit One thing I do not understand is that this film had a budget of 68 million dollars. What was it spent? Air crash or Harrison Ford's salary?
