I had the idea of ​​comedy and dramas over the Korean movies, but "Christmas in autumn" changed my viewpoint. This movie is so easy. This is not a meddramatic scene or top comedy scene. The single scene where the actors woke up aloud Kisses of actors and actresses even a kiss is not even a scene. And yet this movie has been able to reach the audience so that I can know the existence. The end of the movie left me with a spell. I even cried, but my eyes were red hot. This movie has given me a feeling that I can rarely describe. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I can recommend this movie to everyone but I recommend to the people who want to see the film in real movies. 9.4 / 10
