I saw Cold Mountain and English patients again this weekend. He does not know about the former one Inman (Jude Law), who will move the army to return to an army soldier Ada Monro (Nicole Kidman). Both films are lovingly operated by Anthony Minghella who do an exceptional job. Although, the cold mountain is very good, it can be a great movie with right-casting and less broken, backdoing dialogs. <br /> <br /> Romantic epics require a credible heroine. The English patient, Christian Scott Thomas was a fully smart, alluring and beautiful Catherine Clifton. The main problem of Cold Mountain is Ada, who feels foolish and intelligent and the lack of quality will convince you that Inman may be covered after a kiss. As a limited range of actress Kidman, she usually plays a tough-faced woman who is struggling with stonyism. Kidman was very interested to play and love interest in the game. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and weak. For anyone who was close to suffering and suffering, he used to feel ridiculously enjoyable and dressed. Kidman was so stupid that he felt that he was spending three hours on each scene. Michelle Pfieffer may have played quite part of her younger day. Even Natalie Portman has an improvement. <br /> <br /> Renee Zelleweger was dressed more appropriately but chewed her animated performance scenes but she was probably trying to compensate for Kidman. Odyssey's role was in his silent movie Jude Law, but his part played well. Ray Winston was excellent as London / Southern villain. <br /> <br /> During the civil war, people were probably not very well educated according to today's standards and perhaps they spoke face-to-face languages. But if you look at BBC adaptations of Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskil, everyone is clear. It's probably unrealistic but it will improve my entertainment.
