There are other comments here on IMDB, I had very high expectations before watching 'Angels in the universe'. I was not frustrated and did not give the movie 8, I would say that I can justify that grade. <br /> <br /> The movie has some incredible performances, especially the main person Paul. Assistant actors are doing very well like patients of mental institution, parents and sailors. The song also provides significant, significant film support, depth and feeling. <br /> <br /> Although this film is very scandinavian, it does not leave some humor and compiles some writer about Paul's life. . Still, if you want to see a chessy comedy or light weight, it's not for you. It's about the human story about psychological problems, how they are treated in society - but most, a story about Paul. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all movie actors. One of the best movies from Iceland when it is not outside Scandinavia.
