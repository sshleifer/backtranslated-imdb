A dark knight has set up an ideal teen horror movie with a unique twist. Extreme-bruding musical scores and Gothic / clustrophobic atmosphere make this small film very addictive. Meg Tilly "Julie," as excellent and leads us through the bronze of the tomb, providing a sense of foreboding and loneliness. Other teens are equally effective in their role, such as Melis Newman, the film's ultimate heroine. Special effects, though the date is excellent. This image is highly discarded, but it can be good so that it can never be destroyed in an endless continuity. There is a great, dark magic flowing through this photo; Once taped in, you really get it and you're for some fun. Double-disc DVDs are available, although the original negative movie was not found to be restored. Maybe someday it will be located. I assume making some unexpected at the end while helping the film by giving an old school honor to some parts of the carbon speckles and giving it a lot of effects suddenly. <br /> <br /> The second disc is a rough cut / alternative version of the film with a temp score version which gives more explanation of the death of two girls, too much is Bo-Is ("Amicintro's Cascade"!) The last dark crypt is going to open on the pull. The main stream was sure that it was not a punch for the viewers, but definitely for me and extremely vague. Also, the documentary is an interesting subject which is interesting because it gives information about what is going on with actors, crew, directors and writers; Explicit material, then the current logo, shot and discussion of the scene, rehearsal. This stuff then backs up for a small film is very unique too.
