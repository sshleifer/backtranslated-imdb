I've counted the number of times I've seen this movie. I have never been tired because it is a movie that can be enjoyed and explained in many levels. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is too late, yet it has grown so much alone. <br /> <br /> They actually portrayed this film in the Philippines forest, this is the greatest asset of the film. You really feel like you in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> All my fans are still in love with Robert Duval ("I love the smell of the morning!") Martin Shane and the great Marlon Brando <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the film is very scary, weird and the brain is at the end. Well, remind me of what Coppola said about this movie, "This movie is not Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" What does that mean is that the film is not drug addiction and war. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on Joseph Conrad's short story "Heart of the Dark" and is against the Civil War instead of the Vietnam War. War as book. I think this was a bright combination of my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect, challenging film that is dark, violent, ridiculous, and sometimes done in every possible way. <br /> <br />> A true classic <br /> <br /> Ratings: 10
