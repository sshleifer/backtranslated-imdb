This show is verging on the brightness. It is a modern day married ... with children. The scripts are malicious because they are scattered with clever tricks. They are realistic, today's adolescents-adolescents face problems facing them. As well as running burden that you can not be the best parent in the world and what is the best way to deal with it? However, at the same time, it managed to remain light hearted and funny. Which, with all the drama and action on television this day, is a very delightful and welcome change. This is something that you can sit for 30 minutes and relax, laugh and relate. This is not the most ridiculous comedy in the world. Yet you will smile at a fraction of at least one episode. Michael Repeat Dave led as bright. He needed heavy sarcastic scripts that filled big shoes and then something. He and Anita Baron (bikery) have fantastic chemistry and jumped very well with each other. It is sold in the market to the right show audiences and this show has a strong future if it is put in the right time slot. Also, if Fox releases it from DVD, the following will be stronger and larger. (As a classic example with scrubs.)
