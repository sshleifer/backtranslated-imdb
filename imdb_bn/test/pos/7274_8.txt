Ah, with a refreshing, mud, pox and gibbets to see a 18th-century visit to England ... and a delightful techno soundtrack for boot. It is frustrating, with Hydevon Plancket (Robert Carlisle) and Gentleman-pop-on-hard-time Captain McLane (Johnny Lee Miller), and how they got together and looted Aristo pigs. The planket is a tough brown, but MacLean is inferior to it, and thus becomes 'gentleman highwayman'. She has fallen in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) (who will be the only weak part of the Shiva) and wants to influence her. <br /> <br /> Dresses are fantastic. Large, colorful, historically innacurate beautiful togs. Allan Simmons receives all the best threads and received the best line like Lord Rochester, which breaks the eye of the very non-18th century. The music switched between swooping glorious choirs and bass-laden techno thumping, which you do not feel as if you think it will make a historical film. The scripts are rapidly moving and peppered with modern day colloquialisms; Merchant Ivory, this is not. Your seat-and-knee-hilarious parts, sitting beside your fingernails, are scary, but the whole thing has been torn apart and it is a great way of life. This cheer-in-the-movie stuff. Unmixed
