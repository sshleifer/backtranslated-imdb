First of all, I honestly thought it would be a genuine movie. But after seeing this, I was pretty surprised. Amanda Bains was strong in favor of supporting cast (especially the character played "Bullet tooth Tony" from Snatch. The opposite role of these two films!). Now, I'm not supposed to say an actor is good, but his work, in particular, was totally enjoyable. Half of the film is a triangle love triangle (although very interesting), but I think it will not be released, which I think, the film is really: just entertaining. So if you glance over it with a DVD or theater, I'm sure you enjoy it.
