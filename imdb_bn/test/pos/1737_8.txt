In September 2003, I heard that the BBC had heard the doctor reviving and making it "bigger and better" but I heard the rumor and thought that they were all-rumors. However Russel T. Davies was conducting the production and writing, and later on Saturday, March 4, the title of the Channel 4 News title - Christopher Eccleston interviewed the title role. Yes, Christopher Exststown is an actor, I see her for the first time in the film, she has been met, and it really happened during a television interview. When the month passes, more information is leaked, Billy Piper is cast, Delix returns and contracted for Gladieter to make special effects on the show. A few weeks before the return of the new series of first broadcast trailers, huge billboards in London told people about the return of the show, tabloid magazines carry massive photo spans of the aliens, and Christopher Exststown is present at various shows. Blue Petter, Mastermind (which was a special doctor's nightly version), this fasting and Jonathan Rose on Friday night. Actually this new series of Doctor in British television history could have been the most popular program, it could be bloody. <br /> <br /> So what was bloody like? Undoubtedly, it has been a great success with almost every episode of making the top ten shows on TV charts. From its top ratings to the old series, its ratings were made to the top five TV charts for the only part of the success (two-February 1975 episode of the Ark-In Space). The opening series episode is losing or recording the previous record with more than three episodes, and in an era where there is much competition in TV stations and preferences. Come on, smile and genuine Doctor Who's Exciting Hits Me One day more kids, celebrity westing and Ante and DEC Saturday Night Techway. Of course, most of the success is the role of taking sculpture and a well-known actor in the role. What you can see on screenbars is the same as what you can see in Spielberg / Hollywood movie. Like the 19th Century Cardiff and Nightingale of the 19th Century, Cardiff has a number of thousands of Dalex aggression strengths, external aliens that actually film the night and can not prevent a dark filter on the screen. I promise that you will hear a lot from the directors in this series, Joe Arner, especially one day, will be in a list of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The new doctor has some flaws and Russell Davis You should keep the door. Soap operas and post-modernist elements may be controversial (I do not have the opinion) but the debate is that the weakest scripts are written by all the RTDs. I mentioned in my review of Cassanov that he cheated the audience and he did the same thing: When the armed soldiers pointed out his guns he was confronted. The doctor blames "attack plan delta", which does not give any knowledge to the viewer, but rather to escape from a tight spot, a nude Captain Jack suddenly finds a laser in the hiding and RTD scripts such cheats and deus ex machina type is full of endings. In fact, the final episode destroys this ridiculous idea as "bad wolf" which seems to have got a much higher stability than a doctor. And finally I'm trying to remember that some of them were actually with the doctor? This is often a supporter or doctor who keeps the day. Shocking is called ROSE TYLER Doctor, so can we see the title character of the day, please do it like the classic series? A final point about the doctor's screenplay is written in the form of a ginning loon. Eccleston is the most known for her serious and frustrating role and she's absolutely breathless when she's going down, like running her face down at the end of the world, but she's often the character of "Tom Baker on Speed" it's clear that Excelan has done many ridiculous acts in his career. He is not very good at it <br /> <br /> Do I hate this show? Sorry I did not mean to say, but some expectations have been met or exceeded, there is no one else, and they are almost all down to Russell Davis, who are underestimating their achievements on the next series of scripts. Who is the doctor Let's look at the more traditional stories of human trafficking in the threats of psychological people we've seen in the 1960s and 70s, imagine a story like The Seven Devils with a huge budget run by Jo Seehre! Oh and one last request - can we see the "Next Time" trailer broken? They release all the best bits in the coming week's episode
