Sometimes there are questions on Hover over us and there is no answer. Two women are constantly trapped in one another's arms (such as the word of the word of the word), and the birds can not answer their own questions, how they define their relationship when there is no name for their own society. The slightly wrong title FIRE of Deepa Mehta is a short-lived trilogy first, linked here by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than the intake. The fire does not make a look here as the uncontrolled sex emotions, since women - the old man and the more radiant women (Shabana Ajmi) and younger, more devoted to the brain, Sita (Nandita Das) realize that they share a lot more than the general concepts and to each other Faith and affection of what they have for their passion for each other despite the disputes they face by their very traditional husband and family Stand up for. Like water, the fire is deeply spiritual, even if it falls into the technically sensitive image mode (where the water is more than the weight of the word, it carries a strong meaning that eventually connotes its definition). Even, it's a very beautiful picture, and a strong voice from a powerful director.
