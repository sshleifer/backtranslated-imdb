This is the most energetic and entertaining ten minute film> I've seen it for a long time. As a film student in New York, where this short has been shown several times, I salute Jim Cox for his generation's style and speed. I'm sure it will look at its big screen later. Hope this short> find the market on TV or elsewhere, so this inspirational work> it can get a wider distribution
