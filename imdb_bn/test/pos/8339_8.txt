This film is especially important today by William Wellman. It presumes that sometimes it's more important than your own personal insecurity or convenience. This movie, under the leadership of Walter Houston, was stolen by theft of "chic" sales like the Gramopa. She is the most complete drawing character of the film and a pleasure to visit. You see many movies from '20 and 30' but you can recognize some familiar faces. Well you watch the opportunity to worh your time. Recommended.
