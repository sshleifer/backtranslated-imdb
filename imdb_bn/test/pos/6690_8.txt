This picture is amazing ...... no doubt. Some time ago it shouted firmly from the financials of their families, which was correct in their science-film (which is not me), and it seemed that it was good. But after seeing recent documentaries in outer space we saw it again ... and it's good. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacy is the greatest actor ever without doubt and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Levotsky, Blast, Arlington Road). The film surrounds a patient in a nursing home, who claims to have come from another planet. Yes, you think ... but if her story is so convincing that her psychologist is telling the truth then she starts thinking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emotions of working with his own psychic colleagues, his wife and family, his father-in-law and his genius astronomer colleagues (after receiving some information from the proto, most of them admit that he is telling the truth!) A great movie ... which you think ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
