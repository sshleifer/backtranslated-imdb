I have seen the preview before I decide to see it. And you know, I actually like it! In 18th century English it is a new twist. Although the dance scene is perhaps the modernization and color of Leisure Tyler Clauder's colors (it's pretty cool!), But it is quite fitter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's outside. Unlike 18th-century detail film.
