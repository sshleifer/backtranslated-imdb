Why is not this criticizer like this movie ?? I do not get it. This is easily my favorite Clive Barker effort. "Heelier" was very rough around the edge (the movie did not just leave that stupid room), and it could be confronted, "Lord of illusion" does not move in all !!! I liked Barker's writing, especially his "blood book" for years. Terrifically Recreational He has a naughty direction to his completely dissatisfied with Stephen King. She freely mix her own homosexuality and weird religious and occultic elements. I love love love However, I understand that Barker is a horror writer as a dark fantasy writer. And imagine not just my bag. I have the right to sleep Always there. I think Barker works well with short stories. His novels revolve somewhat. I had the experience of trying to read "The Demon Game". It's a good start. Then 100 pages I thought "Where is it going?" <br /> <br /> I read "Cable" (based on Knightbrid book) and thought it was good. I especially want to expand on Decker's character. The mask spoke to him and controlled him. I liked the way Barker presented it simply. Black and white It's there. She gives it a simplicity that is interesting and trustworthy. When Darkar was killed, he asked (simply) "Because I like it". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I worship detailed visual attention that gives its films to Barker. Advertising IT I think it's just pretty. There was something in addition to these to the Lord of error. Some of the drawings at the beginning, during the nightbreed credit sequence order. It is just like a complete vocabulary of Barker that dreams for the nightbread world only. I wanted to know how much his design was. I know he is an Amazing Artist who speaks as his own style and artist. <br /> <br /> Nightbride (I think) Barcker's most entertaining movie. It came very quickly. Well edited Do not pull it like a lord of delusion little little. Very fast It's absolutely perfect for everything. It works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. Initially killing the family with the murderer and then hurting the old man in the shop is really great. That mask is terrifying. I'd like to know that Barker Designer is well-designed. It's not just a hockey Jason or "Scrum" -that mask. Some really annoying about it. <br /> <br /> However, this is a great flick. If you do not see it then definitely check it out. Highly recommended. Always one of my favorite horror films. In my opinion Clive Barker's best. It will be warned, though horrible and violent
