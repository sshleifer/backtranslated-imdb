In 1974 my skateboarding was completed when my two-by-four skateboards hit a rock with steel roller-skate wheels and I was tumbled, for a few days, I was feeling down in Boston, outside of my parents' house. At that time Caste came out of my hands, summer went away. <br /> <br /> But I always appreciate the X-type of games and surfers. I think I spent the first month after climbing the mountain in Swan Hill in California, South Africa and saw the surfers, that I missed my calling. It must learn young people before entering the horror of self-preservation and self-awareness. Or otherwise, you will be so worried about getting hurt or smile, you see the wind like a trained bear ... I am always admired that the moment a good surfer is at The wave does not care about the experience. Together with nature forces. It looks like a good surfer, so there is nothing else, that wave is okay, and the way you communicate with it. I have many genes in this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This documentary has taken some young surfing ideas into consideration and increased towards skewarding. Ramps, downgrades, less obvious waves when they contact the cement waves under their feet. Their day and time, these were all new. Radiant. The concept before the Zephyr skate team obviously concepts as you might go into a straight line on a skateboard, so my long "Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace" like the tumble down in front of the walk. <br /> <br /> This image was looking at once, to label everything in America, to be tagged, to be marketed, and jam-fatal "extreme" to force our throats down. (Seriously, what is so "extreme" about "extreme value" in Taco Bell? Besides this, your colon is the most dangerous thing ...) <br /> <br /> Check out this movie and see 'Extreme Sports' Birth. Before the X-Games, before the Boom-Boom Haq-Jams, before the Crusty Demon, before the ASA ... This young street urchins who did not really try to create 'extreme sports'. They're just doing it for holiness, pure pleasure, sun skateboarding with friends. <br /> <br /> I hope they will spend 'extreme' meaning there. They know they do not deserve the goodness they deserve. Maybe this image can correct it. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie with a great soundtrack, a portrait of Southern California, is actually an America, which does not exist anymore. <br /> <br /> I care for Shan Pen but he does a decent job narrating.
