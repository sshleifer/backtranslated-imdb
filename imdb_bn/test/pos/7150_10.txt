I am surprised that "Franklin Franklin" did not create even more enthusiasm this year at the Sundance Film Festival. There was a lot of time during the screening smile that could listen to such a sunny movie. The film is quite nice and makes a story which really tests a larger issue. You know little things like religion, gender and truth. Most comedies seem to rely on the same old voiced situations, many think that "I know they have stopped it from some things". This movie takes its own unique aspect. I really think J Floyd did a fantastic job with this tight budget budget.
