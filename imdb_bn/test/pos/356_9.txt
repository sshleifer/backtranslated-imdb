I have seen that I believe this year as the best Australian movie, John Hewitt's aquilites. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stylish thriller with a murderer premises on Acholites. Get this ?? Two bullied and molested teenagers discovered a local serial killer in their suburbs and then set them on blackmail to him who killed them who were confused. Hewitt topped the list of teenage players including Sebastian Gregory, Joshua Paine and Hana Monggan Lawrence. Add that three, yes, that's the three great psycho! Bellmana McClory is the victim of rape by her disgraced wife and Michael Dorman as sophisticated tattoos, under the leadership of Joel Edgarton, in an extraordinary performance of Serial Keller Do Cruz. After you add these teenagers and these menacing adults, all hell breaks break ?? Hewitt made a ball in the wall serial thriller that is great and original. You can see the effects of Twilight Pick of Larry Clark and David Lynch, but Hewitt has made it out of itself, behind a cold suburb, always wanders with empty drones. Shane Armstrong's script, Shane Cruse and Hewitt Tight. <br /> <br /> If this is properly marketed then this movie can be a break in with the teenagers. Next Wolf Creek? It could be better. It makes all the right moves. Teenagers are the real Ella Larry Clark. They do not have to suck and have a connected PC agenda, they are non-communicative, good looking and hip. The killer is dark with real danger. Joel Edgarton stole his kiss as a local Ted Bundy, who plays a butterfly in his 4WD extra Ala John Fouls de Collector. Darmon's petrol head rapist, Sobarion Meym pushes the leading danger and provides a vague lip, which you can not wait to see if you buy the farm. <br /> <br /> The picture is fast, difficult, and cruel. Not only that, it demonstrates confidence and instructional skills from Hugh, if the prize is not given, he must win the IF or AFI nomination! His nude and poetic Mais N scene, brilliant sound design, extraordinary cinematography and tight structure have clearly been identified as one of the best spectacular features of this year. <br /> <br /> The film reduces you, thinking and unstable. This is a great version of the return to the current movie in Australia. It must be the Hollywood's interest. Oh, and I mentioned it got Toronto? Can the other OZ feature say that in the film? The world should be ready for a new auteur, John Hewitt.
