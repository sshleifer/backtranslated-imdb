One of my favorite favorites of session 10 and one of my personal favorites, Manpower was highlighting the beauty of Al Gore's courage before going to global warming and before the film, it was certainly an adventure, Al Gore tried to make the world aware of changing the world. Something that might be really dangerous, half the people in half a beer and half Like a pig, Al Gore had one thing in mind: to kill aware of myanaberipigera! Al Gore is more sunny here, he feels sorry for those who see him, and yes he may be a child, some do not believe in him, but he only f ****** demented bastard. Basically four children are trapped in the cave due to Al Gore, but of course it is not in their mind, there is no room for any other matter, only what is Moneybrapag with Al Gore? The four kids, Curtman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, were mostly sorry for Stan El Al Gore and four boys were just playing in Al Gore's play, sometimes not imaging that they could almost kill him while trying to kill Marippeg (ridiculous scenes- "They're just children, cursed Manbearpig"). So in this part we have all the elements of the rescue team which apologizes for Al Gore and on the other hand we have a little more delightful Cartman episode and it is not surprising then Cartman's attitude is a treasure inside the cave, certainly this whole thing with this treasure is fantastic and great because you In both sense a sick cartman will see, he is really sick and honest for boys Yii for our sick. And ultimately Al Gore has killed Manishrappong! This character is a fantastic one and I serial! Awesome fun in this episode, one is a highly re-watchable one. 10 out of 10
