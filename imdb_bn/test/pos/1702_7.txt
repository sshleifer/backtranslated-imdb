I just finished a double feature night of an American Weowwolf in London and Paris. I started to hold "London" even after all these years and the transformation sequence is quite economical by any ideology, the movie is fun, and scary, a little bit ... ... now "Paris" as its enjoyable, several scars, as many beef It's not as exciting or eerie but it has got some fashion at this moment that has few movies, so in the sense that it was ahead of its time, the transformation was' Good for the near term, when a CGI is nowhere near as impressive. I gave this movie 7 because I had to enjoy it, I got a lot of laugh and made Tom Everett Scott so stupid that I would like to end first if I want to dislike his performance .... Julie Daly was able to guide the direction of the script, which had some brightness and shiny lack. I read here that John Lindsey wanted to lead a bad, I'm not sure that it was a completely different movie. I also noticed some of the discussions of "what key" of the cecilia, which has not explicitly mentioned that it should be American and the headline "My Way of Life in the American Way" or DC will be interesting to all political dogs. You can only see the original of its new DVD transfer with the Dolby 5.1 sound, and watch it on an HDTV, launching both of these ... Excellent !!!!
