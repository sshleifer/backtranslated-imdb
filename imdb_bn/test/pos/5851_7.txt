Ratings: 10 out of 7 indicated by Berber Schroeder. You like Hitachi's 'Rope' but you would love this movie. 'Marder by Dinners' star Sandra Bullock is psychologically frustrating, but the bright police detective Casey Myder is still in charge. His partner Sam Kennedy, a discriminatory detective who does not act like Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Teenage killer high school student Richard Howard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Panton (Michael Pitt). These young psychologists kill the perfect and prove their superiority by moving away from them, but the closure of the capture is at least one thrilling and exciting to the killers. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting letters is a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school generator that killed the killers. The film reminds me of the various hit movies of the hit comedy 'Law and Order'. We saw a fair bit of police and it is interesting to follow any detective and it is interesting to see what they follow. <br /> <br /> Another plot in Case of Casey Meyder's past and former prisoner-swami Most of the viewers have found this outlook on this unnecessary and slowly moving movie, but I found it in the most compelling part of this story. <br /> <br /> If you create a 'Marder by Names' image safely for safe search, or I have to say dangerous, kill mystery. For more thrills and mysteries, try 'Se7en' or hit 'Kills' for Hitakoos.
