I saw "a story of two sisters" last night and really enjoyed it. I've recently become a big fan of Asian horror films and think it's a strong entry from South Korea. There is not much shock you have to fear, like normal American horror films, but the director keeps the mood of the off-kilometer and rearrangement, especially in interactions with strange characters. Most fears are more conceptually and everyone has "something on the bed", when they were children, from fear they play, but in this case, when and in the branches of the leg. I like how this director liked how it was able to effectively manage this family, like the first diner associated with this camera. He is also good in expressing his inner life and flexibility through ordinary scenes, such as a child's skull, like sitting in front of a TV in his mother's face or sitting in front of a dazzling TV. I think that this film is basically the result of living with the crime that explores the crime and the crime you are hanging against. <br /> <br /> Main Spirir Ayode (If you do not publish movie twists then do not read any more)) I had followed quite a good story, but started dragging the bag during the part of the delusional. However, I think the end of the flashback is clearly tied together. The film, due to the rational crime of a lot of characters like "Mechanics", eventually leads to emotional breakdown and illusion. <br /> <br /> The explanation of my movie here When we return home to Su-Yen, we see that it is the true ghost of Su-Mi or Su-Yeon that can see and communicate only with SU-Mi. We see the primary child, in my opinion, Su Mi-Mia confusion. Although there is a real baby girl, and she first appeared in the film wearing gray pants. I believe this is a real child who is talking on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and he does not bring them home till he gets picked up. Before the wedding, the couple is excited by Su-m (perhaps part of his split personality?), Which explains the sequence of married dinner parties when the husband and wife think of him as crazy and do not remember what he thinks. I think Su-Mi is acting part of its divided personality. The film then shows bag-dragging scenes and scenes such as wipes his makeup in mother tongue, which is later revealed that the Su-MI wipes his mirror into a mirror. <br /> <br /> I think the ghosts in the house can not be fully visualized by Su-Mi and both are either Su-Yueon or Mom or both. In final flashy, it has been revealed that Su-Yen was wearing a green dress and had hair stoves during his death. This green dress, which they showed, was sitting on the dining room table before sleeping, when the father-in-law was looking down under the sink. Also, when Su-Yon was wearing flashbay in her hair, when her skull head was looking down at the bottom of her head, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Su-Yuan is a little ring for a scene Come on like. Then, how does it meet together in the flashback scene, how both parents were responsible for his death, when Su-Mai played a supporting role in an unknown way. <br /> <br /> I wonder "Ma" Su-Yeon see when he goes to his room to cry, flashback, already a ghost. Perhaps at that moment the mother had already killed herself in Colette. Other things that are recommended, but the film can not be clearly explained that it seems like a father, in some cases, there was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother. And perhaps his death has contributed. It is not clear whether its relationship with the father begins and it makes the soil self-conscious. Mother also had psychological problems, nurses needed it. When mama says Su-m, this maternal indication is to her, you want to take your soil afterwards. <br /> <br /> If we accept that the primary wives that we see are actually sweet, then Father's advice is also to sleep with their father. . Su-Mi suddenly shouted, "Do not touch me when my father brings me to each other"? Did he "do the filthy things" that he has in his next conversation with his father? This film is interesting to its interpretation for various interpretations. Some of the scenes, however, remind me of Kayako's Harki-Flashing Movement, in the near-scenes of women like black crawling, such as in the Ju-On / The Grudge. Also, the final scene where the child's mother finally gets her only sweet memories of the ring. Moreover, only the idea that some characters can be ghosts are taken from "six meanings" or "others". <br /> <br /> Overall, I've enjoyed it, but it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already being produced) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both "The Ring" and "The Grace", so I'm not one of those kind of fake claims that remixes can not be good either. I'm really excited about this "dark water" coming out of summer. I have not seen the original Japanese version yet, but both of the movies are definitely on my watch list.
