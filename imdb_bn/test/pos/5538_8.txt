I just wanted to give a bad review of this picture, who wanted to write a quick response to everyone because they think it's not funny or it's annoying. <br /> <br /> Here's a comedy --- The film is not meant to be a comedy only. It has some depth. Like many Demi movies, it works with people living in some weird corners of our society, who are trying to integrate a perfect life for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie and home video industry do not deal well with subtlety and leave it on "COMEDY" bin. It's funny, but many humorous off-bits But the heart of the movie is not a humor but it's about the people. It can not be one of the best movies in the world, but it is difficult and entertaining. <br /> <br /> and Cast is one of those things which shows why Cutting itself is an art. Michelle Pfieffer could be great and this film showed that this was a chore playing some for adding beauty to her. Mercedes Roulele gets a big hoot and she can chew visually as she rubs her role. Oliver Plate, Joan Cusack's small role and talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaacak and you've got a big cast, which naturally makes a great difference here. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modin is fun, but more importantly, he is a major hottie in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy. Come back <br /> <br />, wait for the unexpected and let the movie go wherever you want to go and you have a great time.
