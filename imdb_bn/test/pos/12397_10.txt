As an adult, when I was young, I was grateful for the capture of this movie. From time to time, I was facing family problems. This special movie was able to hold what I saw from a close world. How much colleague pressure is too much? I really wanted to buy this movie because it came to me trying to reach the audience like most movies. How far a person can go for social recognition? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teenagers are trying to find the answers to these questions, but ultimately ... if anybody is "the leader of the pack"? Is it strong? Beautiful Perhaps we all seem just like that? Could it be the moral character? As far as the movie is playing, Cast has worked together as it was predefined. I just hope that more directors and producers are trying to create a work that will reach us like this particular movie has reached to all of us. I hope I can vote more than ten because this particular title is more deserving.
