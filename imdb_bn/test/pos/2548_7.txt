Can not say this is not done well. A recent film festival takes 30 seconds to take some scenes from director director. And there is little indication that he did not get exactly what he wanted. But it's a strange non-Hispanic film similar to many years ago in Side Story. Both Lead, Brother-sister team, excellent and memorable in their part. Queens's underground car repair district has a type of setting that is completely foreign to most people and it costs the admission price. But some of the original problems of the movie are dissatisfied, for example, the sister seems to have got her. I understand brother's reaction, but it seems like I have to come to me a little easier. The film seems that such people do not need our help, they can find ways to live without normal support systems. I will not encourage anyone to believe. There will be more resistance to the choices here than pictured here. It works well that is another as an entertainment. As a proper illustration of a culture, not so good, I think.
