I always enjoy watching this cartoon, trying to catch the train on Sylvester Train, instead of staying at her grandmother's house. It actually fares a standard, but entertaining, especially when Tweety pulls emergency stop cords. One of my complaints about how the animators were runaway with the train. When you watch over, my little boy (who likes trains, so she likes it), then you start to eat some things. <br /> <br /> This short-term position is not in the luggage car train, but in 3rd, 4th or 5th and tall shots. The engine's number is 651 or 814, or no. The number of coal tender 99, or the letter "SP and question-answer", or any number or character at all. Coaches carry "SPQRR". The long shots include the word "&", and then in closing it has the words "south east and western". <br /> <br /> This does not interfere with the story, but the production details may not be seen very carefully. <br /> <br /> This cartoon is my favorite among Sylvester and Tieti.
