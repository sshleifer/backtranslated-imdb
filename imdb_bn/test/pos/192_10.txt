Mikhail Kalatozov's The Cranes Flying is a great movie. The Golden Palm winner at the Cannes Film Festival, it has an excellent cinematography and starring Titiana Samoslova, who is the only Russian actor who won a prize for acting in Kansas. She is Veronica, with her boyfriend on a plan to get married, a boy of love with love and happiness. During World War II and his boyfriend volunteer army, his life will be reversed. The film had an impact on the love of a teenage love and who went to their loved ones and watched them to fight and waited for their letters or other information. It is an illustration lost innocent. Samojlova does a fantastic job, and your character will break your heart. Camera movement is fast with many closures, it is a dance camera. The first scene of the stairs is fantastic, but it is not only, but later a scene when Veronica tried to commit suicide, and on the other hand, in my opinion, one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, Veronica's house bombing, when she carried the stairs in the middle of the fire, her apartment was completely destroyed happens. Just great! 10 out of 10
