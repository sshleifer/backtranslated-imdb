This was one of the most emotional movies I've seen. Regrets, joy, pain, helplessness, sorrow, healing, artery and love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spurious. Everything is so well done; Adaptation from book, actor, set, camera shot <br /> <br /> This movie has touched me in many ways. It reminds me of frustration that losing your love, and that takes time to heal wounds. You can love again, but the pain that comes with separation will be at stake. <br /> <br /> Is not this the most important age question? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Love before? <br /> <br />
