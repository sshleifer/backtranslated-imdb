Another "world-ending" film that compares the unrealistic "tomorrow day". DAT follows the same type of structure but with a distinct Japanese style. How to rent it? That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I have found that this small film is mostly for small people who are compelled for 2 hours. Also explain some of the science's frequent heading cards. The effect may have been seen in Japanese films and they compare what is good out of Hollywood. Human disasters are usually outside the screen, but the disaster scenes are so horrific. And that's one of the errors In recent times, despite the terrorism of thousands of on-screen deaths like World War II, there is no idea of ​​the chaos of the entire nation spreading through the sea. " Disorder but in most cases rarely touch this part of the story. However, this movie works at many levels and ultimately it is DAT, which is more realistic. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story itself was a closed plot device and another plot device that itself was in the 1960s horror movie "Garrith", it closed itself. Reasonably good science, and after most realistic disasters, makes it frustrating. A sudden closing movie for pop love songs will not help you (unless you like the song). This "exciting" makes me a little late for a drag. <br /> <br /> The overall direction is good and the industrial design is excellent. Acting is all good as well. Recommended.
