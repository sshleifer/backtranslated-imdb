According to Charles Vidor's guidance it is certainly an extraordinary 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors. Rai Heyever, (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt", singing songs with Gill, (Danny McGuire), "Anchor Away" and Danny McGuie was owned by a nightclub in Brooklyn, NY and was in love with Rusty Parker who is in Phil Silvers (Genius), with his "Connie Island" a dancer from his club, who was a comedian in this film and with Danny, Rastie They worked together and danced. Auto Kruger, (John Cowd), "Duel in the Sun" played a role as the promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided that Rusty Parker is going to be her top model. Jerome Karne's song is heard through the whole picture and song, "Long Agony and Far Away" theme music for this musical instrument. This film was nominated for many awards, and during the Second World War there was a big hit at the box office, which kept people away from the mind due to the ongoing war at that time. Rita Hareth and Gene Kelly hit the instant and their carrier exploded on silver screen for many years. Great Musical and a movie that you do not want to miss, it's really a great classic movie. Enjoy
