After all, despite this low rating on this site, I have seen quite a few capabilities in this movie and will happily defend it. And no, I'm not connecting to the crew in any way ... <br /> <br /> I accidentally came across the wind's DVD, and it was a strong feeling that it would not work perfectly, like video packaging. So I took an opportunity, and was pleasantly pleasantly surprised by this strange, very different drama. I'm ordering a rental or sale of DVD Marketing and Summary of Monty Home Video (the tag line "Love comes in many forms" it has been modified as "conversion of terror among many forms"). Sure, the rent and sale of small films depends strongly on attracting a person's attention, especially if they have never heard of the movie before (similar to a movie item itself). Perhaps what is working against this release, the horror fans have carried the description of the "universal wind" as "universal wind". It is very easy to think about what the film is, and some college students who make the crazy fool to make the madness in this story. So, at the time of submitting this review, perhaps the IMDB's rating is perhaps the reason I dislike people and realize that they were fooled by that summary, seeing an obsolete role, but seeing a dark drama. After enjoying the wind I can forgive marketing choices and think it is a dynamic change of pace from the big source of Hollywood, it is true that if the audience is attracted, they can give more ratings. <br /> <br /> "The wind" in this movie is basically just a metaphor for society, and it is the four friend stories that make things worse and how their life quickly becomes a harmful self-preservation. After a lot of distance between them in a 'education lesson', a death occurs and every person tries to preserve his own position. Manipulation became standard among them, and in the end we can see how self-help becomes their main motivation on good decisions. Civilized, civilized to savage. Using knives, branching, boxing and kicking as a club, it is completely clear by the means of violence instead of a gun. These characters, in the same way, are doing all the wrong things for the right reasons to be on top of the situation, because they have already taken a lot of things. Although there are many violent violent images, it is interesting to see that nudity and lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> "unknown" actor who works for the wind. The big ones were originally intended, but if I am a less-known, capable actor, then it works better. In this way you can sometimes get the story by thinking of "extraordinary, Tom Cruise", rather than a victim of real torture to deal with an extraordinary situation. Even the unusual conversations (like a field between Michael and Billy, and Mike face Clayer in his bedroom) are clearly kept and Fairview looks pretty normal in the universe ... which has a comfortable room, a forest and a wide open area. I remember the dark skinned secret scenes of reflected skins, which director Michael Manzilo referred to his comment as an inspiration. <br /> <br /> In addition to handheld air, it is managed to handle messages. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look carefully, you will see many symbols and dialogues which other directors should decide, with the head you pound This is a notorious scene between Claire, John and Billy, and it has suddenly been astonishing in the context of the story. I am still surprised that some people (boys, chiefly) kiss a scene and complain about two people, apparently there are no problems playing kisses if there are two problems. Everything is handled nicely here, and extra visions embarrassed you and also said, "Oh man, how did I miss it ......... Things slowly drowned" and I praised it. Or you can hear the DVD commentary to reveal more things! <br /> <br /> The purpose of this movie is to "get" for us, the air is airborne breathing at a time when most movies are to earn money and after listening to other films outside their "box office competition" Or CNN has been mentioned. <br /> <br /> Years later, it is always <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I firmly recommend to friends who find unusual films like this.
