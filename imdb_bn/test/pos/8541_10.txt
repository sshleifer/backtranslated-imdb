You know those movies which are terrible but you can not help them but love them? Well that Evil Ed, is probably the best horror film in the world. The sound is garbage, dubbing shit, screenplay is meaningless and the special effects are popped. However, I can not help but love this movie and at least 50 people have recommended this for years. Sam Campbell (or the man who played him) should be featured in the studio series because it is memorable. Probably Tony Montana, the greatest movie villain. Seriously, if you do not expect much, then do not be frustrated. Put a light hearty viewpoint to see this movie and you will rate it soon after 10.
