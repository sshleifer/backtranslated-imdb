These pictures were lovely. It provided some ridiculous views in the British club scene, which if you really see it, it's a fun thing. The characters of this flicker who see us in a real movie have seen them so realistic. <br /> <br /> There were some major scenes that really made this movie: got ready view; "Get me a real doctor" scene; White background scenes are being destroyed in each character of a complete state, the infamous line "What am I saying?" And comedown- sun view I am alive at this moment and I have seen myself smiling violently in my own ridiculous way. I can not give this movie 10 because it does not measure up to Grove, which I did not think of in this world, but it certainly has its moments. The MyS-n-scene and camera work are fantastic, special effects are significantly notable, and the performances are remarkable. <br /> <br /> After waiting a long time to see this picture, I was glad to say that I was not disappointed. I hope to see more from future authors / directors.
