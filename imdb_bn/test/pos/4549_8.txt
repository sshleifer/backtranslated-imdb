This movie is lovely. Smile will not stop Each scene is packed with limitations with the ridiculous comedy. Chris Farley plays a comic genius, and spades his character in one. Farley was one of the best snap stick comics of all time, and in this film (like all her movies) we see how much time and energy she devoted to portray the character of her character. "Tommy Boy" is a wonderful example of a comedy, it always laughs me, I've seen it many times before.
