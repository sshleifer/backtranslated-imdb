I have seen this series back in PSB, and still have seen a few years old tapes. Sometimes it is very atmospheric and weird. It is a very good show as the characters are all well defined and played. You are drawn into the plot and come to take care of these people. Villains are almost sunny, especially Nottingham's Sheriff. Man, I want to beat that snotty little bastard out. Nicholas Grace does an excellent job and Sheriff will have a great time being. His eloquent son, Sir Guy, is equally useful, but it is kind of. The series of black series and Devil along with tons of worship and the things of nature kill many of this series and Maya. I saw it got a prize for children's wonderful television. If I have a child I do not see them. Wonderful use of this show location It is now DVD, so go out and buy it.
