Flash Gordon's first rate was cereal. I know there were a few caves, however, I did not see it for errors. Flash Gordon in the Buster Crabboun. He was not a trained actor but he played very well, credible. Gene Rogers is beautiful and 20 years old. Old, in my opinion, is a fantastic good job. Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming, superb. She was quite versatile in many other movies, she could sing and dance. The screenplay of "Ming the Mercisses", all 3 flash Gordon cereals, was top notch. The rest of the cast also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy. John and Tracy
