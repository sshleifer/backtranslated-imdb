All the comments in this movie are negative now but I say "The Net" is engaging. Some movies can keep me at the edge of my seat, but this one. Another plus for that most action / suspense movies are completely language, but there was a small prejudice. I found it an enjoyable movie to watch. Like Sandra Bullock fan, I'm a little favorable. * Nimce *
