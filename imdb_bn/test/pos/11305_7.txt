My 5-year-old daughter is very much in the movie's Barbie series. I got a mixed feeling about him - he does not want to buy a complete Barbie-doll movie, and these films are a marketing plan for a young marketing company to buy more dolls and earn more money for Mattel. Although this morning he asked me to meet him with this movie, and - it's not a lazy Saturday morning and much to do - I agree. I do not know whether movies were made to help the doll market, something that I heard from, or the dolls (or, perhaps, some) in both markets, to sell the movies, or to sell it in the market, but whatever, however, to admit to me It will not be a little surprised - it was not half bad. It is a fun and fantastic story which is full of magical space and people and memorable characters (both good and evil.) Originally, Annika ("playing" by Barbie) Wizard Wenlock is a "light of light" opposite evil rogue. One way to build is to find, the other thing that his sister has become a flying horse and her father in the stone. The animation was great here - not Disney-Kalibar (if anyone thinks Disney is ideal for ideals) but generally good, and when the film is apparently suitable for young girls instead of middle-aged men, I still got enough twists and turns there was a surprise to me. How to make it all turned on. It is true that there was some hole in the story, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but again the target audience must remember those who would not really think about such things. A modest family movie around this 7/10
