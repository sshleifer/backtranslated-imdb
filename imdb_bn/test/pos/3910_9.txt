I have heard many opinions about this movie and then after finding Paris Hilton it was not even possible to give me the best impression of the movie ... then a group has to be dragged into the movie. My friends and the hope of a pill of pants, I got the threat that I was scared all over the film ... it was predictable, but the death and the entire atmosphere of the movie made it really scary for me ... I Through my fingers was watching through the whole path. So I say, check it out and decide for yourself and if it's a terrible movie you do not firmly believe to see it, it's also Chad Michael Murray, which can not be bad for a few hours. Hey
