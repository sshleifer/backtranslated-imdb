This may be one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; He threw virtually everything from virtual gag and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance, romance even in some violence. The mix is ​​challenging and curious, and the film has a lot of recreational and tricky sequences (like Chaplin and the other four try to find a coin that orders their sacrifices), but the elements do not always click together, and feel ruthless in the mix (and tone) . For the famous final statement, though undoubtedly honest, it seems a bit naive today, its expressions are "a good world where people will overcome their hatred and cruelty and their life will fly". Great performers by Jack Oki and the beautiful Palette Goddard. (***)
