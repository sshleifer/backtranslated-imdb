Growing up in the 40's or 50's, most of our kids were in the back-of-the-mill but today it has escaped from me until the films are seen for movies. I liked the film's story, cinematography as well as the superb casting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr., which played a limited role with the ever-reliable Word bond. Apparently this movie was the inspiration for the next television series 'Wagon Train', which shows Bond as the Buddhist of Wagon trains in the west. Johnson stole the movie with his horse riding skills and this actor is doing a stunt of his own stunts like Ben, Other notable features include Denver as the lovely Joan Drew and the first non-commentary role of James Arnence who later became famous for the role of 'Gnomoco' Marshall Matt Dillon. If you like this genre, you will fail to like it.
