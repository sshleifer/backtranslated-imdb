I like this picture !!! It became so easy for characters to become a part of life and really feel the feeling they are going through. <br /> <br /> A movie filled with smiles, sarcasm, shocks and just crashed a fantastic romantic drama! <B>> <br /> The only part I did not enjoy was special features. Putting behind the scene commentary was a little off. Since I wanted to play an extra role before the movie, I think about the characters (I know the fools) but the characters of actor personality are different from the characters they play. But in spite of this, it is a completely fantastic, beautiful film, I recommend that anyone who has seen and hagmum in this film, can I buy it? The answer will be a specific yes!
