My main criticism is simple enough that not enough enough or enough detail. I liked to see everything more: shipbuilding, engineering, training, first lift in orbit, preparations for departure, obburnal injections on Friday, everything. Instead of jumping on the NDC Corporation bus, I liked to see Earth's first lot on Friday. In fact, I liked seeing a series of world stories to create this world, a full hour for the whole planet, and probably another in the loop around the sun. As it was, I was hungry. On the other hand, I understand the budget and audience attention-spans. Give the science: Let's justify the light at the beginning: At the beginning they mentioned that there was a great conversation, but let's give this steam once they reach outer planets. The audience had to present some kind of conversations and we could guess that the lag was edited for language; So there is no complaint there. But zero for the spooky spaceship. Without making any noise, the only movie was Kubrick's 2001, and then he used to breathe breathlessly in the helmets - which was * quite effective. I understand the manufacturers of Space Odis that the huge rockets in the huge moon are not able to understand how turbulent the motor can be, the penguas roar the same as all the other cardboard ciphey films as all the cardboard spaceships. <Br /> <br /> But the rest of the science was excellent. There is no complaint, in fact, they have praised the radiation problems as well as what they have done. I hope the BBC will not be frustrated to actually make a detailed version of this movie, but I think it's not for next week or next year ...
