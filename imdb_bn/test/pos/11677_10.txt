I saw this movie at the theater at the age of 14 and it changed my life. I immediately cut my hair and started buying all of the movie band records. These were among the basic bands of the L.A. Pink Rock caught in the film at the peak of their power. Black flags (pre-rollins), Circle Xerox, Fear, X, and Bacterial bands are similar in punk music history. I can not believe that this video has not been released from the video or DVD. Great movie for punk rock fans.
