The recent history of Hollywood's past ghosts / horror films is frustrating. This picture will inevitably have the same fate, so get e-bay or similar copy. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture and the sound is fantastic. A good screen is shown on and well recommended with 5.1 or DTS capable sound system. It is obviously subtitled, so if it closes you, I will not be disturbed by it. Dubbing works very little and will not be here simply. <br /> <br /> It's also a frightened, horrific act that will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I will play the role of single girl, who is absolutely bright. If you can encounter the end, you want to see it again. The plot is relentless, and there is no comforting moment to be released without way. <br /> <br /> If I have a small criticism, perhaps there is a recognizable effect in some scenes from the Japanese version of the ring. However, we have taken direct copies of the ideas of other people in western film for years, and so my point is limited to one that does not prevent me from presenting it to 10/10. I believe the greatest fan of this genre will achieve a huge "pleasure" from this movie which I have dropped as a classic for one prospect.
