I always knew the day was coming. We all knew. There is just so much oil on the ground, and one day we will run short. But should not have enough coal to be used instead? And wind power, or something. Think about things for future generations. <br /> <br /> Then this documentary hit me in the eye hit. Oil manufactures fertilizer fertilizer, which is not available to anyone in the history of the world for the first time. When there is a lack of inevitable oil deficit, many things - air travel, many drugs, plastic, life on the coast - will become impossible. But the wonderful insight from the documentary is this: Oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without it our life must be changed. Although options and conservation are implemented immediately, they will smooth our landing line to the strange post-oil world (documentary demands). <br /> <br /> Despite its bitter message, the documentary is often very entertaining. It reminds me of the fabulous historical footage (in the mid-1950s, there are impressive images of dark urban factories and campsite interesting things) that make us move to the coast first. It is hoped that now the widespread efforts have been made, both of which can make our transformation easier from oil and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the documentary is that we can find this thing now because it does not spend time on the mystery. How can this be a great emergency all of a sudden? In the 1970s we knew preparations for the world after oil - and we started preparing for alternative energy research and small cars. If our failure on the initiative of President Jimmy Carter, 25 years ago, would have led us to a difficult landing in the oil world, then why did not anyone shout about it in the soapbox? <br /> <br /> Finally I The documentary was not highly motivated; And it has left me with a terrific coolness to drag me out of a beautiful dream. For everyone who is not likely to face the near future, it must be seen that we still have time to do something. <br /> <br /> - Charles
