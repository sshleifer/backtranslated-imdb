I discovered Turner Classic this late one night. I said to myself, "I will close it as soon as it gets fun", but do not need to say that I have seen the whole path. <br /> <br /> I was a movie junky but I was never the title of this movie (or I forgot if I did in 1971). It is valuable to look at Golf Haun's skills as a tart-spun sign. Her acting is an unlikely movie. Yes, the script is sharp and nice (the last time they made a Hollywood comedy with a smart script?) But his performance was amazing. I could never understand how funny Goldie could be, and it later expressed a little sadness in the roles like Sunny and Private Benjamin. In his later career, he is much above his very small, malicious funny looks. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see Great Morgu, Great Bergman and Cast Cast, but it's Goldy Haun again will be able to watch this movie.
