I have read some reviews of this movie, which have recently been released from the ecliptic DVD. Apparently, the opening title is letterboxed, but the rest (most) full screen. The first release was a full-length letterbox with Planet Video in 1982. Although it was a primitive publication, it got the writings properly. Later releases had sharp and good picture quality, but they were full screen as a DVD. The letterbox of any publication on this film should be, because it significantly adds to the experience of the older Planet Tape.
