A proponent of my job is that when things are slower, I can see the movie in our theater below (I work in a little 2-screen theater) in the action room and still watch the Rays stand. I saw Italian jobs probably 20 times, and I'm not tired yet. The atmosphere reminds me of the ocean 11th, although the performance is not good. Mark Wahlberg is okay, Charlie's Theron appealed to the boy, but Seth Green is the best in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a very good job while playing a darts, although many disagree. I enjoyed Moses Deff as explosive experts that scared dogs. I highly recommend this movie, and I will continue to see it whenever!
