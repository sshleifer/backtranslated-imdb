This film is the story of Catholic nun as an assassin of executioner convicted of the death penalty. Describes what the film does as a salt, which has no productive role. He could have doubted his true role. But eventually he could only make a nun in the role, which has nothing without faith on Christ. In America, there are many movies that describe condemned criminals or prisoners. Those scenes, especially the death penalty, are far different from Japan.
