Who said it was trustworthy? Before you sit down to see this picture, give your opinion and close your ration. You will enjoy more of the experience. You'll forgive yourself more lazy plot sets of movies and accept it for - this is a great family movie. I do not appreciate being concerned about "suspicious elements" in children's movies for once. That's my ticket price. And it manages to maintain its clear intelligence - the old Chadlin will enjoy this movie. Sufficient humor to make adult interested. Very good film
