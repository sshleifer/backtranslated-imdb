O god! I can honestly say that Maya Angelou is one of the most fascinating and important people in the world, especially my culture. She is incredibly inspirational and her story is a great woman story! When I first picked this movie, I imagined that Cast was miraculously integrated now shows their actions! Maya Angelo is one of my favorite Poets and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. I believe he is always the greatest. This movie was at the edge of my seat and reached Kleenex, as well as reminding me that if you are going to grow up, then no matter what place you come from, you will be great! And Ester Rollley played a wonderful supporter's role ...... 100% brilliant ... and now even "I know why Caged Bird Singings."
