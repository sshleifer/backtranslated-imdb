The movie is growing as a child, one of the quarters of which I will not forget soon is the Karate Children You can put Ralph / Daniel down on whatever you want, but it is important that the messages behind it are messages, which are great for animals and respectful to the children, but standing for yourself while calling for time. Returning to the film, it's rather funny, I saw boys crying and was really impressed with the performance of Hilary Swing and the other night I entered through the channel's ocean, I came to show this film and during my first visit to this movie I did not understand that she was in it . The story is similar to Juniie, like Daniel, where she does not want to fit or fathom and is brought to help the teacher straight out and guide him. I really liked this addition to Syria because it passed a good feminine pass for the story and yes, some documents that Hilary had kept me, we would say excited. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5
