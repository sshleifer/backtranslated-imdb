Jillie Stewart brought the life of Charles Linnberber to life, when he described the whole picture by crossing the Atlantic. It edited well with flashbacks on the life of Lindeberghs. Franz Wuxman's score is brilliant on the shoulders and the film really gives a heroic feeling. Stuart's can play one of the best roles and time after this film. Search for the appearances of Mood Hamilton (JW Movie Mayor). As Boud Gurni. In DVD 8-15-06, Stuartes came out of a series of classic films. I consider Jimmy Stewart as America's greatest actor and I will never be tired of seeing him in any film, see this picture and you will agree.
