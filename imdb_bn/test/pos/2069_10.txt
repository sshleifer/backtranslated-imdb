I have seen every version of this game, which I can remember, there are several phases, and Sir Derek Jacob I always saw the best Hamlet! <br /> <br /> is the most amazing voice for her performance on stage, and her expressional face will take you to a roller coaster emotion throughout the game. The way in which he provides his line, he takes you to a crazy ride. She (as Hamlet) can be instantly loving, soft and gentle, and may instantly get excited against the hell of her life. You believe that he is getting pain, you believe he is angry, you believe he is not a little crazy. You believe he is Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some thanks probably goes to Shakespeare. :) But to get the sound stage from the page without a nice actor, it really does not matter how well a game has been written. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you must see this version. If you do not like Shakespeare, you will absolutely see this version If you get a new perception for Shakespeare Sir Derek gives you a lot of performance, he will breathe you.
