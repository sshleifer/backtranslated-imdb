Many things about USA can be summed up in this movie title. It contrasts the spirit of this country in front of the war, and praises such things as a Hollywood-like lie that should be glorified. I'm not sure that I will agree with the latest event of the filmmaker (though in reality, I can not always say exactly where he stands) but I appreciate the unusual and artistic way around the point. Speech, radio interviews, audio track of poems etc. play a role here. Most of the time, the story's visions can have a great impact on this audio component. I was kind of a radio buff, so the radio was pleased to hear the way to integrate the motion of the film. In fact, most of the conversation conversations are in place of conversations rather than talking to each other. It is not to say that there is no "character", but in addition to the "Jim" hero (60 'drop out' about the uncertain state of mind) others come and go very fast. Some make very strong impressions, especially like a guru like taxi driver who thinks himself as a voice of knowledge. When driving in gym driving, when he broke the song of the spontaneous song, it was a very powerful moment. The quote on the DVD cover is "Dangerous", which is taken from Bush's speech which prevents us from entering our intrusion in Iraq. On the contrary, when we hear that speech at a climactic moment in the film, we come back home with a historically charged moment that will always be remembered.
