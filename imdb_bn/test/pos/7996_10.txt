Forget the superhuman "Batman starts, this is the final Batman movie that you do not want to miss." The film has everything, and it has lost its first hit in 1989. It may not be the end of the first box office, but it is definitely a good film The scene is amazing, Burton is working on his magic, as he always does in his film. The town is a wonderful sight to watch, the story is really good and the story is really good and 2 villains are very interesting, much more interesting than the comic book. Team Burton and the playwright Daniel Walters will give you one more step to get a real emotional connection with these characters. Go ahead, full-fledged penguin by Danny Davito, a kind of tragic character, Zin She was abandoned by her parents and later life tried to take revenge for her refusal, sometimes it is very disgusting, but some of them are mostly classic lines, a villain can ever speak in a single film, another villain Keton, Mitchell Piper, who is our One of the most beautiful actors of the time, she played brilliantly and Oz The performance and the live-action Batman or older and links perfectly with the villain has stolen mourning. She has a sad background. His name was Selina Kyle, and she was a secretary of Moti, who was then a fascinating businessman, who later pushed her through a window. However, he survived and "awakened" by the cat and decided to become a legendary catwoman and decides there, of course, before, a wonderful sequence that he completely loosens and most of his Oscars destroy his entire apartment <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He just got cool and he has a kind of role in the Clint Eastwood method to play Batman, and he is very dark. He does not talk much, and when he does, he feels very calm and he does not sound his voice. The "Batman" voice starts with all the fools and the fake IE Glass Batman. He struts like a man around Gotham by his own inner demons He pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. In this love, he took two Batmans in the most popular Badijis to please the comic book world wide. <br /> <br /> I would say, despite the amazingness of the performances scene, like the spectacular Batman scenes, gliding Batman across Gotham and down the street pushing down the street, the romantic angle between Pieffer and Keaton that is truly a top choice for this movie's classic The person who wants to see the actual Batman see, I would give this a 10, if I could.
