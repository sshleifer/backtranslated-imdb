Generally, Anthony has made Mann Western with 'Big Boys' - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. . . A list is big for the cowboy. But in this B + movie, he tackled a little differently and achieved a number of successes with a real true genuine success. The main character, directed by Victor Mature, is a trapped / mountainous man, and usually romanticized in movies - Robert Redford of Jeremiah Johnson, such things, where heroes are not actually an ideal mountainous man but a heroic figure who hangs with a clear cut real mountain men. Not here. Once, a real mountainous man - obscene, weird, vivid - central character, and some of it to see, mature in his later role. The original acting chops are made by Robert Preston, self-absorbed Castor Cavalier Commander and James Whitmore, available by the Spencer Trasies of the poor, who are one of the old timers who feel trapped in one of the more hostile Indians on one side. And the upcoming army of other civilizations. Even as more intelligent, very intelligent, as a wife of a Benfraft officer, who had initially anticipated from the point of view of a fragile spectacular character, then she began to realize her voice and found civilization to remove herself from civilization, that she was attracted to him. Sometimes the remote frontier is not fully realized on the screen, since John Ford gave such a place in his master Fort Apache without a romantic attraction. War sequences are large scale and especially violent, and especially impressive if you look in their widescreen format. Good show, and underrated movies, almost all.
