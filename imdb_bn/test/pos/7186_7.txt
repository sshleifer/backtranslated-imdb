The French people are not known as great movie producers. <br /> <br /> Although they earned high points in the Amelie Oscars Esther et et Obelix A very different film in what I was used to from French. This is a great movie especially for kids. Made me fooled that it spoke French and subtitles. Usually with English spoken movies (Netherlands here) I do not have to read the subtitles. But you only understand French. This story is very great with obelisks, who do not consider him fat fatty, but there are excellent details such as Bruce Wilix and Malkix. All of you know the story from the Anionic book and this slideshow shows the highest slides by all of the slides. Sterling lost three ships from pirate red beard to Bracking. I would say a great movie for the weekend with the kids.
