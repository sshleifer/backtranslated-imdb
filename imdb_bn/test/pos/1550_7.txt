I liked this Columbian film as its atmosphere, which was real thriller and even reminded me of movie-time, even in the first 30 minutes or so of the movie. It's done with a nice old fashioned manner, including the use of really nice and accurate camera angles and lights. It does not immediately mean this movie is a brilliant one but it's hard enough to consider a good late-columbo movie entry. It is certainly a good movie than the previous 'next' entry to the Colombo film. <br /> <br /> 26 years after the appearance of his previous Colombo film, George Hamilton again came back to play the lead lead against Peter Falkle, and as a murderer, certainly different and new roles. I liked him in his role and he was the best Colombo 'Villain' who gave some good competition to the old lieutenant. They had some nice sequence together. The problem with 'modern' new Colombo films was always such that it was not a well known actor in contrast to Peter Falley. This movie probably does not suffer from this problem. But I must say that this film does not present Peter Folk in this class. He must have played the character more well and his performance is not consistent enough in this film, probably due to his director Daryl Duke, who has directed the film "So-Pan", which is a really horrific film among most other projects. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good and enjoyable story, but it was used similarly to cover the assassination, previously it was not used in the Colombo movie. It was used before the 1975 film "Colombo: Playback". Of course, there must be enough 'real' moments with his story, although of course, every columbus film is less or less the same. But oh well, that's what Colombo series is so great and consistent. It is also true that this source has left for Lieutenant more than usual, this does not mean that this film is more stupid or drunk than its murderer but the author is more overly enthusiastic than others as I see more. It does not make movies or stories worse, and it actually makes Columbus work harder and makes it more enjoyable to discover small but important sources. Thankfully, this movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective elements from the Colombo-comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
