I have become a "huge" racing fan ever since "moving picture" and this concert is the first to be popular in the ray? They have still been admitted to play their biggest concert, and, despite the rain behind football, they still end up giving outstanding performances. A real example of this is that during the "yyz" the entire crowd started singing it in the original CNC in a real classic manner. They actually play each of the favorite songs with a real "strong" which is rarely done. You get the best seats in the house for one of their best concerts. The second DVD is a striking documentary of the band during Brazil and it shows you many retrograde topics, and it lets you see as a genius not only as a musician but as a real person in their daily lives. This DVD gift set is for young and old any fan fan and of course a keeper for your DVD collection. There is a concert of their concert to listen to their musicians. This DVD is worth it!
