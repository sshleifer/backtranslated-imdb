I get this film out of my ill feeling with Ingrid Bergman :) :) I really think that with her talent this world is always best actress and her movies are absolutely wonderful (even when they are terrible) There are also. If it does not stick to Vivienne (as I originally liked) I could have given it a 9.0 because I love Viv, but probably not as much as I prefer ingrid. And any other actress could have it 6. This is a good story, two wild people fall in love in society where bad is bad. GWTW reminds me a bit without being laced with an extraordinary attitude. Gary Cooper is very nice as usual and of course his voice never changes the whole film, but Hey Ingrid makes him so amazing and pushing and maybe 20 times more hot than he is.
