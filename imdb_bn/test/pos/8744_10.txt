When it was made and it seemed to be bright then I saw it. After seeing it for the second time after almost 20 years, I still think the traffic is brighter and much better than the American film based on this play. <br /> <br /> All of us who come here today should also take a look at this. Tomorrow's politicians believe that they can win the drug war, because the issues raised in this film were just as it is today, at the end of the 80's and until they changed their policies, it would be even more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well written, beautiful, beautifully portrayed and portrayed nicely. A thoughtful stimulating drama that gives entertainment and as well as the harsh reality of criminal medicine business.
