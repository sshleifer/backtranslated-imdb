This TV adaptation of Sarah Waters's novel was so lovingly done, I rarely find words to commend it. Since "Velvet Tipping" (highly recommended) I saw such a performance by actors acting during this time by Sally Hawkins and Ellen Cassidy. They worked with their souls, and what they got across the audience! Supporter actors have been well-selected, they made a great ensemble. <br /> <br /> Those stories think about just a gay relationship - no, this is just a part of it. The betrayal of someone who loves you another major theme And there are some more surprising twists in the plot. So the film will be straightforward for people or people like me to be interesting.
