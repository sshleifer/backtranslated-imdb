I liked this movie for the first time I saw it many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, maybe 10, maybe 20. This last time I saw that I did not notice before. <br /> <br /> The end of the picture, the killer heroes are conveyed back to the city through the sled. Dead men have a couple of closeups. The one who beat me was a young man's shot. What you see on the screen is its profile from the head. His hands are holding a flashing candle. The wind is going to fly and its thick blonde hair dancing in the air, tune with the flash of candle flame. The difference between death and life is incredibly strong. Moving hair and candle flame reminds the lives of the residents of our body. <br /> <br /> Every time I revisit this movie, I see something new.
