The film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, was brilliantly created. It starts with the family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day) - a former stage singer and his younger son - my guess is 10 years old, who is traveling to Morocco to retire. The attack on French government agents on the bus, and they are very nice to him. He was killed in the market after finding information he sought. He wants to carry this information to anyone, so he goes to the only person, even little know: James Stewart. The opponents kidnapped their young boy and the agent told him that he would say something, his son would be killed. Stuart has to travel to London, where his son is, and where the agent told him that it will be. The movie is very mysterious. There are many twists and turns (usually hitcouch movies). Also, it has only the right amount of angular relief. In addition, it won Oscars for the performance of Doris Day of "Kui Sarah, Sarah". This movie is very good. It's hard to find a problem about it. I would certainly reccomend it to all the fans of Hitachi and all mysteries. I give this movie "A-" because it's a little bit predictable.
