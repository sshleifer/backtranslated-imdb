Well everyone travels 120 kilometers highway, McDonald's eat and air conditioner operates fourteen seven running and Fox News shows a stops, I think this documentary is interesting. One thing I picked up, when they were talking about North America, then I was in the documentary Fabric Aun Kennedy. I'm going to Bill O'Reilly for Canadian batching. <br /> <br /> Everybody will be affected by the reduction of oil, especially Canada and the United States of America living in large countries. I'm not sure that green peas more gas is not impressive, and does not mean SIV, those who live in zero free temperatures may be starving to death. <br /> <br /> Anyone has studied economics, I know that we live in a world of limited resources. I would give documentary props for trying to present a balanced perspective about reducing oil. But I'm studying a degree in journalism, full of documents loaded in this documentary - as Republican warm. Democrats could not send troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> If you are going to present a documentary about economics and resources, it is best to leave the political crisis on one side, because it can completely stop the potential audience member. Attention to limited resources issues. At the end of the day, mainstream minds are the best, because it is not a good promotion for small mass stories. <br /> <br /> I do not see the documentaries of Fahrenheit 911 and W.uddin's sub-continent, not for their political bias, because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Surely I want to shop, and consumer junk food is not such as tomorrow, but if the world ends tomorrow, I would rather die rich and eat the living beans. <br /> <br /> For potential documentary makers, just give information to the public, and viewers create their own mind. If you are trying to package your political opinion as a balanced documentary, people are going to smell a rat one mile away.
