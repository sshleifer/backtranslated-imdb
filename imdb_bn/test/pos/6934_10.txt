Just saw this one again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had good time. This type of movie is made, for people to entertain and Jabmium Bloodbath II. This is for me and I have shown it to everyone. <br /> <br /> The story follows a group of young people in a van who runs in a group of escaped convicts who passed over an old farmhouse. When a scarecrow (that is actually I think of a giant) gets annoyed, it comes to life and re-animates the dead body from the local cemetery. This led our heroes to land in a small town in the process of torturing a few people in the process of torturing two insane killers. Very soon it is a showdown with people fighting with zombies. <br /> <br /> I like this movie! In many different formats (black and white films, video and digital cameras) very fast and in great music, there is always something going on and it never bothers you! Sure, it's cheap, but you can say that this movie has taken great care and hard work. I read another review and I can say that these guys missed the points. If you want 35 mm flower moon fluff, or if you are in modern elements like the modern legend, then let me pass it. If you like low budget elements like Gates of Hell and Evil Dead, then I'll buy it now. <br /> <br /> Make-up and Gore are very good, acting is sometimes disrespectful, but it's pretty good at all and editing is very impressive. To complete two films, this level is enough! It is actually one of the best B-movies to be seen in the ages.
