When I saw my girlfriend in the apartment, she said: "How complicated!" And she must, of course. When you use simple, one-line plots, especially violent protagonists versus skak schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. Here a couple of negative critics also missed one or more important points. Another whine about confusing flashback Come on! This is not a movie that you can go to visit the toilet, come back and hook up in a few seconds. This one demands full attention and a deep vision of detail. Then it is not really difficult to determine what is happening and when. The director has left without enough interest in all the scenes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < As with my girlfriend's comments, the film started as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that the two lost lovers find each other. I predicted the experience of the French movie that the story would soon get sick and I was right. At the end of the first part it became clear that after several twists and turns, Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, why did Lisa go? Lisa did not know why Max did not contact her in Rome and after leaving her in Paris she left without trace. Alice was the only person and her own reason for closing her mouth. <br /> <br /> Both Max and Lisa have found the truth, of course the question is: Can the Elis Manipulation be restored? Well, there's no time, time has gone and things have changed. <br /> <br /> Many European movies use a technique that I fully enjoy. Initially there is no explanation for basic contradiction, then two (or more) interested parties try to make decisions on their own. Instead the audience is slowly fed with bits and plots and knows less than the original characters. L'Appartement is a fine and fine example of this technique. Alice appears to be a side character in the first half; Gradually, it has become clear that he is the main character. <br /> <br /> acting is very simple. Vincent Castle is somewhat perfect as a naive and emotional character, who is a risky life to find dreams from the past. Monica Belucci is certainly very nice, but capable. Jean-Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary humorous touch. Roman Boehinger is very faith like a nanotic woman, hurt by feelings of guilt and remorse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it was 10 unsatisfied ends. Of course it was necessary because of the desired parallel. After all the events are just the point where Mac starts the movie, only the wiser and sadder. Alice paid for her sin. But still a bit of airport's slightly twists are artificial. Max exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice decides to reject Mac easily, who has dreamed for so long; Mac very easily returned to his fianc√©e. But then again, I do not know how how elegant parallels can be achieved without sacrificing. I assume that artists will sometimes have to give up the realityism for beauty.
