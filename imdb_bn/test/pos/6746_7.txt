This is a really dark movie. Actually silent. The title character is intrigued by Evelyn Kiss, unknowingly brought to New York City <br /> <br /> After talking to the girl and innocent sister, she came in a round. But he is not deliberately a killer. That does not mean that he will be killed. This does not mean that its existence is not one of eight million people, it does not ruin the city. <br /> <br /> Keys are excellent. Supporting Cast is very very good. There are many less known people involved - including the director. Will not be closed. It is counted with a movie! (And how beautiful it is to see Colombian pictures, wonderful humor and silence has been observed in Colombia and Republic, but we never see them.)
