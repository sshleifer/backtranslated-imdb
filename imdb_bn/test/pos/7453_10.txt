Graphics: Of course, bright. The most stunning thing was not given explicitly away from the trailer. The sequence of battles move very fast, but after seeing some of them your eyes should use it and it will not feel so confusing. The cloud has a wide array of swords and I hope things get going a little slow, so we can see them because they were completely detailed in detail. Oh, and finally we see how to equip Matiya ... <br /> <br /> Music: Bright. I was a bit annoyed about it, because (from what I have seen) is not the best for writing music (the act would steal a little bronchi sequence?), But it is bright and it fits perfectly. I'm glad I preordered the OST. They replaced the songs instead of One Wing Angle, so if you know Carmini Burana songs you can not sing. <br /> <br /> Plot: Setting the first half of the film and introducing it to everyone is a rough complex tape, but the second half is almost completely sequenced in order, once all the players are in place. I do not have it a weak plot, but it is closer to somewhere near it as the plot near the game. I think it is trying to prevent the game from trying to galaxy, and I think it's a good thing ... the film is its own entity, and it should not try to be the key to mere plot. I accept, I hope this movie will bring FF7 to a wide range of people, but this is not a mainstream film. I'm going to give it just nine stars, because it really does not try to explain something to the beginner ... Marlin (at least I think Marlin was ... sounded like him) started giving him a bit background, but it's more than a crash course Refresher more. But then I realized, this movie for me is 10/10, so why do not I like other points because other games probably will not like it ... If you play the game or at least it is familiar with the mad, you will see this movie. But you do not need to tell me. If you are not familiar with it then go out and buy it, sit there for twenty minutes and beat it and then watch the movie ... though it's still pretty beautiful without any background. You just do not get any references inside ... which produces 50% of the movie (that is, everything is not a war section).
