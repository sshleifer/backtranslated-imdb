After my release in 1976, my father saw this movie. I was still a child, and the shock was frightened by me. Especially I had to leave the theater during the Clostrophobic tunnel scene, because it was very intense for me !!! I went to the security home of my family. I have seen the film everywhere and enjoyed it completely by growing up. Although the shame in the giant suits men. If you ignore the productivity and deeper development of the product, then you have to do kousing, great opening scores, some nice photography and sometimes trustworthy m. Douglas McClun will get extraordinary performance, my childhood hero! The British Police Constable Whitehouse Watching! Tight bang cave woman! Monsters with beaks! Tareq's gliding monk actor actress! This is all! Fantastic
