I have not forgotten this movie. All these years and it remains in my life. I've seen this site on so many sites and stores. If someone reads it and has a copy, I'll give you a copy of it or please let me know where I can find it. This is a movie known as classic romance, as well as my other favorite, Time should be known somewhere. It was really brilliant. If the right actor re-establishes this film and gives it the necessary patience then it may be the right thing, it can be a block buster. The love story of love should be like this for all lovers. I think I was so sad to the end and it really came as a shock. I believe in my heart that the person really loves the woman and she loves him. This is a horror movie and it is a shame that it is not available for purchase to us. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I would like to thank my wonderful lady who responds to my message about a year later. She was a copy of the movie and please send it to me so please. I am a great fan of this movie. With her help, there are 3 happy ladies to get this DVD. She is waiting for book that book based books. I'm checking with her local library, titled 'Mrs Mythland Affair, Margaret Lynn. I'm sure it's great too. Many thanks for his kindness and friendship on July. I'm always your friend, Sharon
