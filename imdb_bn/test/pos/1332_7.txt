Soderbergh is a fantastic director, but he could beat the amazing cast gathered for these genes, noting anything conjure. Obviously, he knew this from going to go. The term "star-vehicles" has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that a star almost created itself. This image makes the whole of the Hollywood hot shots brighter and brighter than the net. The last scene says everything - all the stars are sitting around that nothing is happening and nothing is said. We just found their socialism even though it was visible from a reality show where George Clooney, Kathryn Jett-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Chadle hanged himself. So the story is not the most important - at least, the movies here do not have the greatest pleasure. If you want a cute cute movie then with 11 good stick. But if the star-eye turns you on, it will create your day.
