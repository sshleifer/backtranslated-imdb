Clive-Aviation is one of the main achievements of this movie. When do you hear the story outline a vague ?? Erasmus students of mixed nationality share flat in Barcelona? You predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a ferrous tangle. Pass Do Tout! Actually, it is a young French, a fine-judging comedy about Xavier, trying to create a feeling of human relation. Some nicely monitored minor roles (boasting French neurologist, the incredibly steady mother of the English girl, the foolish mother of Javier), and some subtle visual humor, especially in early scenes, ridicule the bureaucratic complications of the application process. So what can you learn about Javia's relationship? There is nothing positive. In a typical happy ending place, there is a sadly portent finale about 'identity'? Javier has become 'all the friends he made. Yet, this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed euro-audience, who enjoyed themselves and were even praised until the end.
