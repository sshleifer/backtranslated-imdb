The best British comedy film ever! Over the years English comedy television shows have become movies and flopped, 'Are you serving?' 'Dodge Army', the list is running. But the popular dark BBC television show; 'The League of Gentlemen' was not directed to create a movie that could not be a flop, but it was also the best British comedy film ever! With its dark and terrible twists and active the League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse is its best in British genius! The legendary legend of the League of Gentlemen's (Mark Gattis, Steve Pemberton, Reese Schisttheth and Jeremy Dyson) played with Giant's (and guest camios), with his playful giant story! Hope this is not the end of the ryston vase, anyway after this great success! If you do not see the League of Gentlemen's telephones, do not think that you can not understand what's going on. This is all well explained and at the end of the film you will be happy with the result but you are still hungry ... Mmmm, Special Stuff
