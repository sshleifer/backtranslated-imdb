Scanbert was held in the 1940s after World War II. The main character Gunner (Gustav Hammerstein) left his job to get a chance to "differentiate" Europe in the bombing of Europe. He packed the book of his favorite Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and truly proves the famous statement of Witgenstein: <br /> <br /> There are two main plots and a few mistresses, in this film, which is tied for Berlin Train is organized in the train. Writer / director Peter Daler (also playing role as conductor of the train) has played an impressive role with Swedish legend Lena Niemann, Gasta Ekman and Robert Gastfusson. Overall, acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson (branded, bad taste) is seen in the Shieldler's list as a KeelingGadget. I laugh at most of the movies, and when I got up the next morning I became more relaxed. An intelligent film for Swedish comedy fans.
