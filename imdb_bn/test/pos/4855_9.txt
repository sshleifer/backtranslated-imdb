I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. Director Neil Slewen's impressive actor William Messi (last year's TIFF competed in the competition), Mt Lof (AKA Mt Luf Ad, AKA Michael Lee Ade), David Pemmer and Laura Darn (also stars in Novovenny, this year's festival). Based on Arthur Miller's novel of the same name, the Focus follows Christian but follows the "Jewish-looking" Lawrence Newman (Messi) because he struggles around hatred and anti-terrorism around him. In the middle of the Jewish shop owner's street (Pema) and his card-carrying anti-Semitant neighboring neighbor (Meat Lough), Newman's internal conflicts and problems surrounding him were found to be conflicts. Do crime in knowing what is right but do not fight against war to mix and maintain peace with neighbors. When he met and married Gertrude (Darn), he became more complicated and everyone was Jewish. Gertrude taught some things about books to learn by learning her husband. <br /> <br /> Is Newman finally able to stick up for the Jewish people or will he run away? Look out for it. <br /> <br /> The acting was fabulous. The writing was incredible. Cinematography was excellent. The word has been well done. Technically amazing, the movie was boring. Chiling. Mentally intense. I brought myself several times to my knees in the fetal position. I have great praise for everyone who works it. I have not seen this picture a long time a good one. It touched me. <br /> <br /> Wow.
