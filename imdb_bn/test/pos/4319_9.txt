"Live Twogether, Die Alon" was divided into three main stories, and each of them was enough for a great episode. So when you unite them all, you have a great ^ 3 episode. This was a bold step to deliver a seasonable flashbacks of a bold step (Desmond), who was present only in 3 episodes at that time, but it works: its backstory is absolutely interesting to see, both of the island and tone informative about the past The station itself and morally moving. Desmond and Penny are witchcraft connected to each other, even when they are on the opposite end of the world, and both characters are well-played (it is hard to cry when Desmond Pen√©'s letter reads). The action inside the hatch is the seat-off-seat time, as it is determined that the button is not allowed to push again, sure it was only a psychic test, Desmond gradually realized the results of this decision and locked the echo out again Tried hard to come back The moment was melted and the lock was "I was wrong" unforgettable moment. Michael, Jack, Kate, Swar and Herlely captured other forces due to the betrayal of Michael (later after making an evil invention with Pearl) and the return of the change of game of "Henry Gell" as the leader of another. Even at least significant plot lines, Syed, genes and sun beach beaches, where others are supposedly camping, there is one of the largest mythological mysteries of the show, the monster statue, which is completely absent except for the foot without having four toes. Briefly: Emotions + history + mythology + adventure + mystery + threat of destruction + hope is a ray = a classic LOST episode. *** 1/2 out of 4
