This was a special screening of my college theater last night. Everyone thought about how good I was in this movie. Although, my roommate was not taking care of it, but he went to see whether Paris Hilton could work without going to horror movies. However, if you're worried about that, do not. I'm not just one of his fans, but I must be honest and say he was good and it was the best death scene for him. Overall, all the actors were very good. I'm not going to detail for the plot because I'm sure you know about it. Surpirsisngngly, the characters are quite compelling and you actually care for them, especially the characters of Elisha Kuthbert and Chad Michael Murray. We meet with them as competing siblings and work with them to finish working together. Another plus is that it does not look smooth on the MTVville Horror or the Texas Censo genocide and seems almost documentary-like than any music video (Do not make me wrong, I loved Texas Chess and enjoyed Amitivl√≠). <br /> <br /> Now for the death scene. In most Slasher movies, whenever a character is stolen or killed, the scene immediately moves to another scene, but not it. When a character dies, they die very stupid. But the filmmakers do not stop there and every time they add additional things to each victim. I will not say anything about the scene of death and will let you see them for yourself. While this is a great slash movie, it is almost all of the flaws in Slashar movie (searching for a vague house) when you are not traveling, skipping, splitting and screaming with suspicious character so that the killer can hear you). Also, a stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and it was not added to the film. You can say it's just added at the last moment and if you accept it, it will not affect the movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you're a horror movie fan, check out this movie. You do not have to be frustrated. It has got everything needed to create a great slash movie, probably its first issue, though it's the best of the year. Mystery is felt and it's a fun movie at times. If you hate scary movies, you probably like it, and if you are divided, I encourage you to give it a shot.
