Here's what you remember about this movie .... this is a child movie !!!!! I do not know about the rest of you but I'm 80's children. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So, naturally I love this movie. But if you look at other Reno Bright movies, it's a great one. But, I said, it's a kids movie. You have to judge it as a kids movie. It does not matter if the acting, animation or script is fantastic or even better. They all care about what happens in the characters. If the good guy (or girl) win then it's a great movie. If not, then it's bad. You all know what I mean. Once you had all the kids.
