Fulci is one of my favorite all-time Italian splatter directors. She is a very good story teller mixer awful, supernatural, and cyclical theme completely very well. This film is indeed his last great story before he conducts such a disappointment as "Hello of Bound". The story is easy to play in Fooli itself, a horror director. For years, filming splatters and gore films seem to have begun to take a broken experience in which he started hallucinating about killing people. He firmly believed that he wanted to see a mental patient, who confirmed that he was killing only people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not believe that these films are directed but certainly produced. Some of these movies are "genocide" directed by Andrea Bianchi (Barry Ground), "Touch of Death", "The Murderer Secret" directed by Phucchi, and I can not remember the rest of the films. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very intimate film by the supporters of Phulasi. But I liked this movie and it has already seen many times. It is tragic that Phukchi did not get any direction to do such things, but it is a great film and I recommend it to a whimsical fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
