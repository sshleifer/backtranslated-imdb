I'm not sure how IMDB comes with so little ratings in the "weighted average" film. It's a movie of my opinion and all the other accounts overlooked a jewel. Bang is suddenly the most beautiful of Tantu Cardinal, like the lord of Nur and her husband. Tornad and Cardinal are both underworld actors who are finally given a stage for their craft work. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always happy, but it is very real. This is not a "luxury and sensitive love story" as a DVD jacket. In the end it is a tragedy. The Lord is only very focused and ignores all the advice for the money taken by the electricity company. <br /> <br /> Music seems to be nice.
