"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies ever !!! I think I have seen this movie in my late night TV with my mother many years ago and I thought it was very interesting. This movie was also referred to as "Black American Graffiti". Promotional and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs's favorite friend like Kochez As well as it has some great characters, and this movie has lots of humor. Since the beginning of the film, which is going to the Coach's Pritchch home to prepare for the tragedy of the funeral of the Cochchi Cochsee funeral, this movie is one that will laugh at you all the way. There are so many scenes in this movie that I like a lot. The scene where Putter (a friend and another friend of Kochiz) went to the zoo with them and threw a gorilla's ass in his shirt (very rough, but also funny), the first scene in the street corner cafeteria, the quarter party has become a disaster due to a war at the girl's house. , And something else surprising to see. There is even a wonderful companion soundtrack album in this movie, which is packed with amazing Motown hits and artists at the beginning of the 60s (Soundtrack is packed with only 6 songs in '75 ', others' 60s). The movie is basically two friends who dream of moving away from their poor and rough neighborhoods after high school, but their future seems to be out of reach, because their innocent pleasures in the stolen car was responsible for two hoods, and her girlfriend Brenda Promoting relationships with (played by Cynthia Davis) are often in danger. Go out and rent this movie or buy, and be ready for a load of ridiculous entertainment !!! Get very soundtracks. It's so much fun !!!
