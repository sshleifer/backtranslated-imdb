I've seen this picture three times and every time I appreciate more. I think Jordan Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for her real and natural performance. Many of us knew that Phoeb's age was the story of this story. For most of us, life is not as romantic or harshly frustrating. It is a vague balance, and this film captures this balance. It is very well made, with many subtle details of his composition. Whether it is judging from a very high ratings from the population of women under the age of 18, we know that this film reveals some important truths about how the world shows itself to young people.
