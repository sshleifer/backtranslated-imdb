I had already written a review on IMDB, since I think most of the games are ineligible for time and effort ... curse on monkey island is different. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I had many expectations for the third release ... and was not frustrating. The first thing to hit me was the significantly improved graphics. Do not make me mistake for creating games in 1990 and 1991, the monkey 1 and 2 broke the ground and provided the product well, but CMI took action and provided a great cartoon-style game-game that is both fun and satisfied. All scenes and settings have been carefully created and thought well, and perfectly suits such as this in the game. Animation / CGI is a mixture of reality and hilarious mix; This is a fantastic combination of cases. <br /> <br /> The script was very important for me in the success of the last two games. CMI script is tricky, fit and, above all, absolutely sunny. Added to this, the script is now in front of the previous two, where the audio is displayed in the text format at the bottom of the screen. Dominic Arthur's voice is suitable for Geibres: Wicked, plain and a little naive. All other voice geniuses perfectly fit their character, especially the voice behind the Earl Bowen LeChuck. I like every single character across games: just their personality and intelligence, but each character is way animated superbly and individually. Sound effects are subject to audio effects, soundtrack notation. The soundtracks were both together for both monkeys 1 and 2, and despite this, it was very effective in maintaining the environment and representing mood changes. CMI's soundtrack, again, a step-up. Each scene is complementary by an attractive, delicate, curious and piratey (if it is a word) tune. Along with the setting or mood changes, the music also adapts, adds entertainment and entertainment to the game. <br /> <br /> The whole idea behind the monkey island is to solve puzzles and solve the problem. This may be the simple word, but in many places devilishly clever. Some people can be kept away from the reasonable level and thinking of going to the Monkey Island, but in reality it makes the game even more entertaining and fun and adds value to the playlist again. The choices of "Curse of Makki Island" or "Curse of Expedition Island: Mega Monkeys" (which includes the tricks and large amounts of puzzles) make the players competent with all the capabilities and give good reason for at least doubling the game. If you choose any difficulty level, you are sure to repeat each and every playlists and other puzzles to ensure a different game that does not affect the outcome of the game, but it is only for fun. The most entertaining section of the game ships ship, and the sword followed that "fight". This was particularly well thought out and the game was perfectly suited. This is a great story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages, which will keep you wished and will want more to the end. Finally, in conclusion, the game should be given special attention to the designers. Ways to think of each complex puzzle and problem is simply wonderful. While collecting game items and objects, you can not see how you are going to help in progress, but present yourself with a lot of thought and determination, and CMI designers should definitely appreciate it. <br /> <br /> For the best game I've played, 10/10 (not too much)
