Captivating "Get ready for the summer movie." It's a fool, stupid, and probably a touching date, but my kids saw it and they smiled as hard as I saw it. All the "little boys with the organization" film style, so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it is warm and fun. And not, Bill Bill Murray is not in Bill Murray's, but he began to expand his debut role. Strangely, however, "fresh young faces" in this film see how many things went on.
