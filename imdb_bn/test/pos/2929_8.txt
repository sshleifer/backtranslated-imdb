This is another great episode from the 11th episode of South Park. <br /> <br /> Cartman has kept the Torrett Syndrome so that he can tell if he does not want to suffer. He is able to swear on other kids in the school. Kyle tells Principal that the cartman is faking it. But, he does not believe it. Chris Hansen Cartman plans to stay in the deadline to talk about Trent Syndrome Live and Sensor. But later, Cartman began to become so addicted that he would be able to tell what he wanted, after which he would start to call an accidental stuff. This was an interesting episode about Cartman Torrett Syndrome. I recommend it to any South Park fan.
