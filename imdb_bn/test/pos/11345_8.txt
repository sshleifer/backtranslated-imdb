In 1962, the Secretary of Hong Kong Chou Maan and his wife, and Secretary Su Li-Jane Chan (Maggie Cheng) and her husband went to an old building together. Each couple only hired a room in the same floor apartment. Their wife and husband are mostly away from home and Chou and Li-Jane have the same habit: They like Kung-Fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes a sort of friendship and platonic and repressed love. Later on they realized that their partner is a matter, Chao loves Leo, but his shyness and the married woman probably suppressed the situation kept her love at level level. 'In Measure For For Love' is a very slow, beautiful, colorful and romantic love story, a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual version. The film was not a screenplay and the actors were never sure that they would shoot. Later, based on the director's footage, his story was edited. When Chu went to Singapore, until 1966, there has been a gap for many years in the story, when its conclusion is deliberately open and not well defined, such as who is the son of Li-Jen?
