I worked as a musician doing the summer stock musical theater when I originally saw this film. If you ever do any work in the theater - especially in the summer stock theater - you really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are a few moments of really bad writing in the film, but overall it is a great tribute to the theater and why people love it.
