I was surprised to see all of the comments hated here. Sure it is not a show for the best kids, but does the public dislike Barney after the fifth grade? <br /> <br /> Everybody hates Barney. All right, I think his voice and song are boring. Well, he's very boring and weird. I am fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Kids? They love this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a little queen of two or three, my parents spent more time doing more than anything else around the house. Nothing could be kept in mind for more than ten minutes. To face it, that's how Toddlers are. Even the most patient can not sit for long enough to break their parents. There's a lot to do and see and explore, to get too much trouble. <br /> <br /> and then came to Bern. I'm not sure of the purple dinosaurs which are very interesting to children, but they definitely love it. I know i have I was hooked on the show, and wanted to see it over over. Yes, my parents' cheats like music have been run, but getting excited by something they can afford to learn their kids and keep their attention, it's valuable. I learned my ABBC and 123's, magic words and brushing your teeth. I raised it by five or six, of course, but at that point at least I was a little more patient, and my parents gave a break. <br /> <br /> My nephew and nephew went through all the Barney stage is growing, their mother is very happy I know what the wind puts in the air. She is entertaining. Of course there are big birds, Arnie and Oscar, and they're very good. But on the children's stage, it seems that more kids like dancers who sing big songs. And that's enough for me.
