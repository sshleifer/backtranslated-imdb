This movie deserves well. The ridiculous wit of Mike Judge many people in this country are trying to light, they are trying to deny ... we are going to be lost like society. <br /> <br /> 24 hours a day can be the nilol coverage? Any evidence? Mike Judge draws a terrific future, where fools survive and improve. You stop and think, and smile. Do you look at the world and do not ask we being dumber? Are we being overtaking by the human trash as well as our own trash? (Beware of Landslide). <br /> <br /> The movie is really fun. I want to tell you more about the plot but I do not want to hide it. <br /> <br /> Why would you release this image with zero promos? What can it be stupid to take already?
