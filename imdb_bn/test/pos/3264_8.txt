Based on its current IMDB ratings and various plot summaries, I did not expect much from 'two hands'. But how I was wrong. <br /> <br /> To start from the beginning, you are deeply indifferent to a continuation that has been unmarried for a while. Even with the view of Maine-n-Scene and cinematography, the director has made a film with great imagination and made it better. If you are looking for a movie that is not only entertaining but exciting, compulsory and really awesome, see the next movie. <br /> <br /> I hope the sad demise of Heath Ledger makes this movie more popular. She was an incredible talent, and her performance would not be missed. Do not make the mistake of judging and canceling this amazing film before you saw it.
