This daffy duck shirt has only one racist joke, which is basically, when Daphne wears black beauty, it is a black woman. I understand a little why this joke was included, at the time when some people did not know how rude it was to be racist and still discrimination in black people was not illegal. <br /> <br /> The point, "A Koi Dico" is basically a fun, interesting short, where Deffi fills the book's character and does things in books. I like this short quite a lot (despite other critics here). Daffy love the clock duck so the path is vaguely annoying, but at the same time extremely entertaining. This is an excellent version of the porky episode, although it was not very important to stay there. How the wolf had thought of wolves in those days, the thirsty, terrible creatures in the blood, which they certainly never did (until they are very hungry). I like the style used in animation - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For those who have called Duffy and who do not think of racist alphabets in cartoons sometimes "A Coy Decoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
