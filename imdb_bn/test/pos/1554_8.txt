I also saw this movie at the film festival, but like the previous poster I found it interesting and original. Shorts often work twice as bad in small budgets and poor performances in the odd terrain, but the AOOLL is a small thriller that focuses on "external limitations". Performance is strong, otherwise nobody will expect from Morse or McGuinley, and the instruction is sharp and on the money. I personally saw the comments of the previous poster that I saw. A.W.O.L. Written by Shane Black, who usually in this case, decorate the story with the story decorations provide sensitivity and simultaneously look at the audience and do not take yourself too seriously. All A.W.O.L. It is proven to be a very well executed and funny film.
