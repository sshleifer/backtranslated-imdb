Number is not false, 109 voted for this picture. At the end of the 20th century, it is a big deal about the position of one of the most captivating insights junkies. And for those who know about the work of Bill Hicks, who were alive today, imagine what she wants to say about the boy's president? His little career has finally disappeared from a tragic situation and why this film, or rather, explains why these two films. First of all, you see how clear his talent was from the beginning, who knew Bill Hicks, would always say that he was not funny, he was also unique. The film also shows how challenging his material was for him in the entertainment industry. Her drink also contributes to her professional problems, but this film is not clear. And then a complete performance of the second film. If you have never heard Bill Hicks at all, it's a wonderful role for the person and his dark but intelligent humor. Especially because of these issues about 14 years old, the fact remains until now that the event took place under the first President Bush. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Makes up. Let's make sure that nothing is very provocative, nothing will be very interesting and the result? Well, as man said to himself, America will go to sleep, your government will be under control ... in his life, at least in the UK the artist was recognized for his talent and succeeded there. After 11 years of death, 109 people in IMDB could say something about this movie. After you both of them meet, I hope you understand why more people will listen to Bill Hicks.
