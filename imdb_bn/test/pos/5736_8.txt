27 years ago a horrific genocide was performed fun and pretty for a night where six teenagers go to an old remote abandoned school. Instead, the children were harmed by dangerous vicious protector guards (especially the Spanish horror Icon Paul Dash, who played the greatest horrific danger) who had committed the cruel assassination. Director Carlos Gill is related to the playful story at an acute speed and does a perfect job of creating a compulsively surprising and mysterious atmosphere. Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgerce's scathing script provide a clever and inspiring blend of great and supernatural elements, which makes the audience guess too late. Fernando Arbibus's stylish film uses light and shadow specialists. David San Jose's Moody score makes a similar joke. Interesting and striking young actors all contribute to the vibrant and engaging performance, especially Carlos Fuenteses as Colin Ramon, Olivia Molina, Fearful Maria, Joe Berettua, the overwhelming Joker Jordy and Carmen Morales as Spaniard Goth Cook Sandra. The set pieces of assassination are bloody and barbarous as they should be as each bit. The horrible whammy of a wonderful dark end. A tough and satisfied shocker.
