OK, so it's set for POP fiction, but in my opinion it's mainly video-video direction style, sketch-like descriptions and its own voice and identity due to great performance. Thomas Jane delivers a great deal (drug-dealer show-off is great), as well as Haroon Ickart. There is a brief and brilliant appearance of James LeGrose - great humor- "They got one house" The scene of Porschekova interrogation and rape is memorable, as Mikey Rouke has played - "go to the top" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Take a peak, it's worth it.
