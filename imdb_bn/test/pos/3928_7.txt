I do not think this film will give less ratings which will be mostly given to it. It's one of the best "teenage" horror films I've ever seen; And that's saying a lot. There is nothing left behind without any explanation, characters and intrigue have broken down the countless horror film's stratipoats and it does not have anything to do with other horrible pieces recently submitted to us. (A clear example is "psych angle" psychological.) In the first 30-40 minutes, exceptions can be annoying with exceptions, although some small light errors are easily visible. After the arrival of the village, horror-a different, cyclone type of horror starts. <br /> <br /> With the plot and details, the cave is not small; Characters are the most powerful point of this movie, many of them have been broken down. For example, two main male characters of Nick and Wade are not stupid in any way; Although Dalton may be better fit in this stereootype, he does not pay only for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are genuinely horrible, all made for the span of time around the film. And, ultimately, even though everything is decorated, it's easy to see that it will not be so easy for living characters. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I can see, and which does not mean continuity (ie, curly without finding your own cut finger in the pocket of IE, unknown bro) is the illumination which is annoying in the first 30 minutes annoying. Although, there is nothing in the little village, though plot and influential, although everything is too big and increasingly reaching Ambrosia with the arrival of the main character, so I will give it. It was mostly argued that around 70% of the film was unreasonable. "How can two waxes build a whole house?", "Where do they get all the wax from?". If people give more attention to the film then these questions will not be rebellious. Sinclair brothers did not create the House of Wax. Their mother worked to create real wax figures, and they were displayed in the museum. And Paris Hilton's Unfortunate Character Where the Second Question to Meet Incomplete Death Is The Answer; What do the dead people do with all personal items (mobile phones, cars, clothes)? Using their third brother as a link with outside, it is quite controversial that Sinclair couples get the necessary money to buy wax in WWII-type fashion. <br /> <br /> So, beside that, I I think the movie is worth more than that, and no one can lose the chance to see it. So watch wax house. OK
