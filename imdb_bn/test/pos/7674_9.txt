I was given the 5th grade lonely "Gardens" for our spring Qur'an concert. Since that time, I was grateful for Garcin's music. I love these opera haunting melodies in gershwin. Back when I was 5th grade (about 10 years old), I love doing LP practice and love very soundtracks. I recommend watching this movie and if you can get the soundtrack, get it - you can sometimes find it in ebay - an old, used LP. I tried to find out the soundtrack on the CD and searched and searched. These songs contain wonderful musical instruments and I will really keep it in CDs for purchase and they wish to retain the film and keep it in DVD. This is really a great job that I think will enjoy current and future generations and will be benefitted. Some movies may seem slow and dust, but I find it quite the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge have dubbed the musical voice, I think the face of the voice and personality is good. A person's voice and singer voice may be quite different. Porgy and Bess, and songs in this opera, will always have a special meaning for me.
