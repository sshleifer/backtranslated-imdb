The story of five Muffy boys (most notably Shane Austin, Will Wheaton, and Keith Coogan) tried to save the school from a terrorist attack after imprisoning the leader's father. Lou Gosset plays the headmaster of junior school, is a serious guy who tries to express the feelings of discipline to his students. <br /> <br /> 'Toy Soldiers' is a fun and beautiful cool action, and of course good hostage-crisis-in-school movies. I think most appeals come from teenagers, but terrorists do not come in vain, and in some movies they do not seem to be a terrifying group. This is a very challenging challenge for the group planning the preservation of these schools, trapping in the boarding school, and threatening to kill military or police intervention. They are really cute, too. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it was a beautiful movie. It keeps a steady pace and gets ridiculous or does not get anything like that. Astin and Gosset Junior give good performance. <br /> <br /> I agree that this is an underrated action movie.
