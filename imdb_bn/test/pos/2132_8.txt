Although the movie is so hateful I really liked this movie and I think it was better after the defeat, which was lost. Both of these movies and the year of the dragon are very partial, although I can see why nobody likes this movie. The film is too long for three and a half hours and the second half of the film is much better than the first half. Chris Christopherson and Christopher Wacken are fighting against Hupper in Isabel but he can not think of his mind with any one. Sam Waterstein is the villain who has given the list of 125 people to kill, who say they are anarchists and thieves. Jeff Bridges, Brad Derrief and a young Mickey Roche also have a great cast.
