The era of Vietnam War was long before my time, but it has always been interested in me and I have seen many movies about it. All I have seen to face in the forefront of the war. When I read a description of "War Ant Home", then I think the idea is provocative. A Vietnam War Film I talked about what would happen to the soldiers when the war ended. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> I set the remote and settled it back to watch it. I did not move to my seat during the whole two hours; This is a movie which is very interested in you because there is no way to predict what will happen in the future. <br /> <br /> This movie made me a huge fan of Emilio Esteve. I enjoyed him as Billy the Kid in the film "Young Guns", but he never saw anything he did next. Emilio proved to be very gifted as well as writing and managing. <br /> <br /> The movie pensing is done very well. I feel pressed hard to find a point where it drags. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it did not get any real recognition after the Oscars came or come. Parents are trying to deal with a dramatic story that is not their son, who was not he, and perhaps they will never remember him. The price is definitely worth seeing.
