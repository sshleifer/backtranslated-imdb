I say that this movie has been produced nicely and it is the top rated rating as a general scientific film! I've enjoyed it .. It's a scientific film, if you want to see a thriller, another channel .. this is what scifi lovers want. Well produced by Saifayee's best producer Scott Scand vandover! OK special effect was not nice, but what a great cast! Some of the money can be used for impact, but then what are the high budget effects of science? If you do not like these movies, change the channel and change the channel. Movies like Mission Impossio and Bravieve are great but these are not movie movies. Saifty Subertot, Alien Hunter, etc. made excellent films. Well done ... keep them slow!
