Very well adapted to the screen and highly trusted for the timing of the Merry Web, this movie is truly the best composition. Especially talented rising star, led by a generator maker and one or two established actors, the film uses most commonly known names. Yet the play was more believable for him. Social and personal tension is almost realistic and I felt that Caste responded to each other's character, even though they did in real life. I saw that a commentator Janet Macteier had a bone-lips, and the proof of his characterization was so good. This is shown on television when it is shown first, it is tapped, then the tape is sadly lost afterwards. But it remains as clear as some of my mind. If you have any affection for the social age, but it must be fully seen.
