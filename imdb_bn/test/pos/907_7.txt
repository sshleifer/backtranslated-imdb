This is one of the L and H shorts which are often referred to as the first "real" L & H timings and perhaps one of their best mood features. J. Piedmont Mammoththander (Oli) is a millionaire who came to greet his nephew Philip, whom he had never seen. Firstly Oli is laughing with these strange people and when he takes treatment during his medical examination, he draws attention to himself, but when it appears that it is a companion that he is supposed to be, salute. He said that Philip is a good boy, but he has a weakness - there are women. Mumblethunder and Philipp stop going home, but their journey is constantly chasing after the woman, when each woman breaks into a small dance each time when she sees a woman. The huge crowd is involved in this incident, because he is not following Scratch, because Philip himself is wearing a skirt (a cint). Eventually, for the right wing of Mumbler's pants, Philip managed to drag Philip to a doorstep, but Philip ran away to follow more scratches. There are lots of almost all laughs. It looks good to look very young because guys are not exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is quite a lot of her usual character, but Stan is so happy to see her normal person acting differently from child's character. It shows that he was not one of Tony simultaneously and he excelled in other roles when he got the opportunity. With a run of 19 minutes, the small and sweet, classic fishing provider still stays with me.
