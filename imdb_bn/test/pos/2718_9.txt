In this way I explained the movie: The first thing. There was not a single scene in the movie where you see the bad guy (Taylor) tortured or pushed Ben's hand toward the wall. However, the same gals can not be called. Finally, you see Taylor going disappearing. Looks like the message was "no Taylor." And the whole movie was a figment of Ben imagination. Also, there were no scenes in torture moments where a cheek was confronted or in the same frame as Ben. It was always Taylor. But in reality, Taylor was Ben. If they were two different people, then why are both shown in one frame in horrible times? But before that, you see them both together, and that bud only uses Ben's imagination. Also, when Ben leaves the prison, the text on the screen clearly states that Ben's story was unreal and he did not have any place as he explained (refer to mine, car, etc.). Lean Hunter went back to Christian after returning to Ben, find him, he could not find him. Why ??? Because Ben (Taylor) is finding out for gals. Instead, Christie Taylor (Ben) is in the world to test web cams, photos etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Taylor Was Ben So, the result was Ben Schizophrenic and the movie where you saw him and Taylor was in one frame, there was nothing but the imagination of his imagination. Otherwise if there was really a Taylor, then they should find out all the detailed explanations come from Ben.
