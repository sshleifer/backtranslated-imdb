When I was a kid, I caught this event a few times and it was shaking, my parents liked it, and now I think what they think of syndication. This show did not have original limits and evening zones (new and old). This show used some old ideas and some really original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe Jonathan Glasner and Brad Wright did the job. Those guys were the stargate sg-1 producer. The show kept the entrenched visitors in viewers and set up a really scary environment. This new evening zone was not there. Coming up in the road serling impetuosity, the mood of the forest is coming to light. <br /> <br /> The end of whether made good or bad for a terrific time. You can predict what's going to happen. I'm still trying to find out the season on the DVD.
