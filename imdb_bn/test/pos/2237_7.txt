I grabbed this movie on TV late night, and a low budget campus "Masterpiece" hoped I was surprised with a beautiful movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting ability (or am I short for her?) Will make her perfect as Android, and other actors, though very low, are not at least terrible. <br /> <br /> has a plot; In this, they will have to continue their illegal romance by mixing a rough plot, imagination and a long-awaited couple (a human, an Android) and an "big brother" combination and Android assassination. Production and set, also, was much better than I expected. I did not see the original cyber, so I really can not compare it differently; This image has been given a Blade Runner, but as a late night, the future is guilty pleasure, it's worth a watch.
