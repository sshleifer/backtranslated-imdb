It was a fast-paced recreational film in the early 1930s. When you lead James Cagney, these "pre-code" films are even better: just watch fun stuff. Generally, when movies are "dated", it is a negative but not with movies from 1930-1934. Yes, taunts and attitudes, dresses, hairstyles, etc., they are dated but it's a big part of fun. These films have an edge to them that are almost always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a fascination which is interesting and interesting. You see people - like the little criminals described in this film and their parents - which you do not see in a while, but this is one (primary '30s). At the beginning of this movie, the children go to the judge and you sit and laugh at these crazy characters that appear on court from their children. Yes, we can get the Italian father of stereototypical; Jewish father; All Anglo-Saxon mothers and some mothers, who claim dramatically, claim "a good boy". Although things are predictable in some cases, you do not feel anything about it because everyone here is so much fun to see. <br /> <br /> It teaches you that 75 years ago the children were raped, stealing, robbery, mugging, falsely, the condition of the human being. This film isolated the theory that "people came back in the old days." No, people have always been bad or good. Degree was helped by their environment, parents, financial status and other things. Here, we've got a bunch of "Dead End" kids who are going to school in Reform. <br /> <br /> Immediately acting like angels after running a school of children's reforms in a ridiculous and silly story; A man was not punished for falling into his death and to burn the institute (Explanation: He is a medieval and it deserves .for real justice and reform); And shooting a guy bit of "Patsy" is not even questioned by the police because he is the good guy! Observe the subtle anti-religious excavation which only shows the prayer of the evil "Warden." Any accidents, no accidents. Since the code has been generated in the late 60s, the negative code-related things are going on and the first 30's of pre-coded <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Digges, the way, "Mr. Thompson" outstanding in his "bad guy" role. I was particularly effective in his voice and in the adaptation of the Charles Dickens film, I could play an equally evil role like the boss of the organization. Cagney played his normal role, the Tech-n-Goaf tough man who got the pretty girl, "Dorothy Griffith", played Maj Blake. Frankie Darrow was effective as the leader of the boys, "Jimmy Smith." Only Dario's face shows his character credible. He is a real movie star, but I'm still going to Cagan. The rest of the reform reform schools were not very believable and they were actually ethnic stereotype, but they were fun to see. <br /> <br /> I think the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes we saw how bad these kids were and after the arrest of the children, the good and the bad and stereotypical parents saw in the court. Those scenes are the last days of the 1930s Dead Child's stuff purified. They always show children's bad news at the beginning of the film, but after the story ended, they all started acting like Wali and Beaver Clive - rarely "criminals". It is very remote but it works, according to entertainment. <br /> <br /> Overall, a hockey but very entertaining movie, especially Cagney Films and the first of the 30's. Almost everyone rated at least eight stars for their entertainment value.
