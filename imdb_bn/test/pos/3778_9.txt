This picture was in three composers, which was later joined by Chapin's compilation, which was released under the title "The Chaplin Review" in the theater of the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> It was a strange movie in any other way. Later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movie emphasized peace and brotherhood. Conversely, this promotion is a promotional comedy promoted to strengthen the American effort of WWI. It's really impossible to see Charlie as a "super soldier", who has captured 13 German singles, some Germans suddenly and quietly shoots few Germans in perfect seconds, and then goes behind the enemy line to try to catch Kaiser himself! Indeed, it was a major departure for the Little Tramp, although it was very fun and funny at the same time. The film was created very well, well made and I definitely did a lot for our soldiers' support for the soldiers (very bad it was so meaningless and costly battles).
