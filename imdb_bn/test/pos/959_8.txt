Well it could be a baby movie ... Probably I'm not allowing my kids to show 9! So, who said this is a little movie?!, I admit it to the teenage movie .. So, after returning to the movie, the boy can speak very well .. So good that nobody does not speak truth or false. However, this is a wonderful movie to play on a nice screen, I vote 8 games for the screen and the story ... I think they have sent a little lesson to the author ... "The truth never ends".
