My dad has worked with the top secret information in the DIA and he mentioned this movie to me. When I was a child, I always used to ask him if he concealed and he recommended this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually 2, almost completely different friends! A tangle they did not really know what would happen. Snowman, Dalton really cracked me up because the film portrayed him as just a few drug moles, which he did not know about, and the film seems to have made him the worst. Falcon, Chris is just a man who wanted to express his feelings to the US government in a very reasonable view. <br /> <br /> For movie lovers, it must be seen !!!
