Trilogies are very interesting Some people go out with a bang (ring of lord), some slowly get weak (matrix), some obscurity (blade, futures to futures) are lost, but maintains some talents, which can be seen in bright light. Flawless floats beyond the outer surface. Case and Point: "Three Color Trilogy". Quarterly this chapter, the last one being, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In "blue" we had a more visually shiny, more character-driven plot, in "White" it was more than a light-hearted, fictional story where we talked about anything from the characters. "Red," but focused on what "what" and "how come". It questions our own destiny and focuses on past and future rather than the present. <br /> <br /> This section is a small model that runs on a dog and brings it to its owner. He soon learned that the dog owner is actually a senior retired judge who spies on his neighbors phones who call through advanced espionage. Three triangle films have a very basic plot line, but the story brings a lot more. Consider the "Blue" story of a woman related to the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly showing ideas about contemporary French society and how the character's behavior reflects. "Red" is not only a young man who finds shelter in old age, but also about opportunities, hope and fate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The old man (Jean-Louis Trinigent), whom we could never find the name, is very self-centered and hateful. According to self-reflection analysis and the objectives of his cruelty, he learns that the judge will be the right person for him, if he is only shortened at the age of 40. Irene lives on a small judge, Junior, who is like an old man. This is "what if" that movie keeps the chakravarti. What would happen if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man has his perfect match. But the young judge actually matches his perfect, if he corresponds with the old one. Valentine does not know it, just me, and it recommends in almost every frame of the Kryststef Kisłowowski Irene. We are facing his presence, Often the advice about the fate of Irin. <br /> <br /> I mention that there is no reason for the old man. That reason is very symbolic for the overall theme of the story. We compared the older judges in August (Gene-Pierre Lorrett) to smaller judges. We know that the old man once loved him but he went away. In another scenario, we see August as heartwarming because the love of his life goes away with other people. There is a constant reminder that Valentine will never fill this person. Although they cross each other without aiming at each other. There is also a statue of the telephone, it is a way for Valentin to exist and to update his life, in August it leads to its heartbeat and goes to the old man. These three elements serve the character's own psychology shadows. This is a key statement of what they and they do. <br /> <br /> All three "color" films stand for a specific policy, which is the most common in France. "Blue" stands for Liberty (personal person), "white" parity (being accepted by multiple) and "red" Brotherhood (to learn socialization). And although this final chapter is a clear focus on the Brotherhood's policy, Kisłowsky has confirmed that he has brought two other additions to connecting the other three stories. For example, we try to get the old man to reach out to Valentin and illuminate it with his spy equipment, which is a reflection of the principle of equality. We finally see that Valentine is searching some souls and he is more concerned about himself than others (not taking a phone while calling Michael), a clear example of Liberty. And when established with three principles, Keselovsky combines all the characters nicely into the final and most heartening scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most scary triangle is the final chapter ever made, both of these film directives and stories barrier barriers. This is not just our modern life, but in our modern times where and where life should be. And even though the movie is more subtle than both "blue" and "white", it boldly expresses a statement of love and compassion. It is difficult to imagine that "red" was the last film of Kislovski and he died at such a young age. Despite this, Trilogy will always be the best of her works and we will always remember her work, which is considered to be an outstanding director with Bergman, Fellini, and Wonders, who has never been awarded with the Oscars. Kieslowski, you missed!
