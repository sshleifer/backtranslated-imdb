Even with all the movies in Vietnam's war (Hacker Ladder, Hero Hunter, Apocalypto, Taxi Driver etc), I do not even know half of what happened. Even horror thoughts seem inhumane. And a progress - or a retreat? - The inhalation that is needed is now an important part of the AppLipes, one of Coppola's greatest and most important films ever made. Based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 classic, "Heart of Darkness", which is the history of corruption and moral corruption that comes from the distance of civilization - it is the patronage of a divine nature, such as the Laws of Flies - it brings Vietnam a physical and emotional journey. In view of his first visit to Vietnam, the story of General Willard, which operates a special operation in Cambodia, is presented. At the beginning of the film, stuck in the wild sigon, mentally unable to return home - the deer hunter nici wakes up loudly So he contacted: his killing killed Green Berett, who wasted himself in a remote building in the Noon River, and who has become completely insane - worshiped like a god by the locals and killed indiscriminately. The name of this person was by Carl Cartes, starring Marlon Brando in his second career role (Best Starley named Disney's Stanley Koalski). Willard flew into the armies with the army of some soldiers, afraid of his fear and madness became a witness, and there was a lot of obscurity - even before he met Kartez, he had sincere sympathy and identification. By the time they do, cartage methods do not seem to be wrong or as they should, and they certainly do not seem to be very unusual or outside the place. Apocalypse - A place beyond morality, wide at the end of the world. Loss of civilization, loss of judgment, self Cartage's solidarity with Green Bear interview and his next published title is one of the coolest and most discreet lectures in film history. The film is about the trauma of the human soul and its fragile point, here it is like Diary Hunter and better than that. However, the apocalypse borders the global level that can tolerate - a growing view of helicopters in the humid, dirty forests and flood blasts between forests and an orange sky - a weirdly sound doorstrack - as well as a village exploded from Wagner's Speaker and a river Cooler scenes along with air raids (a view that is the most Itala, garhabhabe ridiculous, and oddly like the scene of uninterrupted war has gone down) - it all contributes to a feeling of mystery - the end of the world - and in some remote place in the future, but for Apocalypse Now and forever. The Deer Hunter is even more intimate and personal, you can also say by title and the overall impact of injury affects the individual mentality, the demise of the human soul and it has the power to completely surrender to the power of darkness. , Or long on. That is why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing. In "the heart of the darkness", Cartesi is shown as a conflict between morality (civilization) and its inner barbarism. The Apocalypse Now, Kurtz has left all the conflicts behind. He is better and evil is overcome. Due to morality like man, he can save his hands in the moment before his death. Cartes are actually waiting for death, T. S. Elliott has quoted himself in his temple, lost in the jungle. His last words, and the end of the movie is the opposite of the words, "horror ... horror." He mentions the infinite void of existence, the dark blackness of man's psychology and his own mind, where oppression is born again. It is impossible to publish the word, which is experienced by watching this movie - Experience, in a nutshell, that the winner gets experience on his journey. In comparison to the scene of the striker Hunter's brother's view, in fact, the same piece, the last part in the courtyard, the one I saw is one of the deepest, quietly and seductive boring things.
