Contrary to comments posted directly below, The Big Trill (1930) was not featured in the process of three cameras "like zero serum". "It's the last, completely different movie of Napoleon (1927)! The Big Trilogy was shot simultaneously in the 35mm and 70mm (grandeur) editions, and both versions have been shown from time to time in the FOX movie channel, so it's easy to compare each other. Version (Approximate @ in Letterbox broadcasted at its original 2-1 ratio) with its wide angular panoramas more than cinematic Shi is impressive, but it is suffering from the same problem surrounding the first contemporary cinemas, because focus is due to the lack of close closures on Raou Walsh. People involved in crowds instead of crowds or longer shots are more effective in the standard version because the camera is more involved with the audience. Seeing two versions simultaneously, the mother of the shot Walsh The decision to stop the knock's version gives the correct idea, but it is not possible in the version of the Grandi: El Bredel has a couple sequence: a shell game with Ian Keith, and some business with his wife and Jacques, which is in the version of the Graduate, but the standard version Missing from. <br /> <br /> Record, The Big Trill is one of the three Fox Grandior movies that survived in its original Wide Screen format. (The other two are Fox Movieton Foley of 1929, a Lost and Happy Day, which only survive in standard format.) Other studios also experiment with the expansive film at this time, but the only other whispers still available in both formats are 65mm and 35mm Impressed in, and released by united artists. Other broad films were MGM's Billy the Kid (1930) and The Great Mado (1931), RCO's Danger Lights (1930), and WB's The Lash (1930), all of which can be seen in standard format versions of Turner Classic Movies. WB's Kissmate (1930) also seems to have been extensive and both filming on the map, but has disappeared completely; It's annoying to lose. <br /> <br /> Why did the massive film fail in 1930? Theater was circulating with effect to the effect of the stock market crash of October 1929 and the cost of installation of sound equipment (for payment), and therefore there was adverse reactions to the extra cost of installing new projection equipment and to accommodate the new wide screen. Just a handful of films, photography in different systems that were not even compatible with each other. It will not be until 1953, when Fox, Twenty-one Century-Fox, will now try again, and this time it will be successful with the launch of the movie screen.
