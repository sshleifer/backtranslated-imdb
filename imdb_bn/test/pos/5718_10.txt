These were very energetic and well-played shows. I saw it 98 and my friends back and I still joked about it. Every time I see it as always as fun as it is first. I love the way that ways can relate to it in their own way. I look forward to seeing more of John's own script and productions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I can not find it anywhere for sale, and I've searched a lot. If someone tells me about a website or store, I would be very grateful to him because I am also looking for his other live performances. If you have any information about this please send me a message. Thank you.
