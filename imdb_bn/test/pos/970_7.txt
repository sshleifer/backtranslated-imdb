SPOILER alert <br /> <br /> We all heard the legend "Boy Who Wried Wolf". But what if the modern world was a wolf. Well it could be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Shepard ("Middle Malcolm" from Frankie Muniz) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. One day he was pressed for writing in English, but the lazy filmmaker Marty Ullfitt (Paul Jemytti) is blowing in the air, who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. Nobody believes Jason when he once told the truth and ended up in the summer school. However, Jason is determined to prove his parents and to travel to LA with his friend Kailly (Amanda Bains). When Wolf refused to accept that he had closed his story, Jason Wolf planned to live the life. B.F.L. It's a great way to spend no time but spend your 90 minutes. I wish they could have made a lot more, and although they are quite cute (although I like pool-die) there is not much surprise. If I do not have Paul Giamatti, then I did not like what I did. She is simply delightful of this. If you have to try it 90 minutes to kill it. You can just enjoy it.
