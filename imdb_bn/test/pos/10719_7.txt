I saw this movie in 3 different events. For the first time, this movie was bowled over me. It appeared to me as a very great movie. I hate this picture as a sensitive garb on my second viewing. Anyway, seeing my third, I firmly believe that this is a good movie. The film has a lot of mental strength, especially the scenes of mental conflict between Mr. Crumar and Madame Cramer. Here are some scenes that appear as a cruel man to the Marilyn Strip, though he is a beauty of real life. Dustin Hoffman is unable to get involved with the recent work of his child custody as a lost hero. Setting this film was even a debate. Master Cameraman According to Nestor Almendros, a shot which escaped like a cricketer's character, decided to break a glass firmly to show the intensity of his anger. Unfortunately, nothing happened to Nestor. Cromar v. Krramer shows the destruction of a family structure. It also says how to maintain sweets if kids are involved.
