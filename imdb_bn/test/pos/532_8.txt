I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" did not judge any of the talent (and illogical authority) of Natalie Portman. She was completely unused like Queen Emdala, and when she was used, her makeup was terribly terrible. "Anywhere but here," he drives his angel-awful makeup and he usually works. And she just can not do good, she looks good. I'm a little older than he (he's only 18), and I have little or no chance to meet him, but hey, a man has been allowed to dream, okay? <br /> <br /> Although Susan Sarandon is a good turn in this film, the film is completely contained in Portman. I was an observer of Portman from "beautiful girls" (where he was small, but just as cute). There's something big for him in the future - I can see it.
