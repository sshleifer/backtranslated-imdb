China White (1989) Ronnie Yue's first international film. This UK / Holland / Hong Kong production was shot in English and was slightly edited for Western audiences. The American Wang Brothers (Michael and Russell) wanted to act together in the movie, but the other Western actor Steven Leigh took his place, because of the previous commitment was unavailable. A number of Hong Kong stars such as Tommy Wang (playing a mute) and always obscure William Hooy along with the director also appear at an interesting camio spot. <br /> <br /> Chao brothers are in Holland to run a family business. . They want to get the family business to be valid but other Asian gangs do not want them to be "foreigners", as a means to save face and want to see that they want to earn money in the old fashioned way. Others smuggler drugs and want to do new business without doing it. When Chaw was shot dead in cold blood, the brothers could take their steps against the family not staying with them. Can the Chaw family kill the family each other, or can the streets of Holland lead to blood flow to solitude and gangsters? <br /> <br /> A highly underrated movie. I was surprised by how well it was. I did not see the Hong Kong edition. That would be a huge treat for me. It is long and involved in the production of many Star Movies in Hong Kong. Very bad this image is not available on DVD. The video print that I saw was washed and the sound reproduction was not that great. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film takes place before decriminalization. Medicines <br /> <br /> Holland
