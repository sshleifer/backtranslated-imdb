I saw this photo at the 19th SPP 2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Beagle is just a few small flashbacks, the whole thing about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1855, when he became Kent with his growing family, when 200+ pages of Origin were drafted and whether he had completed this book Thinking. <br /> <br /> This script is based on Randall Kennes' book Ants Box (Annie, the daughter of Charles, when he died at the age of 10). This is mostly family drama, but includes sex scenes - but the participants are both on screen and closed. Not too exciting, not a lot of science but a well-made movie that shocked beautiful and correct mental buttons to look at. A bit of a romantic nasty, actually. I suppose that you can be an unbelieving free thinking scientist from an atheist family background and may still be as a mental romantic and a wonderful parent. <br /> <br /> Some letters and Darwin himself said that he "killed God", but whether the audience is in doubt. The deadly struggle for survival and the predominant web under the ground (well-known and completely controversial before Darwin) and the failure of Darwin's prayers is beyond doubt, the idea of ​​a kind of goddess that "his" creatures remained steady. <br /> <br /> I really do not object to many Americans. There may be issues with some titles, which is probably the most controversial subject of film, or there is no horn, tail and pitchfork in Batman.
