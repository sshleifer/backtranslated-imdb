Tea sands were shown in Washington (DC) on April 15, 2005. Director, Rituparno Ghosh, gave a brief introduction and then to answer the question. <br /> <br /> always, I think richness is a fantastic job. I understand that those who think that they should be more aggressive or more malicious, but will that be really realistic? Possible, perhaps; Realistic, I'm not so sure. I think his explanation was valid, although it certainly could be another way of doing this. <br /> <br /> I hate to use this term, but as far as I've seen it was the most "accessible" of Indian films. . I know a fair amount of Indian history, Hinduism etc, but the details here are far away from me. If you were obviously familiar with Hinduism and its customs, esp, then there are many good understanding about movies. They were in C 1904. I miss a lot - one of them is mother-in-law, want to decorate her daughter Ashalata as a counter weight. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * There was a lot to announce that the movie was better explained to me. First, the original Bangla version was 20+ minutes more. So what was left? Apparently three main topics: An initial segment where Binodini (Aishwarya) is in Kolkata. Leave the Bengalis. According to the director, different characters. Bangabandhu v e. Speaking Bengali language - later set up some political comments. Of course these are lost in the Hindi version, and of course a non-Indian like me, it would not have been fit in any way - but there would be a set up to ensure the Bengali situation. Later, there was a segment where Benoni Din wrote a poem - a sign of his independence, etc. Finally, more business about jewelery. So, although some people think that it was too long, I think the original, longer version has become more clear. <br /> <br /> Women's hair is apparently another sign (Ghosh again) - Mother-in-law was short hair (Hindu widow had little hair), her sister too - there was a widow - her hair was more (more modern!), of course Binodini / Aishwarya was a long waist-length hair (the state of the widow's rejection). <br /> <br /> At the end, I threw me - suddenly Binodini, who never used to think political, is writing a political declaration? Oops! Ghosh said that he was on a film festival in Lonaro, when the subtitles were completed. Subtitles use the word "country" in the encyclopedia Binodini letter. Gosh also said, a more appropriate word (I will forget his exact words) - something like "self" or "freedom" - he was speaking about his own independence and "found himself" - not about Bangla, India and British. . Then why Bimonadi disappears after finding Bihari again? Obviously, because while living in the Ganges, he realized that he did not have to define / complete a human being. She could just be herself. So he rejected Bihari, he threw himself a few months ago, and just left. Of course I'm not sure why he is buying his next meal, but this is another question. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm 100% sure why he keeps shawl on the dead woman, but she is probably refusing to emotions / revolution ? Binodini which is used throughout the film (see Mahendra and Ashalata, in the Ganges boat etc.). It has been done to see what he wants for a life, but can not. To the end (I miss it!) She leaves the table on the telephone with a letter, showing that she does not need any more - she is leading her own life. Finally, Rabindranath Tagore quoted at the beginning, how he apologized for the completion ... apparently wrote Rabindranath Tagore as a serial, pushing his readers with sexy widows bit. But in the end he sold to conscientiousness and destroyed the Binodini, at the feet of Mahendra and Bihari, praying for their forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote Tagore to exploit him for the end of his sale ... and Tagore apologized for the end with his answer. In the film, of course, Ghosh goes from the other side.
