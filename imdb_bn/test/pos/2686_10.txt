This show is brilliant! I started seeing in 2007, and never before heard of it. After one episode, I was hooked. I'm never home to see it, so my wife bought me a whole series of DVDs. Non-stop laugh, I need to say more? I was still on TV because it is certainly worth it and most of the shit is currently on TV. <br /> <br /> I want them to make a movie, seriously, who can not see it. . Kevin James's name alone will bring a huge fanbase in a movie, the guy is funny (striking your stomach) <br /> <br /> Trustworthy show just under the earth. If you get the chance to buy it in DVD, do it, its worth it.
