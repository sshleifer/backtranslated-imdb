I do not expect much of this movie, except for B movie Gore Fest. Thankfully, I was presented in a very well made film, that managed to build mystery and maintain it throughout run runs managed it. It was an impressive achievement. The acting was firm, you care about and made that character related; And although the film might find it slowly, it forces you to think about what to do in the same situation. This added some fine camera work was done and the director pulled it all together pretty much. After a great endeavor, if you like the development and mystery on Gore, it's worth your time.
