Dan was part of, the show took a shot on them and in the "Danes umbrella" episode CBC covered the coal. <br /> <br /> When Dan says that CBC would never waste the taxpayers' money on the ineffective business, Rocko entered the room and Ryan ramph returned his tapes on Friday night with Benmargue, the show was a flow and this man would not be fun Until they knew the history of CBC that people do not see the good show that they watch.
