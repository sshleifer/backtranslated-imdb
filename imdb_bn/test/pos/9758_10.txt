I can not believe this story on TV for the first 25 years. I remember it was touching a lot and was lucky to get VHS tape many years ago. I did not watch it again until recently. Since I've never seen it since. I saw it 10 times in the last two weeks. Acting is fantastic, the story is compulsory, and I am surprised that I do not appreciate the talent of actor Brian Brown. The shiny facial expression shown in the first half - when he gave Jaya a stolen medication, in contrast with his very reserved and nervous body languages ​​stored in half of his body: his first water and residence trip in Kainesia. We have to wait until the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene to see its open show for the gene. The same dance scenes first express their appreciation in Malaya. Who does not want to be her Mrs. Baugh? <br /> <br /> <br /> Joe changed rather than light, which is bigger than the life of the forest in Mala, some self-aware average jockey behind his own house, the gene took the opposite road; His wartime experience seems to have given him new confidence. He wasted no time and went after what he wanted. He took steps to accept what he could achieve - just as Joe told him one day. <br /> <br /> For me, all of these transitions show that it is more than just a love story - this is a story about life's growth, courage and flexibility. Solicitor-Noyle is both a sweet and sad picture. He also gave a lot to the jinn - he gave his last hope for love. In the end, he had achieved true love - he expressed his happiness more than his happiness. <br /> <br /> I like to fight between Joe and Gene in the book. I think this is a suitable and necessary addition to help in the patronage of internal struggles to deal with both of them for making them possible together. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm old, probably I realize life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised, b. There are blue eyes in the promotional picture shown on Brown's site. He certainly did not do anything like "A city like Alice". Well, 25 years long time!
