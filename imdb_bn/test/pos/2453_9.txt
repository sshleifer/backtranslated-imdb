It's a little watched antitrust movie which was ignored for very long time. The Thanksgiving of 1972 This place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas The oldest boy returned from Vietnam and behind him was a bad time for revenge. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. I can not really say that when I'm very excited I say that this is a heart-warming war film that I saw. The interesting thing is that there are only a few sequences of war on the whole movie. Most of the stories come in a house within a few days. But the war that took place in this house is as intense as the real battlefield. The movie does something that is difficult to achieve; However, Estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the entire Vietnam experience. And considering the similarity between the current invasion of Vietnam and Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does an excellent job with material. She gets a lot of help from a hand picked cast. Especially Martin Shane and Kathy Butts are fantastic like parents. A truly moving film. Highly recommended
