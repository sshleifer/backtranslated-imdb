This little flick is memorable for a number of movies, but it also manages to keep its own style and mood. Remember the "troll" and "do not be afraid of darkness". Suspense builders were good, and just beyond the PG line from G. I especially liked non-cliche choices with parents; In other movies, I could have predicted conversation conversations, but the film was a better choice. If you want a movie you do not want in the movie then gives you some cool, it's a great choice.
