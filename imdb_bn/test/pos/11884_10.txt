Why is Shaw Brothers among the best directors (probably the best in Kungfu class) why this film is a classic example. The film is very good, the story is nice and interesting, and when the humor may not be in your mouth, it is dull in character interactions. Once the story grew, and the character began to assess the situation, the whole tower was combined in the best war scenes (Tiger, Crane and Crab Hong Gare are very present). In the 18th century western social programs, there is a scene that can be wrecked and ending with a tricky and entertaining battle. The film ends with Chesie's moment, but if you have a fan of Shaw Brothers, you'll understand that the cheese is not just a top and a major movie course.
