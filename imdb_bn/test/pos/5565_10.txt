I want to tell you that I was a fan of Star Trek TNA, because I was a child. Well, some days ago I had a friend of some of my DS9 episode and I asked him <br /> <br /> "Hey Man, what have you seen lately because I've seen all the TNG episodes". "Well, I've got these episodes in Persian". I said, "OK, try it" I was sure that I did not like it because I just fined TNG and found it. I had 3 episodes but the show did not affect me much, I initially got this baby and I thought it was just another TV show, nice events but regular. Although the music was a little different, there was obvious special effect and I had a vague impression that the actors did not fully enter the skin of the character. <br /> <br /> I saw three more episodes that I did not like that was not enough to decide. Then the show started to get me, I got a good perception of action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton .... the rest of history. <br /> <br /> I think I feel like the letter independence in the context of the opposite action Star Trek where they all were sleeping and when they were too high tech bullshit sleeping. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> I highly recommend !!!
