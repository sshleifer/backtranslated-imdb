Hi I John and I will tell you that this dog was my dog ​​on this impressive screen, he was like a hole, which made the man revive. My dog's name was Colin and he stayed away from filming for a week for this photo. He had other things like crime watches in the UK and some other small parts. He won some dog shows but he is dead now. I miss him, he was a great, true and faithful dog and we got a lot of time together, but he got cancer which was not possible to treat, so I had to get him down. The worst day of my life, I hope that if you see it again, then give you some things to look for the movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you everyone
