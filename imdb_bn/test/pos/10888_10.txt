You only wear the best Italian suits from Armani, seal the hand and apply your exact measurements. Your automobile is best to supply German engineering and it is equipped with many gadgets like horses under the hood. You are a member of the best polo clubs, often eat spagots at restaurants, and are always with the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch doubles as nuclear explosives, while your trusted pen is also a semi automatic automatically 22. You go snow diving in the Alps, the diving of the Caribbean deep sea, and the sky never dives from your place. You are Bond, James Bond, the world's most famous spy, a good queen favorite boy, bad boy in British SS, and probably the world's most loved people. The character of James Bond was created by Yan Flaming and the longest permanent icon in the film industry, more than fifteen years of filmmaking for more than four decades. The last person to play Pierce Brosnan, playing James Bond from Timothy Dalton in 1996 and his first debut in Golden 2007. <br /> <br /> This is the first major title setting developed by Nintendo 64 by a third party. Enhanced Golden by Rare for Nintendo, has been in the market for some time. The only way to verify that its continued effect on the sales charts is good and this review library will not be complete without it. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - most licensed games of the movie are mostly flops. Although both seem like a good mix, in most parts, the results have been terrible. Cliffhanger, True Lighas, Lethal Weepon, and all the Star Trek flopes to mention are enough ammunition against this mix. And for the record I'm not a fan of the movie's licensed game, especially if I saw the movie. At least how I thought. In the case of Golden, I had more reservations than usual. If there is not a bad movie, this film did not appeal much to Golden, and I did not take place in the top ten of bond movies. As a game, however, just tell it a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is the first person shooter, and to succeed, you will need at least as much brain-brown as possible. For those who have seen this movie, you imagine that most of you are reading this story, the story is very consistent and with the small change the film follows the path. The world's most dangerous satellite, a plot under the control of Golden Age, started in USSR, and in this process a beautiful woman has been captured. Your mission will be extreme, the danger will be extreme. You will have to rely on your wits and the experience will get you through the most disgusting mission the world has ever known. As soon as you prepare you will shorten M. Happy day, james
