Beauty Terrorism The poem fear. Innocence. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have to write this article for a tile of two authors in this story. The best thing is to watch this movie without just telling anything about it. When I went to the movie, I did not even know one thing about the history of two girls. I just looked at the beautiful cover-art, even though I could not even read Sinope and I popped in the DVD player. I just knew that it has won a lot of prices on festivals around the world and it is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> The DVD cover is "the most awesome movie from the ring", "Grid and Dark Water". Although the horrible part may be correct, you can forget about the rest, because the only story of the two movies corresponds to those movies ... inside the inside of a long black hair. Comparing it with these famous Japanese films is also irrelevant, because this Korean film has proposed a lot more and is actually more complex and intelligent than the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a small masterpiece, and here's some reason (there is nothing to say about the plot): The film gives me a shiny surprise-twist at least twice. And when you think you've got the conclusion (whether you've got it or not, it's irrelevant to the moment) and you think the movie will end ... this movie has been going on for some more time. Cinematography is amazing, using bright colors during daylight and dark shade. Cameras - Excellent manager who sometimes chooses impressive, if not, ignores innovation. Some shot authentic poems (eg top shot with two sisters in the lake) It all looks very stylish. There are only four main characters, but the conspiracy surrounding them is intense. The story itself starts a bit slowly, but there are lots of variations in voice and emotions to keep it interesting. There was even a scene (when girls took to the lake) suddenly reminded Peter Jackson's heavenly creation. But when there is a deadly blow, it is quite effective. There are some successful surprises. Well, I jumped up right from my sofa. The musical score is fantastic, and sometimes when it does not appear to be scary, I could not help it, but it seems like it was the Italian feeling. Bit for a Korean movie is weird. But still, a great score. <br/> <br /> I also think that telling a story of these two movies does not mean that just a horror movie is giving it enough credit. This is a mysterious horror-drama that works both in a mental and supernatural level. No matter when you look at it, this is the Asian awful that ranking up there in the best. It can not be poor, but it gets quite pretty at times and the subject is quite annoying. So if you have not seen it yet find a copy, pop it in your DVD player, go through the stream and make sure that you pay your full attention to the 110 minute running time of this movie. <br /> <br /> There, I hope I do without doing anything good.
