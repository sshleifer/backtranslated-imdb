It does not have any connection with Virtual Encoters 1, so this is not actually a single pic. Two videos share the general idea of ​​simulated sexual ideas through a virtual reality machine only. So you really are blowing away by the VC 1 (yes, right) story and dialog, and VC 2 will be a continuation, just be warned. All the actors and actresses are new, but this is the same wonderful director, Sibyl Richards. <br /> <br /> But like VC1, you get a lot of beautiful women and lots of sex scenes that put on the envelope. The soft core can go as much as possible. <br /> <br /> If you have a VC1 and you like it, you would prefer VC2. If you do not have it, then get really good sexuality, both of them.
