I enjoyed it, especially as the mistress of beautiful Gong Lee's mistress <br /> <br /> It's a little confusing, but plus English subtitles plus for a Chinese dialogue, American-spoken voice-over voice though the voice was very well synchronized. <br /> <br /> Qi Jin Huang D's (Zhang's family was the first emperor), and his name was Yong, so he mentioned in English, such as "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng" and "King Young Zhang" No, the two families / given names were not used together in those days. <br /> <br /> The language of the Qune is spoken "" No "" Shin "- Researchers did not get this right. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize but finally disappointed when the commentator announced that he was" ji "It's a terrible cotta warrior." The city is called "C-n", sometimes "jai-ai" - certainly the American voice-over speakers could get it right!
