About the atrocities of war, Bergman's story can make an intelligent musician intelligent to fool people. With a lot of memorable scenes throughout the film, I find particularly remarkable that Wolleman and Von Saido will go to boats surrounded by bodies of floating soldiers in the sea. An impressive masterpiece!
