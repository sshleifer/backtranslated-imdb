First in the Gran Garbo 'Anna Christie', the MGM 'Talkie' for the first time was 'Garbo Talks' for the first time. 'Ana Cristie' is a powerful movie but not for everyone. The film is depicted as a stage, set and short film, long dialogue and dramatic characters. Uniennell, who wrote the play 'Anna Christie', is known for his dark work and Garba's character Ana Cristie is an inferior figure with the tyrannical past. <br /> <br /> The quality of the words in the DVD was moderate. George F. to help with topics Marion, who plays Ana's uneducated father, Chris Christferson, is hard to understand. The devil who is acting as well as the old drunken seamen of Marian is teetering on the madness with his stability. But his conversation has been written on a lot of Swedish pronunciation, it is true of O'Neals' real game. It is equally difficult to understand Mary Dresler's conversation like Marty Owen. Dressler credibly portrays a broken-down old drunken women, a 'Wharf rat'. His dialogue is also true as O'Brien's original game, as Charles Bickford's Irish Seamen, brought a troubled relationship to Matt Burke. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> Fascinating Films are Grey Garbo. She distributes prostitution wrenching performance as a victim of negligence and abuse, leading a life of prostitution. Gerva was a huge star at that time and considered the most beautiful woman in Hollywood. Here his face is not glamorous, it is tortured, it is tortured. The gesture of her body is almost twice as bad. She scrounches her face on the screen to become a sad creature on the screen. To express his sadness to the proud viewer of the audience, <br /> <br /> This is a bold subject and Garbo brings life to life. It's not light rent, not funny, not for everyone. A strong emotion from the depth of the 'Anna Christie' examination, it travels to Hellouva.
