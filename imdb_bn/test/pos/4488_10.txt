It seems that there are two types of people in the world: those who think that "five letters" is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know that they were silent because they were so clever and already labeled "lam" at the end (which, apparently, Among their little minds, twillight zones exist only because: come with twists). <br /> <br /> There are lots of hair episodes in the series and I Ten TZs can not be rated ten! But this one is certainly one of those who appreciate such a rating. It's clustrophobic and colorful. The mystery is revealed and at the end we can not wait to reveal the secret. But whatever the secret, whatever this man is, it really does not matter. Most of the beauty of the episodes is moving towards it. It would be just as strong if we do not find out what these strangers in the weird places really are.
