I must admit that this is one of the few low Costello movies I actually saw in theaters. Most are now seen on TV and I must admit that Lou really is enjoyable and he also gets the girl. It was my first time to see Dorothy Provin's program and of course I fell in love with him like that day. I have seen most of the work and enjoyed everyone. His first acting role in The Great Race, I bought the disc! <br /> <br /> Every comment in this movie has said that this movie was done with Lou Castello Bud Abbott, which is true, but if Lou lived, he would do much more. She really does a good job and does not have to rely on her old routine to get laughs. I'm sorry that Patterson's little man, n. J. Did not get the opportunity to do this <br /> <br /> I hope it has been a bit of time for the DVD so I can add it to my comedy / science file.
