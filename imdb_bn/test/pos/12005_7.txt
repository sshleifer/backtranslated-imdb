And I do. Peter Falk created a role that would remain forever in TV's land! And I'm grateful for that. This is not his best hour, though. Colombo goes to college and basically teaches how he resolved a crime, and still there are bad people who go ahead and think they're smart too. Do all of our fans know that Colombo needs a competent opponent? Without a great enemy, how could he be the hero in a wrinkled quote? Still, it's better than Colombo, and I'll wait and see the next one.
