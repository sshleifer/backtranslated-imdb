I was highly underrated in this movie. The subject seems to be a bit weird, and I was stopped first, but once I was watching the film, it does not seem strange. I was curious about the different possibilities proposed in the story and I could not wait to find out how to finish it. Once it was over ... I thought about it for a long time. I was satisfied with everything from acting and stories and scientific material and emotional problems, finally about k-pack. It's not particularly passionate or happy, although it makes you shine from time to time but I think it's especially entertaining and thought-provoking. I own it now, and the desire to see it many times.
