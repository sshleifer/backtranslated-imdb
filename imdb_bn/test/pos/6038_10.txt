This is my favorite Colombo another. It was a top performer with John Cosvettes, who was never a handmeller or a sex worker, Anjanet Kamar, Mirna Loy and Bleth Danner. Now there is something that I've always wondered - when this episode was shot, Gennonith Paltrow was born, or was Dana pregnant at that time? Thanks to IMDB, I have an answer - she was five months pregnant. Now I can truly feel ancient. <br /> <br /> Casavets played a brilliant conductor with whom Danar's marriage was apparently the use of social media of her mother. He has a mistress as well, Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but he wants more he announces. He is sick back in the street On their concert night, she gets released from her and makes suicide. Columbo takes up a few issues immediately. One thing he noticed: "You have beautiful women here - the bedroom eyes - they have money, body, and occupation, where is the man?" Wonderful to see the folk and good friends Cosvettes together. There's a very interesting episode of Columbo's bassett with Bassett. Cast everyone's cool <br /> <br /> This is an episode that has created the classic series of Colombo.
