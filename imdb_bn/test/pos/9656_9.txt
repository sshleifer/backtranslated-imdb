This imagines a lovely and charming epic with lots of hearts. I have lost this sweet movie in Hollywood's Chinese Theater. It's really romantic with a sensitive message. Artwork and effects are apparently attractive and the director is so amazing that an amazing artist. The frame is like watching the moving industry. It has a strong and talented cast of actors. What astonishing surprise to see Josh Ackland, he is just a fairy-tale perfect king. Sarah Douglas is awesome like Villeneu and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz made a lovely romantic pair. This film was made ridiculously in the budget of the small Indie film, has thrown me away. It may not be violent Hollywood stuff stored by us, but it's a really nice movie and on the rainy season, enjoying curling up on your sofa. Do not forget microwave popcorn. This is my advice. Just enjoy it.
