I always liked San Connie, but as James Bond I always loved Roger Moore. Yet it was the condominium, who had set the bond's standard and established itself as James Bond in 1983, to create another look like 2007, and the meaning was essential to protect the world from the evil design of Specter. <br /> <br /> They will never say anything else again. Speaking with the help of a foolish young air force officer, Chem Basinger's brother steals two nuclear missiles during the exercise of his brother's war, and now Bluffeld's speaker, Max von Sedo, has played here threatening the world's blackmail. <Br /> <br /> Von Shido's Operation guy Clauss Maria Brandouier, who is also interviewing the bassinger and a bit crazy on the side. And in Barbara's carrier, she is working with a female assassin who, Angelina Jolie, sees Nora Croft as Mrs Butterworth. <br /> <br /> Even Shan Connery is even running a new 'M' British intelligence before running even Edward Fox believes that Connie spent a lot of money in the old fashion and British taxpayers in her violent way. I enjoyed the performance of Fox, he's Colonel Blim's grandchild. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the carrier, looking at its method and quite useful. When he is diving Scuba with Conan in Bahamas, note how he puts Mr. Shark in the 007 case. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Roger Moore's father, who will vote for him at this moment? But I think Connie will still be awesome in a wheelchair.
