About 20 years ago Frank Marshall came with tears in his amazing epic "Alive", where legendary Mexico's exploitation director Renn Cardona also used the same drama as the outline of his ambitious film "Superviventes de los angeles". The fiercely fierce flight of Ferrard 571 was uprooted on 13 October 1972 in Andes of Argentina. This deadly accident had lived the lives of many passengers, most of whom were members of the professional rugby team. But 16 of them were finally saved and thanked because of their weak will and they were fed due to the deadly casualties of their unfortunate fellow passengers. Of course you can not claim this cheaply and roughly edited movie is better than the 90s, but I definitely appreciate and respect this movie. Above all, a exploitation film claims much more input from both cast and crew, although the larger budgeted martial film is intense but the routine thinks it is more like earning money. Set and special effects can not compete with "living" naturally, but "Supervivets ..." provides equally impressive feeling of frustration and even more nights create snow. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most outstanding Mexican productions. I was really taking on cardona's acceptance that this is not surprising and clear. Scenes of dead and open passengers are still difficult to digest, but they only emphasize the inhuman conditions of the catastrophe and the inhuman survivors. Instead, a harmful director who earned fame with "bad night" and "Santos" series, such as the Bad Bad Movies. Unknown young Mexican actors are a great work and musical score favorite. The story is well-known, of course, so the screen does not offer any unexpected flashing. Through history or "living" in the past, you know that such people will still have to bear any kind of plays before they can be rescued and you can only wait for them. Yet, it is a good film that is not supposed to be done very often.
