A big neglected situation in Myanmar was a movie about the situation in Asia, it was high and out of color Hollywood's answer to it. Initially, I thought the Hollywood 8888 revolt would dramatize, and traditionally, the Halloween and Burmese male leadership would add traditional Hollywood love to Titanic-type love, which could be an old man. Fortunately, there was nothing like that - it can also explain why the film was not financially successful. <br /> <br /> However, this film was a pure God and I was happy to see the accuracy of the illustrations. Malaysia and Thailand were filmed outside of Myanmar and I miss foreign Burmese people, I can not find much guilt in the film. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the film for frustration. Human and consequent overwhelming actions. After all this, the real events of a civil war. Hans Geemar's music must be the USP of any other daring tragedy that has no connection with it. <br /> <br /> I was one year old at Rangoon (now Yanggan) in this annoying period. When I made a movie about my real life experience that I was very young to absorb, I had to get a DVD and I did not have to say, I had no problem with it because it was an amazing scene for me. .
