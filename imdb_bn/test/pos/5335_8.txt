The run-off-the-mill "family rental" that you can get, the reason for the rise of Wei-Rabbibit from many acclaimed shorts series, is far away: a well-made and satirical conversation and tricky idea, it's really a film that is family Almost every member will appeal. <br /> <br /> This story is related to Wallace and his dog, Groome, that lives in a village and creates large leafy vegetables for the annual fair. Those who manage "anti-pesto", the painful rabbits torment the lively garden everywhere. The business is a big success - but Wallace is too much clever for his own good work. When he tries to "rehabilitate" rabbits in their vegetable crunching ways, he unleashes an ancient horror of unexpected legend ratios: holes-rabbits! Suddenly, vegetables in a city are safe! Cinema crazy innovation, unexpectedly smart conversation, and references to everything from King Kong to WOLF MAN - even more than to seduce an awakened teen - but the real character of the thing is in his characters. Artists and animators are amazed at the magnitude of the jump from the soil bits: They seem completely alive as a meat-blood actor. DVD releases (and I recommend widescreen) as well as informative and entertaining extra numbers are included. Extremely recommend! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
