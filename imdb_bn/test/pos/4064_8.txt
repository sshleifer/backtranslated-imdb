I'm not going to go too deep, but showtime was a beautiful fun movie. Your snapping-your knees were not funny scenes (that I can think), but it was the moment. Cast is quite good, Robert De Niro is as good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls a fantastic fun performance. Rene Russo is fine only in the movie, there is no allegation. There were two characters in the story which I liked that they did not explain too much. The first one by Jim Campbell, was the friend of Tray Sellers (Eddie Murphy). I thought he was a friend of the tray, but I wanted to know more about him. Other characters like Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) colleague Police / Nestor Serno. I think he had another police working with Mitch Preston, but I want to know if he or she is his partner. I think maybe I'm thinking too much in a movie, after all, it's a comedy ... Who is aware of the characters? I think I though I really could see this managed by Tom Day, who pointed out to Shanghai Nun Since I saw that movie, I was looking forward to seeing the next one. I think he did a great job with this picture, and I look back at his next job. Finally, this was a good movie, but I do not offer a full price to pay a ticket if you die Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Ryan Rousseau fan. It was valuable to watch at the theater, but not for the full price, I would recommend it to Mattine Price. Also, there are some movie triangles here. Cameron Man's man, directed by Gambia Fridlander, is a music video of the David Matthews band "Everyday". He was Clark of "Meet the Parents" and also starred Robert De Niro. ... and above that he also starred Derek Junker's brother in "Jullander" (in an interview with Julland and Mr. Parents star Ben Steiller). <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the picture. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
