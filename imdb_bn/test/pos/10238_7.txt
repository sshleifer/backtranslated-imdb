What is interesting about Barber's Nightbird is that it is a story of a man on violent people, a grave threat to monsters everywhere. This one, the monsters (titles reproduced on the night) "good" boys. It shares ideas for celebrating different, curved and dark, with different Adams Family films, and most of Tim Burton's work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> Only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old tomb and rustic "weapons" with guns and bombs. And at the moment when you saw Frankenstein's air burning in the ventilation, his sympathy was very central in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a great composition and even Barker has made it even more interesting and of course more cool, work. But it is pure fun, it looks great and makes the mood by mocking yourself. The price of a look!
