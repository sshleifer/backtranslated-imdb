This review contains some small, yet important, spoilers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I ended up watching my nariyi copy <br /> <br /> .. and it was great! This can be the sound of Chess, but many times during the film I have forgotten it was not a true XD, it is certainly credible, although the acting of Masfumi Kobayashi (own game, think ...) is sometimes a little false. Marica Matsumoto (Taqasi Shimizu Rin Yuk) began to change credibility levels throughout the film: sometimes he is really good, then at the next moment he is really cheesy (especially the last surprise and the next restoration) <br /> <br /> The first character was a ridiculous character. Hori, who believes in "octoplasmic worms", is all eating tinapilate, everyone is coming to eat. He started strange humor Mike has provided relief (Stereototype Alien is acting as a kidnapping-hunting victim) but there are some really vague scenes in the near end. <br /> <br /> This plot was very funny and really surprised me how everything was gathered. The thing that's not really explained (such as a mass suicide in a Tokyo park) and where the resurrected Kagutaba-son came in) Tu everything else was good. Ultimately, being one of the most horrific, the most horrific ones, if I could never have been a continuation of such a series. Above all, the bride does not miss a very fu 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD offers great pictures and sounds (most importantly English subtitles - improve free!) for a great J-Harah experience! I highly recommend picking it up.
