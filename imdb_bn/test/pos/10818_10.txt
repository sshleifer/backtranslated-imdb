I saw forest travel 2 days ago and I found it an excellent production. The movie is supposed to be entertained, and it is! It depicts the style of the 30-second American sculble comedy, but the Von tour is more refurbished. Adjani and Depardieu are very nice in their role. The plot is easy. The film starts with a lot of people who are mostly visible, they do not have anything to do. It's great to know how these situations are linked during filming. It's good to see a French movie with this kind of humor. I find it primarily a film where love is the main theme. As the German spy of France shows Peter Quet once again to be a wonderful actor.
