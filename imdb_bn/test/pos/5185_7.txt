Extra special effects make this disaster step very wide. Someone can see that the producers have taken some problems to display computer screens - they all make a lot of faith. The set is also looking very authentic. Good choice of songs by nicely closing the picture. <br /> <br /> Good acting and presence of David Sucheta certainly adds a little weight. Compared to other types of these types, floods are well-suited to the best of them. Thankfully, the "human drama" aspect was not overdone, as is often the case for such films. Human suffering is portrayed as a perfect balance with the actual flood scene. <br /> <br /> And of course, the film ensures that many of us doubt: Weather forecasters often do not correct it! :)
