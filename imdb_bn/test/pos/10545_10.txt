I can honestly say that this movie is the most awesome movie !!! If you are in the mood for a comedy, I completely recommend this movie! So, here's the summary. This girl (Nikki) is fourteen years old and she goes on vacation with her father (Andr√©), whom she has not seen for almost two years. He expects the vacation to be completely annoying, until he meets this boy (Ben), who is much larger than that. So, trying to influence him, he says that he is not with his father on holiday, but his lover. It's a fierce movie from the beginning to the end, and I highly recommend it. So rent it and enjoy !!!
