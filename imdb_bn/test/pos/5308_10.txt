The United States of Leland was an amazing movie. I was leaving the guide on TV, I did not know it and there was no scope to sit there and go there. Then one morning when I got up, I saw that it almost started. So I decided to see it. I had the time and interest to see it. When I saw that Ryan was in the filming of Gosling and then he was the main character, then I immediately sucked and did not move away from my couch. The struggle that is going through the Leland is an inspirational story. Everyone has to deal with similar thoughts at times, whether it is a small story or whatever is bigger than what is being done throughout life. I have to sit down and watch the movie again, the things I missed the first time. As a general comment ... I recommend this movie to any bath fan or any person to choose a good movie with a really good story. There is such a big performance that is actually an extra bonus! So you can take the time to test this movie, I can almost be sure that it will not be wasted time.
