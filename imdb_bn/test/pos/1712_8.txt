Harry Langdon's "Saturday Afternoon" is always written among the greatest silent comedies, at least where the underlying issues are concerned, and so may be a bit different for some. Like other recognizable classics such as Keowon's "Cops" or Chaplin's "The Immigrant", the film is a little known, the current situation does not offer much in the way of comedy and belly laughter; One might even wonder whether Langdon might belong to such a rare company. However, in my opinion, this is a totally comical comedy in its minor original way, and Harry is interesting to visit. <br /> <br /> The plot "Saturday afternoon" can be suggested for a modern viewer grown in TV sitcoms, Hanimunar or most of his spin-offs: two gentle boys, one of whom got married and a lot of fun under his wife's fingers Try to go out with some good girls; But everything goes wrong, and they run to fight against the difficult boys boyfriend of girls. Is this word known? And perhaps a little dreary? Well, before the movie was made, the premiere was already a shop, but there was nothing about Langdon. He was curious, he was asleep like a middle-aged child that half of the beginning was asleep. Any Freudians caught "Saturday afternoon" will have a field day with this horrible, little face-to-face, male and her harsh, short-sighted mom's wives. When Harry tries to hide the money under anger, but he keeps her in this work and forces her to hand over, you will swear that you are communicating with the 6-year-old son and his mother. . . And maybe Harry Langdon gave some people cripps, and still doing. <br /> <br /> She is an attractive screen figure, and she does not do what she does. For example, in the scene with a coin at the bottom of the street, Harry finds coins in front of another foot, carefully, like walking like a tights, closes his pens because he can not find the right place, and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like anyone else. If he laughs at you or not, the guy is seemingly mesmerizing in his own world. Where Harry's idea of ​​the plot of his films is oddly passive, and almost does not move the story towards itself. After finishing "Saturday afternoon", when the big boxing fight is going on, Harry's co-actor Vernon Dent is in the thickness of this activity, but Harry has been frightened for most of the time and is windy like the wind. Through the streets when they are drunk in two cars (sitting on a running board, but on the other side with his feet). This is a memorable figure, and critics Walter Care wrote, it completely transforms the screening of Langdon's screen: he is a passive person who finds himself in some way through deadly action, when the earth is slowly flowing. Langdon and Dent, who has often worked together, also noted that it is a relationship in this movie that will offer a fancy when the loopol and Hardie meet for one year or more. Langdon's style was probably dominant on Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Afteron" and his star may not be for everyone, but the film is well worth it, and you may find Langdon, an impression that shake difficult.
