I know that many people are not bothered with this movie because it is not a good fight and difficult with subtitles. That's a really lazy way to think of a movie. If you want to focus on that part of the movie you have to find out something else and learn to respect the industry as art form, it's a wonderful job. If you want to see it, it's not really about war. Sometimes there are good fight scenes that are well featured with good camera work, but the story itself keeps the story together and it is an important part. This is not the original Kung Fu movie. The story is not the main focus and the fights, and the two combinations create a nice movie that is well-deserved and it is better with subtitle in the original language.
