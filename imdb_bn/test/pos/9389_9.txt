I love B-Awesome movies. But I'm not usually a big fan of the movie "So Foolish It's Funny". Death bed: I would be so forbidden to eat on the bed because it's a kind and so original. Lots of question marks, lots of plot holes, and WTF factor were cracked up to 11, but I was not really bored for a second. I did not really call it a weird call at all, every minute I was saying myself "what will happen next to this bed / film!" I have seen this with a friend who is not terribly bad or in any way of B-movie, it was also beautiful. The effect was actually very inventive and color, and the atmosphere was quite good. It mostly has a very consistent and even tone across the film, (though incredibly comical, consistent) and the act was not intense. From this point I can see that there are some inconsistencies in the bed work that suspends suspicion of believing near impossible, but the film was a unique and bizarre idea that the truth did not really bother me. Seriously, for me, this movie hits, which I will never forget, but I am sure I will be thinking of myself in some future scenes. Does anyone else know the unconscious of any other film, which man uses to practice? Completely fantastic.
