For the late 80s cheese, this is not really so bad. There are very beautiful one-liners with holes ("it was a huge theft!" - "Thanks!") And Madonna gives a good performance; There is nothing worth rewarding here, but it also goes to Razziz and Oscar. I wanted to know if the film is using its regular (pre-British dominant) voice, it is curious to know whether it is used better instead of modified hyper-bronxis accents. Well good Alongside, I want to see a performance of motorcycle police actors through my actions; He said that it was a fun movie to work but I am sad that the actor who played the UPS distributor Buck, who died, who is?
