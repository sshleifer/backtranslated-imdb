Perhaps it is probably one of the best French movies I've seen for a long time! This "pastiche" or spy movie parody is made very well and you are going to smile from the beginning to the end. Some mention of today's world is very fine. Under the light of today's French culture / environment, the whole Marcocan context of the movie is understood. That said, all the jokes and - seemingly - critical commentary of such context can be understood and accepted because it is a parody. <br /> <br /> I told my sister that this movie has already seen that I have to go and assured me that I am going to get a great time, and I was actually! If you like the old 007 movies with San Conaniere and you like movies like airplanes or hot shots, you'll be happy. I hope this movie will be released in the United States on DVD ... and wait.
