On 14th June 1905, during the Russian Revolution, Polymacin revolted against their tyrannical officials during the Russian ceasefire. The crew of the ship, led by the inspirational Bolshevik sailor Gregory Vakulinchuk (Alexander Antonovov), is frustrated with the second-rate treatment, and is especially forced to eat maggot-infested meat, decides that this is a revolution. And so Sergei M. Eisenstein's Russian propaganda enthusiasts started the classic 'Bronents Potimomin / Battleship Potemkin'. <br /> <br /> This picture is shining with brilliant illustrations of the amazingly visible paintings: A missing shipkeeper has danged delicately from the surrounding rope rope which he has tossed; A dead rebel peaceful on the shores of the body, his chest marks marked "SOUP killed for a bell;" Closing the closing brace of the hundreds of observers who finally bothered with the Tsarist regime; Under the Odesa steps, a deviant child carrier carrier keeps an eye on the breathless breath of the visitors (this scene was "borrowed" for Brian de Palma's "The Unacquainted", especially suspicious scenes); Many canon barrels are surprisingly amazed at the typical battleships of Ptatkin. <br /> <br /> However, the film itself is the best analysis? As a split selection of memorable scenes ?? But as a single film, and, indeed, each scene is extremely memorable. Although divided into five roughly distinct chapters, the entire film flashes wonders; In no way do we see ourselves losing interest and we are not completely suspicious of who should be sympathetic towards us. <br /> <br /> This film is often referred to as "Campaign" and it is exactly what it is, but this requires a negative connotation. 'Battleship Ptcatkin' was created by Eisenstein for a specific purpose and accomplished absolutely completely. With the celebration of the 20th century celebrations of the 1905 revolution of failures planned by the Soviet Central Committee, the revolution of 'Ptatkin' was predicted as a popular movie in the country as a symbol of the resurgence of Russian art. It is somewhat unfortunate that Eisenstein's film failed to perform well at the Russian box office, it hit Alan Dwen's 1922 'Robin Hood' in the first week of the movie and is only going on for four weeks. Fortunately, despite various programs being banned in different countries, 'Battleship Potemkin' played more specifically abroad. <br /> <br /> This image proves to be a successful vehicle for Eisenstein to test the theories of "Montage". With the quick-cut editing and extra large number of remote shots, the audience is not allowed to be sympathetic with any individual characters, but generally with revolutionary populations. Eisenstein briefly broke this mold, however, in a scene where the Vampilinchu is trying to kill the ship's officer, and of course, according to the well-known Odessa Steps sequence, our heart is unfortunately afraid of child's life in the tumbling baby car. The version I saw was co-ordinated with the accompanying soundtrack, basically the works of Orchestra of Dmitry Shastakvvich, who performed amazingly by enhancing the psychological effects in this scene. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest silent era films, 'The Beatleship Potemkin' is a win-win film, and a significant slice of the history of the movie. The film's highly exaggerated event (among other things, was not a violent genocide in Odessa step) has embraced itself entirely in memory, which is often uncertain of true history behind the events we often portray. This is a grand achievement.
