I still can not imagine why the theater is not released. It has been cast a big shoe, Catherland, Lane, and especially Chris Evans doing spectacular work. Wake up, Studio Execution! <br /> <br /> The story is growing on the basis of the authors / screenwriter's experiences, a very rich community is growing as "poor children", where the class is everything, and creates a difference <br /> <br /> During the question hour of the movie, He was asked about his experience and especially in what we do not know about super-rich, in every aspect of his life. He said, they are not stupid, they are very smart (they oppose how they can portray themselves), they have plans, and they threaten! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is too timely.
