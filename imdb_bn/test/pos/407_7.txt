Red Scalton plays a radio detective known as "The Fox" in "The Wisling in the Dark", played by Anne Rutherford, Conrad Vedt, Eve Arden, Virgin Gray and Ragus Ragland. Wally Benton, a lawyer, "Fox" found the plan to marry his enemy Carroll (Rutherford) when he was kidnapped by the leader of a Sham religion (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Vedt) has only learned that his civilization, Silver Henen, is not getting the promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who is going to live with interest. He wants to plot Wallie a perfect murder plot so that people can kill the plane on the street to show his attorney. For backups, and because he is not sure that anyone kidnapped Wali's drunk, Jones Carroll and the daughter of Radio Sponsor (Gray). <br /> <br /> Whatever it is to me, a great movie on the second end. This series, "Whistling in Dixie." The plot is good, the cast is good, the less slipping and the less intriguing joke. Scalton, when he did not make the face and turn his eyes off, it is quite tragic and Rutherford is very good. Veidt always played this evil men in perfection. Eve Ardene Wali's agent, who arranged a date for Gray to confirm the renewal of his contract and for him. I've seen Gray in the film since the 1950s. She had always had a nice look, but knew who was such a knockout at '30s and 40s? It's a fun photo with a yarn cast.
