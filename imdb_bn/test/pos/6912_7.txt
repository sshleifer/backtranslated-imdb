The dramatic license - somewhat hated, though it is necessary to revive the story of a life. In the case of "Lucy", the main point of the teenage boy's teenage years, he has been married to the primary career and the native Anaraz of 20 years of marriage, though in a shattered and rebuilt way. <br /> <br /> The main mental point of Lucy's life has been cleared: The struggle to find her place as an actress in Lucille, eventually played an impressive comedy, making the character Lucy Ricardo a legend; Her uncomfortable, romantic, and ultimately impossible marriage of the native Anaraj; Lucy and Desi create the first television empire and secure their position in history as the TV's most memorable sitcom couple forever. <br /> <br /> As Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Do not expect to see similar miracles like Judy Garfield playing in Judy Garland, but the York is able to strengthen the ball, yet still his favorite is interesting. Although his ridiculous time is different from Lucy, he is still credible. This film never describes details of his perfection in the set, and his first "I Lucy Lucy" years of torture with Vivian Vance, but an excellent inclusion interview with Luqi personally with Luk. <br /> <br /> Daniel Pino was slim and less charitable compared to the real country, but he has his own charm, and especially with the opening scene, most of the decent work is done with native accents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are not good actors in their own right, they are not just suitable for the people playing. Most actors came from Australia and New Zealand, and suppressed texts can be identified from time to time. <br /> <br /> While the main framework of the film pushes the historical truth, there are many deviations, for some reason it is impossible. Jess Oppenheimer, the lead author of Lucie's radio show "My Pleasant Husband", which started in 1948, has been shown in this film to reach the scene in 1951 with the help of "I Love Lucy", which is the main creator! This movie also marked McDaniel as the director of the main "I Love Lucy" for his full run, replacing William Ashar completely replaced by him completely! Also, although I think it was due to budget constraints, Ricardo lived in the same apartment to stay in New York, when in reality he changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and off-sized as well as the original. The Connecticut room is very close to the original, except that the house is concentrated and reconstructed right and left. <br /> <br /> In 1953, the Arkoos did not hit the market, but RCI did not buy ARKO until 1957, even though Laski was talking about buying ARK in 1953 even during the red-hot incident. These changes can be for a dramatic license and the film works to highlight major events, but what would have hurt them to show Oprahimer and Asher a little more respect, "I Lucy" are two important identities in history? The biggest gaffe "I Lucy" comes in the entertainment scene, at least a few of them. It is always risky, which is recycled in the film and seen by billions of people, but more often when unwanted changes are made. The scene with giant bread bread has been severed, and the difference between all that familiar with that episode will be noticed immediately! The number "We were a child" was also reduced, but it was virtually dead. With Nailing Truly York nailing Lucy's approach, the "grape-stomping" scene was by far the best. The producers decided to restart the "Vitametavegamin" and candy factory bits, the actors restoring their rehearse, trying not to reinstate the wise. These scenes proved to be effective due to this method. <br /> <br /> The main drawback of the film is that the audience has already recognized a big deal about Lucie's life, since most have skimmed or dropped. Overall, it gives a beautiful portrait of Lucy and Desi's wedding and real flaws can be ignored if character development is effective.
