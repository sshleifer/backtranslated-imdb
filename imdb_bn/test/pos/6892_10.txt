I absolutely loved this series, and it was very sad to go. Yes, it is Christian based, and traditionally as well as. It is related to some difficult problems, but I guess that it depends on your perspective on this subject, and like a teenage adolescence and now, like my own mother, I was happy to see a TV series, clean and, Well, quite pure, wonderful! I, in contrast to other critics, seemed to see how they had coped with the condom agreement. Rather than listening to the common sensual drying about condoms, they showed that the boy was actually working purely and applied it to his next relationships, which was pure and pure for him, and this was 100% more secure. <br /> <br /> After watching this whole series, you are very much connected to family and family (after having settled permanently permanently) and that the moral values ​​they teach in every episode are very valuable. I made by Angel (made by the same producer) to be here and there to Chess (although overall I like it), but in my opinion, in this opinion, it was very well made and well played and was even better. . It was a huge plus which was good for the whole family and was interesting for the whole family. The family was not outstanding, they had their own faults, but for the long time they did the right thing, and you raised them up and changed and struggled like a real family. This was my favorite show and always will be on top of my list, I hope it will come in the DVD!
