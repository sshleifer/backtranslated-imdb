Small Town American, Jill Johnson (Belle) settles for a night of babysitting hundred miles away from a grizzly murder scene. With a beautiful house for children to sleep and rest, she sets off the door and sets an alarm. But when unreasonable phone calls from an unknown person say that she "examine the children," Jill Panics When his phone is found then terrorism fears And the police find out that the 16-year-old's worst nightmare works perfect kids. There are no other lead actors in this movie. Camila Bell is the main star with a beautiful face. The day he comes to the child, he does not know exactly what is waiting for him in hell. <br /> <br /> If I had lived in a room like Jill The first person I'd like to see in the refrigerator, but I'm not a man and I babysit. But the funny thing is the size of the room. I was thinking, if the house is not so big, will the movie be similar? A huge room can be lost to anyone, but this film needs a huge room. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell is a beautiful face, perfect smile, but it's like a movie, someone with experience in the movie actress needs someone. I have not found that Camilla is good. I do not know he might have thought that this could be his successful role. I like him, he is a beautiful girl, but to play this role, there must be something different to some of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was not scary. I found this movie more like a "chick flick". I think the only reason for the release of Superbol Weekend is that people are at home and watch the game and girls go out to see it. Girls will enjoy more than girls when it feels like a movie. But I like this movie but it's like that. Girls just like toggles and screams or screams This was just a nice decent movie. <br /> <br /> Someone might love this movie. There are many PG-13 horror films that are not successful. It was at its own level. So I liked this movie. I give it 7/10.
