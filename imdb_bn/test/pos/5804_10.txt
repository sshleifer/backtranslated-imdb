Madonna has entered the boat for more than 20 years, and has had many experiences with it - of course and a lot of knowledge. He did not think yesterday, AU controller, he knew what would be popular tomorrow. He takes all the new trends, the brave, technology, and includes them in their own works. His world tour has not been 'average'. When Madonna conducts, she gives 120% - everything is big, good, dramatic and meaningful. He takes inspiration from East, West and then makes it unique. Everything is given a deeper meaning, and conferences tours are not different. From the very beginning, you are sitting at the edge of the chair. She starts with the lips, then she poses brave circus brave on a horse high in the sky, she does everything she can to entertain you. He remakes his own songs, giving them a modern feel. He sings a disco cross, he comes in the middle of the stage and does not know the level of scary with his amazing dancer, the show is far more than exchanging for you. It is a spectacular, audio-visual orgasm that can not be kept in words. Lucky those who are actually experienced watching Madagasa stage. Pushing fifty, he is still incredible form. Recent sticky and sweet tours even more ground-breaking, which does not prove anything else, that was Madonna, and sometimes the only one pop and one queen.
