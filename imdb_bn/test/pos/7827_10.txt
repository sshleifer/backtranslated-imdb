When this show was broadcast on Australian TV in the late 90's, I first saw that it was the capital of the Kevin Costa film's 'bodyguard' capital. But then I take an episode and I saw it from the beginning. The partnership between Shan Paratwe and Luis Lomber played so well and the structure of each episode was very entertaining. This was not a overblown TV show that you can ask to spend most of your energy explosion so that they can keep the clip commercially to bring the clip to the audience and then can not reach any other level. The show delved into the life of two major characters and which has made it interesting. The story of every episode where good actors were with interesting guest stars And of course many actions and conspiracies which were always good. But what was great was humor, and it flows naturally from the letter, it does not appear conrived. It was British but in a good way, and if this event is done in America, it will now suspect the DVD. I do not know why British TV production company is not interested in publishing this show in DVD. It deserves a great show and a DVD release.
