I was half a dozen when I saw the last night's selection of small films - but I was standing straight from the first frame of "I Shout Love" and could not pull my eyes for a complete, short, perfect length. With incredibly assured pacing and performances, this film maintains her funny / sad / insightful tone throughout. Finally the credit went so early and such small, I had to go online to find the person responsible for this master's work. It is very interesting to see the name of Sarah Palley, which is rarely seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> Christine Thomson (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) are the richest, broken throes. When they work together through the reconstruction of Tessa's favorite moments from them, both actors reveal their character in terms of the dimensions and their relationships, which reveal nothing to the respect of their enemies, but to the expert / writer's expertise. The picture produces moving stories with smiles and sniffing grief. <br /> <br /> "I love Shout" is one of the greatest and most memorable small films I ever hope to see. It has intelligence, heart and stunning originality. It is important.
