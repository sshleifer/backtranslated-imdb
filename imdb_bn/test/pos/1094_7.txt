The director should not be very critical about the second feature <br /> <br /> I really like the work of Madiba camera. Mr. Shaun said that there was a unique way to see things <br /> <br /> But how does 14-year-old boy shoot so beautiful pictures? Remember that he got some kind of education. I do not think English is common in Cape Town gateway. Although bad, Madiba looks younger than 14 years old. <br /> <br /> In any way, if you exceed the specifications mentioned then you can watch the movie and enjoy it for the camera work.
