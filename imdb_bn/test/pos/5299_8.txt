I recently saw this movie and decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to see this movie is that Miazaki can not be seen in the past. Miyazaki Spirit is well known for his work on the distance and away from the Haol's running fortress. However good for the western viewers. Both of them were similar to each other but were completely different at the same time. However, together with the piano together with different stories and animations. <br /> <br /> The story is a fish called "ponio" that faces a girl. When Pinoo went out of his house beneath the ocean, he discovered a new new world that he did not know that he was there, and a new trouble, when he was caught by fishing boats, he was rescued five years old as the son Sousuke Known. <br /> <br /> The story follows both of them and mutual friendship between a boy and fish. Could Ponyo really have to be with Sousuke forever? <br /> <br /> I think this movie is inspired by "little mermaid" and also "Toneri Totoro" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is too short And you have very less time to learn about this movie characters. But the characters are a fish and a little boy, so how much do you expect to learn about them? The movie is set up in 3 days, I think this is because the movie is so small. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you all enjoy this movie
