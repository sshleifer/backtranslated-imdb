I have to agree with all the previous commentators - it's just the best of all kinds of comedy, Baradot Marilyn Monroe was ever sexy and clearly with a beautiful look (perhaps there is less mystery but see how Marilyn paid for it).) I think Not that I saw such a beautiful lady in the screen, so it's perfect that a gay guy like me is also excited. Read - and not purely for aesthetic reasons (if the genuinely wanting the foolish gospel is to make a 'convert-a-quier' number, they will certainly need the criteria, since the mouse of a church does not apply here ...) her breasts, The rest of his part, his voice, the ridiculous way, he suddenly walks through a room ... just to reach a human Nones literally indicate such fine excitement ... <br /> <br /> I think there is one of the greatest leading male male in history. Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert and other big women like Barbados have performed more than that. She was also in 'Fanny' with Leslie Carna, and 'A Ha Hoo to Steel a Million', as well as the debut movie 'The April Fools' (though not against her) with Aye Hepburn. I can not agree with the comments that the strong, overwhelming music over opening credits is appropriate - I mean, that Bardt is not at the peak of everything else and his tide (I mean, not his voice) is his overwhelming part and one even for example, for example to be impressive May <br /> <br /> The cat is perfectly handsome, even if Brigitte initially says, 'I do not know why I love you, you are not even handsome. <br /> <br /> Dear, favorite news item! One of the truly wonderful 20th century wonders, while not mentioning that joy with us yet, while really many characters are so fast away hungry, all its bright glory.
