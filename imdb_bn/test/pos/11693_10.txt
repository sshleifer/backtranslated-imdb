It was an excellent movie! I saw this at Carloee Heavy IFF in Czech Republic, and it won a prize. This is the first movie I ever seen from John (Director), and I was fascinated. It's a great story about love and family The movie has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama and suspense. I do not exclude a plot, but it's a well-made movie, and if I get the chance I'll see it again! Cinematography / editing is great, the film flows smoothly and the letters are warm, and they are one that can be related to. I hope you enjoy this picture. If someone knows where I can get it in the United States, or if they plan to publish it in a while, please let me know !!
