This review is based on the producer's cut: <br /> <br /> 'Halloween 5' was a big disappointment in the box office '89 back. Personally, I've always liked it and proud of it in my collection. But due to its failure and rights issues, we will see another installment six years ago. Though the series was not the best, the film was ready to be the best one. Donkey Pleasence is not the return of Dr. Loomis and George Wilber as Michael Mayer, the return of the character of Tommy Doyle from the first film, a major studio supporting the project and releasing everyone like hits to create a collapse film. So what's wrong? I will give you two good reasons: re-shoot and poor editing. Due to a bad screening screening and unfortunate passing of Donald Pleasence, the film has changed, and is not good for it. Box 3 and 5 tanked the box office and earned negative reviews from critics and maximum series fans. But then, thanks to the bootlegging's magic, the real cut has emerged and many fans, including my self, are very happy. I will conclude this review by saying: The film is my favorite 'Halloween' movie, and I am not afraid to admit it. <br /> <br /> Professional: Score is easy spelling. There are some of the best writing and dialogue in the series. The origin of 'Halloween 4' is Amulated that it was more about mystery and mood than blood and vacuum, and 6 in the same way. Excellent performance, especially since late and very missed Donald Pleasence. Movie at an exciting pace. An interesting explanation for Michael's evil and why he would not die. Kill some brutal Some pretty cool moments, my favorite Kim Dirby is involved in the character. Previous films really really cool. Some good surprises. Like the previous two series, it's a great disguised end. Cons: Although the interpretation of Michael's temple was interesting, it made him a little less terrible. Since Michael travels from the place so fast? <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: In this theater I saw the first Halloween. I was very excited because I thought 5 would end and then I heard this incident. I've enjoyed it at the time, but over time it has seen what it was like: a great movie is okay with the terrible ending. Why did the filmmakers not listen to the public at the examination center? If they publish this higher version, it can be done better and will not be stuck in this series that is currently in the world. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
