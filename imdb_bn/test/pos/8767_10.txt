The matter is banned, even in 1942. It's a war campaign. The fascists are among us and they are doing what they can to destroy the war effort and to seize their victory and their power and to establish their effective effective sovereign state. But Hitcoo will have to create a real thriller. So he invented a successful debris which is successful, but one of the sufferers, whose friend dies, becomes the main suspect and escapes to the ruins. As a result, he was able to visit the country and discover the clever organization of the local Nazis, who are known and supported in the top civil society and using little discontented sandals for doing dirty work. Our young lie suspect behind the original Sabotur from Los Angeles to New York and the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist, who believes that his spirit is not guilty of giving flattening, his nephew advertised billboards star, but a fierce and fierce patriot who is thinking of going to police only. Then the wealthy rancher and plotters her home. Then, some sympathizers and friendly truck drivers on the street, and a circus long coverway were going around and their dwarves, bearded ladies, siamese sisters and some other points of the like. And he invented the goal of Soda City, an electric dam, that supplies Los Angeles and its fighting industry with the necessary power. When it was launched, it took part in a US-based Alaska military ship wreck as a jackfruit. And finally, with some inventions, creativity and elbow Greene, he and Pianist's spouse are managed to completely clean up, most of them are arrested and dropped from the torch from the first Sabotur, a certain fries star of Liberty. That one would not be grilled on the old electric sparking chair. But Hitcoch is still not in the habit of having a personalized camio look in his own movies, so do not look for him. It is well-built and performed well, but it is simply a promotional movie with an extra style. <br /> <br /> Jacques Collardou, University Paris Dufin, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sovereign and University Varsils St. Quentin en Yvelins
