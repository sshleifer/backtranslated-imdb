In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the leading family classics. It features Mickey Rooney (Mia Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor (Velvet Brown). <br /> <br /> Velvet won a race horse in the name of a raffle. She falls in love with it directly. With the help of MI, former jockeys, they train it in grand national competition. After finishing the pie in the last minute, Joe finally agreed to take Velvet out of his place. <br /> <br /> It was a good motion picture together. Fine story and top notch acting. There was an indoor game witch between Elizabeth and Mickey. This is a wonderful family picture directed by Clarence Brown. Photography is stunning This is a movie that you will enjoy for years. <br /> <br /> This picture gave Elizabeth Taylor a family name. Mickey and Elizabeth both remained after the film. They still send each other's post cards after all these many years. <br /> <br /> The whole note. Elizabeth Horse "Pie" liked so much that the studio gave her.
