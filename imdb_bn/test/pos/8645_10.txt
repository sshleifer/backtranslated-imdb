"Twin Pick" and "Blue Velvet" have always been my favorite pieces of filmmaking, and although the previous films of Lynch were somewhat frustrating for me, they were always valuable at times. Shout, lint can be like a good wine - he must be savored and overturned. But at the end you have to create your own mind about what you have seen, because Lynch never gives you complete answers. <br /> <br /> Many people will go out of "Malhaland Drive", perhaps by putting themselves on their own mind-bent visual jigsaw puzzle that unfolded before them. But this film has a shocking argument, you only need to find sources. Bati (Naomi Watts) comes in search of Hollywood, Die-Eye and Starad. Then he has escaped from an attempt to drive Mulholland who finds an amnesiac in his bathroom. Together they try to uncover the secret behind amnesiac life. All this leads to a club called Silencio, where a blue box will reveal all. And that's when the movie threw everything out of the window. We thought that we knew completely different people ... is this a dream? A reminder about the previous escapades of life? You will love this film or hate it. David Lyncht always draw such extreme reactions from his audience. But due to extremism in his universe, his films can make such reactions excited. <br /> <br /> It is better to show the film in a significant way rather than straight-forward story. And lynch is a filmmaker that still grateful that you let yourself draw your own decision. Especially "Vanilla Akash" has many imitations, in which a mind-set movie decides to answer you in the last five minutes and you will probably forget that movie as soon as you walk on the movie. mulholland drive will haunt you.
