I have seen quite a long and mostly movie without any doubt in Human Traffic. It is a group of young people 2 days of life, indifferent to their daily existence and death job and on weekends, they take a glimpse of the road. It's ridiculously funny and extremely mad, and sometimes very sad. This is a great soundtrack in the same style as 'tracing' and it features the features of the rising stars of the rising young stars. The film was made in a small budget and when I discovered the genius of major filmmakers I was looking forward to the future offers by writer / director Justin Curigen.
