The superb 'Prime Suspic' series has reached four parts, it does not hurt the speed, it is itself a significant achievement. 'Prime Suspense IV: The Lost Child' is a strong supporting cast that we allow in these British plays, but Helen Mirin is easily influenced; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Single mother and her two younger daughters. Insight given in our mind work is one of the mental highlights of this mini series but it can be very strong for many stomachs. <br /> <br /> Action sequences are hand-operated with great hand - the camera pushed us right through the tide and is ticking during climatic blockage. <br /> <br /> It's another superb police systematic drama together.
