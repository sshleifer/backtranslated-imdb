Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Jarakov and Sunder Dale Arden, have definitely made the best serials about traveling in a rocket ship in another universe to save this planet. On the way, spelbindings, flash among spectacular and action-packed chapters and their friends together with their friends like Prince Bairn, Prince Thun, and the legendary King Bhutan, together with their friends, mercilessly mercilessly mingle their battle for war and fighting. Mangro and her daughter Priya Arora's jealous betrayal (now that car!). This series is not just a cut on top of most serials for plots, performances and budgets - it's miles ahead in this region. There are a couple of exquisite sets produced by Universal Studios, such as The Bride of Frankenstein's Laboratory Set and Opera House from Opa House, Opera. My most modest opinion for the year 1936 was to increase production costs across the board. Many of these weird men and women wear really creative and first rate. We get Haq-men, shark men, lions male, high priests, dragon, octocks, orangapoides, and tigrons (oh my!) And many, many other fantastic things. Have all their credible and first-rate special effects? No way. But most impressive for 1936. Musical scores are remarkable and the section introduction is well written, long chapters long enough to revitalize the memory of the audience of the chapter, and score efficiently. Director Frederick Stefhani made amazing work together and produced a suitable film for Alex Raymond's Phoenom comic strip. Finally, this serial of acting is quite good. All too often there is no name with no talent around serial one or two former talents - most of the things here have some power. Do not make me wrong, it's not a Shakespeare troupe in any way, but an employee like Flash in the Buster Crabbubs, chooses a choice. Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and generally the other two actors are standing with him. But before reaching those two, let me refer to my other reviewer, this was great for the serial, through the Hayes office. After several decades I saw the flash of movies and more meat on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson. Shorts Crabbie (And unfortunately, we can wear Professor Zarkov (Frank Shannon)), who can wear shoes for shoes. The girls were able to wear in the mid-middle and absolutely beautiful genes Rogers could have played genius but she is a blonde bombshell. Lawson is very proud and sensuous and beautiful. But for me serial made two actors as Charles Middleton Ming: officious, sardonic, ruthless, and fun. Middleton is a class act Jack "Little" Lipsson congratulated King Bhutan: warm, enthusiastic, ridiculous - the symbol of every essence of happy happiness and mourning in life. Lipson stole each of its scenes. This plot is here, everywhere and everywhere, but Flash Gordon follows the basis of the serial, space opera, and science fiction loads. Excellent!
