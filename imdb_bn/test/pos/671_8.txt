Be careful, my boyfriend recently came to TV on BBC2 in the first few hours, so I set the video to record and I was satisfied. <br /> <br /> A man has found a dead woman so she escapes, so do not blame her for murder and a widow works as a soldier in the house, but she does not know what she is taking here. This man turns out to be a psychopath and potential killer. She started tormenting her and locked her in the stars. Then he can cut the phone line so that he can not get help from the outside. A young boy regularly makes some purchases for his notice, does not come when he closes his shopping. Finally, people leave, as nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Why I can see, when my boyfriend was released in the film, an X certificate was given. Some of the scenes are rather nasty for this period. I thought that the guy was going to do something to the little boy too. <br /> <br /> This cast, performed by Robert Ryan as a psychopath, Ida Lupino widow and Barbara Hotting and D. Pollock as a boy <br /> <br /> I saw this Robert Ryan's coolest performance. A must see. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 5 out of 4 stars.
