After returning to the "good old days" in 1971, we can remember very well when we treated the whole season of Charles Chaplin in the film. We saw him in some old talk shows when the preacher called him. (আমরা কেবলমাত্র এটির কথা মনে করতে পারছি না; মর্ভ গ্রিফিন বা উড্ডি উডবুরি, এক বা অন্য!) অতিথি ছিলেন স্যার চার্লসের ক্যারিয়ার সম্পর্কে এবং 195২ সালে সাবেক চলচ্চিত্রের বর্জনের পর থেকে তাঁর চলচ্চিত্রগুলি কীভাবে ছড়িয়ে পড়েছিল তা নিয়ে আলোচনা করেছিলেন। The "Little Tramp" from Los Estados Unidos is based on its "illogical alien". (No crystals, he is not from another planet!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is interested in various political and economic systems and openly investigated. 20's (and before) everything from the anarchy movement, technology craze in various forms of socialism, Chaplin had to play for Hollywood party talks, which of course implies the inclusion of the Soviet-style, which we usually call communism. <br /> <br /> m Chaplin's accident was absolutely embarrassing. He never became an American citizen. <br /> <br /> <br />, enough before this background! <br /> <br /> <br /> She said that she became America's 'Personal Grantis'. It was too long to get the old films and get back to movie houses. It will definitely ensure a great gesture by forgiving us and quickly forgetting Americans. <br /> <br /> This will be a beautiful gesture for a great filmmaker; Also, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences plans to honor Chaplin by honoring the Oscars in 1972. In order to invite Charlie back to America, it must be very enjoyable and delightful packaging and she will have to come and receive a special academy lifetime award for millions of worldwide television audience numbers. <br /> <br /> It's normal for Bidid, the Chaplin Season to promote the theater! (Remember, Little Trump was a movie maker who was abusive as a $$$ $ Man!) New event in this event, city lighting, astronaut, Mansour Verdex, King of New York and finally Chaplin Rev. We feel very excited to expect the long film festival. <br /> <br /> In our fair city of Chicago city, it was booked at Rush Street Carnegie Theater. The festivals are moved away with the present times and the others will be shown one at a time, each going for the necessary time to fulfill the public's desire to see each picture. We think that the last part of the schedule was Chaplin Rave. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We look again and see that they started running with REVUE; Since undoubtedly mubhigoyadera (much like themselves) who know very little about movies and his performance, the keystore, esasana and mutual Silent Shorts are also being shown as a regular feature in addition to them, They have seen too many countries show Kiddy. Oh well, again, nobody consulted with me! <br /> <br /> Today's guest of honor, The Chaplin Revue, we saw that it was actually three different pictures; Chaplin (itself) by the description by the use of carefully gathered, some animated Themes and eventually music (again, Chaplin wrote) and some happy talk and extremist statements (ditto, Chaplin by.) The use of the proceedings opened in Hollywood, Chaplin Studios building as well as some rehearsal time Some of the films taken in the filmmaker film-movie-type film director, Chaplin is acting in what he wants for a group of actors. <br /> <br /> This segment was well done and was well received by the audience. Both building comedies and rehearsals are enhanced to feel them quick. (রিহার্সাল স্বাভাবিকভাবেই, ক্যামেরাটির ফটোগ্রাফিক প্রক্রিয়াটি দ্রুততর করার জন্য ভবনটি ব্যবহার করে। পুরানো কৌশলটি দেখে মনে হচ্ছে যে ভবনগুলি প্রায় নিজেদেরই তৈরি করছে। <br /> <br /> এই ছোট্ট ছোট্ট চ্যাপলিনের ছোট্ট কমেডিগুলিকে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করেছেন। প্রথম জাতীয় ছবির সাথে তার অভিনয়। From about 1917 to 1923, the choice was well thought out and one of our content and mood Provided a wide range of diversity. <br /> <br /> First up, shoulders Arts (Charles Chaplin Productions / First National Pictures, 1918). According to the title, it's the story of the First World War. 11 November, the month of October, on October 11, one month before Day armisisa Released, it was a comedy comedy comedy and a romance between private chaplin and French Girl (Miss Edna Purviance) This practice is in the grand old tradition of defeating fast, physical and rural army. <br /> <br /> The old expression about bringing children and dogs together, the next movie is A.G.G.Life. (Chaplin Productions / First National, 1918) Parallel life of the Chaplin tramp and a new adopted trail, scrap. Two of them are involved in the story of the film. One of our supplies with Homo Sapiens, a Canine and both some big surprises. <br /> <br /> As the last, we had a good choice as PIGGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) ended. It was bright, light and tight. It was a trip to the Western Spoof region, such comedies were made by each comedian and team. "Pilgrims" in the story is not your standard Thanksgiving variety; Rather, rather "dude" or "tenderfute", who came out of the west. Trump is not just that guy; But his character is an escape crime, which is mistakenly considered to be a new scholar of Western Church! <br /> <br /> Our rating (which is Chlutz and me) **** (That's four Derbies) <br /> <br /> Puddle Schnitz !!
