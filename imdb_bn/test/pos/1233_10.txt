Hello all the Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I could not agree with you yet! This show was so cool and cute, I saw it as a baby at the end of the 80's. Among the other very dear Denver, such as Care Bear and Rainbow Bright. I'm 24 now, but it's still one of my favorite shows and my favorite cartoon from the 80's. It brings all the memories back. The theme tune was very great, whenever I get it, get hugobamp. It is tragic that it lasted for so little time, but it was a strong favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and there are people who liked it. This cartoon shows I will keep for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
