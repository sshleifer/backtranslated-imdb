This picture was very different from previous movies and I had to wonder, "Where is Ralph McKhee?" He may be involved in the plot, like the old friend of Miyagi, who teaches Julie what he already teaches, then Miyogi can add more as well! Mackieo may have love for Julie in this film! <br /> <br /> <br /> On a serious level, I enjoyed this movie because it teaches a teenage girl how Karate is, and her feelings differ from what Daniel had. Julie is much more wild than Daniel and he needs timing, which Miyagi has found very challenging; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, we're all about Miyagi devi I can learn one or two!
