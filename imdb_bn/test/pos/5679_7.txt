Like most, I thought 'another crocodile movie' In the last 12 months we have got the private and the vein, what can they do? Where both the films were about action and violence, it's about fear and excitement. <br /> <br /> Nothing is going on when performance oscillate is not fit, but these people suffer during times of misery or terror. It's so rush-like. There is a hole in the plot and probably does not behave like crooks behaving like others, but the fear is so effective that it is an extended part of telling you to enjoy this movie. It will leave you uncomfortable feeling as the Passion of Christ.
