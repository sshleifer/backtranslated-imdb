I'm slowly flowing through Hong Kong action films because I can get my hands and come across this gem - mainly because of Ching Wang Lau, one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> Action film might suggest though it is not as a great title as OTT. It is a great speed to move along and really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> This photo was the biggest surprise soundtrack. It will be seen that Rob Dogon - the popular 'Clubbed to Death' song in 'The Matrix', which was popular with the 'Big Matrix', lifted soundtrack from the sound bullet and compiled it with a track on its 'Furious Angels' album; The question is, 'I'm not driving anymore' and it's open tune for the TV series 'Law and Order' and 'Matrix Reloaded' DVD menu teaser opening track! That really surprised me, because of mere coninidence!
