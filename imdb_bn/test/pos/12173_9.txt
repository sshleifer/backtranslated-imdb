Awesome movies. I was always smiling through all the time. Why? Well, I'm from Austria, I can do German (Bavarian) kind of humor. So I think this movie is only when you see the German native speaker only intelligent. Both Stefan and Erican are talking in a new type of Turkish-German accent, which has become really popular in our country (GRR and it). But of course they are very stupid. Each comedy will decide as your personal humor, whether thumb is up or down.
