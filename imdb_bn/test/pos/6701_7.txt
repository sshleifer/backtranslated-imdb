Okay, let's get out of the first place: As a part of the movie, Life Force Garbage. As a bit of impressive entertainment for SF buffs, it has many talents. If you have seen those old black and white SF B-movies - huge variable spiders / seeds or alien monsters roam around the desert - you really will be out of life force. <br /> <br /> Bad thing: The story makes little sense and played quite poor. Good thing: Special effects are half decent; It is a seperately different British central story (this is set in London) which gives a different feel to most SF movies; And it's better to make Matilda May (amusingly luxury build as "Space Girl") fold almost naked around the stark. <br /> <br /> Short: It's fun. <br /> <br /> I saw it half a dozen times now, and whenever I come on TV I make time to visit it - admitted that it is partially with the naked girl Miss - but it also enjoys a bit of unassuming and stupid SF do not do.
