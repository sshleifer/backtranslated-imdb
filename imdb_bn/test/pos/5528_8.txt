I saw a six type for WC. Fields - He's only a long scene for about 10 minutes, the infamous pole order he is famous in Vaudville and other famous moments. The 55-minute repetition is also delightful, grateful, for the most laughable Charlie Ragguls, left banker J. Pinkham Honey. He's all foil He stutters and stumbles about our pleasure. Also, his comedy partner, Mary Bolland played his wife, Flora. George Bergen and Gracie Allen are joining the proceedings. The bands are especially fun at the beginning and the end, but grossy and ruggles mostly use images. Gracie is fun, pretty, but he can get tired. And the poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do without Gracie's repeated all the time. I do not think once to laugh (though he has a great view of rugglass, where Raggas gets George to take Gregory and leaves him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields where she asks Fields to sell her a sweater , Although that bit exclusively field 'though). The situation is continuously funny: Hwanney is going to California, but George and Gracie are appointed to help them with the cost. 8/10.
