I love this movie because Bobby Phillips really can fight! I always hate when the actors are not credible in part of the action. It was great to see, there was no crime, but a woman who could skillfully manage martial arts and war. If you compare it to most action movies with women, you will certainly see what you understand. They cut the shot with anyone that can fight and it does not flow well. I was very impressed. I hope there is more!
