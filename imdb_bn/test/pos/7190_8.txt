I do not know about the English version of this movie, but the Norwegian translation has been the most fun movie I've seen for years. Characters say so funny things and in the current incidents that I am surprised that I am surprised that they have more options, such as the architect who can not correctly say the name of the wizard Miraculix. It has become something like Malcomcom (i) X and "utenriks" which are Norwegian for foreign issues. <br /> <br /> Like the word "utniaks", many translations do not give any money in English and are probably not French, so translators should make their own jokes, and work very well. Of course, these are a very good foundation for creating, a movie that is ridiculous from the beginning to the end! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with a good translation!
