This show was incredible, but very clear for most people. If you have not seen the European diversity show in the 70's or 80's (or at least Mexican one), the whole show will probably be lost to you. If you have, this show was a dead on the fierce philosophy skewering satirical and this shows that the dive in their worst A pen-shield with a pencil is protected by the wannabe of a chain-smoking souvena and a former-wife Harriman, her grandmother and immasculating "Variety of Diversity" has a variety of shows which try to get off the ground each episode but always descends into battle and the work has gone too wrong . Joins the host "Johnny Blues", a gradually side-kick seems to be named because blue jeans is a very popular product in his country and that means that the kids will love him, of course they are. <br /> <br /> The result was a ridiculous fad of common shows. Imagine a debate that probably caused the Boston Storm in the last days of "Sony and Cher Show". Now imagine this is happening in front of you ONSTAGE and they are trying to keep their compositions. Now add sugar and a Euro-rich mentality (tuxedoes, gowns, booze, accents and smokes). Now you have "Viva diversity". <br /> <br /> Have you heard a musician whose song was beautiful for other musicians? Very conceptual? Viva did this for diversity comedians. The very mysterious way for standard American listeners. It was fun as Hell. And destroy.
