John Houghton has created many great and memorable movies. Those who often and easily remember, were released for many days before they were passed in 1987. However, that year, it reminds us that Houston was still at the top of its game with the faithful adaptation of James Joys' acclaimed novel "The Dead". "<br /> <br /> One day before a man named Doc asked me," Do dealers do not seem to be more vivid and bright than any other Dublin story? "I think it Jason's tweet and the film both have social commentary and criticism, but in most cases, the warm and loving portraits of Joyas of Ireland are drawn and often <br /> <br /> Whiston's hero Gabriel Conroe, who has realized the world, is nothing more than an illusion, it is simply extraordinary. The film has to miss the point of claiming to be a plot, with Joe's in any case in Dublin - When most are present - there is no focus, the plot is simply a tool for the protagonist's epiphany, in addition to the lack of work, Josie's little story The director is frustrating about a little dialogue. The ability of the host to translate what sounds to Josse's views is mostly the greatest victory in the film. Feelings, thoughts ... Gabriel's discomfort during the dance ... All these intangibles jump into life and the perception of visitors in the screenplay of Houston Come in. <br /> <br /> Husse also claimed that the writer of the society softened the criticism and missed the mark again. While "The Dead" can be portrayed with a delightful photo, the joy and anxiety of the film's characters are only commented on the small scale society: we are the old aunt of kids; Tender with embarrassed drunk sore throat; Sadly wife, rain is very secret; Even self-confused middle-aged people <br /> <br /> But "The Dead" loses its title. This is not a dark story. No it's that awkward really. For a moment, live and fall on the dead and forget the intrinsic emotions in it; At the end of his life, Gabriel wakes up at the last moment of life: Gabriel can really go ahead by destroying himself and his world's miscreants. The central point of this photo. Like the central point of our life.
