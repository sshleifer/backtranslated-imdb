Director and script writer Dan Harris is 25 years old It is rare to see this movie, which is not only professional and deep but also a mature part of it, but it is difficult to judge 'fantasy heroes' with it. Some of the typical routine errors are in old managers. <br /> <br /> This setting is very familiar with the American subcontinent, 'American Beauty' or 'Desperate Housewives'. In the film 'American Beauty', we are surrounded by suicide, but here it happened at the beginning of the film, and with the death of the gifted athlete brother and son we are going to meet the middle class family. Emil Hirish is playing a younger brother, Sijurini Waiver's mother, both of whom are trying to deal with depression, because to find reasons and motivations for living. Harris manages his actor with a sure hand, and produces a surprising tension with the first two divisions of the film (as a season season in total four years) with faithful conflicts and real questions. This is the second part of the film which is a little frustrating, it seems tired and tense, and I suspect that the producers of the young writer-director and director could intervene, trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood conference. Thus, the film failed to be a slight version of 'American Beauty', with a different focus. I'm sure in the coming years we can hear a lot about Dan Harris.
