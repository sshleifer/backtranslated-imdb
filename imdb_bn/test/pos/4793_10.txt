Religion is one of the issues of Buddhism in Bengali movies, as a food for films, as a food item or a person needs very little analysis. You can see a satiric Bonilla in a "La Vaye Lacquet", "Yu Chien Andalou" or "L'Hour d'Or". Very critical and effective among its critics, but when you saw it and then you see a movie like "Najin", then you see this work and later started questioning about his authors. And many have questioned what the discrepancy between Buenel seems to be, but this is not well said, I think there is no conflict in his work, only the views of the Buayanul religion are diverse as unique in the film. <br /> <br /> This beautiful image is based on the novel Benito Perez Galdes, which tells us the story of father Najiro, who had a humble, easy life dedicated to God and helped everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. Wives was also alive, who is a persecuted and abandoned wife. He did not find any sense in his life without his violent, macho people. She has a kind of repulse towards her. On the other hand, one of the cities prostitution. Father Nazario has been stolen again, he blamed Andar's cousin. Andara heard this and tried to fight successfully with the priest, who does not believe in violence. That night, Andara knew that his cousin was a thief, he stole his belbie. Undara struggles with his cousin with fatal consequences. With this, find mercy from Ander the priest. Nazario decided to help her, knew well enough that it could be against her church, perhaps some of these things have some consequences. Because here, Nazario is going to be a pilgrim. Except shoes, nothing is without, but with the spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to stay with him, and he wants to serve God. <br /> <br /> If I see the most beautiful movie of the buenail, it is also the most spiritual It is clear here that the issue that confuses most conflicts with is here, we can not see Buenel against the power of the Church, we can see a Bunuel, whose film is about church but not ordinary - and not super-kittens. Just like Wasseyb, I do not think that the exact word conflict, in fact, I see it beautiful and well, and despite having such religious issues (as its "Witch Lack") I found it a more spiritual movie but touching diversity to touch Catholicism Do not try and it can laugh at other movies. "Nazarine" father Nazareo and his point of view are God and the same religion, but at the end of this, analyzing this person's spiritual life. <br /> <br /> The other two women, not a discrimination, but two other perspectives of good faith. Firstly, our wives, a persecuted woman, who lost her faith in her first life, with her husband first and then with her little girl. This little girl was very ill. Along with him Ander, the judge who executed the trial. In the family of the child, only religious women there is a big pain, but there is nothing in the natives of the father if they do not have anything to do with this city. He blesses the child, later said that he is good. The priest wanted to walk, but Beatriz and Andara restored life to faith and wanted to dedicate their lives to God with Father Nussari. After some complaints, Father Nazario decided to stay with them, discovered some things that ultimately he felt about the person of faith, God, religion and need, who would have to request a charity to live. This last issue should then be mentioned as a possible explanation for the completion of pineapple. At the end we are walking while asking about these things as drums (like "El Aid d'Or") and Father Nazario, when he first rejected the fruit and eventually decided to accept it. The symbol of necessity or maybe, as the answer to the answer to his spiritual road which begins to be priest. Meanwhile, two women must be expelled by father and Andarra for his crime (a beautiful scene where he is a man who helps the father's Nazario jail and then he imprisoned the priest in prison) and he likes Beatriz to be with his head. She behaves badly, because she does not accept that she loves the priest. Here the film can be a unique place to criticize the church - go on protest against the way the church is going to oppose it. Parents, critics on certain issues of religion (father Nazario helps a woman who is guilty of crime) but most of them believe in a story about life and Benjuel. Analysis, and he got it with a really nice, flexible, sweet and unforgettable movie, without any doubt, his best. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the error ... Well, if there is any.
