Alice is like a movie made in the 30's and 40's. Does not try to be an "event". Just want to relax And do it. I was surprised by Cepher Sutherland. An introduction that could be a role, he made it real. The plot is to make alusions to Alice in Wonderland. A guy wearing white clothes does not go through a hole and falls down one of Kiefer. Plots rotate and rotate like Alice, but you do not see in small movies with a single star. I liked the direction, Sutherland, just a very fast paced and interesting movie.
