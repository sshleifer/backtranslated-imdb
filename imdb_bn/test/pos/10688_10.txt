I never saw this movie before it was broadcasted on the local movie final network. This reminds me of the 60th (time tunnel) erine ALEN TV series. Excellent effect (they ruined Star Trek 5 after 20 years, but then it was not very hard to achieve). <br /> <br /> I think the script is very impressive and mature for such a product. They had some touch-ups in order to finish some loose on the character level, but it is surprisingly interesting for a small film (especially in the future of Europe-politics, surprisingly like today's European Union!) <br /> <br /> This plot is actually the twilight zone Reminiscent (as indicated by other users), but in this case it is complimentary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> 7/10
