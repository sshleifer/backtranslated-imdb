I do not know whether the director was the director of the film to ensure that the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful. Perhaps this romantic picture is set by most Americans, as in the middle of the war, Messi has returned from the war (his neighbor asked, "Hey, is it true that you got frames there?") And try to try his life together But one day he got a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and obviously saw things because the surroundings The condition itself reveals itself as a violent anti-Semitism, and Messi and Darna wrap it up. Not funny how the Jews in this film are complaining but how. Also historically correct, as Labor Union Democrats were covered in America and God's flags at this time. Messi is constantly pestered to come "meeting". His presence brings unexpected results. <br /> <br /> One of the contrasts with today's applied time frame is a study. In 2005, the citizens who have reflected the Republican Party as patriotism and their union, and saw the organized labor as part of the left-wing 'patriotic' America. To see the pictures, if you are interested in seeing a friendly, awesome and humble Messi (played by him well), he is a victim of racial hatred and hated between the 40s in NYC. <br /> <br /> A difficult, mentally charged film.
