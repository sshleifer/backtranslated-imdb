Be American, I have been exposed before this character, which is something good because you were disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I did not enjoy any of the stupid silly comedies of American teen movies, and although it's a little similar humor, I could not laugh. I sometimes laugh loudly at a movie. And usually a movie has a few fun parts for me, but this movie was fun since the beginning. It was only when I had the frustration. I'm actually going to buy it in DVD when I find it.
