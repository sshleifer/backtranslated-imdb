I'm not much for the "cop" film, but it seems to be a classic and when I found it cheaper I bought it and it got stuck in a sandy, finally finally it went around to see it and I liked it! Now, you can stay in New York City but it's perfect as a movie setting in winter months. Roy Schidaer is a member of an elite police task group named The Seven Upsus, which has five people fighting for criminals. In an inaugural scene, they retrieve full shoes of money from an old shop, distracting the crew by routinely making "a China shop bread" routine. But that's only the beginning. It seems there are two police, embodied as the police, who are holding them for kidnapping and ransom of the masses. Richard Lynch will be one of these sleaze-bags, and he's weird like before. When one trimmed a limb driver like Limo driver, one of the seven compromises, his cover blows, he beats up the trunk of the car, which may be one of the most exciting car chargers I've seen. Although surprisingly, for the light traffic chase in NYC, it is still amazing that the skiers follow two kidnappers, which I guess, to Bronze and then towards Turnpike and then to the end of the skydiver's car suddenly stopped I have ever witnessed that a Chase The scene is the ultimate one of the most heartbreaking obstacles. Since the Police Police Commissioner knows very little about their activities, Telaider and his men are suspected because they are surprised when they are made by the abducted people, so of course this kind of thinking should be destroyed. The buds & Scheider things are steep till the bottom. Overall a decent police super / drama, really my thing but I like this one. Joe Spinell (psychic) ​​look for a small role. 10 out of 7
