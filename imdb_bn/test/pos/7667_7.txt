Viva variations were a unique hybrid program that was a parody of both and a tribute to the programs it presented. <br /> <br /> This was a mock up, together with Thomas Lennon and Kerry Conne, playing a divorced show, Bij Couple with the 1970s favorite, "The Sonny and Cher Show", which was to host this program together. Forced to be a woman, loudly on men, and continuous barrage of "humiliation humorous" hanging over each other, plus sketch comedy bits and most humble "specialties" Iyakalapa has been described as a performance! <br /> <br /> "Hybrid" was mixed with the truth and imagination. Of course, there was no "Mr. and former Mrs. Lupin" and the program's announcer, Johnny Bluesans was also similarly fictional. But all the acts performed were certainly real, and some were even entertaining! But there was some work that was better suited for the old Chauque Barisse's "Gong Show". <br /> <br /> The program itself was an incremental sketch from "SCTV" (it was carried out after the MTV series, "State"), and some would suggest that it would be better to mix a program such as five minute bits One, rather than single series alone But "Viva diversity" must have a higher mark for the original concept, and it was often weird than funny, but it was certainly appropriate, especially when they moved on the road to Las Vegas and even performed glitches. It is unlikely that we will see something like this again on television.
