Of course the most thoughtful, spiritual deep, intense Hamlet never completed - no other version comes off. It has played Jacobi that all actors have a good understanding of the role. Claudius of Patrick Stewart is violent and still sympathetic - I especially like two dopphas to play Roskranz and Guildenstein. Very desperate and still sinister. Some people might be involved in the need for powerful Opelia - that is not a strong person, that is, and Lala Ward hits the right perspective. Amazing Just amazing - I saw two dozen times each one.
