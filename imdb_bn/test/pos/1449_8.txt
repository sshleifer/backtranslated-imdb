I have not been surprised by this old film. Only "Sierra Madier's Treasure" is good, according to performance. Whoever saw heroin addiction at first, I was amazed at how realistic this movie was. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely inconsistent, realistic, and heart-wrenching. At the premiere of Otro, it is perfect for film, it takes a long time and too much mobile camera. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's performance is good, like Alan Parker. In fact, the whole supporting cast works very well with this film genre as little as a perfect creator. Documentary Styles This photo keeps the photos up to date. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 8.0
