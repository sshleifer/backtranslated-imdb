What was a surprise in this picture. I saw some of the horrors of Phosphian and Jimmy Flickr and I was surprised that this was the same director. He also wrote a screen game that shows that the chap was enough to create a detailed, complex story line. Dubbing on this is not good, but far from the insulting shield whereas hawlers like 'Manhattan Baby' hinders more. <br /> <br /> This picture photography is fantastic. A weird, almost predictive highway focuses on a small town that is killing young people who are seen throughout the film. Unheard of watching a scene of a woman beating, is still refreshing compared to normal movie violence. <br /> <br /> What happened to Lucius? Perhaps there is a strong case that has reached the peak of this firmly and it went slowly later.
