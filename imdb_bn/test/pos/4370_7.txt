Hindsight is a wonderful thing When it first appeared, most of the mockery happened (the famous review 'My No Leika' inspires), this forerunner of "cabaret" can now be compared and it is not half bad. This is not a classic, but it has its own devious attraction, (the movie version of "cabaret" follows this plot when the stage version changes a bit). When Christopher Iswarud of Lawrence Harvey (where the true author's real name knows, what God Ishrod is thinking) describes himself as 'a certified graduate' and Harvey is a completely insufficient 'hero', (he is virtually incomplete), and Shell Winters Forelun Landwier (sadly played "cabaret"), Julie Harris is a totally amazing Sally (it's a beautiful comic Part), and in love with the character of Shelley as a first-rate German-Jewish phrantasa diphrim Anton. Of course, if "cabaret" has not ever happened, you can ask yourself that it can sometimes see the light of day. It may not be quite a reason for the celebration that it has revived but it is all quite similar to the perfectly acceptable.
