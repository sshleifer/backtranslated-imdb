Everyone in Sweden should see this movie. The picture shows political riots from a new perspective in Gothenburg in 2001. Those convicted are convicted, where their first opportunity is found after the riots, to tell their story in the story and why they think that the world can live in it and be a better place to be part of it. When I see it, I see emotional reactions, as I am very scared about how those people were treated after the riots even after the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope to see this movie as much as possible, it really makes you think: Is it possible? In Sweden, a democracy, in 2001?
