In my opinion, this movie is a wonderful example of the reality of the war and the soldiers of all countries who fought in the Bolivarian soil and bombarded them. The lack of violence in any way is different from the story's story. This is honest, true and brave, just like a man who fought in Helsant and died. The lack of cruel imagery of violence is just and right. The men who suffer for the right to freedom, freedom and self-determination in the free and independent world. They never wanted to see this scene again. The incident of Gallipoli is historic. Open Paro-Technics and Blood and Gore view are not shown the worst for UN level acts of atrocities against war criminals. <br /> <br /> The glory of this movie is a glorious fight for them. Conflict with mentality, courage, dignity and inanimate spirits and humorous disasters. This movie is not interested in creating a philosophy to scream at fools. The cruel consequences that this men made from this private clash are not such a thing that those who survive want to watch on a screen for entertainment. They had seen enough at that time, and in the first place it never looked and sometimes did not wish to review these scenes on screen called "entertainment". Cruel cruel scenes of the genocide of war criminals in Gallipoli were sleeping and sleeping scenes for the rest of their natural days. It was painful internal stains, those people who fought those people who were in the graves. They all got involved in the fight and faced many people, they died and, anyway, the powerful heartwarming men were able to smile on the teeth of horrible death because they would not insult their companions and not be ready to die beside them. It is Austrian for the brave players, but it is applied to greater or lesser degrees to all the fighters, but the word from the boys of the war was that Johnny was playing Turk, it is brave, as you ever want for a soldier <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> ANJACA and Turks were fighting to establish their position in the World War, and since 25/04/15, nationalism equality is their own Our claims were notified and the world was denied. The director has created such a wonderful composition that actually respects the souls and memory of the soldiers and acts as a reminder of the future generation of all ages, because children can be taken in addition to fear of panic for the "horrific" visuals and it is a mortal and non-existent application. And children should be present in this film so that they know what happened before they were born on that sacred coast. So that they can remember. It's human nature, they soon forget that.
