I was one of the fortunate people invited to watch this movie in New York. On September 11th, a group of extremely cruel friends associated with the tragedy, how it is a compelling story. This picture makes me laugh and cry and shows me how humans can create a wonderful thing after each other in our darkest days through the spirit, love, and friendship. Movie Maker really captures the passion of the person involved. It was astonishing to see how this story was told in the eyes of so many people. I came out of the theater when I wanted to say hello to all my friends. I would recommend everyone to see this documentary. I'll rate this movie with A +++++++++++. See it when you get an opportunity.
