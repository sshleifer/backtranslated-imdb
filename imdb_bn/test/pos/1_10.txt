My boyfriend and I went to see The Guardian. At first I do not want to see it, but I like the movie - it was definitely my best movie that I have seen occasionally. They portrayed the USCG very well, it has really shown me what they do and I think they should be more appreciated. It just did not teach, but it was a good movie. It shows how the movie actually works and how difficult it is to work. I think the USCG is challenging and very scary. It was a great movie around. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Finally my heart broke but I knew why he did it. The storyline was great I give it 2 thumbs up. I shouted, It is very emotional, if I could have 20, then I could give 20!
