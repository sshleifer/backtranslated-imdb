Brooklyn's nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Haven) is a simple but happy life dancer owned by McGuire, owned by her lover Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silverways) have a show on Friday night: They try to find a pearl oyster order at a bar. Contest participation changes while participating in Vanity Magazine's cover page. He was invited to work on a large theater at Broadway, whose owner offered him. He lost his happiness and started drinking in his new lifestyle, lost the love of Danny and his old friends. 'Cover Girl' is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and beautiful and talented Rita Hairdressing being fantastic part as dance, singing and acting; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, with herself on the street and dance with Rusty and Genius; Songs and dance forms of dance are spectacular. Danny, the character of Jean Kelly, is almost ugly with his chaitanya behavior. Rita Hareth surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in 'Gilda', but she is stunning in the cover girl. According to VHS cover information, 'cover girl' was the first musical instrument, where the song was a part of the plot, instead of being thrown into the film, the story is continuously rendered. My 16-year-old son has met this same old friend at the recent Gene Kelly Festival and liked "cover girl", so I want to say that this classic is not for a film lovers and old generations. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Models' ('Model')
