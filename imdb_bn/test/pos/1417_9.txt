Stephen Hawking is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Seeing this movie makes me feel stupid. But it's a great movie. Very entertaining, but not very impressive. The film is located around Wheelchair, Stephen Hawking, who looks at Einstein's average and discovers his theory and scientific discovery of the universe, time, galactic and black holes. Sometimes or some other person comes at a time when they think that they have found the universe and found the universe, and as soon as they become calm, they will write it all by swearing. Well here's a man who actually held that feeling for six hours. There is a man who is suffering from Lou Gayatric disease, the world has still become the greatest mind in the world. See this and how he formulated the theory of black holes. O of non-SM-fold. You do not have to be the same after you see it.
