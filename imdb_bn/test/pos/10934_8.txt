The first seen this movie sometimes forgot a nice and significant white horse seem to be some kind of fairy tale. But in the context of the story, it is understood that immediate civil war would have to live in America, one must have a horse, no old horse, but a really cool one. And the eagle's wings are like a horse. But a person is another matter to be worthy of such a horse. Who should own it? Native American or advocate soldier? Storytelling against primitivism pits against civilization It has been said by other commentators that it actually took this English director to understand this fact and then could develop this simple theme like a west, which could not be seen in any other way. This film is mainly about the brutal hardness of the animal and the environment and the cutting of living beings from it. Photography and soundtracks are fine. Martin Shane's performance is a publication. As one of Shane's other outstanding performances by Willard's 'Apocalypse Nieuw', the film released in the same year indicates its power that in no way has it been given a free ray. More of sorrow Wonderful equality spread among them in two stories - at least two filmmakers fly towards the souls of the people for the war of liberation. When Wilder was released, I would keep Paik finally in the audience to make a decision. The last word is in the true sense imaginable, and very running; Caution Together it is a great movie.
