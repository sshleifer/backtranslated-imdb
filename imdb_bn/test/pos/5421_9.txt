This is a very funny little movie that did not affect me first. From a completely aesthetic perspective, the animation is not nice here - though after a while you notice that simple and silly draws contain a certain strange charm. Perhaps this is why the script is like a script, it works in animation. <br /> <br /> The image shows an old couple sitting on the Scrabble game table. At the same time they decide on this game or other malicious acts (eg husband's obedience to showing things - even the chair and table)! And all these elements took place on TV's television alert about the debris of Television - Armageddon is definitely here! Naturally, the neighbors are shouting and running uncomfortable - at that time the couple continues unreasonably with this stupid game. Hacks, even their cats know that the end is coming because the couple may be betrayed or can not cheat - which ends very realistic !! The pictures deserve the kudos for both unique and as well as very funny. Although it did not win Oscar, it was nominated for Best Animated Short - which it deserves.
