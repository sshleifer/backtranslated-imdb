I can not comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If God exists, the soundtrack will be released, Elona Shaker's work is really lasting. Even after the twentieth century, I moved away from this generation hunting themes and returned frequently. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds Catherine Morland's entry into the society. A bit of painful and unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (primary lung fiction?) Catherine Mrs. Allen came to the company's bathroom where she met Henry Tillani. He did not tout (and some financially challenged) General Tilly's seat, invited to invite Talenans to Northland Abbey, who had unfortunate confusion that had wealth. <br /> <br /> Where mutual attraction matches the family, the dispute is inevitable. This catherine, combined with a clear imagination, leads her fear for her safety. His last exit is fierce by allegations and complaints by cheating and connivance. <br /> <br /> But the attraction between Catherine and Henry stands in this trial. He provides a happy ending. This final scene is especially compulsory, provided the accompaniment of Ilona Sekakage. <br /> <br /> This may be a "bad" product with a nutritive aspect, navigation, and shiny performance, but it's 88 fun minutes for me.
