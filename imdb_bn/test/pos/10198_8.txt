Scientist Carl Lehmann (good performance by David McAllair) blows something awful in a deliberate chemical explosion. His brain has been replaced by his evil colleagues with almost unmodified metal cyborg suits, operated by the evil emotional colleague Alex White (Richard Cox's completely scandalous screenplay). Lehman embarks on an all-out killer spree. This is a stupid ugly tenant Hunter (divine palm gear is a wonderful disgusting winding). Director Jian-Claude Lord, who previously titled "The Visiting Hours" of the acclaimed Slashar Cyco thriller, has conducted a lot of footsteps with enough embryos and maintained full jupp speed, so that Flickr enjoys trickery Saif-Fi / awful action. Thespian character, Thespe Murri Chachin, is easily nominated for the top acting as the disgraceful Fat Crip Birt, who made a fierce fight with Lehman's pregnant wife Lauren (the winning performance of the beautiful Tieri Austin), in the single most brutal sequence of the film. Stun Winston's Nifty Make Up Adds the overall sleazy fun of F / X and Paul Zazzar's thrilling scores.
