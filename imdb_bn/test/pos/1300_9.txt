Let's face it. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly cliche, Korean romance drama and movies going on. First, there is a pair of long-lost siblings, among which the other falls in love. Secondly, here is a popular girl and two gorgeous, famous boys who fall and fight against them. Third, a letter is suffering from a tragic disease, which, eventually, takes its life. <br /> <br /> Still, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the right actor, this movie will probably disappoint the novel fans. But the actor fits perfectly the role because the film is furious - I can not really stop the observer. Despite its gorgeous appearance, Kong Dong Winn, Li Chung Ah and Joe Han Sun and plus all supporting actors give a wonderful, heartfelt performance to not mention. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
