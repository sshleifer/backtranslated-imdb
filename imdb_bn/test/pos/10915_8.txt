I have seen this movie many times and I will never be sick. It's coming out of a man's closet, he does not know he's in. The character of Kevin Kain is a teacher and when his former students announced the character of Kyle, his village people started speculating whether it was his speculation, straight or gay. If he is straight or gay too, then the character of the kine begins to wonder. All cast acting is absolutely fabulous and funny. I found the movie very funny and heart-warming. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and you feel good about it. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will find a great time to see it.
