Let's face it, many bad movies are made all the time. For those who work in movies, you probably spend a lot of time in these plans for many wonderful time and effort. Sometimes, and this is my opinion, it's important for us to make movies that work only. Tell a story, (no matter how easy and unrealistic). Also, collaborative process is an original characteristic that is unique in movies and theaters. It is necessary to produce any calibra, bring his story to life, depending on his scale, different talent talents. The film is not the most impressive part of American film, however. It is a film maker as a character of its own, which demands our attention. None of them work as models of filmmakers and we've worked. But, I will argue, they are trying to become part of this small civilization of our small portions of this civilization. (Just a very small part of us) these people live under the rocks of their own lives and it is just a trap to romance with the movie romance. This leads me to my next argument. American movie highlights the raw soul of creating independent films. Bad stories (nowadays) say digital films with drunken effects and terrific performance - because they can do with a budget of several thousand dollars instead of $ 1 million a studio budget every day. The difference between lower low-end production and studio productions. The independent filmmaker wants to see a finished product on his Randown TV so that he can create a linear or even an alien story for the shoot, along with the amount of money his own resources and the surrounding resources are investing in. Wicked personality materializes in every art form. I found this movie as a real bright document for many filmmakers. And not, I did not fulfill myself. Man, these people are sunny Their problem seems to be sunny, their properties are enjoyable. The best line in the movie: "OK! ... OK! ... there's something to live for!" Jesus told me !!! "A funny elderly man called a million times. The Hat of Tom Beach. The Chicago Rule.
