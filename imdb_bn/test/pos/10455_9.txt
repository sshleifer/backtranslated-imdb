Perhaps this movie was meant to be fun but nothing. Perhaps it was meant to get excited at nudity among teenage boys. But what I found was really something that many believe. And "nice people end up" From the character of Lisa Bonnet, Angel Heart has a line that says "It takes a bad ass to speed up a girl's heart beat." The truth is. Probably. Women always say that they are flowers and candy and arrogance and whatever. But (at the very young age) they are looking for a good, thin, disrespectful, uneducated person. They know that they can not conform to their beliefs. And that is part of the attraction. After all, what's exciting to be a guy that you already want? I believe this happened to Boise Davidson. And what she has to say about this movie is related to sex and nudity, the party and any other girl who disguises, is your heart broken. It all happens and it will be yours. And that is a firm final statement of that film. But all that said, fun in the movie. It's funny and it shows quite a good antics of antics. <br /> <br /> It is a rare film which is sleezy enough to meet the teenager crowd but knowing and knowing enough to show what it is enough; Would like to get your heart broken. No high school film ever did this well. As I said, I think writers must face the situation in the first place. Maybe we all have. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, but if you sometimes collect a shelf dust from your local video store across it, choose it one night, you will be surprised. A hell of a lot better than it has ever kissed.
