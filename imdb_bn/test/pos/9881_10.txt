Sometimes a funny comedy by the best director, Oz Scott. Eight TV icon lists and goes on. Milano (House of the Boss), Ethhers (Family Relations), Stone (Mr Belvede), Robinson (Night Court), Jackie (227), Di'Obo (Wonder Years), Walton (Mr. Hand !!!). It's one of the fun movies ever. Great lines, meaningless subplots, cheesy, bad acting. This is a group of high school kids who must pass a driver's ed. Night court requires Mac to pass their final test, or he will be fired. Brian Bloom's great acting / risky person, Rico Connor, has a great acting, but b. Wang's Kiki (pronounced key-che). A great movie for all ages, so bad it is good.
