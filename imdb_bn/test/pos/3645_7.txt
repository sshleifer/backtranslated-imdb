As I said earlier, I am not a TV fan. He's just so annoying that I want Sylvester to just eat him and finish it with him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This cartoon once again became homeless and returned to feed from garbage cans. He leaves near a port, stains a cruise ship and he decides to turn around when one tweety passenger travels. <br /> <br /> The ship supplies adequate levels for the following hijinks and tries to catch severely annoying birds and avoid voyages. Once successful by chewing and consuming only once, the worrisome canary is ending forever. However, as a tweety acting cartoon, this one is quite good, but it's all thanks to that bright cat.
