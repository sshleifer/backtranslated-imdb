Even after 50 years, it is still a very guardian movie, say a lot about it. This is more intelligent and attractive than most recent movies of the same intelligence, and it has certain feelings of innocence. I'm not the big fan of this kind of movie, but I could see the whole thing being indifferent, it made good films with a movie that does not share your taste in movies. I like black and white palettes, nice casting, cute cute scenery that guides you to pull the next tactic and end up like everyone else. Seeing the haste sequence, one realizes the power of silence, which unfortunately is unused in today's movie.
