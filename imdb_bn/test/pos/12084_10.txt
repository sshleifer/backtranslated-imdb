I just want to "love my children", when I came to see an entry made by this web site and a partner Briton !! I want a great fan of this movie and I recommend it to everyone. Find comfort for the other's good wishes to find someone else's comfort. I have a boy with Asperger (among other things) and I think that if anything happens to me and my husband, then nobody just wants to take my beautiful 'natural' girl, but my special and gifted son. Being able to relate to people raised at home and with the same value is more meaningful than you. Living in the United States, I still can not take care of this movie. So you read all of this, if you have not seen it, then make an effort to do so. This is a very moving experience, especially for any parent, or even if there is a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry and request it. Then you will count your blessings, and anyone has this experience, or through an experience near this one, my heart goes to you. It realizes how difficult or stressful things can get to me, just remind yourself that there is always no worse off than you. It's an amazing movie and it makes it even more powerful that it's based on a true story. Not that it is tragic, this film will not be abandoned by heart warming and encourages the strength and well-being of mankind.
