If you like Gary Cooper, it's one of his best roles. Do her career properly in her gentle intensity. "Blayde Hollister" comes to Dallas for revenge against Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his Georgia farm and killed his family. In the middle of Hollyster and Wild Bill Hikk's obstacles by the shootout in the streets, Input Martial, on the way to Holistar, is trying to arrest him. Holiston was shot out to get the law closed and he took the "Wing East" Marshall under his wing to stay alive in Texas because they changed the identity. <br /> <br /> This is a great start, and the picture shows all the ways. The action can be a bit "slow" by today's standards, but it is one of my top ten favorite movies.
