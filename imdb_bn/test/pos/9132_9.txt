I think Melville is supposed to be the cold definition of this movie; This is like a great system of thrillers in the late 70s / 70s? LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and deadly story, also plays the role of Dellon, Barryville, Volland and Montand's playground. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Borov is a police who has three cats and a daily routine. Dellon is a hoodlum. Montand is a sick, failed police. Volont√© plays a shirted suspect. LE CERCLE ROUGE is certainly far away from a heist movie; Melville uses her technique ?? Long disparate details in each step of the hest, etc. Yet this special action drama is much better than its other movies ?? And it is very unlikely that they are very good. The look of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very extraordinary to Melville, very Melvillian. <br /> <br /> Dillon was sharp and quiet; Bourville brings his skills, and Montand probably makes the best role of this movie; Its performance has an unexpected warmth. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the letters are sketched, strictly not necessary, and personal. Or mask; The film is still inspired, economic but stimulating. <br /> <br /> Another movie that proves Dellon a very good actor; And he is not a genius that it is not meant to be condemned as a fourth-rate actor. He is good, he may be close to a Boriville and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. Before Le Sean Rouge, at the end of Melville '50, what is a boring Overpong noir pasich (acting by herself) at the end? And just a decade later, here he is in full form, with this wonderful action drama. Stylistically, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Before looking at LE CERCLE ROUGE, I was not a Melvillian fan; Now I think I'm rather one. <br /> <br /> A play in Le Sequel Rose? This means that one action drama is one of the most common styles. Melville score.
