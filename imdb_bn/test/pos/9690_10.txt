Jackass Number Two is the most ridiculous movie of 2006, Sunny Clarke II is killed. It is beaten by one of the best sequences of recent memory, Jackas the Movie in every way. Now, this picture may be the most fun, but it is also the most objectionable, scary and totally hateful. You feel yourself sick of the film. I'm not completely serious when I say or eat something before this movie, because there are chances that it will literally come back to hunt you. Also keep the drink as the minimum. You've been warned because, like a tagline, it will request you to be kind. <br /> <br /> Jackass number two hits show Jacques, Johnny Noxville, left Margarrow, Ryan's crazy men follow. Don, Steve-O, Chris Party Part 'Pontius, Preston Lascie, Ehren McGauhie, Dave England, Brandon Decimillo, and Jason' We Man 'Acuna (Chris Roeb himself is absent' Rabbe ') because he is the most deadly, life-minded, and fantasy rebel Stunt I'm not going to talk about stunts, but I'll warn you that any scene of any animal will be sick or mentally scared and that he will be a casts (not to say) death many times in death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The jackass number does two, so the stents themselves are not, but how Cast responds to them and their work. Make it easy, if they like it and had an explosion, you too (this stunt goes for 99%). All stunts are very original, and their 90% are ever before seen. You witnessed a few recycled ones, but they're amped. You would not feel guided really because of a movie like this, but it does; Jeff Tremine's directive makes the movie so much fun, because he provides guidance on the gang during his comedic times, which is only bright in his part. He could only sit behind and sleep in the whole movie (actually, you see in the picture that he is sleeping through some pictures), but he went out and helped these crazy people to feel stunt funny. I give Mr. Tremaine two thumbs for that. Another outstanding thing about Jacques is the reputation of celebrity Kaiomo, and at this time, they are BMX legend Matt Hoffmann, skateboard god Tony Hawk, director / actor J. Chandrasekhar (Super truppers and bearfirst), actor Luke Linson, Miami Dolphin star Jason Taylor and director / actor Mike Judge (Office Space). Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are among the most entertaining pictures of the film, because this guy is more fun to watch as part of this movie. <br /> <br /> Jacques No. 2 is the most politically incorrect, morally frustrating, and is always the only common mistake, if not the maximum. Despite this, it is so original and so ridiculous that you do not worry about that. You will be gasping for the wind, so smile hard will make you cry, and smile across the entire film out of your seat. Due to the obvious and potentially dangerous graphic content of this movie, anyone under the age of 18 will not see this movie. You have been warned. I hope you enjoy the jackass number two as much as you can. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - SP
