This film gets off to a bad start. An incredibly corny monologue is immediately followed by a brilliantly completed, truly amazing spaceship crash. Then things will be reduced again, as you can understand that living survivors are bad actors (excluding docking pilots and psychopaths) and b) almost everyone fits nicely in their giant-grazing land. Hell, half of them can not even speak in English, preventing listeners from learning about characters. You think that you are seeing "Deep Blue Sea", it seems to "fill the silence of the sheep", reduce the good bits. And unfortunately, the whole thing worked hard to "crash against a desert planet with Hanib lectटर" during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he is not an anthony Hopkins, and he is frustrated by the disappointment of being a smart hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good view of the unexpected survival - but apart from this you can spend the first thirty minutes or more ... <br /> <br /> But then things turn around. I just can not pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets much better. It seems less cut - the scenes begin consistently consistent with each other, and the vin diesel becomes very less annoying and soon he is a show-stealer. At the time the first monster appears, the film is actually quite enjoyable. Read it at night, it's great. Exciting, scary and exciting And even the development of the character of the character of the main character is well done. If you can sit through poor bits at the beginning, then you have some great entertainment. <br /> <br /> Also, visual eyes are sweet, and I honestly admit: I love the color and tone of this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (9/10, only if ...)
