This is the first movie I ever owned in the video, and 14 years later I have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was brilliant twice in her life, Mickey Rooney gave MI Taylor the true level and Donald Crisp was sometimes as strong as Brown. Amy Anne Revere, as Mrs. Brown seems to be the world's most learned woman. After 60 years, the warmth, humor, and tension of the film still affect the viewer; We still love joke, the laugh, the laughter and the love for soul and power for Velvet. I love it as an adult as it liked it as a child. One is required for the collection of each family.
