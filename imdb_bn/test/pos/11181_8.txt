Unfortunately, I could not try any other entry in the series because I can not find any place, although I certainly do not mind and believe me, I have seen. Nobody knows, it's a point and click adventure title. This means that the mouse is what you can do to interface with whatever you can use it, even if it is a mistake in a particular case. I will not loot it here, anyone has tried it yet. However, despite the less experience you have with the computer, you can sit and try it straight away. There are not many bits here where you need to be fast or have a quick response. Hack, you can adjust the speed of the text (if you have subtitles in it), and thus the conversation is in it, and it is not very slow or slow. Easy to access your inventory, as well as mixed or using items. You give three alternatives (this is a person, a specific part or an object around) for what you need to use to click and hold the button to affect anything: hand (push, pick up, open, etc.), eyes ( Test, see, etc.) and face (eat, conversation, etc.). It adds everything to a welcoming, friendly environment, where you can reach lots of puzzles (their quantity is diversified, you try it based on your two-speed settings) and search and accept different dozens, creatively your heart's content. Characters and areas completed. Its length will determine how much time you will take (you will not see any guilt from me, they will be valuable) and your skills to find your skills solutions. There are several points in it where you can decide whether you want a difficult way to accomplish this. This can be enjoyed by anyone, at any age. There is no material acceptable for children. This is one of the products that proves that it is not true that it is helpless to the old audience. Animation is quality, smooth, how it should be run, and the third step is not exactly missed when trying it. The story is well done, and you are never obscured about what is happening. There are many well-defined cut-scenes, the same color, most brightly kept in the 2D world, with good camera speed. "Cartooni" is a suitable word for it to describe, and not only the visual style. It can be applied to all of these. Its entire universe is similar, but not like the past, with our past and present mixing, living by humans and fulfilling things that we can accept or understand at least parts, make fun of them. It must be the greatest power, okay: it's fun. These come from many spoken lines (how it is called), and those who excavate British efforts in oral attempts, the likes of 'Allo' Allo or BlackAd Franchise want to test this cruelty. However, there are different types of jokes, but the following are not limited to: honesty, cleverness, darkness, ambiguity, ridicule, gross-out comedy (not just my opinion) and much more. There is self-awareness, you personally with leadership, and for example, have explained why he is not going to do what he said. There have been pop culture references for decades. Almost all of it works, at least no gag falls flat, and if you do not sew this time, my best guess is that it is not compatible with your humor ... any situation which does not emphasize the judgment, and if someone doubts By doing that it may be the case and want to know, I recommend the demo version, where you are free, you can take care of the brand and / or laughter of the game. Plot well written (almost all this, really), develops nicely and keeps your interest well. The audio is all nice, crisp and well done. The effect of the sound is on the spot. Music is well composed with no exceptions. Voice acting is stupid with a celebrity or two. As Gambras Threadwood (the name that you love) Arto is fantastic, you control who you are. Incredible as Bowle LeChuck, dead (and still threatened) zombie villain. Design works extremely well, highly imaginative and all suitable. Despite the relatively limited nature of our hero, pirate work comes in handy, but you are busy with something. Run a ship, another board that matches, and surprises in a rather unique match, and surprisingly, the way. The playback is mainly in the preferences, timing of the dialog, etc. It is linear, as long as the order goes away there is freedom, so Beaconiyar is second to it, secondly not so big, as far as possible the amount of challenging possibilities, as long as he forgets what can be done at this time. Ah, nothing is perfect. Anyone that delve into a thoroughly disciplined and impressive imaginary universe, and should count on countless times this to get a real kick out. Good kind, do not leave that injury and potentially bruises. Do not forget, kids do not eat * * * books, which are just begging for cutting paper. I would like to assume that those who like others will also appreciate this. And they are not the only ones who can get into this. In addition to the members of the group mentioned above, I advise anyone with any fan of this type of VG to appeal this review. 8/10
