I was not expecting this much out of the movie and I was confronted. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint, and Laura Lynn acted nicely as the main character of this movie. Any teenage can be related to parental control and you can actually express your desire to come to the person, which is basically about this film. Ben (Rupert Grint) when he met retired actress E.V. (Julie Walter) and started publishing his ideas with words. He slowly breaks out of his shell and breaks out and becomes very less painful. Each audience shows up to 75% of the movie's ups and downs in the movie. The film pleases everyone, and I hope that soon it will be released on all US theaters, because there is not a great chance to watch movies until they live in big cities. It must be seen!
