The story told by The Cranes is not flying, by the end, all that original. Young lovers are separated by war; Bad things happen both. We saw it a long time ago. However, we have not seen it well, brave shots that take the liberty to segregate, or destroy, or strengthen frustration. More extraordinary coming from the Soviet Union is not the last word in the Soviet cinema of modern era and Tarkovsky. <br /> <br /> I was reading Chekhov's "Three Sisters" another day and shouted what could be the meaning of this picture title. Law 2A, Mashra denies the idea that we have to live meaningless life to understand our meaning: <br /> <br /> "Must have faith in mankind, or at least find the truth, otherwise life is empty. , Vacuum, survival and not to know why the crane flies, why children are born, why they are in the sky, you know why you are alive, or everything is trivial - mere fool . "<<Br /> <br /> Similarly, Veronica had a hard time believing that the war, and her parents and others, have been in vain. It is good to allocate a meaning, not just for life as important, for living and disappointment. Perhaps this thought inspired him to do his final work in the film. <br /> <br /> Another comment as BTW is a minor fixation - There can be a pattern of V in the film, although I noticed them as I was. But the first letter of Veronica is not another example; In the Cyrillic alphabet, his name starts with a letter that sounds like English "B".
