At the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival, I watched the premiere of this movie and was very impressed with the time when Jeff Harry, a skilled timer, was able to bring this issue to the screen. Customs of the characters are perfectly messed up and allow us to test a senior problem that is willing to die in a warm and humorous "own post". Peter Faulk was brilliant as Morris and the family members and friends supporting groups were completely throwing their role. As a result of contact with families, friends and people outside of Maurice, their parents know about the problems of growing up and their dignity to die with dignity. <br /> <br /> While this film apparently A movie Jewish actor and his family, it really is a movie about all the families. Life and Morris crackle joke during this romance through life of "forces of nature" is fresh and realistic. Childhood competitiveness, adult success and failure, and hope for children This playable is integral. Many people will question how you can create a "ridiculous" issue of suicide, I think of medical and timely treatment. If you are not afraid of tears or laughing in struggling family quips with this problem, you must see this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is the "Best Picture" festival in Phoenix Film.
