The lastest novel in the film "Jerry Lewis" is written by Monoble TV writer Gerald Gardner and De Curuso, which has been "hard work" after almost a decade. Jerry's comedy is clearly an acquired flavor, and confession that he can sometimes be his worst enemy when he's as a producer / director - but even in all his seratom movies, there is always brightness. <br /> <br /> Which drives to be fun, entertaining and yes, quite fun. It's a bit different from some of the Lewis films. Speed ​​is very passionate and it's a lot of great supporters - a sort of Zari Hogan heroes. The whole thing looks like a distorted TV pilot and you will fall in love with it or hate it-- but hopefully you will be ridiculous
