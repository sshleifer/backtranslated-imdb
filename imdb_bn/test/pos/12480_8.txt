The film of Henry-Georges Clujot is an example of a French adaptation film. A movie in the novel obscurity of reality and full-magic and symbolism of postwar cinema. With some stains of American classic films (but not imitating it) the director tells us a story about the importance of love, crime, and perspectives. We can find very good actors (Sujir Delayar disqualified). <br /> <br /> Interesting, how can we find the direction of this movie nowadays? Quai des Orf√®vres Legacy is palpable in Woody Allen's heritage. Plunging a crime situation in a beautiful environment. The finale of Steven Spielberg's good ending film is also ideal. And finally I want to say, during the photography session between Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dori Monier (Simone Reinent), who first admits that she believes that her husband is unfaithful and who just gives pictures with her. That scene is the only one between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nicholls, 2004).
