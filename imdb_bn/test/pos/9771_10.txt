I only saw this play by TV. Although I only saw two series, I love this play. I'm waiting for more series to be broadcast by cable. <br /> <br /> Although it describes the terrible, unreasonable situation of a captive camp, it shows us an invincible spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They do not know whether they can survive, but their expectations are not expected without annoying them strongly. <br /> <br /> I know that this film is not as real as other war chords, but I do not want to blame it for it. It makes me believe in the strongest desire of the people in the most difficult circumstances. <br /> <br /> 'Personal Bills', especially this episode touched my heart deeply. <br /> <br /> I remember every scene. I always hate math. But after watching this drama, I can understand something about mathematics ... its relationship between mathematical past and present, the eternal symbol. <br /> <br /> 'Time, light and memory are made in a circle.' <br /> <br /> Like other victims of the war, she lost her boyfriend's overwhelming fortune. I became immersed in his time and memory so that I felt the same thing. <br /> <br /> She feels a lot of loss but she has pure passion for her studies. <br /> <br /> She started her study camp, the joy of her appreciation, <br /> <br /> I believe her diligent study keeps her alive. <br /> <br /> I have seen this many times, but the meaning of this movie has never been faded. Every time I have seen, I feel the same passion. <br /> <br /> * Their songs are beautiful, handsome, <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can not hear the OS.
