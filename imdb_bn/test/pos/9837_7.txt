Years ago, I did not respect and respect Jimmy Cagney's films as often as I loved him. In the 1930s most of Cassine's films with Warner Bros. lacked the reality and his acting style was far from fine. However, the more I saw these movies, the more I encountered these aspects of my face. Actually, I like it now and hope for them! Supporters of Hollywood movie in the old time probably know what I'm saying - thirteen and other young whiplers! Well, while the entertainment, the mayor can not start from the beginning. Although the concept of a film character like Cagan is running to run the reform school, it is ridiculous, and when he made the changes he seems to have taken it too far, it works all the way and provides a lot of relaxation. <br /> <br /> Instead of Reggie Hood's Gang Pre-Dead and Kids and Leo Georgie, Huntz Hall and Billy Holop, Franki Daro and Farina play the same role. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already famous for his role in gang comedies and one of Hollywood's most paid child actors did not believe. Everything that is needed to be withdrawn will be an inspirational name and a wonderful stereotypical "Negro". Here, he was really good and normal black stereotypes were less than usual. However, Farina and her father, Fred Snowfleck, will be crying towards a very interesting but horrific offensive court scene involving Tones. With awesome names like "Farina" and "Snowflake", I did not ask to warn you. <br /> <br /> In addition to these small accusations and trustworthy plots, the film is exceptional and fun. Kids do a great job, such as Cagney and Doodle Digges play an exciting role as a genuinely hateful but wicked warden. Also, as an additional plus, you will see Warner Stock's actor Allen Jenkins repeatedly his first role for the studio.
