This movie is great. Best acting I've ever seen in my life. Ingvar e Sigur√∞sson is the best Icelandic actor, and of course Hilmari Snyder and Bjorn Junker. Great music and sound. Strong reality about the struggle of a man who has many problems in his life and people Black humor mixed with extraordinary performance and style of this European art film, it works, comes together in the best Icelandic movies ever made. I'm telling you "See this picture, you do not regret it." I gave it 9 stars. If you see an Icelandic movie in your life ... see it
