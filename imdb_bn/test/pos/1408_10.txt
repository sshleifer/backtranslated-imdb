William Henes sparks this story of a brave cadet, who thinks the West Point will be something that he has come. Hines' horror comic performance was his trademark - from 1928-1923, he was a top box office star and one of MGM's biggest stars. Joan Crowford and William Beckwell also fined And although this story may seem fantastic now, it was a huge hit, which kept Haynes and Crowford in a college football (a 20-minute national craze) story. After haynes closed his big mouth, he often switched around by his cadets, he swallowed his glory and entered the big game against the navy, and then gave a wonderful performance. Even with a broken hand, he won the game for the Army and returned to his place in the West Point. This film is easy to show and show people (always with the underlying Marion Davis) Why Billy Hanes was a huge star of that time. He is needed and worthy of remembering!
