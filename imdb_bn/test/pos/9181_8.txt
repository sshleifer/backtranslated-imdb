All right, I must say I'm fascinated. It seems difficult for me: I want to see my power to choose the right romantic comedy so that I do not scratch my eyes or the movie. In both ways, the "hit" was pretty good in darn. Hey, it was good enough to double for me. Smith was fun and good. Kevin James was just sunny, and absolutely essential for the movie. This film is centered around Hit Smith, as long as Kevin James is not the same. <br /> <br /> The story is: Hit is a match maker that helps the girl to scream. When the girl does not want to do otherwise, she creates opportunities to watch the girl. After confrontation, the rest are left to build or break the relationship. He only works on the referral and the process is basically unnoticed. Albert (Kevin James) This time the hit project, and Albert's Algra Kole (Amber Valleta) has eyes on a Paris Hilton type image. When that plot is released, then hits itself, Sarah (Eva Mendes), has a sharp, independent, fanged gossip columnist who does not want to do anything about the relationship. <br /> <br /> Two stories create for some fun moments and they tie together for a bit of a quagmire. Of course, the story of love is behind the girl without being compulsorily abused, misunderstood, or accident. Thankfully, they make it short and unhappy. Hits was a funny and funny movie that flown very well and was walking around without any hits.
