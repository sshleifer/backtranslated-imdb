I'm not too much on the reality show, but this is an exceptional reason, in spite of the fact, viewers are a bit more beneficial than entertainment. I do not have children, but when Superanini's lessons will be very good (and if) I ever do! My only complaint is that this event has been closed in the United States. I liked the British version with Stani's grandmother approach. Is it just me or someone who thinks American version is a little soft? Now it is a "merciful, flexible" grandmother? I think Inks needs a sugar sugar to help us all go down the medication? Still, there is no mistake with happy happiness, is not it?
