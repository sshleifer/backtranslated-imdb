Always Joan Hickson Jane Wonderful as fine, sharp and aware. I do not want to live up to his acting skills because they are appreciated enough on this site. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A pleasure to visit . Moving as a fine and deeply alcoholic - a sad mother who loves her daughter and miss them. A long long shot of his stubbornness (thanks Tucker!) So he could be full-fledged. When I was broadcasting for the first time and I moved again, I moved, now I have a DVD. Bra <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think the travel guide like Joan Hole mat is very funny. She could have it on the extra acting edge but have her role in it. He is very funny, as a highly guided guide who wants to work well with everyone on the bus, I think he is happy. After sitting beside everyone on the bus, his reaction was great ... always: he must take it very seriously for the performance of the comedy, and Ms Hole also did it. <br /> <br /> I hope these two women have a good career (I'm in Holland because I do not know their theater production can go to Google ...) - They have the performance capabilities on the screen. <br /> <br /> Peter
