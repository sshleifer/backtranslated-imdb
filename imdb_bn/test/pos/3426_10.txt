True and coordinating mechanism in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human test. This film is an excellent job to explain the complexity of the task and the great challenges South Africa has made. I believe everyone will see this movie as I think some people outside South Africa have realized their past and what is being tried in the process of true and reunion. Almost every country has some parts of its own history, which is still the source of hatred and hard work. We all must understand the procedure to deal with the past. What is happening in South Africa will point us all. I found it irrelevant, moving and disturbed at times. There was no outstanding performance, but this story added strength. Once again, the BBC has helped solve a complex issue and delete the top movie.
