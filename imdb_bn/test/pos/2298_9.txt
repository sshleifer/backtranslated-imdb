After reading more than just the fair share of criticism for the large number of reviews of different movies, I have noticed a certain trend, strictly judging what people are expecting to see. I think if you go to a movie, you will not have good feelings if you do not expect anything in the open, if you try and see the pre-made values ​​you want to reach. <br /> <br /> I try not to be hypocritical I saw this movie with a very clear slate and open mind, and I was very happy. Since it is not a winner for any mainstream title or award, I do not know what I can expect, but all I really enjoy is something better than the engine scroll. Beautiful animations, deep stories, and always enjoyable nayas hack-n-slashings are very well-matched in my personal favorite animations. <br /> <br /> I will not enjoy it that you enjoy it, but it's just an opportunity and you can come out with a beautiful surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before speaking, what you say will be more beautiful than silence" - Chinese Proverb
