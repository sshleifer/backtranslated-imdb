A tricky story of this relationship and the play of the game shows three main categories of players: Playboy (Max), Manipulative Woman (Alice) and Boca who can be really in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien). <<br /> Max and Alice are very unlucky and probably hateful characters, but those who keep their partners in the dark are controlled by the game. But as soon as the discussions are over, with experienced players like Max and Alice, they were delighted to participate in any way that they were declared right in the game, and not all of them could be less careful. Play another game with your own life and with some other unknown people when another opportunity presents itself. Lisa, Muriel, and Lucien can be someone who felt like making some real investment in a relationship, only they did not realize that they were the game and they were eventually damaged (as much as we have shown that we are concerned .... Who knows that they are not shown to any kind of pioneer players on their screen). <br /> <br /> This is a very fast, deliberately decorated and seductive story by which to cast an enticing death. It is more desirable to think: how real is a game of relationship?
