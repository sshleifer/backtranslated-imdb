On the eve of the New Year, the intense sister of Salvation Army Edited (Asthrodite) urged her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundl√∂hm) to meet David Hallam (Victor Szstrom) on her death. Meanwhile, the alcoholic David cites two drunken people as the legend of the Phantom Coach and his trainer: According to legends, the last year's sinner is the spirit collector and his spirit collects his soul by killing his last year. When David refuses to edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies. When the coach arrives, he recognizes his friend George (Tore Svenberg), who died late last year. George revisits David's offensive life and flashbacks, he sees how selfish and selfish David was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Curcallen" is an impressive and stylish silent film, with great effect (for a 1921 film). Characters are very well developed; However, the story has been dated and there is a strange and unknown situation when sister Edited says she loves David Holmes. Why should such an enlightened man love such an enlightened man who pollutes his life to others? Despite the religious date of the present day, it eventually gives a nice message of faith and freedom. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Caros Fanatma" ("The Phantom Coach")
