I'm not saying to myself that I enjoyed long kisses good night. I'll give it a 7/10. Good: 1. Acting: Samuel L. Jackson almost entertained almost any land. In this movie, he does not play his usual character, the type of control, instead Gina Davis is in control and Sam is in for a ride. His time is great in his line and he is the high point of the movie. Gina Davis gave a great preview of how Samantha Kain / Charlie Baltimore He is a credible action hero and I do not think many other actress Gyana could pull off preformance. 2. Action: This is a very action packed movie. Things are often crashed or blown or others are pursuing others. Special effects are particularly good especially for about 8 years old. I can see some green curtains but it is not too much annoying from acting. <br /> <br /> Bad: 1. Why did half the movie take place to set up the plot? This image needs to be edited at the script level so that it can not continue. Maybe a play or something could run this long but people would really be in full-time movies for it to survive. I think that if you can hold the first half, you will deliberately grab the second half. 2. Gina Davis is cold weather and a tank top but she does not feel cold. 3. Some things are unrealistic. Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after a blast outside the house and then he lands a tree and just right up. When you see this part you will think it's a joke. Overall Fun Movies 7/10
