This picture has "spooky" me, since I saw it at the age of about eight. I'm so happy to have tracked it so it does not know so-called. I was feeling very scared, because when I saw it, I was in the tin mine of Cornwall, so could all imagine. Thankfully, I did not see any ghosts of dead children there, but when I was very young, this film really felt very annoying and scary. I certainly did not forget it, even though I could not find it anywhere. It seems that the films of Children Film Foundation are generally good, but they do not show them anymore. I remember programs like Children of Green No in BBC in the same era - in the same way, they bothered themselves.
