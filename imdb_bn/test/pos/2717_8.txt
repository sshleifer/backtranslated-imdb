Our family and friends enjoyed this movie too. This theme was managed by Shabna Azmi, director of the Great Performance of Konkana Sen, and other Cast's good performances. Climax was well-built, but at the end which was far from being called "good". We were still trying to try what the director meant? They were small in the idea, or were the common film lovers out of understanding? A good finish will create a lasting impression on the viewers and the visitors will increase the ship. However, due to such a relationship with the character Kankana and Shabana Ajme should not accept this loan!
