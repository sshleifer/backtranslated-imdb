William H. Messi is awesome in this Alfred Hitakoque-esque film. As a critic of the film, Messi stars wrongly murdered one of his friends. Ensue letters are lovely. James Cromwell gives a terrific performance as a blackmailing personal detective. As always, Macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance. Watch this movie whenever it's on TV. And check your video store because it does not want to miss you.
