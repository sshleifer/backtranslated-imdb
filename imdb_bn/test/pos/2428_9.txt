I'm not sure as an illogical evidence against Anna Anderson for the DNA test. First, read the book of Peter Court based on this picture. Anna Anderson knew something that could only be known by the original Grand Duchess Anastasia (forensic evidence from Anna). Second, compare photos of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one and the same person. Thirdly, go to the Peter Court website (the URL below) where you can read the detailed information about the DNA test, as well as Franziszija Shanzkoska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (scroll to the link, "Anja-Anastia Notes at Fanziska Shanjakoska"). Even the Shanjkoskar relatives also believe Used to do that their sister and Anna Anderson are not the same person. <br /> <br /> I will always believe that In fact, the same person iha Anastasiia nikolabhanna romanabha and Anderson were brought in, and I will not ever driven in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
