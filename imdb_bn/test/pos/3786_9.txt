This is one of Chaplin's first national films since his glorious mutual shorts and more engaging artists feature. It is also looking for more interesting than the mutual films, to complete Chaplin's comical expression. Most people forget that this film is really a dream that Charlie is waiting for the front. <br /> <br /> The Liberber's cheese is being used by the enemy for gas and there is a lot of pressure in Chaplin's war. <br /> <br /> In this career, the great man became so submerged in the filmistic expression that his films gave the impression of making themselves. This incident was not a suspect, but still, it can be a real realistic view of life from front to back, though I remember it from a surprisingly ridiculous perspective. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, the completeness of the familiar Chaplin's work will be the prerequisite for all the sinaipils - do not delay!
