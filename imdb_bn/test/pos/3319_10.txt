If this is not my favorite movie, then obviously the top five. I love it Everything about this is perfect - clothes, set, line - Yes, how do they not talk to ordinary people, but ... in small scenes on the right, especially girls in the office change their shoes. , Ivy plant in the office, feeding freeze lunch, to know how our officer girls work today as of 2005. I think all tiny letters are wonderful. If somebody like Joan Croftford is at the top, it is all part of the package. If you choose a lot of things in the film, it is clear that it was in the early 60's, as women were not started for "emission", at least if they did not want to do it.

They have met with elements of Diana Baker's character in real-life, which has found the love of her life by accidenting her accidental child - in the hospital there is a large old bandage around her head. This is part of the package, its attraction - shiny palatability. I like the mix of relevant stories today (the person who works with a married woman who is only a married woman), you want her, "Oh, if I just fall in love with the doctor and she loves me, Although he knows the past of my past, and seeing me confused after a terrible accident! "Also, DVD, widescreen received, it is more beautiful than the entire screen ... Yay!
