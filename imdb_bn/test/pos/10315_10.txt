The Three Stugges I always liked that many actors. I love every one of the shorts that I just love about. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shang, More, Larry, Joe, and Carlie Joe)! Shorts were all colorful and also many other great actors and actresses star in which they were shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stoges is the greatest actor ever and the most fun comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These little ones include Dae Green, the beautiful Christine McCaintere, Doris Hawke, Alin Lockwood, Johnny Cassiere, Nancy Sanders, and Emil Citka. Green and McIntyre provide great performance here! There are lots of fun here. This is a very delightful brief. There are three similar stugges that seem to be absolutely husband and I recommend both!
