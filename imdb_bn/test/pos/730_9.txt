The Niemesses game is an enchanting movie filled with mind, submission, film, mystery and philosophy. In the simplest sense, what will happen when the movie is to find the answer and finally you have found them all. North's quest gets dark under a path that will make Sarah Novak even more compelling. The final answer seems to be more dangerous than the price, but Sarah has a lot more to understand. What do you do if you are able to understand the feeling of last chaos in life? <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by JC Warne. Although it was the first feature length of Warne, the film does not reflect this, rather instead it shows Polish and an artistic approach to storytelling. The lead role of Kelly Pope was strong and the watch showed a depth to see interesting. I certainly would like to see more of his work <br /> <br /> Based on the cats, it is a very cerebral movie. It's your thing, as it's me, then I completely recommend to see Nemesis game. Ratings: 4.5 / 5
