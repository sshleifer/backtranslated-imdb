I've read some grumbles about court scene. These people betray their ignorance. The story has just happened in the long run to restore the aspects of this period. Some people are looking outside the court outside the court. Although the performance may appear very stylish, but in reality, it can be created as a director, as it is possible to deal with the person's behavior in certain stations. The expression of the actor's face is a wonderful, especially duplicitous Marquis Changxin and King's mother. <br /> <br />, of course, love to have both the Greek and Shakespeare's sad reflections between the relationship between his father and his father. The King transformed from good to bad and the spontaneity of the killer from bad to good, provides a lot of food for the idea of ​​the evolution of one's nature. This movie will give a lot of thought to a college course on humanity. <br /> <br /> At the same time it gradually moves slowly gradually. One suspect involved a large part of the troop movement, which was quite terrific. It makes the pale by comparison to ring war scenes. Thousands of people in the industry have literally the ability to fight in the war, in the hands of some directors. I remember a scene where at least 30,000 troops are seen moving across a huge plain. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, how much it takes for this photo!
