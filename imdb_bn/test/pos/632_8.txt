<br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV, I entered through the channel and came across this unexpectedly well-made film. I missed 10 minutes earlier, but it does not matter. This picture has literally grip me, it's a real spinal cord. <br /> <br /> The absence of well-known actors in the film, you do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new They will never know when they die or what they will do. So it's more time. Although there are many new faces their performance top class. <br /> <br /> Movie makers play with your mind, just show enough cows for rest. This shock, fear, horror and helplessness also came out well by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Good writing n twist, fast camera movement, chit editing and superb direction make it an extraordinary mysterious thriller. This film actually switches between the generals - horror and mysterious thrillers in the audience's stupid and intense busyness. Undoubtedly comparable to hitco <br /> <br /> I could not even move from TV even during commercial breaks. I was a helpless goddess of this extraordinary movie.
