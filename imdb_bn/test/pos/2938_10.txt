Reality shows, such as "American Idol", were not enough, judges like Simon Cowell painted razor-sharp Barbie to try to make their mark on the music world - many times the singing of the singer was reduced to tears as "poor performance", now it is believed "America's Next Top Model" In the last three years, Bob was attacked by the "Search of the Next Big Things" version, which is supernatural The idea of ​​beauty, beauty, and body dystrophia <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a concept made by Tire Bank, who is a Judge of the Sounds, it is known that some fifteen contestants Gathering and counting yourself as many number of "jobs" that prove their "talent" in front of the camera and are now only Johnny Dickinson ("America's First Supermodel" self-doubled) but equally jet manual and Nor Marie Not only that, one girl who can focus at one moment is not good and blithely rings, it shreds like coffee in the morning in the early morning. Like many other reality-based shows, the contestants are voted every week and their bags will be packed and will have to move quickly (one thing that they reminds of the tire in every room). Of course, there are many more types-in-female, female bonding, tears, dramatic swells on important moments, and some really exciting pictures which have malicious tension in the transformation between the previous, ordinary girls unattainable goddess. <Br /> <br /> I must admit, the show is a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's the state of my mind, but I was amazed where there was a vomororatorium where already thin girls would have to be cut and judges, photographers and many artisan designers would think the right way would be to see. For a moment Even though it dragged me in spite of my previous paragraph, probably because I always showed interest in the fashion world, and always preferred to make the most attractive woman make-up and illuminating it with the perfect light. But I wonder where this growing hard picture is going to shoot with. It's like they compete with "awesome factor". The shoots, such as the shoot tiger, the hidden dragon, the shoot where the models are under water or in an almost impossible situation, what are the sequences of war scenes, what's next: Gestures 70 miles an hour when tied with train in trains as the upcoming Amtrak? Or are they under water, where disciplined, they are trying to free themselves in record time, and at the same time searching for hijacking in Sifon and sometimes their pearls in their cameras do not forget to smile? How is a "Pitt and the Pendulam" version of the picture shooting? <br /> <br /> There's something to do with some cudo, and it's like "American Idol" With that I probably justify the hardness of both the show, and justify its frictional judges - and basically go against my primary paragraph. "America's Next Top Model" is an exhibit which is an extended myth like "American Idol", and it will get the kind of exam treatment they get in the real world of girls, where potential designers and photographers can be maternal as a pixel, as if they were hat They can drop bits, but they will not be able to sell themselves, and where someone chokes them To go out, the other will provide them the necessary requirements. It is astonishing that a girl wants to enter such a difficult media, but they are dreamed. <br /> <br /> It's a big disappointment for the frustration with the departure of Jonny Dickinson in the fifth season. ; During his run, there was a tough barometer about how to walk, talk, reveal, publish, and finally walk himself, sell live products. Twiggy can not just replace Dickins's aforementioned temperament - with the amazing combination of Twiggy I will go where it is. So, in the absence of Janee, the show lost some of its edges and could even mark its slow signal, but in the meantime, there is a compelling pleasure to see the stupid entertainment on weekends for spectacular visitors. Lastly, this is a show that introduces Adrian Curry to Spotlight. Curry has created a name in her own name, whose relationship with modeling is very low, with her only child actor Christopher Knight in her own reality soap opera.
