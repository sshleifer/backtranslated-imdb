Just beautiful It's long No measure Do not wait for anything to happen. Great for a rainy day. Through a medieval crisis, a man takes his family to a different area of ​​the Greek islands. I saw this from my teens and still love it after 20+ years. But I can not find it in video stores. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teen who wants to go home and then settled there. There is no phone, no TV, no annoyance, when it hits the peace, people's condition gets bored and then reflected. And each character does so. Susan Sarandon is a beautiful woman who wants to be involved in sex with the character of John Cassettes, but she does not know well, you know. Gina Rowlands, the wife who loves her but is about to leave her marriage. He is the demand and disappointment for everyone. There is another character in the film, a Greek who talks inappropriately about sexual relations with Molly Ringwell, but she is interested in topics. But he is annoying and horny and I do not like this character. The film's local makes this film so good. It will not work if film is elsewhere. I recommend this picture and can give it a 9 on the scale of 1 to 10.
