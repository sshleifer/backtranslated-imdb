"Le Samourai" (I have now admitted that Gene-Pierre Melil was never top on the classic), I think "L'Circle Rouge" is much better than "Bob Le Flambur". I felt that "Bob Le Flambeur" was an average and influential B-Film, but still a B-Film. "Le Sirakal Roja" proves that he continued as a filmmaker Melville. John Woo is a great fan of Melville, though his filmmaking style is different. While using Woo in operating sense of shooting-out and violence, Melville has a minimal style that best fits her. He is not eager to create fast-paced action films, but made more crazy crime thriller. He was one of the best in that section. <br /> <br /> "Le Samorie" is still his best work, mainly because it has more character development than it is, but at a technical level, they are probably the same. As well, "Le Samouri" had a great lead performance, there are four of these. Alain Dellon is again a very cool gangster on the thief - this person's silence is impressive. In the Buddhist rebel and fledged case, the police superintendent as the inspector. He stole all the scenes that he stole and proved that he was an accomplished dramatic actor (he is known in France as the best artist in Buster Keton Mode). Yves Montand is great as shaky and paranoid gun expert. Jiaean Maria Volante (Spaghetti Westerns regular) has been promoted by three of his co-stars, but he is still working hard enough. <br /> <br /> Again, Melville's side is fantastic. Americans take equal effects from both the American thriller and the French New Wave, people always think about choosing the best shots and corners. It's more slowly than the slice slowly, but it really closes by the end. "Lie Circle Rouge" is a little bit of an absolute classic, yet it is still one of the best musical instruments to be made. Tarantino must definitely meet this before making "Reservoir Dog". (8/10)
