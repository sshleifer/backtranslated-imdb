Looks like the police squad! It first came to ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very interesting show, many spectacular mess, unknown visitors and scripts filled with sound play. In one episode, there was a line where once a man named was shot twice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after six episodes. I think it was worth a lot more, but the network executive felt that this event has asked the viewers to pay more attention due to Gog's every episode. Which I think was the first, where the title of the episode shown on the screen was different. <br /> <br /> The screenplay of Leslie Nilsen's Frank Drebine was corpse, but it was very funny and its role was in the descriptive style of Jack Web of Dragnet. Alan responded well and played some of his portrayals from the Peter Lupus mission: It was not as bad as impossible as Norba, but Johnny the Shawn boy was played by William Duvell. After advising Drebin, Dick Clarke's Demo Joyce Brothers and Dosage Manager Tommy La Sourda was there. <br /> <br /> Although the police squad! There was a brief life in ABC, the JAKARTA Brothers did not give up the idea that the cash was more successful in the movie franchise. I'll stop with regular closing gags. Finish right here.
