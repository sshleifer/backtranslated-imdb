No music No stupid spice Based on a rational realist script of the police system in India and the original "face-to-face" expert in India, Dia Naik. It takes a 56 56 (56th to see how many criminals killed "weeds" - you already know that bit) Brilliance has highlighted Nan Paktekar by playing a role as a relaxed and counting Indian policeman. It is believed that in the slightest criticism, one of Ram Gopal Vermas Factories is one of the films. Movies that are really good or near, and Rock Rock is very good. The top 70 films, commercial and artisans that started from India. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What the hell is saying, the story is not going to say and finally (in the Indian flag) how the police network works. But seriously, like a lining hell is funny (although I do not know that the subtitles version will be funny) the producers are trying for some release, which is interesting First director Shamim Aman (I think his name seems like). <br /> <br /> Again, 55 non-stakeholder brighter away from the role of his shameless scream of past, only a good actor shows what good actors can do. Really good thing. If you are interested in Indian movies and get annoyed with some sophistication of our son, then it is definitely a relief. <br /> <br /> Once again, the guy who happily carries a movie on his shoulder and refers to the style of film - comfortable, fun, intelligent and counting. Good conversation, good acting, all the nice things are all nice aspects. Recommendations: Gangjal, Ram Gopal Varma Company (both Indian flags)
