Forget about Donnie Darko. The reason I open with this seems to be that I think a good part of the reviews read in the box is simple but weak argument that it does not hold a candle in the Darko. It's not that I disagree with the necessity, I think that this movie is completely different from a different animal and is worthy of its own analysis. There are points to compare, but if each key of each film's heart is different then they are peripheral anxiety. In Darko, the description of the driver's power is available. In boxes, descriptive motion forces originate from moral contradictions. Believe me when I say that I can understand the tendency to compare innovative filmmakers and find trends, but for me every new movie is more important to watch for the first time as a spontaneous entity, and then expand my perspective later. <br /> <br /> The box is a movie that you get mixed feeling because it seems to be in a kind of identity crisis. Not sure if it always wants to be. Twists are numerous, but not easy to follow if not predicted. James Merceden and Cameron Diaz play relatively credible pairs of brides on financial straits. A box containing a "button unit" reaches their doorstep and they are aware of the terribly burnt people that the button can cause the death of a person pushing, whom they do not know, and they get one million dollars. One of the things to achieve this box is to awaken this invisible fear that we now have moral consequences. It is an eerie and seductive quality, alluring is still sinister before the button is pushed. Once it is pushed, the events are set in motion, which ask two leaders to question their own morals and express deep regret for their lucky decision. <br /> <br /> The box is a test which is interesting because it gives me a rebel film. If the couples are not pushing or pushing the button, then there is a "altruism coefficient" developer based on the data collected by the radio, then the conspiracy is revealed, we notice that it is finally a compulsory almighty: become selfless or the species will be wiped out. . I think couples do not know the consequences of their actions while making a decision, but they have no doubt that the box can do anything, so why would they choose the best? When we face any problem in our lives, we have only taken care of it that this god has broken? <br /> <br /> The psychological barriers in this film are everywhere. Press the button or not, it's probably messing up with you. Take money or not, nobody gives anything free. Search for the truth, your answers slowly reveal your death. <br /> <br /> I suggest that the box is a satirical act, because it gives false pretenses to free will and reveals that we are stuck in many metaphor boxes. You can be free from the life of others, that freedom? No, this is just another box because you fall prey to the consequences of your morality. Another box that has no escape for us and that's because we live in the world. This is precisely why the outer people of the film are finally antagonists. They claim that we loot our freedom and meet moral standards. We made good, and it was burned for us and became a slave in a sick sport. <br /> <br /> Jean Paul Sarther's references represent this point rather. "You can only enter the final chamber free, or free." Sure, but there is no problem in the chamber we enter, but it's a chamber. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemathe
