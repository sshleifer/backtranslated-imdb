I like this movie. First of all, I did not expect much of this movie since I did not talk about it and it went on in the video after it was opened in theaters. I do not have to do a good on-screen couple of David and Miny. (I've got much hope from the screen couple seeing "I've got mail" with Tom Hendes and Meg Ryan and seeing "Saille Sliels".) Personally, I think Richardson will play Minnie's part in the jail and vice versa. I do not know, I think Joel will have to stay in the movie with David. They looked perfect for each other. But in just one picture, the girl next door door always gets the guy. :) (Like "when you were sleeping".) Even though I was very wrong. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything is brilliantly done. Bunny Hunt did a great job of directing. The lines were perfect with intelligent cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** Alert: Spider Ahad !!! *** <br /> <br /> I love how everything intertwined with each other. For example, at the outset, Elizabeth and Bob were going to Italy, and in the end, Bob would show Grace in Italy. He is also an example of doing things with Sydney (AP) hand as he did with Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Note: Spinners are now finished! *** <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like about the movie was that it was a little uncertain. Well, I do not think a man could get his wife in one year in a year when she was the only woman, which she was with her whole life. You feel that even after talking to someone in your own house, you will be separate from yourself for even a few years. Instead, he goes blind in the dark after one year and * at one moment he loves a woman he has never seen in life, but feels a connection with him. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was a fantastic movie. It was crying me two or three times, and it laughs me countless times (the bottle of water for the bottled water was fun with the restaurant scene!) It is clearly there with romantic-comedies like "Rome Times Mail", "Sliding Doros" and "When You Sleep". <br /> <br /> Rent it today !!
