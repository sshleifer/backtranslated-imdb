OK. To enjoy this silent comedy, you must suspend the movie about the initial starting point of the movie. If you can not do this you probably will be able to score a low score. Charlie Chase has a huge overbite and his wife has enough big to have her own area code in a nose. Unknown to each other, they both have been preserved in the surgery to correct these errors. Apparently, in the 1920's, plastic and dental surgery was even better because these major surgeries did not need any recovery and they were right then! All right, remember I ignored it, did not I? Okay, then you have to think it is difficult to believe the idea so that both can meet and no one else is their spouse. All right, ... now you have allowed yourself to take on this two stupid premises, the film really gets, really good. <br /> <br /> Charlie passes beside her and she passes him. Both are frustrated and thrilling because nobody ever thinks they are attractive. So, because of this new horror they agreed to go on a date. But, they roam in two houses - do not want to know their spouse! However, they are later seen and attracted to each other. But what about poor husbands sitting in the house? Well, both of them can learn that the other has got married and both expect their marriage because they really want to stay with each other! At the end of the film, Charlie showed that the girl is really his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both lover and old man - changing his clothes and lying to the husband when he plays! This is really a laughing riot and fighting with other people while traveling around the house! You really have to believe it. However, an image with Charlie appeared before and after the picture and knows what was happening. In the end, they both feel stupid!
