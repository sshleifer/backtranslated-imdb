Why did I vote for this movie, which just stopped *? Quite simply because if you find yourself funny to it, you can just laugh till you gag. Some people may go too far, it's not for everyone, but whenever I'm down and smile really need to be a bit stupid, down or in GHP and I can forget all my troubles and transport a magical dark and weird In the world. <br /> <br /> * "Fully Closed Hats" is an Australian expression, it has no literal translation.
