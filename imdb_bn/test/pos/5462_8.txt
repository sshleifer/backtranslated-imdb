All right, so maybe the disguise of Jay Leno and David Letterman is not clear, but you still understand these people and how they work behind the scenes. Bob Balaban and Titt Williams are excellent as Warren Littlefield and Michael Owitz. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and not the fifth, but it's still funny. Especially as the manager of the Cathy Betts Lane. <br /> <br /> Interesting, amazing, interesting, very watch, it's a good TV movie.
