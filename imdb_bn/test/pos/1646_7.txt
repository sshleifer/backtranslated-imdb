This is not a bad tv movie. Shtrafnat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means fine Batallion. Such war crimes took place because of the increased demand for the soldiers, because the Soviet Union killed a large number of people through the war. In this battalion, criminals and insulted soldiers were included, who had the opportunity to clear their names by proving themselves in war. They were looking down as a scam and were expelled easily during the war without much honor in the military part of Afghanistan or many. They are often sent to suicide missions and are subjected to extreme casualties. The execution was done in the eyes of those who refused to fight. Not saying, their lives sucked. <br /> <br /> There were some nice performances by Cast, especially those who played Antip by Yuri Stepanov, who played Aleksandr Bisirov, who played Stirah, and Roman Mamanov who played Major Kharchenko. However, the series is not really addictive because it is too long, it can be very small and functional. <br /> <br /> Although it is about war, there is very little violence and much more violence. It is entirely dependent on the actors to work on it, and finally, it's a TV series, so the producers do not want to scare the viewers and the sponsors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Personally I want to be a fascist, then a communist is given the situations presented in the film. One character explains that Soviet has cleaned his farm and his family has died from hunger. He was arrested in order to destroy the property of the clamor and he ended up as a criminal in the Battalion convicted. Antip remembers how to feed the rest of his family killed his mother's youngest son. Both men had explained that they fought for their motherland rather than the Soviets. <br /> <br /> There was a Marine in the Battalion, who had raped a girl, killed his colleague in feasibility, threatened others, comrade threatened the others about him, and hit him while fighting. She committed suicide due to shame. I think enough Marine has seen this movie whether they ask for formal apologies to street or outside projectors on the street with banners and riots. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> To say the least, I do not think I lost my life 500+ minutes.
