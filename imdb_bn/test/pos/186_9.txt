It's a fantastic, and impressive film in many ways. I saw on TV as a little boy, my throats were often covered with tears, and again nicely restored standardized DVDs. <br /> <br /> The Cranes are very free of war wars. There is no music in the Chamber's Chamber and there is no color, or no class water bridge with consciousness. <br /> <br /> The cross between Vivian Leigh and Bijora is influenced by Tatiana Samolova as a beautiful girl who is deeply influenced by whose mother tongue is written and does not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very brave , Because very close to "above." But that scene will be with you. <br /> <br /> While the Soviets were so defined by WWII, the film was quite vague, and more powerful for it. Pre-war and post-war scenes have a very similar sense of 1957. There is no endeavor in time. In the Siberian view, which seems like a modern opera set (a complimentary), until the whole film is even more stylized. The cathartic final scene coincides with its last drop - again compared to Cherbourg. Production seems like a big budget (those stairs will cost a superb cough) <br /> <br /> go for it. Do not expect a bitter socialist pill (of course, very sad). Crane Flying is an impressive part of the world film, a great deal of where and when it was created.
