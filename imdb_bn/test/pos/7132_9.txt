I saw at Indie Jencon screening. I had some time to kill and decided to check it. It played a packed stand-room - only 1000 people in Bali. <br /> <br /> Wow, what a journey! The script was tight. Action time Pacing is perfect. Character exploration is excellent. One thing that I really appreciated was that you did not know it was a big budget film. Yet it soon became apparent that manufacturers could make their set and effects as far as possible despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It is true that this movie was targeted at specific viewers - gamer / tablets - the makers did not make any effort to hide it. But other filmmakers can learn a lot from them. After the scene the scene is going on for Jaguar and does not raise the concern that the mother will be seen to be "get it", they again get the biggest smile of time and time. But there is enough universality that laughs even mom, even if she is not funny. I think many times I am trying very hard to see movies that try to reduce the lowest universal majority, so that they can appeal to most people, but the film only condolences for it. <br /> <br /> But this is not the glitch. In fact, the film was so difficult that the viewers were covered with trash credit around its finger. And, when the audience around me * really wanted to like the movie *, they were not pushovers - the gamers could be the most important place there. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy to see this huge crowd At least 10 times the audience had such a good time that they looked at the comedy or scenes during the movie. How often does screening happen? It should be no surprise that when the closed credits emerged a huge scales. <br /> <br /> In my own part, I can not wait for this release. After it's finished, one of the producers said that they are shooting together for a TV / DVD release. That date can not come very soon.
