This show was really a good way in many ways, though certainly a cavalier Western Hero (?) Wandered on a motorcycle instead of a horse, due to the settings of 1914, the "very late" for the West, which should generally be set between 1866 and 1890. I think there are some debates about the cancellation at this time, but I did not really see it during NBC's time. When I came to see and love it, I was in the military in Germany a decade later and this was shown every week from the beginning of the armed forces television. Then, Mart Kidder was famous as Loose Lane, but I always remembered him as Nicholas's girlfriend. In many ways, Nicolas was much like Maverick; Both were attracted to being rich with little effort than the war. It was in the small TV Magazine that they delivered on PX (actually not an approved version of "TV Guide" but it is as relevant as possible until the problem of copyright) that I learned the true story of the first cancellation. I was really surprised that in the next season the more violent Joint plan they had as if it were really like that. Of course, TV's "Western era" decreased for almost a decade after the show was created; One day I will be able to write that the "reality age" has decreased for that long! Although "singing" and "sideways" were still running, they were both close to their end and it was years after a new Western really caught; I think this trend did much to reclaim "Nicholas" and NBC officials suspected that it would find a big audience, but to me, a good Western, in contrast to a show set in contemporary time, was somewhat timeless, other "time" As show; There is nothing like changing fashion and showing more "dates" than any "date" like them and I think it has been shown 10 years after the show, what exactly has this issue brought to me. Also, this show is a primary pair of Garner and Stuart Margolin, which is actually one of the best sidecaps, and not just the West.
