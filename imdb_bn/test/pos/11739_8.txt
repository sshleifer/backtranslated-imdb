In the second view, it is still a wonderful romance which, in my opinion, is much better than the movie that is associated with my 2-DVD set, Leo McKeary Rody is the classic "one thing to remember". Yet it seems to be missing out on a little (only 6.6 ratings on IMDB, and many critics are dismissed as "Guay slash"). Sorry, because Jennifer Jones and William Holden have an intelligent romantic drama that works very well with these two wit, how sad. If the film should be well-remembered for extraordinary color films and unforgettable music scores. I do not like Valentine's Day much but it gives me an excuse to see this movie again, and I'm happy about it. Although I still think Holden's character has been very much predicted, taking the suspense from the final scene, this movie is very running and I really enjoy it.
