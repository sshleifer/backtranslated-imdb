This movie is a perfect example of Barker's cinematic gifts in the Harker / Giant genre. I think this movie has done a great job to keep an eye on the look and appearance of the novel and comic book (or, actually, the comics might be second, I will forget). This movie was made for Barker fans. It helps to read the book in advance, but it is not important if you can follow a movie. I've seen anyone reading this photo, read the book, then watch the film again. You could find a new honor for the movie. I've had a big fan of Barker in this movie, and before reading the book, I liked this picture immediately. This movie contains great chemo, makeup, writing, instruction etc. This movie shows some giant / horror movies sadly failing to see the monsters. They are in full color, are not hidden in shadows and take most of the screen times. Like other films that use to hide animals in a light of loot or curiosity, this movie celebrates extraordinary and puts them in front of them as a good person. Clive two thumbs up We are always waiting for thief :)
