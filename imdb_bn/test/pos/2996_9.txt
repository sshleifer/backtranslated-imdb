When I saw this video in the video on the DVD Store ... it made me plot. I thought that I was in love and at the same time I was young at the same age (although I realized that they are now old enough to be my parents), and the soundtrack written by Alton John and Bernie Taipei "made it big" here in North America Before ... I think I had nothing to lose by buying it. I was not frustrated <br /> <br /> <br /> Until now, I've shown many people from the date I came from, and my current boyfriend ... obviously, they could not find it as beautiful as me. .. It's a "chick" cinema call ... but I still smile and cry. This picture is widely ignored. It's good to hire one of the local video stores here, so other people can share magic. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's taken a little bit away ... but it gives you an heartwarming sense of innocence ... and new faith in love.
