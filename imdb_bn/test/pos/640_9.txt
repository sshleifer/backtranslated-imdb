Billy Hughes is a silent young girl who is working to make a cheap horror movie portrayed by an American director in Moscow. One night, Billy was locked in the movie studio. Later that night he heard that somebody can stay in the building and can test it. When she killed a woman brutally killed, she heard it. After fleeing the murderer's back, Billy told the authorities that men had to face red only when it was a work. Billy knows what he saw and soon his life has been in the underground fingers, believing that he has some importance. <br /> <br /> I do not know how much this heartwarming sleep gave me, but I thought it was an old flick. Although there is one thing, it is mostly the worst, and one of the intense thrillers that I have seen several times. It's just a great mystery maker and mostly clicking on everything! The first half of the feature has your heart in your throat and with a atmospheric undisclosed environment of isolation, our clouds cling tightly. This underlying is a ridiculous dark black saliva. False pops up in the story, because it can lose the fierce firmness that could be lost in the fire replay and the characters of Ivan Richard so quickly and foolhardy comedians (or good potters' comic reliefs), which can be very strong. Long run, probably could work without it. Despite some cringe moments, this aspect does not hinder my joy. For me, the soft finish was not exactly right they decided to go with. <br /> <br /> Interestingly mysterious firm was eerie from the bones and packs some unsettling products. So there were so many aspects in the context and its thrills, how they all became dramatic and nervous holding and unbearable tensions were suddenly divided into a series of rolling rolling and rolling rugs. Indeed, they used the concept of novelty of this disability and gave place to foreign countries to reduce the situation, which did not speak much English, and so we were caught in confusion. Dramatic Marina Juddina The silent girl Billy of America gives a frustrating screenplay. The way he was able to show uncertain passion through his eyes and actions gave it some ugly and credibility. Director Anthony Waller has blossomed with his sterious, good time and skill, the hard look that is strongly negative for you from his strong surroundings and a strong wind music score. Alex Guinness had only one real name to look at a small camio section. Cast performances were all right, especially the nail-cut Oleg Yankovsky and Egor Volkov became Russian figures. <br /> <br /> The features of this ornament are mostly unknown, it is better than average darkness. Thriller Highly recommended.
