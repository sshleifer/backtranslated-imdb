The show, like Night Stalker and then X-Files, creates a fantastic situation and the original characters have to solve it. On the contrary, the hero (es) did not hold the empty bag until the end. They were usually real results. It was also clear that 'good people' was a dirty profession where sometimes they kept dragging some ugly things. Imagination, intelligence, acting that does not always take itself very seriously ... I miss it. One of the reasons is that, I have pressed hard to think about many programs - excluding the banner - which is the acceptance of the viewer and their attention directly from the bat. The authors are exceptionally good to set up, unless it is impossible to find an explanation of the letters in the impossible circumstances. Explanations that often take up to 90 degrees become unexpectedly, all of which are still sensible. Very, I agree with other critics that the Anabal character was somewhat unused, but when he was on screen, it was not only for the eye candy. He was very good in his own right, and when he created this for the man, he felt that he stood up to two men of the man. That day is a rareness. Sullivan? If he is not in the division, he is working for KGB or CIA. He's kind of cold, ruthless kind. He knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job. King? It's clearly a game of him. One excels at parleys in the concepts for detective / spy novels which he wrote as excelsible 'real' work and. He is probably the most fun to see for three, although they all have their moments and often. I agree that there was a lack of original interest in the final off-series featuring only his character.
