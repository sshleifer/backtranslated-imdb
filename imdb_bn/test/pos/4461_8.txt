Lucio Philli's "Door Torture at Dcling" picture is an extraordinary portrait of Sicily, the small town of the angry city of the annoyed assassination of small towns. Two amazing real-scenes scenes of atrocities and cruel violence by the entire atmosphere of this wonderfully well-known film (especially compared to the next Florian's gourfest). Immediately death children are undoubtedly portrayed as cruel and rising pipings. Nun Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) will believe that Bruno's sheer seduction really will be seen. Specially recommended - especially my other favorite "House with Windows that Huff" (1976).
