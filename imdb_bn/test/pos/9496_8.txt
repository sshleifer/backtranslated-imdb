I was really good at this movie. It's finally shown to the viewers that Lella should keep her in the end. Lila was sick of her husband Jim, who was then more worried about her work. He was so in his work that he forgot their anniversary. She was very drunk. She could not accept it, so she left to see if she would miss him. The film shows that he missed him, even trying to do the same night that he compromised. She went to her and tried to bring her home. He ended up finding another man called Schuyler. He felt like a man that he always wanted good wishes and gave his notice. Eventually, he looked at Schuyeer's shoe and decorated with the same thing as Zigar, showing the way to his cigar ashes. Jim stopped earning lots of money and cleaned himself. Lela thinks she has to keep her husband in the end because she wants what she wants and she changes.
