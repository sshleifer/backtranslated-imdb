Vigosho, Mexican Viagra steals; A beautiful girl who is trying to rebuild her life and wants to leave her husband, a head of the Italian Mafia; A young Sheriff who falls in love with her old sweetheart. This is a plot called "The Shipments", which is a comedy based in the country's small town Paradise, Arizona. Despite its simple and classic tales, the film (directed by Alex Wright) has its fun moments: When Elizabeth Barclay (as a Candy Porter), Vigaroso looked at the deer pillar, "What is it? A Mint candy?" Or when the girl is at Sheriff's house Enters and finds her nude completely. Or when the WiiGooso shipment ends in the end of the lake, in the end of the lake ... Cast gives some excellent performance: as Matthew Sherman by Modine Paradise, who still loves his old girlfriend; And Elizabeth Berkeley, whose character still loves her old lover ... Cast Cast with Nicholas Tarturo, Paul Rodriguez (as Mexican Jose) and G. Michael Gray (what kind of ...), makes a fun work, a very oscar stuff No, but not too bad. A funny comedy without a lady.
