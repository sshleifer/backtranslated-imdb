Well, I would say it is a very enjoyable and somewhat sensitive movie despite its flaws. I do not believe for a minute that Matthu knew the first thing about being a dentist. Also, Haun's character was quickly restored from the suicide of suicide at the beginning of the film. Not to mention the whole thing is rather ridiculous. However, the film is successful due to a good speed, humor, and its stars. Matthew may not be a dentist, but he was usually as amusing as he was. Bergman came with a big deal of sensitivity in the film (especially during the scene where he and Methu are going out to drink at the end of the work) and also made a humor. I believe this is his performance which shows my brother a couple scenes of this movie. Hawn's performance is significant, although an Oscar may be on doing it a bit. Basically, do not take this movie very seriously and you will enjoy yourself.
