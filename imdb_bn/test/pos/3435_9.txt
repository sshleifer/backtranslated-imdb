'Schenbart' is the most fun movie coming from the Swedish movie industry, not just Peter Dal. In December 1945, it is a black and white film to get some of the atmosphere from the day before Christmas, which is very good. Almost the entire plot is held in a train, non stop in Berlin. The famous gay actress Gustav Hummersen has mixed mix of gay, non-exiled refugees, murderers, alcoholics and literary criticism 'Gunner' in the train. The main role of 'Gunner', although its motives are for optimum aspects, but it seems to drag everyone around him, very funny, disaster, and living hell, especially for the Finnish war, for him. Homemaking, the wounded soldier has played by the very funny comedian Robert Gastfusson. The train is also a doctor who cheated his wife with his wife. They plan to kill the doctor's wife together with the same train, without any knowledge about her husband's will. Will the doctor's wife reflect the plan to kill him, and the rest of us will unfortunately remain 'genuine'?
