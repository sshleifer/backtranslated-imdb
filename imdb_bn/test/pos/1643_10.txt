How nice! It's hard to say my feelings for this episode. One of the best mountains in the season to ensure ice. It's my favorite of the season. In six people and a clusterrophobic structure, the dog is separated from unknown creatures due to isolated rage in the middle of the unknown, the play can not get better than that. Paranoia even ruled supreme like Muller and the school, each other's suspicion about terrorism. I complained about the similarity of 'Things' movie of this episode. I did not see it, so I do not know. Madar and the school are really more valuable than the ice to test their developing faith. This episode is ultimately intense and suspicious. You will not be disappointed!
