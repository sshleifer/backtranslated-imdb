I agree that these pictures were spectacular. The ray Charles did not take the ray of Charles Ray's fame in Fox, yet Ray Charles's essence really made the film. His life made a great story and finally it is said that it is good. Houston Channel 8. Kuht received a good interview with Jamie Fox about Arnie Manaus's role from Houston's Channel Internal Interview. Link http: //video.google.com/ videoplay?

The only problem with the film that I can mention is that the shooting style was rather soft, but in the end I think it would make Ray's view more realistic and watch the movie instead of Ray Charles.
