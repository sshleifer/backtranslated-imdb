"All people are guilty," the police chief said. "They were born innocent but it does not end." Add this bit of Nililijam to the idea of ​​Jean-Pierre Melville's impressive code and you have Le Siracal Roose. This code of respect in crooks, however, is not simply a cliché; The film's morals - realistic moralists, most romantic morals - by their perspective, started to create films on this subject, and even a picture of imagination. Their theme is that it does not do that, but how to do it. We often bring experienced stories to experienced people with their own respect, with stories about fate, lethality and code-driven things. <br /> <br /> Except for screenwriter and film director for most of humanity, it can be a way of life, raising their own children, and becoming a good friend. This is something of a self-proponent of psychological fatalism. Le Cercle Rouge, in my view, is a classic movie for those who can secretly enjoy the courage of the absence of the last bus. But Melville's Le Samoire - In my opinion, the collection of stereotypes, style dominating stories, Le Serekal Rouge, plays a great strategy of mixing style with strong stories and compelling actors. The point of the movie, in my eyes, is meaningless ... but the film itself is the first class experience. <br /> <br /> Melville's three coincidence - Corey (Allyn Delaney), Vogel (Zia-Maria Volt) and Jensen (Yevs Montand) - are based on some knowledge that perhaps Buddha is determined to meet the men. They can not change ... with their fate. Probably, some do not believe that Melville himself is thinking about the word itself. However, we know right at the beginning that this movie will not be happy happily, it will depend on luck and reconciliation for setting things for us and while we are in high school, we will remember the nihilik philosophy of discovering and love. Corey and Vogel met once and then gathered in Jansen's unique role, we left a one-way street to loot an exclusive, widely protected jewelry story in Place Vendome. Tension is arising because we do not know the French police after only Vogel, we also realize that after some strong betrayal. <br /> <br /> Dylan, Volta and Montand were very respected for their character, and Andrei Bovaryl came up with her character with intelligent brutality, Police Captain Mattey. Melville hooked me as he developed these characters and their own circumstances; He mentions me mentally and then brought me to realize my potential fortune and let me see it. Melville set up his set piece - escape from the train, escape from the wood, after the shootout in the woods, meeting with Mattei and informing a man who - with the possibility of exploring. He always makes tension in his time and takes time; Making movies is a rare feature and even now even a rare feature. And Melville takes time to build Mattei as a person. Matthi is a tragic, experienced man. He is a loan He keeps a regular routine while returning to his apartment - he lovingly cares for his three cats, he draws his bath and when he fills the TB he sets the food for them. I do not know who can meet Matei, but I hope she likes cats. <br /> <br /> Nililj is always creative among some creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it is a very difficult task to keep Nihilism aside and not harming many people easily. (And it is more challenging to show in a film compulsively.) Le Sirakal Rooze is a movie that tells me a little bit about me, but in its own way, I think, putting together beautifully films.
