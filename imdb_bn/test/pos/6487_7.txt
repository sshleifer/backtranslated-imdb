The Society's successor Susan Flachter (Hopkins) and her wealthy father Simon Flachch (Henry Stephenson) are worried that their father (Susan's) after their uncle uncle John (Mills) died at the village of Joan (Betty Philosone) and Keti (Mariana Stirli) in the village of Greenwich. Sister and brother of John). Simon has tried to use him and Susan to take care of the children and to use private detectives to keep him in a state of overwhelming behavior or unemployment, and therefore unable to properly care for the children. Susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and to act in Greenwich Village, to act as an actress, to get information and / or to point out her opinion. However, he discovered that he just does not like the free and artistic lifestyle John and his friends are alive and the girls are being raised well, but he quickly falls in love with the public. Inevitably, his real identity has been discovered and he is facing it to satisfy both sides of the Hefazat controversy related to it. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie, and it was very short running time (70 minutes) to have this perfect but humble story spin perfect length. Maryam Hopkins, the 1940s best actress of 1930s, is delighted with the film. Her strength, style, and disciplined beauty really lends itself to creating a respectful character, even though you know that she quickly pulled friends quickly. This is the first movie I've seen Raymond, and he is actually looking for young and non-Patrician. (And apparently three years younger than her co-star) "Weevil" was a refreshing change for her usual, dark, panic, affecting her energy and careless methods. Actually, even though I'm not usually fond of child actors, I really enjoyed two young girls who played Susan's daughter. They were heartily steadfast, and were really the jewels of the film. Unfortunately, I can not dig any other movies that some of them later, which was shameful, because both showed natural talent. <br /> <br /> The film was made three years after the establishment of the "cute girl" Hollywood code, and with a slightly faster, happy ending and high-color pie in the sky and the characters were easy to live with. The alleged Bohemian Co-op was a fantastic cool-de-sac where artists lived for free or for business and everything was very nicely added. Thankfully, it was a light enough film and the letters were attractive enough to create flexibility for their flexibility and short-comings and I was able to accept just "cute girl" for it; This is a good old-fashioned love story that was entertaining because it was respectful. Unfortunately, romantic comedy / dramas today's movies are less intelligent and entertaining, or I will not be going back to classics continuously. 7/10
