By adapting his novel "Cable" for the screen, the author / screenwriter / director Clive Barker made this amazing story of this strange story and fiction. Craig Chefler plays Boone, a young man who suspects to be a serial killer. The police shot him dead by showing him a graveyard in front of Madian, which is a refuge for the monsters that were actually stuck by society. When they claim Boane and make one of their own, it creates feedback for everyone, including Boone's sweet girlfriend (very intelligent Ani Bobby) and a suspicious psychologist (most enjoyable David Krenberg). <br /> <br /> "Nightbride" shows wild and fabulous fantasies that I do not often see in movies. In this case, Ralph McCracky, the old hand of the conceptual industry, works in movies like the first three "Star Wars" entries, helping Barker to create an excellent scene for "nightbrands", which starts order sequence of opening. A wide range of visual and makeup effects, and production design and cinematography is quite impressive. Bararker and crew do an excellent job creating this whole other world with compelling characters. It's colorful and bright entertainment and a pleasure to take it. And of course, there is a strong connotation of social speech about intolerance and prejudice, not to mention the consequences of a person's fate. <br /> <br /> Add great support performance fun. Craneberg sparks many ugly intentions and real gas as a bad doctor, when Charles Haid is a good-love-hate-his rival, rather rather a bad police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley gets buried under heavy makeup as tired Lylesberg again, and hard as a rock. Haurus Ross is great fun like Norsis, just like Catherine Chevalier's Rachel (as an extra bonus, she gives a spear to her breasts). In the first two "Heelryer" pictures, playing "Butterball Senobe", Simon Bamford, is also active here. 50 and 60's, by a science fictionist John Agar, there is a cool movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman provided one of his finest scores, and Barker slowly led us through a mysterious story about a great mysterious showdown. <BR> <br /> <br /> "Nightbride" is a great painting film to verify that no one has seen it. I give it an impressive recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
