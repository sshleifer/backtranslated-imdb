Vampire stories are your blood cup, but this Goth-Fest should prove to be a satisfactory experience based on the Anise Rice Vampire Chronicles. A real consortium of contemporary 'Contemporary Queen of the Dead' directed by Michael Raimer, the story of shadows and darks and stories of unfortunate souls for eternity. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Vampire Lestat (Stewart Townsend) is indifferent with a world that does not excite him, has 'been asleep' for many years; But suddenly, he heard the words of the world from his extended sleep change and he liked what he heard, and he went ahead for the investigation. What he has got is a new word, new type of music - driving and sharpness - which attacks emotion and feels welcomed and welcomed alive. And he knows that for a long time his time has come, now his time has come and people like him are coming out of their openness and facing them in the world. Finally he became the first person on the band - a singer and actor known as any time in the world. He presented himself as a vampire and soon expanded an imitation that exceeds London (where it all starts) and eventually takes him to California's Death Valley, where he is going to give a concert that is anything <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />), a vampire in his own right hand - actually the vampire, in fact, He made Lestat many years ago - and they are coming together and planning to meet Lestat at the concert. And they are not going for the music. But there is something else, as well: At one point, Least has unknowingly raised the "mother" of all of them, the most powerful of all the animals, the sky (Alylah), who wants to tell everyone about his presence, and especially to rule with him as his king. : Leastat. And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will appear without presence. <br /> <br /> No mistakes, this Lestat's story, and Rymer present with a setting rich in environments and some fine moments, though there is less bite than his film, 'interview with vampire', or 'bram stoker Dakula ' He determines a good pace and some scenes that provide some real thrill, but overall the film does not get frustrating, as it may or may be expected. In the final stage, in fact, the amount of meat produced depends on the actual bloodshed, although there is more than the taste of gore and more than the lip lips and the face with the red lip. There are some good hand F / X, especially growing damp, which enhances the pancreatic tendency, as they move and hit the wind faster than the naked eye. It's a decent job by Raima, but he could have more teeth if he was playing the isolation indication by Lestat; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Townsend is more effective, a look and an attitude that perfectly captures Lestat. He plays with the idea of ​​recognizing him, and in close surveillance you may even get a hint of remorse and desire. It's a good performance, and one of the incredible sellers of that character. <br /> <br /> As Marius, Vincent Perez also did a great job - in fact, he was one of the film's powers. Its character is a bit touching; However, compared to Perez's performance he has to do more with what he wrote, which is quite good. <br /> <br /> As well as moving forward to a significant performance, Marsha Mooreo, as Jesse, is a young woman very interested in her own; And as a mesmerist, Lena Olin, Jesse's aunt, who eventually played an important role in the outcome of the play involving Least and Akasha. <br /> <br /> And as Aksha, Aliyah is a completely Writing presence. She can tell what she is about without a gifted actor, with the talent and beauty of one. And, sadly, he left us very soon. Supporting actor Paul McGann (David), Christian Mann (Miel), Claudie Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tirl Morra (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudi ). With a much stronger story than the normal festival of this special series, fans of Anne Rice, in particular, will be pleased with 'Queen of the Damned', a movie has been nicely produced and distributed by director Raimor and his fascinating cast. Rather than focusing on providing only some cheap thrills, Raima has succeeded in removing a real horror movie that definitely exceeds the point of view - and only attracts your hunger for the same. And that's the movie's magic. I rate this 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
