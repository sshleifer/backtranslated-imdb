K Pax is a very playful movie. Prote (Kevin Speacy) is really an alien, or is he mentally disturbed person who just think he is an alien? The question is whether Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self-declared time limit that the prototype sets it out of the world. <br /> <br /> The film is published and there is no further evidence, both theories increase credibility. From a memorial to the map, its map indicates a knowledge of the galaxy's area where its home planet is located, which can not be from any human. Yet hypnotist sessions lead our real person to a very real and deadly life, which is filled with horrific incidents, which can create such a person's resentment. The last answer seems to give, but you really know if you are amazing enough enough. Generally, I do not like the lady or tiger end, but it is a tantalizing. My own doctrine, which matches everything well, but I do not know that my theories are better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Director Ian Successy (Dover Wings) spin the story delicately, with fine efficiency. This is a rare example for the director to stay in shades and impress the talented actor's extraordinary acting performance on the story. It is nice to say that this instruction is technically inferior, because it is nice. However, by using the soft-free, unused, great power supply, a beautiful change from today's pioneering directors who wanted to catch the audience and shouted, 'How wonderful I am!' <br /> <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacei again offers a tremendous performance as a proto. This is a part that is widely claimed, Spacey needs to provide one minute of cool and logical defense, and then switch to Gears to relinquish his painful changes under hypnosis. Spacy is so credible as both aliens and humans, it makes the work of viewers that much harder. Jeff Bridges is also intense as intimate psychologist, who is involved in learning the truth about the proto. <br /> <br /> This inspired story for thoughtful observers I think it's a 9/10 rate. If you are close to the end of the film, this film will definitely be frustrating. However, if you like an interesting mystery that you think long after credit, you will not be disappointed.
