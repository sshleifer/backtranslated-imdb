Before looking at today's invisible preview of Angels and Demons, I cleared my mind about any uncertainty that might make me enjoy it; The great hatred towards Dan Brown, written by Dan Brown, and the name of Dan Brown was put on all the posters. I went with an open mind, and hoped for the worse, but instead I got instead a two and a half hour romance cat and mouse with forward gum, and that is the way all the better entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The movie hangs loosely on the original novel itself. Harvard witness Robert Langdon (Hans) went to Rome after the sudden death of the Pope and after re-election through the Paul Conclave. Arranged by all of these are Carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learned a new threat, in which there exists a secret brotherhood, an anti-bomber time bomb, which is now targeted in Vatican City and kidnapped four cardinals. Langdon, using his intelligence (and believe me, you will hear a lot from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the enlightened mysterious path. CERN scientists Vitoria Vetra (Jury), who co-creator of Anti-Matt cooperates with him in search. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is running at an unbroken pace. One minute Langdon and Swiss Guard are fast moving to preserve a branded cardinal, in the next minute, they bring uninterrupted information about what is going on the side of the random object, obviously reducing the expected steps of the book / thriller sequences. It makes for an interesting read on paper, but on the screen it can go any way. <br /> <br /> Characters have been written perfectly on large screens. Ian McGregor includes a strong performance, famous pronunciation known as cool but wise Patrick McKenna. Tom Hendes medieval Da Vinci code, knowingly and physically more shiny, from his latest performance. Stellen Skargard plays commander Richard on the direct face of Swiss guards. Unfortunately, neither the performance of Oliver Jury is appropriate, and instead of being involved in the story, they are simply removed as assets. <br /> <br /> However, the Angels and Demons performs no DVC can ever do; Satisfied explosion, a filled fleeting movie filled with a Pulsing bomb counted down to St. Peter's Square and Basilica (with many churches) and a middle hour at the beautiful night. Ron Howard did a good job in managing this second Langdon adventure, criticized this time and exchanged exaggerated dialogues for almost completely annoying (almost). <br /> <br /> New spokespersons may make a big threat to it as "National Treasure 3", but still enough infectious mysterious / thrilling eyeballs and exciting thrill shots can still breathe. Film supporters may feel differently on strong changes, but considering the amount of blasphemy and false evidence, viewers make it very well when they are locked on the screen instead of their sleeping shoulders. <br /> <br /> is a good book-to-movie adaptation that will both appeal and entertain. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
