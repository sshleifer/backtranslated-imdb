Looks like M. Hajnavcius is back! The man behind "La Class America" ​​has brought a fun and clever sign in the old-ray OSMS-117 ... while the directors remember "rising" Avengers of the old classics, urk), Hajnavcius is a cheap cheap hero, OSS-117, Low-budget French decided to do a sort of work in 007 and decided to do it in the old-school way ... Photography, body attitude, Fighting Coordiography and FX, everything is like a tribute to the restored film in 50's. And it works because the movie tones and jokes are really good! Jean Dzurdin awakens this stupid-proudly-clay-selfish French spy, who has lost a country that he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority. Yes, it is true that in that way their colleagues will again consider the way (and, oh! No, I would not say that nowadays there is something to do with what happened in the same area ... Ah Ah ...) Looks like, something like 40 pounds, which is a perfect role. Other custom members fit perfectly, you all dream about Russian spy, Egyptian libertarians, and former Nazi dreams. And of course, women's "women's deadly" movie in any good spying ... The plot is good (probably not bright, but really good enough ...), to take place in real historical events, and interestingly how we (France and others) Think of the colonies they behaved in those days. It was started in 1955 when British intelligence was invisible while tracking a Russian cargo carrying soyage surgery. Then France sent her best friend, agent OSS-117 to discover what happened to both her invoice and agent ... that this agent could really be as dumb, and she even slips through stories without understanding it, very clausau-esquire way Solve it. I said, I had a bad feeling about the movie, because preaching around it was quite terrible, and French humorans were quite popular and flat (forgot the trail bronze 3 or camping ...) but I'm really surprised, and the best way! I highly recommend that you want a good parody of Bond-Esquier films (for example, a lot more fun than DEBS, but less Scratch) or you're the genuine and candid way to get back in 5o. Yes, it's tricky and (really!) Funny, you've got points again Mr. Hajnavcius!
