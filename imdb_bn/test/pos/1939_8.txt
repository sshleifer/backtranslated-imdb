The river bank is more than just a murder story. This is a complaint of dissonance that has been hurt in the pocket of young people for decades. Our main character is a group known as "stoners" of high school. One of them decided to slap his girlfriend just because he had nervous vision "Talking to him". This dangerous young man, directed by Daniel Roebak, will intensify you. He takes another girlfriend out to show his boyfriend's body, and, oddly, nobody really feels really scared about it. The balance of this film disturbs the survival of these people and how these criminal children can be blamed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its character. We definitely see the dangers presented by this strangled apathy and the desire to get drunk or high only. We are showing these kids unsuccessful home life, and perhaps this is meant to explain their terrible behavior. But can it be only a troubled home that can lead to such a destructive life? Crispin Glover self out of its usual broken. After the murder, he took shelter in a city in the whole of Paran√≠a. He tried to express his sympathy for why his friend's crime was committed, but clearly he did not understand what the young man could do. Dennis Hooper plays an older man these kids get to get their dope. Although he is certainly a rebel person, but he can not relate to the indifference and anger of the young generation. The misguided response to how Rubek felt when he killed his girlfriend. Hooper's character as wild, even he knows that this young man should not face the world. <br /> <br /> What do you think about these kids? Well, there is really no way to pick their character. Some are less hateful than others, but you can not help in feeling hurt or sorry for them. In the twentieth century, there are still many survivors and many young people are alive. When are these kids lost? Many of them want to do anti-social work? The film will take some time with you and the questions for thirteen years. This is an event. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
