Reviewing 3 Perry and Croft Seats, I thought I would do all of them now. Dads Army, the best sitcom of my time, it's not half the hot mom, you're a classic like the Rogue Moord. I do not consider hi dye as a classic, but it's still funny. <br /> <br /> It is about vacation holidays like Batlina, but instead of red coats it is yellow coat. It is managed by Jeffrey Fairbrother, a good money man, but has a sock personality. Employee's fun entertainment manager Ted, his Sidekick Spike (he almost finished shooting in every episode swimming pool), yellow coat gladdis, helpless maid Peggy, who is a yellow coat and Punch and Judy Man. Kids hate hatred, who hate kids The situation mostly took place around the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown out of every episode (with the necessary clothes there). <br /> <br /> is a classic, but still funny. Jeffrey Fairbrother walked through halfway, so it's just like flowers and horses, exceeding her reception. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat of basilin. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Peggy Biggues, Series 2, Episode 2.
