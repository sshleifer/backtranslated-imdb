Andaz is your own movie which I am fame and a movie of this, I do not think of any time, think about ... almost any time! This movie is simply awesome and in my opinion, the most fun movie I've ever seen! And yes, I put it down on the fall ... because? You'll see Hera Ferry scenes, but guess what? Not possible! Just because each scene has a view to watch for you! Amir and Salman will share great chemistry and will be perfect throughout the shoe but I will keep the characters in favor of bias: <br /> <br /> # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance and today, before this casting sofa): Gogo is an innocent character who is well-known family of Mogambo (Mr. India Fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually more than a neutral, handsome and handsome charming son for Mogambo's nephew, but for Mogambo. Gogo made the biggest mistake of his life by borrowing 36,000 rupees (who once said, "a fraud and fraud!"). Now, Goge's only purpose is to return to her return and recover her lost money, Gogo has realized that more than 36,000 is what he wants to achieve and thus start ... Gogo's struggle against sinners-world <Br> <br /> Rank # 2. Tej (Tej Muen Hun, Mark Idhara Hi!): Tej Roy Gopal is a bad character in Twilight of Bajaj. Originally named Shyam Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Tej likes to change his name for his personality. Spunk, such a child has always envied his brother and then one day, when his parents give his complete wealth Ram bamboo, turn around for a bad thing. Tej decided to kill his father but in the darkness of the night, Munshi killed Harish Chandra (father of Rabina), although Taz does not apologize for his actions. The only mission to spell is to get his property back and start his own poultry and bakery farm. Tejake also will have to repay the loan to Gogo (but it has no intention). To achieve his evil goals, Tej employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khot, who is very good at sight) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and boy ... who is a smart boy!) <Br /> <br /> Rank # 3. Amar (Amir Khan): Rabindranath's rich heir wants to marry, so he sold his father's cheap salon for Mumbai. Immortal, there is no problem in taking care of the big wedding, that Ravina's father will hand him over after marrying him and if he is willing to dedicate his happiness and to move to London, <br /> <br /> <br /> # 4. Love (Salman Khan ): After Gogoro, love is the second most innocent character of love and immortal tries to take advantage of his friend's masks, sad <br /> <br /> I won 'any more letters because of Jesus Christ! I just will not stop typing! The film is absolutely stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs because they have dropped a lot of good scenes from the movie. <br /> <br /> Background music is better than stud and action matrix, especially in the final encounter with love and crime master Gogo (watch for it), it is finalized. Andoraj teaches you a lot about your negative and positive character and many things about our life and values ​​and ethics. It teaches us about courage (why love complains to the boyfriend that he must go to the toilet, although the boyfriend complains that he will love to come back to meet the abductor). It is also a tragedy for yourself, especially in the scene where Salman Amir's target and then the stomach-boring pill has been given in excess, where Tees expresses his sad feelings about why he can not go to London and Goga is wherever he is. Finally arrested, even 36,000 without getting back. Let's have a full package of your own. Come back and enjoy the journey! Then the second round will be ... and then one-third of the <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie was again considered as Floppy and I said that nobody likes it but the boys leaked! This movie is a big hit! Although there are enough people to come to the theater, the film is one of the highest selling home DVDs and one of the most frequent movies of the channels, so the producers have long opened their way to banks!
