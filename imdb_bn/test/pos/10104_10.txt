I have seen this movie in the movie two years ago, and in this dark story of these two dark-eyed teen sisters love their dark moments in their big country with their parents and parents. Their relationship with their parents is hesitant to say at least, step-mother is becoming unstable in battle with her little girls. The image slants the Oriental-style Scratch effect and horror, which adds its peculiar and unstable view in the first look, which is not clear at first sight, but it is more compelling. <br /> <br /> The direction is incredibly good, and the stunning, step-acting mother swinging from another movie to an incredibly good movie with another. The big room gets energized, and there are enough points in the movie where you can jump from your seat. This movie clearly shows me why the Korean movie is probably the best in the world, the world's best seratom. You just will not find such a thing in the West, sadly, and indeed I can see it in the next decade in the world's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I have been highly recommended to see my opinion, a real joy and fear ...
