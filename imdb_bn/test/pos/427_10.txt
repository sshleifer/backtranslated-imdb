I have seen three episodes of David Morsch acting star, and it seems that I missed 37 episodes! That's better if ITV 3 shows them in an increasing order. I just saw 'Mystery Blue' (episode 38). I really enjoyed 3 episodes, but then I'm David Morse Fan, (SS Saint elsewhere). Anyone reading this, the hack is nice. It is being promoted on ITV 3 Cast is strong, though I can not use the concept of David, although we all know that he has wrongly accused the good man. I played guest star in Gary Kole, did the 'Midnight Caller' happen? If the hack is available on DVD (yet) then just wonder. Love it Cheers
