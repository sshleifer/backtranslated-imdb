I'm not saying that Liav has gained respect from me after seeing his guidance "My Everything Has Been Enlightened". Anyone who reads this book knows how the story is involved with Alex's remarkable and ridiculous vocabulary, with countless flashback scenes and crazy dreams. Liev took all of these and it worked. The movie itself is cool - soundtrack, performance, cinematography - it does all the work. Many stories are missing about the town and its inhabitants, but you can do a lot with the Inditor, so this section did not bother me too much. It is frustrating that many people will not be able to see this movie even that it can be found that it is because of lack of publicity with it. I do not even know the theater was there. I did not know after the DVD came out. You think Fredo Bugins was one of the main characters, Somedi Hemv published at least a commercial for it. I wanted to see the trailer of my "Paradise Noise" DVD (released from the DVD in the spring of06), even it was the date of the release of the "Fall of 2005" theater. Ha ha - really sad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It This is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8.
