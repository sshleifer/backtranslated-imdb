Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Angulophon poetry, I hope I hope a movie that will be a musical tendency of the subject. In contrast, poet sex is presented as unlawfully, drunk, bad parents, leir and hypocrite and possibly a coward. Of course, somebody can argue that the artists who are an artist and especially one of the reasons for the poet industry, to abolish the values ​​of traditional ethics, all of them are a convenient matter, but I do not do anything that can be a positive role model that can crop personality Up from such a bundle. In any way I found another respected character Captain Cillic a more respectable character. The two female roles were played by actress Mitali and Miller, and the first was the first when she performed songs to motivate for bombing during WW2 in slim decoration. Another good point is that sexual jealousy also plays a role in relatively progressive million, which think older old conferences can easily be overcome. Blit's atmosphere was also believable, as well as those who got the experience of warfare, opposed to those who viewed political views of political parties as important to them. I think one would recommend this kind of movie.
