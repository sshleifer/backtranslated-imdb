I saw the best and most inspirational movies about different cultures in one year. Sad and touch. Clock value Maybe a few times We all know how cruel children can be. I know from myself and experience my children as children and hit the nail on this movie head. Perfect! The running of the kite is amazing and I must research the validity of that event. Although it is done CGI, it is still amazing and very interesting. Such an ants feel impossible with a single string but they make it credible. However, this movie has mostly twists and turns, I'm sure many might think easily but they hit me before. Which makes a great movie for me! When you paint the whole film within 10 minutes, it will be destroyed. But it makes it so easy that even if it happens it's hard to guess ... I'm a man and I do not think tears are blowing in more than one point in this film.
