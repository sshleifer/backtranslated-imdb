Oppenheimer was a great series (this is the first thing I saw in Watertown) and it is not very bad copy available. Similar conditions exist for "Gary Enf for All", British series at almost the same time, about invention of insulin. I would pay a good price for both DVDs. Is it really difficult to get Oppenheimer in a DVD capable of playing in the US? Another very enjoyable series, at almost the same time, was "Danger UXB". A series about deflecting uneXploded bombs, hence the name. You can get it from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pitt
