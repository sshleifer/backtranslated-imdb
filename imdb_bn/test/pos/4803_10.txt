Running out of time is probably close to a perfect movie, as you can never see from Hong Kong. Click All Elements: A great script (by French author Julian Carbon and Laurent CortiAud), which leads to a strange clich√©, a genuinely rumored storyline, and to remove the excellent central performance by Andy Lau and Lau Ching Waien. For great effect, great comic timing never crosses the line in parody (especially in his heated reactions to the skills of his higher abnormal discourse). Supporting cast is very good, Yo Yo Mung creates a strong impression in a small role, and even more often, Wise Lee (even unusually and very appropriately, able to look like an ornate Andy Laur) has a good effect. Do not know too much about the plot of the basic setup ?? In a few weeks to live, lau is involved in no criminal sport without any simple purpose with vanquish ?? And just sit back and enjoy the ride: it is certainly worth the price. It is one of the most complete love stories of recent films, and has played in only three scenes (one of the greatest magic occasions I've ever made over the years in the second bus ride). There is also a fine score by Raymond Wong. The most fun playing and mouse in the movie over the years.
