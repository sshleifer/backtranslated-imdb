600 or more Spaghetti Westerns must be at the top 20 places in this place. Can not believe this review has not received! Gemma is excellent in this. Van Johnson is very good but his dubbed voice is just a little off the siliter but it's an Italian-style kiss. Nice photography and some wonderfully managed works All supporter characters played well. The intensity of racist strokes among bad boys is also very difficult by today's standards, which in some circumstances causes James to create a mental depth for the character. A fairly favorable score by Luis Bacalov. Check out this wonderful Wide Screen DVD from Japan. Must have a spaghetti.
