The New York Illumination feature first feature films. Of course, in October 1979, Jazz Singer was released as the first feature film in the synchronized dialogue released. However, this film, which was released in July 1928 in the history of the film, is often disrespected. It started as a brief, but slowly went on for more than 58 minutes - it suddenly became the first movie of the first debut film. This is a ground house run and Warner Bros. Surprisingly, open up on one million dollars. In 1928 it was good money. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Front as a simple-easy for a gangster "Hawk" that two countries barbers naively Broadway buy in a supper store. They can not get out when they learn the truth, because the little barbarian, Eddie, all of his mother's money is bound in this place. The little sailor's girlfriend and gangster haq (wheeler oakman) transformed her old girlfriend (Gladys brockwell) to a new model - the chorus girl kitty (Helen Costello). Haq's men tried to stop the launch of whipping liquor, and a police was killed, and Haq saw Eddie as an opportunity to frame and thus got a key for himself. <br /> <br /> This is the first time you are lucky to have fun for this pioneering work enthusiast. Sure, the plot is primary and the dialogue is compressed, but there are some things you do not see in the primary box - background music scoring. Vitaphone is basically used for this purpose, and here they are still used for music music along with the conversation. And there are number of singing and dancing! Hawk's nightclub scenes are used as an opportunity to show which movies they can never have before - musical numbers. There is a very intelligent message even more than the silent era that can survive. <br /> <br /> Vetaphon could not go out at this time due to static camera booths, so simulation of scenes in the park between two lovers Eddie and Kitty - and cheaper. The green thing looks like an Ed Wood movie or perhaps a high school production of "High City". <br /> <br /> Gladys Brookwell, Hugh's girlfriend, delivered her pants with punching lines. He considers the line what he is delivering a real trooper. Huq - "You think you want a chicken you can get and throw me in the deck!". is not it? Mixed allegory? And then its final line is "I've lived, and I liked, and I lost!" Did anyone pay for writing this dialogue? Following some successful achievements in silent films (seventh heaven's evil sister), Brockwell achieved successful success in his career, when a deadly car accident was the only one spent in his career. <br /> <br /> Then Eugene Palette - our stories are two big stars. His frogs voice, the normal delivery of lines, and the flamboyant look, usually gives him a longer career as a character actor, usually a garage, and a gold-hearted family businessman. Actually, the only member of this movie is Mr. Palette who received a significant career in the film after just three years of releasing this film. Finally there is a question "Where is the microphone hidden??" The microphone was still stable at this moment, and they have hidden it where it is impressive. Here's a famous scene, where everyone can illustrate it beautifully. Huq is talking to his two Henman in his office - who thinks slowly - about "taking a ride on AD". If you see this scene, you will swear the phone on the desk, a character in this movie. During the whole conversation it's front and center The microphone is likely to be mounted on the phone. <br /> <br /> Some of the heroes flying in the dark in front of this new progress. You have uninterrupted actor who is accustomed to using Panometime for the expression, Bhudevivals who know how to run with live viewers, but Vietfon does not know how to create the same idea of ​​booth booth and both the conversation writer is trying to write the conversation as they are the title cards or Films filled with endless fiction. See this. <br /> <br /> See this. It's not annoying, it's running fast and fun loads are what you want to find. And no, I do not want to go out of this Blu-ray, but I hope the people of Warner Brothers will soon join the Warner archive so that everyone can see it.
