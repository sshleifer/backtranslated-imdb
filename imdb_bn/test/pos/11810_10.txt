The viewers who have watched 'The Chuur' will agree with me on this comment that it is a great movie and it is very entertaining. Joseph Madeleow and Brad Renefro have proved their star quality in this film, Dextera (Majelo) mother Anabella Cyroora <br /> <br /> When I saw the first treatment on TV, I did not know what I can expect, but I saw this masterpiece that it soon became clear about it. The 11-year-old boy, Dester, who was attacked by AIDS, walked behind his house while playing with his toy, while one day he met his next neighbor Eric, which was initially a little painful for 2 boys, but soon he became a good friend. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I was wondering what would happen to the two boys, they surprised me. I'm putting a door with a sea biscuit next to the ankle of New Orleans, pulling a blown crocodile behind it. There were other great scenes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> But the part that reached me was that Dexter's health decreased. You can not just help it but you can finally help but wonder if you are going to find out. I thought that they played the first prake, that Dexter was really dead was not clearly, I was fooled. But when they were in the third game, something went wrong. Dexter does not smile as long as he does not show any kind of laugh. At that time, the announcement that their scary victim would soon have died in poor Dexter. That part I lost it I opened my eyes, and I cried from that scene. You just have to Ultimately, you start to understand Eric's loss and then the movie ends with a nice note which is slowly floating beneath the river along with Dixeter's shoes. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was fantastic. It is laugh, valor, passion and sadness etc. When you put it on a blender you will find a nice, of course the film must be seen. Peter Horton did a great job to handle this film and I certainly believe his best. But for now, I will try to search the DVD for this movie, if it exists. Again a fantastic movie that will take you to a mental rollercaoster.
