This movie will go as one of the most fun movies in history. His cousins ​​are waiting for a strong wind, spin-off, and gopman, but they are the best on their own right but take the best cake at the show. <br /> <br /> A movie about dog-owned statue that shows their dogs competitively, it is the cause of complexity of characters which makes it good. After watching the movie about 75 times, I came to the conclusion that there are no weak characters or actors in this film. There are very few conversations in the "group" of characters, but it is only associated with the beauty of the film. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and do not think it's fun, then I am billing it, see it again. The first time I saw it, it was beneficial to me but not too much sunny. This is a movie that grows on you. Defininatly in a movie you will find yourself frequently. Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A + If you found the DVD, how these characters were "born" was amazing that these two heads could hit it. And they did not really go by a script and it went sort out to find it out. <br /> <br /> Jerry and Cookie Google'sman: Cookies are especially fun and they do a great job to sell the character of a cookie. Gary (Eugene Levi) supplies her standard star performance to the poorly-debated Hilary Discobulated Type. <br /> <br /> Find me a fun character compared to Stefan Vanderhoff and Scott Donaldan + Scott Donaldan, I fear you! He will always cast this character as he is cast and is not compelled at any time. Steven (Michael McCain) was very good and they interfered here (and got a short look with Goggle's) why he is always in the movie. A great actor with razors like wit <br /> <br /> Harlan Paper-B +, I do not think he seems to be funny, but he's sure he can not be as funny as the only "solo" action. He uses the dog more than anyone else and there are some other audio conchcissues for him. <br /> <br /> The rest are not all good, as well as no weak character. See this film at least twice. Buy it, you will not regret it.
