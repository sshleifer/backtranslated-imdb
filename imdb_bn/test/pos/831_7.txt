It's still the best straight-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen. Van Damm plays border crossing agent to stop the angry heroin smugglers in the US border. The action in this movie is great and the war scenes are ranked with the best of Van Dame. Coaster Scott Eddins demonstrates why he wants to be the next big star of martial arts. Check out "Undisputed 2" for further proof. Adkins is really good that I saw "Shepherd", I could not seem to be very believable to defeat Van Dam on the screen. Although Van Dam is in his own possession and does not have athletic like Adkins, he can still jump with the best player. All the fight scenes in this movie have been done very well and more than the average of gun battles for this type of movie. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a bit less. I think the objectives of Van Damme's character should have been presented before in the movie, especially why he is close to a rabbit. He is very cool but you do not even find the end. There are some things that are not sometimes explained, but it's a movie in Van Dune, so you know where there is a priority for filmmaking and it's not a character development. Overall though, I recommend that a solid worker movie. So run on the border of Damma!
