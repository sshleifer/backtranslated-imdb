It was that! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hate him, rather his character will die Shannon. The interesting thing is that the place where Piper was being killed on the bed of the hospital and Prue started crying beside him, I started crying. I was about 10yo at the time of this promotion and my favorite character was Piper since the beginning, so if I tell myself to die, I will not see anymore! <br /> <br /> There was a shock and really good time to go back to the whole time. I also blame Phoeb for Prue's death because instead of being with her sisters, she was a whore. ******************************************************* ****************************************** And always my favorite And a CHRMED classic one <br /> <br /> Fair! Happy!
