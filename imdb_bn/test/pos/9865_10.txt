Wow, I can not believe I was the first and only one to post a comment on this first movie. <br /> <br /> Although this movie seemed to be attractive to myself, the real thing that attracted me was that of Matt Lillard, most people probably think he is very caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we both have the same age and same generation I have seen this person so many times that he is now my favorite one. This is one of the few movies where he is a big star and big stars like Salisbury punk Lilyard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film is also a very famous film actor, D'aanfrio, another great actor, a very less admired person from the film industry. The woman in the movie is a young and she is not very bad, even though you know that she has appointed her mainly for her pronunciation and nude scenes) <br /> <br /> It's Jack vs. Gill v Bob, a game prize cut but with no one to share Want to They all tried to kill each other and it is waiting for a blast. Matt shows his true skills that started Skyming Jack in the beginning which started the whole scheme. Vincent and women play some thieves for the sake of money due to lack of business. Vince's character is a great surprise and skitz throughout the film, but it only adds to the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> The left and right astonishes well and the finishing is very lazy and makes you happy, probably depending on the last type you want. This movie kept me very excited with Matt, it's a great movie and I would recommend it to someone who likes movies too. Critics probably do not like this movie, but they do not like movies because they like movies.
