Valentino, a model of France isolated from her boyfriend, has planned to meet in England, but it seems to be becoming more distant after the film's progress. One night passed by his colleague, he hit a dog named Rita. The dog survives and gives it back to its owner, an unfriendly retired judge, who sounds in the conversation of his neighbors, living as a servant and a hideaway. He gets stimulated by the nature of this person and often visits him, often becoming part of his secret games. Although one of the two conversations is of utmost importance, the conversation between being a judge and his wife in a young person, which we find parallel to the life of a person who is hiding on them. We learn more about the couple, the man reveals his more stories, then continues his story, and if we find out two men will lead toward the same fate. Valentine knows how her life will be, face to face and the fate of the young judge will get involved together. The day that struck the dog seemed to be a fate, a godly gift by the dog to his master, allowing Valentin to be the Rescuer of a young judge who is traveling in the same way as his favorite friend, filled with such inferior future, loneliness and unity. It seems that the old man's dream will be true soon afterwards, and his face can sleep smiling in the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kieslowski did not stop to surprise me. She is my favorite director, and one of the most talented directors in movie history. The color of the French flags in three movies is unbelievable, every shot, nothing like every scene, like the industry. Three of the most visual interesting movies I've ever seen. And his fine connection between three films is awesome. Generally signals with a fine break, or delayed view of a scene, see if you can spot some. I have to mention it and it's a huge sprinter, I love it till the end, how all the characters in three movies were residues of ferry accidents, Valentine and youth judges together, and the old man saw him on television, on the pain he had suffered for many years Happiness made happiness happy. I could not remember the best way to finish the film, but it's a great way to wrap my smile, great movies and triangles! I recommend this to everyone who loves movies, movies, ... a work of art! 10 out of 10 for both film and triangle.
