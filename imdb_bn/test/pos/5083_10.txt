I saw the movie yesterday and was frustrated by it, but I am more surprised by some comments here. One person wrote that if the victims of the crime were criminals were suspicious - so ... a person wrote that he was not an American citizen, so ... some people commented that the people of the Middle East hate us and we want death, so ... So what do we say that it is right to torture a guilty person? Are we the right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? What are we saying that we should hate us and torture us for death? Are we the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the "United States Constitution" torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others? " Is it "right" to torture? Why this movie is strong - it's unclear, but not about torture. Torture is always wrong, and if we want to do it, even in the name of justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy" we are wrong and we are evil. We are doing what we are doing, which we blame for our enemies (and we call them "wrong" by the same breath.) My favorite line of film was "If you do not want to join Amnesty International." Right
