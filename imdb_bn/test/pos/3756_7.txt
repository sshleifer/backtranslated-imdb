On television, I only saw this movie once, but after 15 years I can remember that something should be said about it. I thought it was an intelligent look in school going, friendship, rape, and impact that could affect adult life. <br /> <br /> The title actually mentions that sports can be either good or bad, how can be the lowest or you will be good by cliques in school and even after adults if you're good at it - it's a private school set in England But it can be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The main characters want to take revenge on the bad, next life in the game, all of which ends in a climatic clash with cricket pitches. I must admit that I was lost to the end - it was strong and sad.
