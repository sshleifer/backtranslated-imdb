I saw this movie late in the night on a free-to-air channel, and I must say, I was happy. A horror movie fan is, I often see such midnight movies during school holidays. Often, horror movies shown at this time are usually big lamers. 'Campfire Tales' certainly does not fit in that section. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a story based briefly based on well-known urban legends. They are pieced together with a setting involving this story telling around Campfire. This campfire setting itself has a mysterious plot. However, this particular story is used to set up other wonderful stories, which are obviously weak and confusing. <br /> <br /> There are three stories in this movie (four if you count 'hook' at the beginning), all of which are really gorgeous and orderly. I especially enjoyed the third story ('Locket'), in which a motorcycle collapsed in front of a mysterious family. This particular story makes you wonderfully surprised by the flashbacks of House History. Along with this, the end of the story will shock you completely! The first story ('Hanimun') was very scary, although the second story ('People may get too much') was somewhat lacking. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie director I usually never get freaked out. This film certainly works well that works! What I liked specifically about this movie is that it is divided into three shorts. This means that the movie will not be created by developing an hour or more character and setting up settings before the start of bloodletting. This campfire tales is ready for sleep, party, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a vague, crusty horror film that stops your heart more than once. Of course, today's movies you will often find better than this (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legend: Final Cut ... bleah!). Find a copy and see it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
