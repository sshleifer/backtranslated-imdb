Another part of the hidden darkness and denial of patronage of the American subcontinent, the legendary heroes recounted the life of the family of Trasis, all restored by following the suicide of their eldest son. <br /> <br /> Both the couple in the center of the movie and the boy Sandy (Sigourney Waver) and Tim (Emil Hirish) both acted in death due to death. When the team examines prescription medication and its own sexuality, Sandy returns to her former self, marijuana smokes and refers to her old works of unfaithfulness. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sandy and the team has been specially searched, especially when references are made to both of them being expelled from their family: due to his relationship and team's being in the shadow of his first successful brother, Sandy's husband Ben (Jeff Daniels), who ordered the devastating screenplay of denial, to eat extra plates for his dead boy and kept him in his old place in the dinner table. Michelle Williams's big sister Penny underlined and can easily get out of the film. <br /> <br /> Despite its long runtime, the fantasy heroes do not explore the fact that his own mistress deserves any personal story. The film does not translate black comedy, as the author / director Dan Harris chose. And with the similar ideas of dynamic illustrations of a disturbed family, many other films are not portrayed as strong. But in spite of some issues, Wave and Hirish's central performances are stunning, and easily carry the film in the conclusion that it has been successfully completed. <br /> <br /> Ratings: B-
