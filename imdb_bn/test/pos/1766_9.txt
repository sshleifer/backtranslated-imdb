I am surprised, "Once more, my darling", did not create enough votes for "user rating" (in this article). This is a "screw" comedy which I have enjoyed over the years. Robert Montgomery's mission puts him in some unlikely circumstances, and he is just a man for jobs. He also maintains the trademark "Biffoood" appearance around the world and is very soon. Anne Bleth plays his steady / unrealistic followers, who assume a relationship that does not exist. His character is quite responsible for the great nickname "killer", but he remains clever and eccentric. <br /> <br /> "Once more, my darling" is a standout, in the late 1940s and in the late 1950s, in the list of "B" movies. Valuable for this one ....
