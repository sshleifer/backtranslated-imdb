Excellent cast, story line, performance. Completely trustworthy. I realized that off-knit group for the Marine Corps example. But this movie is scared in my heart. Let the marine warrior policy be the enemy. It looks like this movie was based on real life events. It shows how difficult it is to go against the organization. Anne Heche was completely convinced. Sam Shepard's Gung Ho Marine screenplay was frustrating. And his attorney, Ari Stoltz, was so cruel that he maintained loyalty to the corporation, but also maintained his loyalty to his client when his power was up. He knew what could be his true nature. But he immersed himself in the maritime heritage, because of his loyalty to the Corps above all else. I sat riveted on the TV screen. All I give to all this one 10 out of 9
