Although I'm not crazy about musical instruments but cover girl is also happy for the classic movie buff, especially for Rita Hareth and Jean Kelly fans. This image can be date according to today's standards and stories and songs may not be anything special, but musical numbers are superbly handy and a great cast to go along with the movie. Alongside this, the film is an appropriate role for the fans of Rita Haven ... she is only exciting in the glorious technicro <br /> <br /> Despite the cooperation of Jerome Karne in the film, her music is not as close to its music as special or memorable, but its song (1936) at the swing time, still continues to serve the songs well. Dancing is not something great, especially the single number of Gene Kelly and my favorite music number, coming from "Alter-Ego Dance". The impressive Phil Silver stole the film as Kelly's companion. Otto Kr√ºger, Eve Ardene and Edward Broff have given good performance in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita played here a sweet, charming girl; In films like Blawood and Sand (1941), her daughters have been crying over the fatty kids. <br /> <br /> To everyone, it's a delightful movie that you are not over musical instruments but it's valuable to watch. Still the song of the film could have been more memorable if only my favorite time songwriter, Ivering Berlin or Cole Porter wrote the song for this movie. However, it is a cinematography of glorious technicolor and a fantasy dance that is the real behavior of film production. <br /> <br /> I've seen Rita Howarth in her stuff, I do not think I have ever seen Michael Powell's best work, The Red Shawce (1948), seeing the Mayira Sherrar, I saw more beautiful or beautiful redhead dance on the screen. Just watch Rita in the cover girl and fall in love with her.
