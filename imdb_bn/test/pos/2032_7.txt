There is nothing really unclear in this movie, but in all cases a solid flick. Cinematography was all difficult to play. A perfectly linear plot line, but there was nothing you could not see coming up. Probably a tad melodramatic of points, but again, a fairly decent movie is no less. Check out definitely worth it. If you have to hire a movie at the end of the week, then doubt it. Although you may not run out and think of buying it, I think it is very valuable.
