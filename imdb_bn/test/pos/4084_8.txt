I was good at the movie, but I like to read the real story behind the movie "based on the true story". Does anyone know the names and locations of real characters that are movie based? I've searched a whole Internet and can not find any information in this case. I found that all movie information and it is based on a "true story". Even after such heartbreaking speeches by Brother (Fantastic John Corbett), a judge must immediately change his sentence in the courtroom to render, it is hard to believe, but the overall story was very sticky. Anyway, if someone knows the true "true story" I'll be grateful for sharing!
