Back in the 70s, SSF is a small-scale Texas filmmaker. Brownrigg is surprisingly modest low-budget drive-a little directed after a few years in a horrible flicks to seem to develop a small genius. Before looking at his first film, The Do Look In the Basement, I was not sure what was sure, but I'm sure the hell does not just hope to scare Texas, which I was better than Chainsaw. Killing I do not know, it can actually be my worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> We start an isolated insane asylum. First of all, it seems like a neutral person to be mentally healthy, all patients are allowed to freely travel, and it seems as if their house was (I think). None of them seem dangerous, just confusing. One of the residents is a love-nimpho, a 700-year-old woman, a male child, a spaz, a man, who thinks he is in war, a woman who thinks he has a child, and a person thinks he is a judge . One day, out of nowhere, the judge killed the dog, shortly afterwards, the child's uncle killed the nurse. Ten minutes in the movie, and things are really looking ugly. Probably new nurses will do, then again, probably not. Providing further away will do more harm than good. As soon as possible aware, the head in this one is the first crown well. If you are terrified of God-fearing God, but do not get frustrated with disrespect, then do not be frustrated. <br /> <br /> If you like Scrum, if you like Wrong Turn, if you score that point of view, excessively produced, digital Hollywood junk scores, then it is more likely that you will not see this beauty. Do not look at the basement, the first attempt is to make the quality worse. The atmosphere and the position of graininess and fit into a glove-like score. Unfortunately, good ol 'S.F. Though most of his best ideas were used in his first movie, his next version of the Texas Quadrilateral is an excellent composition, that is, if you know someone who is known as extra lazy, money, hikloptotation If you fall in love with the first two of the Braunrick, and you have to find out what to give to each other, do not open the door and check out the house where the spill has ended. Do not see in the basement that a successful horror demand, a star, no budget, no digital impact, only a real story has been lived in a mad habitat, with a doz cast member, and a friend, fine score and, of course, turn. The real horror for this real horror fan. 10/10
