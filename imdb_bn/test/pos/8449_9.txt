Great movie in the late 1970s. A lot can be said about corporate corruption at the cost of ordinary people, so that the powerful can profit profitable and neglect the environment and security. <br /> <br /> After almost 30 years, the film power is bound to force some corporates to increase their power of control tenfold due to film release; It shows the need for public control against strong business interests whose primary goal is profit. <br /> <br /> Jack Lamb Brian - When Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas are equally compulsory in their roles. The 70's are reprimanded for many, this movie revisited decades. <br /> <br /> Every movie gets better after watching it.
