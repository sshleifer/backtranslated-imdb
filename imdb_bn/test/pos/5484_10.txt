Last night I saw this movie for the first time. How nice! What a movie! This movie is just so cool and attractive because you want to see everyone in the world. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give a single word about the plot because I think it would be better to let people cool. Do not read the plot summary before watching the movie! What I would say is the top notch of Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson and Jeff Maguire. I like all of these thriller more like this one.
