It's a tough show to see. It's not something to sit back and relax. It kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People are drunk, raped, tortured and killed like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there are emissions, puke and blood. Oz is a brave show. It raises racialism, homosexuality, realities of prisoners, and most like; Family punishments It is, in my opinion, successful in doing so, for example, the single track "medium" <br /> <br /> It bothers me It was the lines of some weird stories and they just did not have interest in me that they spend a lot of time on the characters. Kinky enough, I got to be quite annoying in Season 1. When it was broadcast I saw it, I think I do not have to continue it. I love season 2 - 4. Season 5 and 6 clockable, (although I think it should not be allowed to pronounce the words "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence) <br /> <br /> There are so many routes for the There are incredible characters. Old boys Bob and Basmelis, I love the very first day. Saeed, Adbeci, Panakamo and Shillings, four very powerful and promising leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, who together with episodes together so effective. Workers like Sister Peat and Ray Mukhada are also excellent workers There were also only minor letters for several episodes or several seasons, but they had a good impression. <br /> <br /> My loved ones are Orely brothers. Their relation was the most intimate and warmth of television. If there is anything I always remember about this show it's them. And sometimes it can not be called "pair", which will make me suffer a lot. Why ats, when the end comes for them, it's almost a lot of damage. I will not have it happened. I've never seen it. <br /> <br /> But a good fontana I recommend it.
