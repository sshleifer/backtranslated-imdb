Brilliant thrillers, much more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are extraordinary in their acting roles, such as the fully supporting cast. A truly strong-minded movie featuring some amazing images and some great conversations is silent, a strong message for all tolerance and understanding of its heart. Based on a novel about Homophobia, this movie attacks anti-war anti-emietism, and with all the intolerance and hatred, enough power. Although parts may seem to be a little propaganda to modern audiences, it has Shakka's power and it works very well as its thriller. All involved in a credit.
