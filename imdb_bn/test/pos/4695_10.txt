To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan in many DVD comments, the "Vibril Music" in the HTV logo was enough to make me wake up from what I was doing in order to glue my face against the screen for an hour. The individual stories included in the series were excellent and the development of the character was wonderful. Loxley's Robin toured strongly with two series in his presence, although his departure from the program was unplanned. Marianne has developed a good relationship with Harne's sons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not a child television program, it is related to sorcery, revolt, rebellion and injustice. And, it manages it without showing too much blood. As far as I can remember, you can only see the red elements of the pilot film (episodes 1 and 2 of the DVD set). DVDs are great, it only has additional additional resources with custom comments, including series 3 (Jason Connery Robin) and series 1 and 2 crew versions. The quality of the photo is very good and the remixed and remastered sound is amazing. <Br> <br /> The idea of ​​independence is important, freedom exists. Nothing forgot Nothing is forgotten.
