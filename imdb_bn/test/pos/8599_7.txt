Nothing worse than the genocide of our world history. In the Hiroshima nuclear bomb earth - this movie describes the horrors of a particular family faced by the horror. The most memorable part is a graphic and tragic figure that is confronted by Hiroshima people after the war. However, the story is more concerned with its effect on how people can cope with dealing with certain groups of people and their living; In other words, if you are not really worried about them then the film will become boring. Although it is not difficult to care, when the motherland of a family is destroyed. I'm not sure that I would recommend this movie because it is very politically and honestly, I have not had any interest in family problems.
