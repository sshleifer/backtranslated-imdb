Although the plot of the cover girl is very intense and tired, it works well enough as an anchor for the carn and the musical numbers of the Gershwin. Following Gilder's signature role, Heworth likes to star in this musical instrument that seems to be tailor made for him. In addition to looking as superb as ever, she impresses with her dance as well. From MGM to Columbia, Jean Kelly, she did not match with her dancing and her shadow where she had decorated them. Supporting characters are also competently played. Personally, I did not enjoy cover girl like Frederick Haydt with Fred Astaire. However, cover girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
