OK, where to start Did you know that part of the lead robots was given to the famous Mim Team Shields and Arnez? Beta yes no But they turned down the allegations about making robots. Then they fade off into ambiguity. Now, this movie has everything. He is a dirty killer robot who thinks he is dirty Harry. Lots of cold robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date for those who love science fiction and romantic comedy. This is the first robot romantic comedy. Now certainly a few few movies are perfect and there are some character issues. But it is very small and can be ignored. I think couples will enjoy this movie and would like to see it over again. 9 stars.
