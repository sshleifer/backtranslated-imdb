I was given a DVD of the Public Demo and it was expected to be the 2009 version but it was not - it was! Of course, I have never seen that the greatest movie was not in any way - but, hack people, it's 2.8 out of 10! When I saw an uncomfortable rating on IMDB, I was wondering what I was getting, but the disc was in the player, so I was determined to see it. Other commentators have mentioned that public enemies are not a historical film - and I noticed that the IMDB does not classify it as against the 2009 edition (which I have not seen). <br /> <br /> Come to the people! It's a story based on some real people - that's all! If I want a history lesson, I sit on this computer and read Wikipedia or something. Mother Barker (the real name Arizona - or Ari - Barker) was never accused of any crime, and other commentators have already mentioned that she probably did not participate in the activities of her son. When they were "working" they sent them to the movie! (I hope he sees this movie as not as critical as some people!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > Death at the age of 52 - Four hoodles from the home of a young girl hard mother. I think she's quite good at it. Shiny little smile he used to use multiple scenes classical! All right, I would agree with the critics that the direction of this film was from the bottom and I expressed sympathy for the actors. Theresa would tell the director that the tops shots should be forgotten - they did not contribute to the story. Perhaps some larger numbers were driven injected into their own skills to remove the poor side, but the second-graders were not brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> However, when it was definitely not a block-star, it was worth more than 2.8 !! All of my DVDs are on the personal database where I score them before the IMDB score (though sometimes the slightest changes affect). Instead of holding the film against others in the same sequence, I was able to qualify and I felt that enough entertainment for the 6.8. (Yes, I will admit that such practices depend on my mood, but even then those who voted in IMDB are also not true?) But, when you saw my IMDB, I am surprised <br /> <br /> with astonishment , I decided to read some comments in hopes of a low rating and I noticed that they are very constant. I agree with the movie that I've seen to be valuable and came to the conclusion that some people are very difficult to please. Well, since someone was absolutely impressive, why do not they go there and make some good movies? I can look at the splendor they can turn! On the other hand, if they can not do it, then why not they just stop?
