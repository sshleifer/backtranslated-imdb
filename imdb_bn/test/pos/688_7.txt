It seems to me an outstanding film, which believes in poor budget with poor cinematography and the editing process is not great. It may be of interest to know about submarines during World War II, but I recommend that others be cautious. Most of the scenes on this photo were flat and the actors were somewhat weak. The story about the return of men during a small holiday seems realistic, but there is no real pensing or tension in the story. I had a hard time understanding what the actors were saying, partly because of some strong English accent and possibly due to the poor work of some sound recording. I give this a 55/100. Most people will need to clean "run".
