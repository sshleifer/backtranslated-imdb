Five fascinating, intelligent, intelligent film-making filmmakers are being revitalized for themselves and then sharing their death experiences and beyond. Joel Schumacher points out with some skill - created some pretty eerie scenes as well as especially beautiful ones. The views of death are not what the spectators can expect, and all of what we will do - wait for us - thanks to the screenwriter Peter Filardi, who did an outstanding job coming up with the story. While the creativity of the story is impressive, the story has a lot of holes, especially in the logic section and credibility. All of Flatlines are an effective film due to scripts, yet again it has many places of worship and acting that brings together four talented actors and William Belden together. This core of actors is very close to each other and act responsibly. Catherine Sutherland makes a very impressive job as the head of the group - those ideas of mortality come back again and are born again. He also directed a young man to portray his image with harmful, destructive secrets. Kevin Bacon is the most practical of the group and as subtle as the suspect. The Oliver Plat is really good as the cause and the voice of human beings. Platt has some really good lines and played well paranoia. Yes, Julia Roberts is very good and very good here. Although actors play with each other and we believe they are good friends I was very impressed with most of the flats, but the story has influenced me the most. Just like the "flashback" scenes of those strong images that roam around the street in the dog's view.
