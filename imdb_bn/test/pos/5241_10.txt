What is wrong to give up as a shameless conversation and / or a strange characteristic, how people talked, lived before and lived in the world before World War II, and how well they can live alone in any year in the "Big Cat" movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is breathing my first time I saw it years ago. The reading of the boards helped me understand why it missed the box office, and why it got Owen's advantage for ten years in Beauty Western's film. Owen, according to Ford's incredible Cavity Trilogy, "True Grit" and "The Schutzist", since 1932, "Big Trill" and most of the Bs years were better than me. <br /> <br /> In 1930 no shame can defeat this boat in the theater. If this movie hits, we have enjoyed more movies with more reality and lesser hues. In my opinion, it is sometimes not one of the best western portrayals of the right dialog and real character realization, but the best representations of any film's edge. <br /> <br /> It's still my breath away Especially the dialog and type are the exact characteristic properties that simply do not exist. Some people celebrate homogenization on the surface of our culture that actually hide the biggest cultural downturn in the history of America ('people like us' and 'people like them') and political divisions (corporations vs. main streets), but for me the "Big Trill" difference to our surface It was obvious, but under it many people are the failure of the country and most people build a great culture and a great nation Wanted to work with the motivation to lift <br /> <br /> "Big Trill" is an epic of melting pot towards the American Dream. Of course the best film I've ever seen. The picture that ever film.
