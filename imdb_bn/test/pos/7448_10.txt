I'll start with a waiver: This movie is not recommended for interest, or has not played FF7 before watching it. The film relies on the knowledge of the spectators of each character to reveal the story plot elements. And it's so very subtly. Make your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cgi film and I promise it will be better. <br /> <br /> Remembering this, I have sometimes seen some of the most spectacular CG sensations in this movie. The whole experience is felt to play an additional long FMV sequence from steroids. Yes Attention in detail in every scene, especially heavy work-based people, was so irrational that it gave me sense of fear. <br /> <br /> I believe the soundtrack is simplified in order to help the audience focus on the animation quality. Again, those who are familiar with FF7 stories and backgrounds should not be surprised about the music (though the location and location of each soundtrack from the original move with each scene and mood where the point only increases the animation). <Once again, I've only played through FF7, fully enjoyed this piece of art from Square Nks. And that's the feeling among most scenes, danceography and organized. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are among the unfortunate majority who did not enjoy the goodness known as FF7 in PlayStation or PC, then the act will allow it to experience more and more experience before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to make a note of the quality of this image animation. Character move with fluidity. Each scene comes to life in the background and tells its own story. For those who criticize the plot plot and dependence of the story, I ask you to rebuild the animation. Face reactions, delicate formulas that bring up another layer of entertainment on the general description method of Story Plot Delivery. <br /> <br /> Square Inex and Great Tetuya Nomura have set a new bar for quality animations and storytelling. The arrival of the child encourages a new era for Cgi Animation, allowing the words mentioned in each character and between their own in the volume. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Square Enix. Waiting was a good price.
