I was very excited to see Rock Star because I'm a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I really thought I liked it more than I wanted. The script has left something to the desired, but the movie's performance is made for it. There were moments when the attitude of the Spanish tap was coming back and I can not help but think that the film was better than a document. However, I digress it <br /> <br /> Wahlberg continues to showcase his talent, as he plays with credibility as a common man whose biggest dreams come true. He does this with wonder and innocence, which not only inspires you, but also his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who has not influenced me in the movies till now, is surprisingly good as a girlfriend / manager. I showed more real emotions than I saw in his last few movies. <br /> <br /> But above everything, this really attracts you in this movie. 80s are drunk with the melody (let's face it - fans of the 80s of Bobby's fans will be sitting in their seats), the film is actually rock dragon songs and their role in Walharg really rock. <br /> <br /> I want to see this movie again, but the first one. I'm going out and going to buy a soundtrack!
