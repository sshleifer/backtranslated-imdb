I always liked listening to Body Holly and I felt real loss while killing her in an air accident. He was not in the old rock's roll class, let's call Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he was not far away. Who knows how he sang his legacy for decades! <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what do I say? He is proud of Body, as the actor (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played Holly's backup group "The Cricket". <br/> <br /> <br /> According to music, some of the most popular songs in Holi are at the beginning of the film and it is really good to Holi and finally a strong finish, in their last concert Iowa. Basi can not sing just like Holi, she sees a dead pigment for her in the department. Some things were the actor's best acting, and you have no argument from me. <br /> <br /> I am also happy that instead of finishing this film, they ended the tragedy with the Iowa concert on an extraordinary note that its tragedy. The last might have been a real downer, but they were not given to it.
