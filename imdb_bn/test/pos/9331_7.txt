Music videos are often overlooked in a discussion about film, most people consider them to be less artifacts. Although a great number of popular actors have a sleek clip for the latest hit single ad, yet some of the precious things stand above others, doing artwork in their own art (any thing managed by Spike Jonze or Michael Gondry is always worth watching). Although the word "art" is not used properly to describe Michael Jackson's 'Thriller (1983)', it is a schilic horror and a strong favorite hybrid of music and a non-violent short film that is almost uncommonly favorite After 25 years. The longest and most expensive thirty-minute song video during his Liberation war was directed by a filmmaker John Landes, although I was a classic, "The Blues Brothers (1980)", and I heard that an American WayWolf (1981) in London. A great entertaining horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, whether the 'thriller' qualification as a music video was achieved, it calculated the length of its acceptance, although its length of time was calculated (though Jackson 38 minutes in 38 minutes) and the title song Less than half of the total running time. Throughout a short film-in-film, the video shows a calm and brightly revealing night, his girlfriend (Ola Roy) reveals that she is part of the "different" night cloud from a full moon exposure. Perhaps she disappointed the unfortunate heroine, we came across the movie theater with Michael and her daughter, this drama is actually released in horror films. When the girl was scared, she left the movie and started walking in the house, at that time, Michael began to sing the latest songs, the thriller opening lines. However, when the zombies of bloody corpses appear in the local cemetery {they are highly described inside Vincent Price}, the situation starts to be interesting. <br /> <br /> Why is my finger tightly considered to be the greatest one of the 'Thriller' all music videos. It can easily be a lot of fun in the song itself, and Michael Jackson ?? Although he has become a comic butt of all the comedians for his extraordinary personality and work? There is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and actor. Perhaps an appropriate explanation for the popularity of this film is incredible, which has certainly gone; It's nothing that has never been seen before, and it's still a weird thing in the world of music videos. The scary giant make-up effects were driven by Rick Bucker and it was surprisingly graphic for a music clip, though it did all the fun with a good feeling. Several moments make for some truly exciting mystery, which successfully converts the atmosphere of the film {{While always wrapping a chit on the normal formula}}. Simply put, you never look at a zombie movie in the same way!
