This is my favorite Indian movie all the time. It's a comic genius. Salman Khan is happy! But Aamir Khan stole with his malicious dialogue. Kareeshma Kapoor's team tells a story of their own - If you stylishly deliberately wear some clothes to make the film fun (if you think that she is wearing a nail) then she is astonished. Andyas, your own comedy style movie that lets me laugh from the beginning to the end. There is not one bad moment, every scene is sunny, even songs and dance moves will keep you laughing. I particularly like the scene where Amr (Amir Khan) got back his memories. I've seen the movie many times lost count. And I'm glad to say that at this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this great movie so far as I know AA.A. It is not a copy of the Hollywood movie (thanks Allaah). Overall, I recommend this movie that Hindi / Urdu understands and loves good comedy. See it, you like it !!!!!
