This year before Halloween was this Saturday (today, during this writing time) and it will be the best horror math there. I'm not usually a fan of horror movies - in most cases recently the amount of whistle is revealed. However, in Campfire's Tables, the director received the secret of Hitakoob-Eskayer - unlike other contemporary movies, instead of using foreheading and 'nic-misses', you do not take every opportunity to panic - rather, the events that seem to be instant, climaxes will happen instantaneously, but It can not be. <br /> <br /> I did not catch the 'hook' or the first major segment, but you could miss both of them from what they read here. <br /> <br /> 'People can dress up' was disrespectful - this brief puts you on the edge of your seat, the little girl is waiting for something to happen to see her yard and house looking for her football ball and her dog. She faces so far that the heartbeat ends before the little part of the father-in-law, when the girl leaves and goes to bed, it seems that her dog is under her. She gets down to lick her hand, and she feels the touch of a tongue on her hand ... written in blood, looks like her mirror, 'People can laugh very much.' I will go to the last few seconds to find my reader, at this moment no one can revolve <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> This photo is about. It starts with a person on a motorcycle, driving only ... towards what he does not know, but he can feel himself even more intimate. As he was driving along, a storm broke out, and he was forced to find a mute girl shelter home. The two quickly interact with each other, but they can do something besides kissing, the girl expresses that the ghosts live in her house. They started packing to move fast, but for the last several decades they were caught through the reinstatement of a scene - preparing to return home to their parents, their daughter and her boyfriend, killing both, and then committing suicide. I'm going to discover you here at the end - I could not expect the story to be in any case, and just what I said was just a short summary of the story - I could not. <br/> <br /> 'The campfire' is the thread thread between all the stories, A fairly interesting rehearsal of the car accident theme and the girls are very attractive - In fact, most of the movies in this movie look good. However, despite the fact that it is crushed, the story is given justice, and the end is difficult to predict if you are involved with other stories. However, if you give enough attention to the campfire segments spread through the film, then it is possible to predict, especially if you have watched movies based on the same generation. (Featuring MSST3, Remember Soltkark? Similar, but besides the horror of Vivian Shilling and a large part of the film, if you've seen the first 30 minutes, you can make the last prediction.) All, I've seen long time the best horror movie, and To buy a descriptive horror math.
