I saw this picture at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since I worked in wine business, I was interested in seeing this documentary and I was not frustrated. It has been reported from more than 500 hours footage, the good news is that the non-ace will not only release theater cut but will release the December 10, ten-hour series film in the movie (ThinkFilm is distributing it) through the next Christmas. The bad news is that it is still a bit of an insomnia animal. It was about three hours long when seen in Cannes. For Toronto, he spent nearly half an hour but it was clocked in 135 minutes. Now, for me, it's okay. I love wine and hear about my business debate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. The innovative theme is strengthening the similarity between globalization and the irrational effects of wine critic Robert Parker. Small local producers are bought by large companies (as well as localities in America), or by market forces, their side can be changed by Mr. Parker's palette, which is the American market (and world)). <br /> <br /> This is a complicated issue, and I understand why Nositor wants to talk to his subjects. Father of the Deep Wine Industry Robert Mandvi and his son Tim and Michael face opposition from local vignerons and government officials in trying to buy Landedoc's land. Demon Gassak founder and wine maker Iim Gibert, Iconoclastic opponent of Mandviar plan and crusader of the local terrorism dispute. Robert Parker himself, has expressed some discomfort with his influence and refuses to stop writing about the wine he supports. "Flying Wine Maker" Michelle Rowland has advised the creation of a few dozen winery consultants, Parker-friendly wine around the world. This documentary has many more interesting personalities. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you will want to find out the ten series of the film and the dramatic version. However, if you do not drink alcohol, then how the world's global forces change the oldest and most established heritage of the world is an interesting aspect. The influence of local culture and economy can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
