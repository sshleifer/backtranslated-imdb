When Alfred Hitchcock created the train's stranger, he returned to the top of his generation in public for most of the movie. From 1946 to 1950, his film was not a box office success, and his contractual arrangements with David and Slegenik ended with this. Actually he has made some really good films in the period, such as Notary, SpellBand, Capicnik, Rop, and (my opinion) under STAGESTRUCK. But when the notification and the spellbank were chosen, the audience hits were stopped: the use of the dream sequence of the Salvatore Dal's spellbay in spellbands was acceptable among his psychologists. But after taking a long test, he was frustrated by misguiding the public (ignoring the quality of that film), and making the spectacular viewers lurk by a leading character in a flashing - it would be much disliked - in STAGESTRUCK. It seems to be a failure (it was not), a matter of bad times for CAPRICORN (it was released just like the confusion of his star, Incredible Bergman and Roberto Rosalini). The paradigm case was another failure - and it was really slightly on its side. <br /> <br /> With the strangers of a train, Hitkoc moved away from the special interest to her in recent movies. Instead he focused on sharing his crime and misrepresented his favorite theme. Based on the novel Patricia Highskit, how was a professional tennis player Guy Henes involved with one of his fans - Bruno Anthony, a player who is traveling on a cross-train as an athlete. Bruno is fiction and fawning, and Guy fills him as one of the common fans ... If a little pronunciation, with the words of him wanting to be the first rocket from outer space. But Bruno Guy knows all about personal problems. She married a ruthless young woman named Mary and loved An Senator's daughter, Anne Morton. Bruno knows that Mary will not divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how she can be sympathetic - she hates her midwife, who is constantly criticizing her. Then Bruno mentions (to stop his cough), he has the idea that he has two people - technically unfamiliar - instead of killing them for one another and then instead of replacing them with two perfect, unsupported crimes. Guy listens to the idea - and it agrees with a fun idea. Train Guy reached the destination, and his last comment idea is like the legitimacy. He does not realize that "Brilliant" Bruno is a social way, and believes that Guy likes to kill each other's enemies! <br /> <br /> This is really a wonderful easy plot. Bruno, certainly killed Mariam, but he expects the Guy to survive the assassination agreement and kill his parents. Guy is scared - and worse, he has found that he is the number one suspect in the police department. In order to encourage Guni to mention that Bruneo had his next lighter (he put it in the pocket on the train) and plant it in place of murder, Gaia found himself in deep trouble - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) ) Insane Bruno? Hit <br/> <br /> <br /> He always plans his film shots carefully, from the beginning we see both of our "heroes" looking at the lucky meeting of the train from the beginning. Continuous cross-contact is used in the film to show how two men are drawn in each other's orbit. It's like drawing them together in fate. Yet both have their own personalities - and hits, with a common margin, crazy bruno actually makes more than an interesting figure. His plan can be harmful (if successful, two people will be killed, and he can keep Gaya alive with the contract) but he has an encouragement for his life. Guy also once had a doubt, but he was made more intensive and neutral than his marriage failure, with whom he has been dating a socially prominent woman. <br /> <br /> Cast is very good. Robert Walker probably had his best role in this film (one year before his death). It was a lot of crying from the front door of the house after you roam or watch. His lithe figure also looked elegant in the story in different scenes. Gary Farley Ganger works like a cousin of her co-murderer, especially in situations that make him increasingly suspicious of the authorities (her earlier role is suspected by Jimmy Stewart's abusive behavior due to the growing suspicion of Jimmy Stewart). For women, Casey Rogers is rightly sluttish as Mary - the audience is ready for her death (an impressive shot reflective of her glasses) so that they are actually delighted Bruno in her work of evil. Patricia Hittak Anne (Ruth Roman) appeared as a younger sister who kept the earliest resemblance to Mary and eventually stopped Bruno during social events. He plays this rare role well. Ruth is a true supporter of Roman Granger, but her role is limited because she is established in her background, and little less essentially. Other supporter actors, Leo G. Mario Lorraine (usually a comedian) as Carol Sina, as Bruno's drunken mother, and Norman Warden, has been shown to be the best beneficiary of unexpectedly violence from Walker - all in a master's hand.
