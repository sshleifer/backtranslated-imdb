With appropriate reverence for Joel Fabienia and Rosemary Nicholas and their characters, the Department S will forever be associated with Jason King of Peter Winard. <br /> <br /> Most people remember him like this camp, the detective Austin gets the power of a bright and guilty woman, but it will do an outstanding job for the character: he is much more humble than that. <br /> <br /> Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight with all the bad guys and eventually chips), he is violent (depends on whether the public's perception is reading his novel), many of his intelligence work behind them. And when he is speculation without coming back, he sulks when Annabelle is right ... and he is often. He definitely drives a man's medieval crisis and drink but ....... Jason King bright. If Wingard played him as a hero in a disorder, he did not work, but because of his tendency to love his poetry, love of love and tremendous tendency, he looks like a tiger (and on the way to his intelligence) occasionally, but most of them have the best line And the history of the TV has deteriorated. And without playing him white, chemistry and interaction among three main characters is better for it. <br /> <br /> Recently viewing it again in the DVD, you will see how much depth Wyngarde Jason kept in the King.
