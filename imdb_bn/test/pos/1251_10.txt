Bruce Willis is so nice to see the closure of his performances and let us see that he is really a talented actor Like a 40-year-old image consultant, he gets enlightened in this film, who has lost touch with his child - until he encounters. This is one of the rare movies that is not talking to viewers and really offers something for the Hollah family. It does not take care of each other, hold some children inside you, and grow just like you think. Willis seems to be creating an impressive track record for working with kids (only "six money" witnesses with Halley Joel Osmement), and he has great chemistry with Spencer Braslin. There are some excellent photography and music, and the last is wonderful and lifting. A great movie to watch with every member of your family.
