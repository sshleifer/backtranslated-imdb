Wow, this movie is amazing. This is an excellent picture. Some sick scenes (not terrible as terror firms or citizen toxicies) have some nudity, and the demon monster's debut in this movie! It has set up the scene for many of Tramor's films, this is a very quarters movie. It's a comedy, romance, and my favorite horse / cow mix! Not many holes in this jolt, but satisfied enough. This is Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet's best adaptation. Much better than any other version. This is so entertaining, and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rocon ... Hey ... I like him. :) I would say it's a great movie, very funny, and Lema is a good host for it. Good acting, and Kaufman always as stylishly instructed. All will look for TROMA fans!
