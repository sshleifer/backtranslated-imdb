This movie is a variation of the theme which we have seen over and over again - the position of adventure in space. Character all character characters - feisty heroine, Judas, covered, etc. The only questions are really those who are beside the snuff. Sometimes this tried and tested formula works - like in this case - but not more often - really mind-numbing "Red Planet." <br /> <br /> Why does this work? Because it's stylish. Above average acting. And above all it is not predictable. Conclusion is not posted on the sign. I was not really surprised how how it would end and how it ended up and how it was ending. This book is the title of my book. <br /> <br /> This is a playful and entertaining movie. Although we did not know that there was no possibility of changing the face of the movie, it is not frustrating.
