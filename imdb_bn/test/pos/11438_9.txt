This movie is almost never seen - I can enjoy it again, for the only reason I was made from VHS copy when it was shown on TV on TV in 1991. <br /> <br /> The accessory cast is definitely enjoyed by themselves and this reflects visitors. A razor sharp script helps with things, and once you have seen it, you might want to see it over again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is 'star' but everyone contributes to the film. A great jazz soundtrack to boot. There are emotional moments during filming, but not on the side of ill-sweet communication - these people travel throughout their life and they express their excitement. <br /> <br /> If you really can get it to see.
