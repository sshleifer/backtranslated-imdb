Although Hal Hartley is not the best work (my personal favorite "Survival Desire"), there are so many things to choose from, especially for supporters of Hartley's dialogue. Even to new viewers in Hartley, I would definitely suggest the superfamous "Dogma" of this movie. The film is more intelligent, its source material (Bible), and more than the other millenniums ago, is more interesting than the movies. <br /> <br /> This film is actually part of French ".by." (2000 PVV series); For example, it is probably less budget movie than other activities of the strike. Although the need to have simple scenes shot with a digital camera, it is understood that the main problem of this movie is the unfortunate use of the blurry / jittery effect. I would not be happy to see this effect in the movie again; Especially in the beginning, it creates almost incompetent films. But ignoring these errors, and you will be treated in a fine film. Especially notable Magdalena (played by P. J. Harvey) how Jesus saved him from throwing stones at him; I'm a briefly moving scene. (Though Mary did not know that this incident happened, the Bible woman was unnamed.) <br /> <br /> <br />
