I give this film 8/10 overall. Apparently, one of the great things is not surprising: Humorinimus Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keef's an artist director's dream mix - and the legality of film as a serious art form. Color, form, imagery, beautiful use of the environment - and fabulous set decorations, combined with sophisticated computer graphics. So, for 10/10! Wow <br /> <br /> Plot lines, well, more expected. You know that they will save the girl and eventually find the killer, but the story is still interesting and passive so that you can drag and keep you there. 6/10 for him <br /> <br /> <br /> Squam factor ... I can not give it a rating, but the film definitely made me fooled and I was watching it on the TV screen. This, of course, has a greater effect on a bigger screen than a big deal. A stylish landscape is a twisted, erotic nature graphic violence - even if beautiful - extremely unpredictable. There is no world within the murderer's head - love! - my world Because I saw this movie in the video, I was able to repeat a few sequences and was praised almost as soon as I was not so nervous about where I was going to the scene and I suspect the whole movie will be valuable <br /> <br /> General advice: Do not let these kids or conservative grandfather do that, but if you are interested in the visual look of movies Like the ultimate industry, do not forget the strange Gore and just want to take a "mind trip", it's a winner. Oh, and if you are interested in babes, Jennifer Lopez is quite hot. <br /> <br />
