I love this movie, my favorite one all the time. Anne Blayette, like Sally and Mayine, is sweet and trouble-free. She believes St. Anne's prayer will solve all her and her friends's troubles. Destroying bad people's sub-plots to get her father's property interesting and clever What kind of brothers do they want to choose? Also, look her "aunt bee" as her mother, a powerful Irish woman who did not bring her family inside. He brought his family inside. They do not guarantee it again.
