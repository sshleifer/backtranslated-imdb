I saw the premiere of "The Path of Paradise," and it was astonished by the dramatic license and all. I lived and remembered NYC (Brooklyn) for several years. Today, groups like al-Qaeda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been linked, I see this as a warning recognized by our government. For this, I will blame our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 We had a new strategy to head the two branches of our two branches and there is no excuse for us to withhold its duration. "Pass to Paradise" but there was dramatic scene of a '93 preview, and nobody took care of it. Now, after about 3,000 deaths and a few years later, we've struggled to find the answer that decides to solve.
