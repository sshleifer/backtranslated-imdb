Up and coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool / and channel to open the young mind of a black culture. Focus and perspectives were a positive message for our people, and hope for change. I strive to fight each American family, and award the advice to this selection. The opportunity to hear the concept of middle-class blacks becoming their own business has never been given. This problem was so consistent with the real life situations that influenced many lives. I sincerely hope the entire volume can be restored and Americans will be kept to enjoy with their families. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
