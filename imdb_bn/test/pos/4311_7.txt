Beautifully illustrated, little disparate, "no one" is a good evening entertainment. The plot is fairly easy - three yuppies get into a bar with scraps with a group of strangers, and they become much more than the application for. The acting is decent, and there are some unexpected twists. Watch for complete incredible (eg 10 shot revolver, and 25 shot semi-automatic handguns).
