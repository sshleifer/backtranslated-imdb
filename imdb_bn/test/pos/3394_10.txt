Everyone who threw this movie was genius, every character of it is perfect for them, and each of them did a great job in their part. Before the civil war and during the civil war, the difference between wealthy, average white and black people was a good philosophy of what was the difference between them. The story gives you some insights like the real problems of the era, and the problems of daily living were intrinsic in those days. The storyline is mandatory, and the drama puts your attention through the whole movie. There are some letters that you will fall in love with, some of the characters that you hate and you get yourself emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> I love both my wife and I, and we'll see some of them years, I'm sure.
