I've enjoyed Carmen better than the basic sin (Angelina Jolie and Antonio Bondrus), which shared some similarities and which I have enjoyed so much. I felt that acting was powerful here (Pug Vega displayed in a larger range, there is more fire and Sbaraglia was also great). Overall, their acting was more bitter, more believable (less dreamy than basic sin, and both actors were 'celebrity status' and 'superb face' depending on low-film work. Vega definitely sizzles, as expected. <br /> <br /> The director Vincent Aranda has created a detailed world (again, better than the original sin) that gives you the rural areas and everyday actions. Let's remember on the Spanish island - for example, people unload products from the cart, changing the candle of the street lamp, all in the background of the action. <br /> <br /> Although I think the recent release of our femme fatals (like Bruno de Palma's Fayal) I am deeply sympathetic towards it, Carmen is a tricky, modern, and docile to the dirty classical double Indemnity tradition. Delightful amusement. Another excellent example of the victory of the courageous European films of the frosty and safe Hollywood rents.
