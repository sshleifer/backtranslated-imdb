It's time to get his credit for this film "Kate Jackson" .., I can remember this and try to understand it on TV. My grandmother died from cancer and I was very sick and I was 15. I did not find many years After Richard died long, I miss him in other shows / movies. <br /> <br /> I still have a copy of VHS tape but it is not CCC or discontinued closing captions for listening and the movie that I can remember or know today is just faulty .. I have a DVD or VHS Can not find a copy that has sub-titles in English. If someone is out, you can learn about the copy of the VHS or DVD copy or the English copy or sub-title of CSD. <br /> <br /> Thank you - coffin
