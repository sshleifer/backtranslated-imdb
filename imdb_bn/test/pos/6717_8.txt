LIFEFORCE was one of the biggest flops of Canon Films. This has received mostly bad reviews and because of the Spielberg / Polatorjist controversy, there is nothing to do with the help of the developer Tob Hooper. It's all unfortunate, because LifeForce is really a great movie. It comes with a very entertaining, fast speed and explores all of the best directions, production, performance, and special effects to burst across the screen! It must be bizarre on paper: producer of DELTA FORCE, Alan's screenplayer, director of Chessab Mossas of Texas, CFFA Music Player, Special Effects Wizard of Star Wars ... was not ready for the audience <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> We got an alien spaceship full of giant bat! We got a sexy, nude place vampiress sucking out the human souls! We got the explosion agency! We got the zombies! We've got! We got an S & M asking! We found the whole city of London fire! It meets Dakula's living dead night and completes the quarter-month and fills PIT Earth. This is probably the single most harmful horror / science-fever / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / mysterious epic never exposed, that is, there is no other in there. <br /> <br /> Try to see this movie chemically changes. Perhaps then you have to understand. One truly f *** ed up experience, and director Toba Hooper's most intimate film director. Maybe one day, it will find its audience.
