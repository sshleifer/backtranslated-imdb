I'm a Petite Officer 1st class (E-6) and has been in the USCG for 6 years and thinks that this film firmly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far away. Pio Fisher (Kutcher) went inside the ship sinking to get the captain of the ship from the engine room ... which will never happen. The sniffer can not go inside a pot, the situation does not matter. Secondly, the command center (supposedly codaya), it looked like a NASA Command Center ... there is no high-tech gear. Thirdly, do not conduct a search and rescue case with 10 people in the Captain watch of the operation. In fact it can be E-6 or E-7 as the SAR controller, and there may be two other Assistant Workers like SR Controller and Radio Watchstarter. Otherwise the movie was dead, I think they included other roles of CGI and their role in search and rescue rather than just aviation-based rates. Some scenes from "A" schools remind me about my days and their silent stuff and have been suffering for my young days.
