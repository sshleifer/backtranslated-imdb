There is a symptom of the Lost Highway which says: <br /> <br /> * Large Spirir Aid * <br /> <br /> (But you already know, right?) <br /> <br /> Since this movie To the many people who are not clearly understood, I want to explain why I make this plot a perfect sense. As others have said, viewing this movie is not enough. If you have an MD DVD, you can "cheat" by clicking on "Top 10 Unlocking MDs" by David Lynch's (but only for a second or third view.) <br /> <br /> First of all , Mulholland Drive is perfect bright. A Best Composition It's a movie that refuses to give up your head. Most comments on DVDs are not correct, but "it gets inside your head and enjoys it" really hurt it. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is praised for making a movie that is not only beautiful but also stylish in appearance - according to cinematography, superb acting (SP Naomi Watts), Boulevanity is a hunting soundtrack, and it has a dream quality - but On top of it it has managed to include viewers in such a way that there are few movies before. (Lastly, the last time you watch a movie that does not leave your mind and everyone is forced to talk and write, regardless of whether they like it or hate it?) <br /> <br /> Okay, all right, this Time to justify the statements. <br /> <br /> Most people who are trying to break into pieces have reached the conclusion that the first half is an illusion / a dream sequence. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is very bad to understand the concept of film by hoping for those who have presented the story in a timely manner. Logic and linear method for the viewer. But for those expectations, I ask you to check the name of the manager and come back again. ;) <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of the sadness of MD Diane Selvin, which is impossible for an actress-actor, other actor, Camila Rolls. Diane is struggling with the lack of talent, he is constantly struggling to progress in his career, and thinks he has failed to deliver his own and his parents' expectations. After realizing that Camila would never be her (director of C. Adam Kescher, director), he recruited a Hitman to get his release and later to deal with the production that it produced. <br /> <br /> This movie may seem like a strange opening for the first type of thriller; Which is a 50s dance / jitterbag competition, where we can see the main character bati is a great performance. We see him with an elderly couple (which we see twice more throughout the film), and appreciate him. <br /> <br /> No, wait. People see this for the first time. Indeed, another significant fact given before credit is that the camera is moving into an object (though slow) and the scene is rapidly flipping. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, it's a dream that follows. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < A positive illustration of The name 'Betty' was chosen as the name of the waitress's real name in the match. In the dream version, the name of the waitress 'Dian'. <br /> <br /> Rita: The fantasy version of Camila Roads that turned into an amnesiac, with the help of the Dream of Dreams and with the help of fabulous car accidents. This makes her dependent on weak and Diane love. Then he was easily placed in a luxurious house of Betty / Diana's aunt, which has been allowed to stay in bed. <br /> <br /> Coco: In the real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, Betty is the acting woman who is the Betty Apartment Complex. He is mainly a powerful figure, which can be seen in both parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Adam Director. We know from the second half that gets involved with the cemmery. His only purpose for the first half of the film is to work as a touch bag only for Bati / Diene, because he brought such hatred towards him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: The real aunt of Diane, but instead of being outside the city, she's actually dead. Diane used to pay the remaining money by his aunt and pay for Camilla's assassination. <br /> <br /> m Roach: An ideal linginian character. Not real Only the sequence of Dreams of Dreams appears. He is a mysterious, influential person who controls the chain of events from his wheelchair. He did the same thing as Twin Peaks in the back of the conversation (which he played). <br /> <br /> Hitman: The person who killed Comilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although the sequence of dreams is presented in some more fashion (downwards more). <br /> <br /> Now, in the movie founded in different versions of the characters, we can begin to delve into the plot. Of course I will not go to every little detail (I will not publish it in Croatian), but try to explain some important scenes related to Lynch's "Hint". <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, Camilla was reproduced as a reminder by the unlikely survival of the car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, which completely weakened her. I was not very curious about the MD, Lin chin indicates what is true and whether it is continuously. I have already mentioned the camera running on pillow, but notice that two cars are moving in every song when it comes to Limo. <br /> <br /> Only one car hit Limo; What about the other? Even if they make their accidents clear, but they will not try to help others, or at least ask for help? My theory is that, since it's a dream, another vehicle's presence is set, and almost forgotten. As Robert Ebert said so strongly, "It does not explain, like a true dream, it does not meet its sequences, it gets impressive, links on it, cancel unlocked platlines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From Between Mulholland's accident site, and on the streets of Anth Ruth's apartment, using her way of walking and cluttering, Betty came and we came to this unexpected old couple Seeing them vilely and screaming themselves and in the camera. The first indication that what we are seeing is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> While the old couple seems to be strangers with Betty, I think they are actually their parents- Mother (because they appreciate her jitterbug competition). Perhaps she did not know them well, and did not have a better relationship as she wanted, so this couple had her dream Has been shown to be very pleasant and helpful. They represent his feelings of murder, and express feelings of Diane's absence of unintended targets in his life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Diane saw him as the main force behind the pressure of the director to accept the part of the film Camille, (the second half of the film From Adam), and he took a large part of his dream. Because of his feelings and remorse for the murder of Camila, a part of him wants to miss him, so he makes him a fool criminal. <br /> <br /> I think this scene, Lynch's attempts to completely screw his audience, because they give false accusations to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Love that 'Bad make me worse' <br /> <br /> <br /> The next funny scene is one with two people in Tavin, who talks about holding one of them in a wall with a man who can see this repetitive nightmare. They are sitting outside the diner After a little talk, they will wander around and walk towards the fence corner, mixing the scene with a nice philosophy. <br /> <br /> While reaching the corner, a left-handed character comes out behind the corner with a vague appearance, causing the nightmare to be afraid of living shit. This nightmare only exists in Diane's mind; When he paid for the murder when the diner saw that guy. So, in short, translate the misery of the poor people to his obessions. The left also indicates Diane's evil direction, as can be seen later in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Council is formed (along with the strange) that the Linchenian landscape has always been one of the weirdest characters - Diane Adam has seen him in the party for a very short time, but like our dreams, we rarely tell a big part of our dream Can I be able to give him an important part of his dream? We have given more information during his scene that what we are seeing is not real (its sudden disappearance, etc.) <br /> <br /> Somebody is used as a director to hire someone when the director is up to him in a strange position (here is a light Clearly indicates that it is part of a dream). He also sees what he says that he will appear once again if he (Adam) does well, or if he does bad, then twice more He appeared twice during the film, which tells Dean that he has done badly. He is also one of them to wake up to reality (this scene is probably fit by his needs according to his requirements), and then he committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Approximately-visible Castiglian brothers (where we can see composer Badulenti as Luigi), probably before the camera, Diane was an espresso and this resulted in Adam's announcement in the second half of Adam. It can be a statement from Lynch at the same time. <br /> <br /> The scene they entered in Dian's apartment, the body lying in bed, Camila, but noticed how she took the sleeping position of Diana; Deene sees herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, even though she had only one wound in her face after shooting herself. This scene is filled with some genuine Linchenian tropics. Since Dia did not know (or when) Hitman would go to Cemailer and finish him, he would only keep her in her own house. <br /> <br /> In real life, the devine audition for the movie was bad. In his dream, he has delivered a perfect myth - the entire staff has excelled about his performance. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> This is reducing his terrible work by giving back his money to Diane, since the killings did not happen anymore. <br /> <br /> When one of his neighbors comes to his piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; She takes a bath from her table and leaves, but when Camila and Betty face the couch, then the camera is placed on the table, then the ashre is displayed, which tells the face of her neighbors to face her. <br /> <br /> Adam cinematography is auditioning for actresses "The Girl". Diane used the same word when summoning the photo of Hitman cameras. <br /> <br /> The blue box and key represents the main turning point of the movie and where the true identities of letters are revealed. There are many symbols here; The box can represent Dean's future (it's empty), or it can be a kind of pandora's box (Hitman smiles when he asks him what will be open). However, it is linked to murder by the blue key (kept beside the killings). At the end of the picture is seen in the hand of a few other abstract left hands. <br /> <br /> Club Silinside is a tasty little addition to remind the viewers, which he sees is not real. It also means that Dyan is going to wake up in his reality (his reality is such a nightmare that he can not escape his dreams) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wonderful old couple Once again, Diane was tortured in such a way that he saw himself as the only way to escape from screaming and to be afraid of his own fear. <br /> <br /> However, my $ 0.02 Hope this movie can help people to be frustrated and to tell the people the 'worst movie' or without making a plot of some of those effects. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Lynch created illogical fear, and he must have also earned this picture. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
