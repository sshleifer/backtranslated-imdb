Great literary frustrating movies are a rare exception in style, John Haston's good farewell to life and movies is surprising, and the complete truth about the soul of James Joyce's short story, a low meditation of love, death, and time expression.

Thankfully, the temperament of cool and gentle sadness is to re-establish the marriage between Gabriel and Greyto Cono, in the hotel bedroom, for example, as it comes out of the snow. This is a sad story, I guess, but the kind that you feel good, does not leave blue. Specifically recommended as a date movie - For people of love who are sweet and not facing the grief of life.
