When viewing the animated Superman shorts of 1940s, the similarity of plots may become a bit annoying - the opposition often becomes a mad scientist in a hidden headquarters, threatening the metropolis with an evil invention - death rays, mechanical monsters, electric earthquakes, magnetic telescopes, do you have . <br /> <br /> This one is refreshingly different. Bad cars roam around cars, shooting and bomb blasts, but the action center is the Golden Train (which travels to Lewis Lane, just as news reporter in the newspaper). Train movies have their own components from the Great Train Robbery of 1903, and there are several features: Driven by speed, running cars on the roof, steam engineers from tender inside, fighting engineers. The train came out of the highway from the train's trout, the losses (people or the whole train) on the train ... within a few minutes of this beautiful piece. <br /> <br /> <br /> If the final day is not won, he will not be a superman film without some extraordinary achievements (associated with the balance sheet and high-precision location). If you're a fan of train movies, do not miss it. It can be downloaded legally from the public domain and archive.org.
