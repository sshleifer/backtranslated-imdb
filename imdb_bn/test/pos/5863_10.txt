This movie is probably one of the most horrific, most creative works of horror. This is what you want ... suspense, drama, comedy, misleading subopts, native America, brain eating ... if you look for all-anything, last-brain movies, you will not see them again. A human story, bent on retaliation. How much better? "I know, I'll crush their brains!" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can recommend this movie enough.
