Just telling me that the tourist trope is a good movie and then 99.9% horror films that came out of Hollywood. If you do not believe in the Unfathomable Fruit or They And it is better than a sync directly into video releases such as stubs, blades, pools etc. The film is one of the biggest problems of tourist traps that it is never seen by viewers. The film opened in 1979, it is given a PG rating by MPAA. Anyone who knows the horror movies knows that a PG in a horror movie is usually a kiss for death for movies. (Director David Schmoeller discusses this issue in the DVD's commentary track.) Although there are exceptions like Poltergeist, which got a PG rating. However, there are big differences between tourism traps and Poltergeist. Tourist Trapp is not a big budget Hollywood movie like Polturgist, and it was not produced by Steven Spielberg. That was enough to guarantee the success of Poltergeist alone. (For those who have visited the tourist trappes for you, MPA has rated this film PG rating, why you hold your head sharp. The 'heart blast' scene should be enough for the film to have enough slippers and R rating, how it is going on behind the bloodstream. ) I have to admit that when I was young I saw a copy of the video store shelf's pollutarist, a I picked it up, saw it PG rating and instead put it in the back of a R rated film. After a few years, I finally saw the pollator and I missed a great movie to not rent a PG horror movie. After that I will not judge a film based on ratings again. This is probably what happened to the tourist trip. People like me, like the pollutor, will probably ignore it for R movies. Perhaps it can be a teenager, most of these films are targeted. Friday was not an excellent form on 13th September, but it was very good at the box office, because it was rated R and was widely advertised by Paramount at that time. It is found in his audience and made several sequels spawn enough quantities. Folks, tourism traps just as well as Friday when you look at it 13. The same thing could have happened to the tourist traps. We have seen tourists Trap 2, 3, 4, etc. As far as the film goes away, the sharp trope is a horror film made in a tiny budget, but it is well-managed, well-directed and well-formed at many levels. Chuck Cones offers the best performance of riots and film as Mr. Slusane. Certain credentials must be given to Pinocchio Donagio, whose score is different from the others, and its ambiguity. Music in the scene involving Mannequins is especially vague. Donagio also worked with many other film scores from the horror film Carey and Tourist Trap. He did a great job in film and continued to film on this day. The weakness in the tourist traps is that there is no explanation for Davy's power. Perhaps how it is supposed to be He just has them, and we should take it so that the movie is to work. We take it at a point, but after the basement of the house, there are events that create the phone ring of the Davy store. In this case, Dave restricted its ability to use? Can phone ring in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is its range? These are things that people are not taking care of of this film can be referred to as errors. Others will accept it as wrong. I'm accepting it. This picture is not enough for those questions made to hate me. This is a horror film. We should not read it too much. Many called it a 'killer manager' movie. I strongly believe that any Manquin can not be killed in this movie. Manicuens are controlled by Davy's power, who use them as weapons. This is a common misconception about this movie. Some people have a problem with mannequins and some even say they are simply stupid. I think they have added the overall laziness of the film. The overall tourism trap is a good fun rental. *** (5 out)
