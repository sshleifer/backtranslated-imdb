Like many, I first saw the water kids as a child or young teenager at the beginning of seventeenth century / detention. Since then, it was with me with sweet tunes, memorable scriptures, at least successful successful animations, and heart, cold and finally good beneficial temple. In recent times I sat down at least two decades to see it again, and I noticed this time in similar matches like Wizard of Oz. No, these are not flexible examples, but listen to me. In this case we have a boy and his dog - personal problems in the "home" area, after moving away from a while and at the scene, change the appearance of their faces. This one, boy and dog become animated. The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Tito are in color. In this case, the boy and the dog are told, for the answer to the water kids and then to give instructions to Karen, and if his courage is shown to Tom, he should have the power to go home .... Oz, Dorothy also needs to find an official person who tests him before allowing him to return home. Among the water kids, Tom fills three letters that will help him with his child's water journey - Doraha has three helpers. When every help is met, we enjoy with the rendering of "Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi, High Cocktail" ... we are on our way. "We stopped watching the wizard." Dorothy has a good wizard sort of care for her; Tom has a female with a lot of role (Billy Whitelaw) to do the same. If you look closely at the two sides, there are many more opinions, which say, Water kids are not frustrating in any way, I only comment on hunger among the two guys, this film is bad guys Bernard Cribbins and always interesting James Mason. Who has some tough performance.Tom and Ela are good for kids, the supporting actor Joan Greenwood (loved by his voice!), David Timminson, and John Parateau and Lance Percival vocalist have added this mixture, I must admit that the animation is for Sterling Less than that but enough for the challenge Nimated characters are all favorites I always have my favorite sort of problem in the French sword and John Inman / Mr. Humphries like Seahorse. The scene where we hear the sound of this guru, the ship is just a huge pole-spotted bow-tie with Bob, I'm going to see the sea level, always rolling me! Water baby is a lot of fun. Sure, this is more than a child's film, but it will always be a favorite place in my heart. For the success of the film, most of the director of credit must go to Director Lienel Jeffrey. Jefferies is a wonderful ridiculous actor and his ideas of humor clearly clear the whole.
