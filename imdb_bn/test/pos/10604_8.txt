I first saw this movie in a video store and I stayed as a left margarine fan, rent it to see what it was. Since I have a huge and stupid (note the stupid word) humor's ideas, I saw this movie absolutely smiling. Some parts are timeless and random, but that makes them so funny. Interesting to get this slippers in the mouth and appreciate this movie you will need to think things like bashed on the head with a watermelon. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at the role. These people actually did a good job. Nothing is good enough to get Oscars, but to get past the amateur level. Young and young adults will probably find this more entertaining used in modern slang and situations. I do not recommend showing it to your parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> It was great to have everyone acting, the script was ridiculous, and the story is really something that can be related to you.
