That is certainly not the best film ever. But it is certainly valuable to humans with a special kind of mind. So who is sad and depressed, nightly horror story, and wolf and real mad love - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) For me, I can stand it only once ... but since that wolf, and Saint-Lucy, the children painted and untitled Christ live in my nightmare.
