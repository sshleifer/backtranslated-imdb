Finally, this 1997 HBO movie was able to get the DVD as it was down for viewing. In the end, I'm old, "Those who can not learn from the past, they have been destroyed to revive it." There was a reflection in the mind. Four years after the first bombing of the first Twin Towers (and four years before 9/11 events), stones reveal close encounters, blunders and series of official decisions, which are the first bomb attacks of two Twin Towers, and lessons should be learned from us. <br /> <br /> There are a great cast features of authentic actors in the way Paradise. Peter Galagher and Marcia Gay Hardin face John Antisev and Nancy Floyd face threats of terrorism, but their NYPD counterpart Loop Napoli (Paul Gilfayle) suffers from lack of formal interest from their top officials. The Art Owner, Andrés Katousulas, Shaun Tib and Tony Gilan, among those who handle this role and play their role, make their roles not as possible clichés but also as real living people and make the film better. The special mention is that Ned Eisenberg, like Eid Salim, who is not for suspicious FBI officials, may be aware of this plot. <br /> <br /> The image is well-formed. Despite being made for Wires, the film does not look like a low-budget movie with its production and its production values ​​especially in New York City locations. The film's fascinating film is about the film giving almost an almost documentary style. When these elements are combined with scripts, it helps to give a feeling of reality to all movies that make events even more annoying. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about his film is his script. Film facts are true (some dramatic licenses that are always required) and are more frustrating on the hedesite, but the film was first shown twelve years ago, it is certainly true. This is how the film was able to smuggle bombs at the center of the World Bank. Thanks to the lack of Arabic translators, the government agencies failed to send information to each other, the FBI ignored the police from a source and was unable to obtain the sources of the police department. Worse, the investigators could connect the points that only 9.11 attacks of these same things were not allowed, but in some cases (such as lack of translators) they are still going on. Even more coolness happened which ended and today all looks very predictive. <br /> <br /> A movie on the path of Paradise, which should be essential today. The film is not only good acting and produced, but teaches us a lesson that we have learned. Picture text? Those who can not learn from the past, they are destroyed for recovery. If you can find this image then check it out and learn from it.
