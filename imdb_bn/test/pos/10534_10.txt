Centurions are one of the best cartoons ever and it is much better than the garbage made in the past 14 years that the young generation can enjoy a good show of people so it needs to be made on TV and DVD. I have an online petition that addresses the website http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html which originally tried to get this shot within five days of the week but now the TV station is trying to get it on DVD focused on it There have been bad public relations. We all want to be convinced to keep this DVD in DVD so that it can be seen by future generation. From now on, the hashro toys are owned by the toy toys line, we want to try to satisfy them with the Transformer and to film some live action such as Geo Joe this year. We need good cartoons like to come back and be enjoyed by young generation. Please sign this petition so that we can stay in the DVD one day saying "Power Extreme!"
