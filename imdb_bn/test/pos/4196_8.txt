"I'm proud of '' Head ', Mike Nassith said. He must be, because this movie, which has been disappointed by many of us or has been studied and tested by film professors, works on many levels. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is incomplete. Too many, frustrating. It is almost as if the producer guides you and enters the movie: "You find it." <br /> <br /> You probably already know that the Moncas TV show is an invoice marketing success which is dependent on business expertise and serving no small public fraud. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than entertaining. "Head" is a certificate of popularity and importance of pop culture groups, which in spite of your head possesses Moni is out of the box. Get one thing straight: "Head" is not a TV show on the Monks. <br /> <br /> So here's a "psychedelic documentary" of what we have, from a source that has authority over the Western Pop culture. "Head" is a movie that can only come from "inside the box". By the year 1968, Monks had cast and crew seasons and tired professionals who saw part of their commitment and despair. Repositioning the movie market was a deliberate attempt. So, it did three things: Make a movie that the Monks realized. Most importantly, it does not subscribe to the old word for the review of the group - and yes, the membrane compared to the previous. Create a movie that expresses American attitude of information dissemination. Therefore, "Head" is really about media manipulation and its net result: about deception. The media should be informed, educating us about the events of the world, and finally asked us to create opinions of these events that can think in positive steps. So suppose we suppose that information we absorb to be completely and neutral - otherwise, how can a valuable conclusion about a concept presented by a book, newspaper or TV show be established? In one of the streets on Head of "Head", a man admits, "I have not seen a newspaper or TV in a year." Is he a lesser or better person? Even a soft screen parallel to the drug "things they do not think." Remember the old joke, "what you know is wrong"? The screenplay began with public admissions of Monk's own "produced image" and running with football - literally. A visual representation of the film idea behind the movie head "Head"? Is the film a flow-conscious exercise? Is the film smoking marathon pot culmination? Otherwise there are many coincidences that occur in the film that suggests. My guess is that the result of motions of "head" and motivation anywhere in loyalty <br /> <br /> In essence, responsible insiders for "Head" seem to enjoy themselves in rehabilitation of the film, but there is anger-anger-disaster anger which is in the late 60's and on the streets in the media, television, especially in negative ways. The culture has changed. In the late 1960s, medicines and violence were strong negative forces and still have, but the producers of "Head" want to let you know that "poor" information is much more dangerous. <br /> <br /> Wars have been blamed. hoaxes and lies What is the perfect way to spread disinformation through TV? Often, the mysterious black box is seen as a barrier to Monkees and seemingly all of us. At one point, Peter is undoubtedly sitting in salon with a molten ice cream cone and a fellow monkey is asked, "What's wrong?" "I bought this ice cream cone and I do not want it." The film promotes that the first purpose of the media is not to inform, but it is sold blindly. "Head" goes further: someone has no idea at the head, and happily he goes. <br /> <br /> Movie makers know this, and the danger is real. "Head" is a movie that produces itself as "whatever we go along", or a deliberate statement. Probably, probably not. As critics spread in 1968 it might be "combined with the advertising of the pot". These Makkahs are about us and Moni. Be careful about what you want, you can get it. <br /> <br /> Cheers: The truly guilty pleasure. Very funny. Intelligent. Please fans Find the substance, have it. Oddly weird Characters Seamless Collection. Good tune. Length is appropriate. My favorite fisherman, including a predictable favorite, is "The tragedy of your time, my young friends, you can get whatever you want." <br /> <br /> Cavits: Date. Medicines No plot No linear delivery of any thought. At least twenty-five stories that keep going to stop-and-fashion. So, it can easily be frustrating. Some may feel pretentious. There is no reason to avoid it, even though those who need to watch can not stand Monkees. Psychodynamic special effects can kill your diseased photo tube or your acne burning burns. <br /> <br /> Match, Cut.
