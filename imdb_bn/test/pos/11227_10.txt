Michael Policus's hypnotic "NorthFork" is a movie that has long been in his memory. Michael and Mark Polish wrote that this uniquely created movie is one of the best scenes from last year's independent films. The movie David Mullen's picture has a nice photograph, Stuart Mathewman's hunting score. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this picture, then you have to read it here. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​setting the film in Montana was a great uprising for the Polish brothers. As "NorthFork" the royal scenes of the country and the mountains were not so clear. We do not need any color! Beauty is in the dark tunes of this picture, which enhances the story of solitude in this remote court. <br /> <br /> Irene in the center of the story, sick children under the supervision of mysterious father. This boy is seen in his bed, where a kind priest administers medicine for his body. But is he really? We see him interacting with strange groups, which we encounter near the cemetery first. There are two fresh open graves. Would one of them be for Iron? <br /> <br /> Another plot line can play parallel to this first theme at the same time. We see six people in the area from the area that they can come out of as much as possible. This will be made that people will be in bed for the lake to be created. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are following a possibility of a link to an angel injured in this area. When Arin met them in the graveyard, he offered to help, only if they took him away at least a thousand miles from here. We watch as the pastor test that the quadrilateral son has been placed among his bible pages. Could the angel be the angel? <br /> <br /> The closing order shows us all the departments from Northwest. Black men roaming around their automobiles, perhaps going home to enjoy new acquisitions given to them as a prize. The mysterious group is taking off for a plane boarding and a high space. We also understand that despite the medicines received from the father of Harran's children, medicines have died. <br /> <br /> <br /> Nick Nolt, such as the Father Harel, enables such a person to perform a less original performance in his illustration. James Woods, like a Walter, who worked for the developer, did a fine job. The biggest surprise is Dual Pharma, who has a great impression like Irin. This child actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise. <br /> <br /> This mysterious team played brilliantly with Darr Hannah, Robin Sass, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, funny visuals. Peter Cooitte, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and other actors, Mr. Nigel under the direction of Polish. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie depends on its simplicity. Mr. Paul's vision will lose one's memory. Montana picture, perhaps an unrealistic landscape, is one of the best things in American movies.
