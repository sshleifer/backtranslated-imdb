I saw Dust SEA as part of a NYC screening audience many years ago. I enjoyed the movie at that time, so I am a little confused by some amendments. Perhaps it's my memories, but in the Rhode Island Film Festival, it seems to be part of the missing exposure to the version. Not sure which version I really like, but I can honestly say that I found something to praise it both. <br /> <br /> I have warned everyone that this is not a pop music. Although it has been promoted as a tribute to Hammer Films, yet a rally in Van Helsing and Dracula hopes that people will be frustrated. There is some bit of hatred, but there is no nudity (the head of the next film in British Project House). And when the Dust SEA gorgeous is full of eye candy (it is actually shot as a sixth film) and it features Hammer Starlet Ingrid Pitt, it is not like a picture of a company in tone or execution. This image is very dark, very confusing, and (sometimes) very fun. I do not remember the previous version as mostly bad, but it's not a bad thing (especially black forests that play like three stoges shorts) is not a void. And Mr. Pitt's some pretty entertaining. Someone may kill him and he gets loose. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this movie does not lie with the description of the loan. It's ideas. Occasionally as a spectator of scientific channel, I have regularly fixed the network to change the one-note in their themes (CGI monster is killed, then destroyed). Dust SEA is so full of ideas that after a while you start traveling over them. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong. I'm not complaining. If anything, I appreciate the boldness of packing these low budget pictures and packing it with a lot of ideas. It's not going to be a picnic to hate to think about movies (who you know). But for the rest of us, who are tired of our modern horror film formula, prediction, lack of respect for the audience, this can be your ticket.
