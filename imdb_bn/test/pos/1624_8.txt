When I was sitting in the theater, Howard and Tom Hans were crying because of torture, Dan Vindy called the code, I could not see the light at the end of Angels and Demons's tunnels. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company have returned for the sequel-prickle Angels and Demons, and they learned their texts. <br /> <br /> According to the acting everyone is good. Islet Juri's Vitoria Vetra as good, and Sophie Neva is better than a girl who played Tom Hendes is always very good, though he is better in this case, because he feels the movie is a thriller. I think Ian McGregor did one of the best actors. He deserves a nomination and may even come to the march, but the suspect. He was so convinced me to the end. He is dynamic and trustworthy, but reasonable, and the Church understands the need to keep their past behind them. Little actors also work very well. <br /> <br /> Technically and apparently the movie has a lot to improve. Cinematography is very much ... very good, and fantastic effects are fantastic. Finally the final explosion order is excellent. Howard does a wonderful job, taking you through Rome's journey. <br /> <br /> Pissing scientist, Ron Howard, has done a remarkable job while continuing this story, and history does not bother us with history. Denouncing Christians The film makes you feel more late. Finding out whether Jesus had children, we do not have to look up the list with the Roman Catholic Church in our weak minds compared to the events of the killing of thousands of people. Because I think the story is so fast because of the excellent score. I can not say enough about the score. It was epic for some time from the pigment lord, but sometimes it's a Bourne movie, which feels like a nice mix. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is that it's funny. The possibility of being one of Karlenango Yan McGregor's age is unlikely, and the likelihood of cardinality with Pope elected son is more ridiculous. The whole antimatter thing can not be mentioned, which has not yet been made, and in 2003, Dan Brown wrote this book ... <br /> <br /> Overall, Angels and Demons are much more difficult to beat, faster, more exciting, and Da More important films than the VINCI code. This will see the thriller for those who love to combine into one of the history and mysteries.
