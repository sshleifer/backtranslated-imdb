It will be very hard to tell a story where it does not happen much, yet the audience draws attention. I achieved this with an endless quality of this short film. Roger has an amazing voice that reminds me of the characteristics of Robert Redford that is very scandalous, intelligent and grandfather, (I'm not a homosexual). The last is very sad, but beautiful. How long has Harry gone, one wonders, he will be alone and he will say goodbye to him? It also gets disturbed by Mr. Howrah for not doing more work together. I hope he will continue to work well in Hollywood and stay away from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Worth Watching
