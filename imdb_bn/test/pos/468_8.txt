I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere). <br /> <br /> A hunting, intimate portrait of loneliness, and it is allowed to increase and a little darkening reaction. <br /> <br /> The two lead plays (Jessica Bohl and Richard Brandyz) are excellent, and they make such a loss that you've met them before these characters are so damaged. <br /> <br /> The themes of Atom's works have reminded me of Egian (Exactica) and Raymond Carver (where I'm calling). <br /> <br /> Soundtrack (TiWana Joe Basket, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and strengthens moments of film without attracting attention to yourself. <Br> <br /> Highly recommend film and soundtrack.
