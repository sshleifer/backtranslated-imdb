[Follow small spoilers] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen thinks that the fictitious humor about serious incidents can be acceptable based on the formula: tragedy + time = comedy Before the German attack in Poland, there was a rare time in 1939, and subsequent events were followed by Blitkrag (followed by Sejcrigue), which took Germany to the channel, resulting in Dunki's heroic transfers and turned the world into a fearful philosophy of thrilling philosophy. Najir honored her before being the winner. <br /> <br /> The big rope of romance, comedy and serious drama? Yes Director Jean-Paul Rapenawu, created a very entertaining view from the event of "Forest Weasze" with a well-organized and extraordinary cast and scene history and imagination. <br /> <br /> Wyvin Dwarves -eyed and beautiful Isabella Adjani) The war cloud as the top actress in France involved across Europe (what an overused cliche, sorry). An experienced self-reliance on many things for his achievements is painful, his internal motivation seems to be "what is good for Vivian ... for Vivian good ...) After his latest movie premiere, a minister in the helpless Reynolds administration, Jean-Etienne Bouffort (Gerard Depardieu) An unusual role for him), indicates his interest to him, he only ex-boyfriend Cl Faced with tranquility, who does not understand the word "no." Then, to help solve the problem of mess in his bag, another exotic beetle called Frédéric (Gregory Darengere), to help Frederick a novelist - expectation. <br /> < br /> Once a comic accident is often the public service message, the work of Wenchild wipers is important Frederick was imprisoned for serious charges, and fortunately the Germans forced their detainees to move south of France. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> Should be facing Frederick, but a really great young researcher assistant, Camilo (Virginia Ladenque) who is a compulsory Jewish refugee scientist, Professor Coppels What (Jean-Marc stele) to be with. Koplsky has some heavy bottles that he would get in England. Of course, the Germans can not encompass this essential element for you (this part is pure fiction - in 1940 there was no heavy water in France - just Perry). And Kemili is so distraught and devoted as well. <br /> <br /> What after? Peter Quet as French journalist, Alex Winkler. As his name tipped off. He is really a member of Abbar (German military intelligence: a spy). And he slept Vivian on the bed (and he wanted to repeat the matter). Apparently Coppelsky is the only male character, who does not want to stop it with the actress. <br /> <br /> This series of events and a continuation of accidents that are very fast combined for production. Pencil and enjoyable film. Partially a dedication and a wonderful thing on "Casablanca", it's a great fun movie (except for heavy naze bits). <br /> <br /> See also: In an adorably intelligent total narcissist year with a few of the redeeming features worthy of Kadosse for my best painting for Isabel Adajani. And Depardieu is ready to loyalty to Rainnald and to join the ship and to join the betrayal patine, whose Viviani's hatred exceeds the reputations of the Republic. Being in power as a man in a critical moment in French history, Bouffort is undoubtedly useless. <br /> <br /> Not shown in many theaters, "Forest journey" should soon be available for purchase or rental. See it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
