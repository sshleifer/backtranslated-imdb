The first film came out in 1973 and I like it. As I searched for a video, but 33 years later, when I ordered it from Movator, it never found it. Sorry to not hold it. This glamorized version can not just rise to the level of production in 1937. I love the score of Bart Musical Instrument, which he himself will listen to, and I even buy a CD of it, but it does not lend well to mysterious and compelling story for my taste. Not just fit. Michael York is missing here Sally Kellerman has won a great performance but Olivia Hussie is not just funny and lugging through the Himalayas. Best Performance by Charles Boy Best Actor Lama.
