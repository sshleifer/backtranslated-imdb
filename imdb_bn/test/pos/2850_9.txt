I was affected by the way all the way through the nurse Betty. It has a large group of characters, a basic plot, and the last one I saw coming crying but it can not pull in your heart strings. <br /> <br /> If anything comes to me about this film, most of the interaction between Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock was. These two are awesome and it shows my heart that Rock is not going to make a big Hollywood Hollywood rental such as Lathal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman will not always have any need to criticize his work, as humans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Excellent touch of neutral violence to satisfy the bloodshed of men. 9th Oct 10 <br /> <br />
