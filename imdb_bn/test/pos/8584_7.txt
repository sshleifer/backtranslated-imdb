I think there is some revisionist history going on here, but one clearly feels that Patrice Lumbura was causing a problem, which inspired the people of Congo from the moment of declaration of independence. His public and his ability to control his decision to come back to his military was to join Soviet aid, apparently in the United States and leading his assassination. However, by replacing him with mobile phones, the United States did not fix anything. They did just as bad as the situation. Well played with excellent cinematography and an enthusiastic score. Certainly valuable.
