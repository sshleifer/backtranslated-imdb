It was firmly operated by Furt Laugh, because he mostly pointed out crime dramas and mystery. The film also features Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Ziger and John Caranine. Scott tries to straighten up and plays an old gang to save Jagger's life and an unwanted person who leaves the air. Works for the Western Western Union, a telegraph company that deals with Western telegraphs. Jagga recruits many people so that they are sure that they are concerned about the Indian attacks and the bandits. Scott is in charge of the male and Young is a telegraph expert who can not shoot guns but can fly. Scott met with their old gang who wanted to stop them but Scott could not tell anyone. It should point to a pretty Western and lang more western.
