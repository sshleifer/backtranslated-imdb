For some reason, some shows just fail ... some fit, nothing ... the body was a cute show with attractive character and dark humor which was enjoyable to see ... it was probably not intended to be a big hit, but It was about "curiosity" that makes it so enjoyable ... that seems to be the only one I see ... Dennis Farina and Frank Halleley have not been fully in their respective roles. It was rude ... production quality and writing was great and Vegas was the perfect backdrop ... I hope the first and only season to be released on DVD because I believe it's some superstition ... maybe it should be made at least on TV ... Cheers
