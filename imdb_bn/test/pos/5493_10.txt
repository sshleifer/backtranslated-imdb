In my opinion, the line of fire, a nice, suspenseful, and your-seat action / play / thriller edge! I looked good for the dresses worn by the agent Hargin (Clint Eastwood) and the agent Rains (Rene Russo) president's dinner. As Larry (John Malkovic), he was a sick man who loves to play on the phone with Frank. Although he looked good in tuxedo near the end of the photo. There was a growing attraction between Agent Harrigan and Agent Reines, one thing that surprised me. Before I wrap this up, I'd say that throwing the whole and crew is a tremendous job, I loved setting, and I could not get it enough. Now, in conclusion, all fans of Clint Eastwood who do not see this amazing, suspicious, and your seat action / drama / thriller, I highly recommend.
