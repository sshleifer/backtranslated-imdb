An unusual film for an audience outside of the United States. Lena Horne looks fantastic and so does Ralph Cooper. The background of the tube movements like other musical instruments have not been added so that you do not hear the great beat of the notes. Music dance is silent to hear the steps. The acting is a little stilted and the cast speaks slowly so that you feel that the movie is older than that. Dancing to the end of the dress is brave for routine time. You think often like an audience part on a stage show. The other modernity you see in the furniture which adds to the feeling of movies is very modern. A must for all film buffs.
