I absolutely love each minute of this film. Jack Black and Kyle Gass bring the most of friendship, hard rocking and fate into the epic story. <br /> <br /> Shuffling, toilet humor and breaking rules of general rule with unnecessary swearing in each sentence, this film must be seen for the hard hard tenes de fans of the world. <br /> <br /> We follow the journey of young zebble (jack black) and cage (kyle gass) when they try and recover recovery. Fate, open Mike win the night, and become the greatest band on the planet. In the full room of both lasers, one leg and the devil must overcome as obstacles to perform their work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A must see for yourself who calls for a firm de fan. Watch for the first joke from the first album!
