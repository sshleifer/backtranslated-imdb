Because it's late and I'm going briefly on the vocabulary, I'll describe this picture as "beautiful and heartwarming", who is madly angry in such claws and is praying for forgiveness. Robin Tune does a wonderful job of sticking to a glamorous twitter syndrome - his character is absolutely sincere and strong, and wherever I go, I follow his career because of this film.
