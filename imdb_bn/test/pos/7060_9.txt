This is the best summer summer camp movie best ever. Indeed, some of the others are even fair, let alone somewhere nearby as entertaining as this one. <br /> <br /> This picture is just as good, clean, fun as easy. Many people will be seen going to the summer camp like kids that they are usually presented here, but the slopstick comedy is mixed. The Chief Councilor of the camp, Bill Murray, threw a fine shoe, and is usually in the riots Nonsense center. The trip has a great line of lanterns, usually publicizing its joke like the camouflage announcement on the camp's public-address system. <br /> <br /> Many great supporters have played the role of creating an interesting fun and interesting concubine for the actor campers and consultants. High-genx while spreading many camp camps. Spaz (Jack Bloom) and Fink (Keith Knight) were especially good two characters. The courage of these two (and misadventures) are pleasing. Each has a classic line, and they like the characters and routes you like. Look for Spaz in the scene of the Disco dance pandemonium. <br /> <br /> The girls in the story are realistic characters. They are not fools, naive, freakish, oversexed, nervous, or other overused, abominable teen character stereotypes. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Syndy Girlling, and others make these characters credible. <br /> <br /> With the expenditure of the camp's director Maury (Harvey Atkin), the necessary pockets increase greatly. The nature of this trick starts harmful and progress from there. However, with all silliness going, Tripper and others have their serious side. For example, Tripper makes friends with a shy, lonely child, Rudy (Chris Mckepse) and takes him under his wing. <br /> <br /> This story ends with a sports competition against the rival camp. This is a great "root for underdogs" end. When the chips are down, Triple's motivational "It does not matter" spell is inspired and one of the best moments in the movie. And get ready to route: "Spaz. Spaz! Spag !!!" "
