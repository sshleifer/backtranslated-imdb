(Some spollars) a murderer in a first-class railway car in New York City who does not kill a gun or a knife or club, but only with him, or touching it and breathing. A killer that is old, even older, then people themselves. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Presented itself. Then, in a ticket with its lungs, the bomb exploded throughout the length and breath of the city. Sheena knows that the customs officer of the United States is following her, since she has returned to the United States from Cuba Island country. By tugging $ 50,000.00 of illegitimate diamonds, he had to be careful to spend his husband's matte, Charles Corvin and sell it to the city's priceless jewelers. <br /> <br /> Earlier, the rock that sent diamonds knows that if diamonds are caught then it can not be found. Did not he know that Matt gave him time to keep a close relationship with his two sisters, Francia Lola Albert? Worse than the fact that he plans to check out the city by holding a bag in French as well as a diamond. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the time in the movie. Until the first half of "New York Occupy Killer" is a criminal mystery / drama for US Customs officials and NYC police stolen diamonds. The rock starts to get sick and he starts communicating with the person he communicates, reaching the mass of the road type in the horror film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> Willa Dennis, the resident of Shila Matt, came out of Jim Bacchas, he quit his job as a nightclub piano player and he understood Hill at the time of his relationship with the French. <br /> <br /> The face of Francis in his apartment makes it active that Matt not only strengthens Shelia, but also his sister. Which later leads to the criminal admission of Francie to take his own life. During the movement and did not know that he had been infected with the roots, Sheela goes to his brother Sid (with Bissel), who runs a flop house at home, to find out the place. Sheila and Sid are too late, the stolen diamonds have stuck their problems. Shilha died knowing that Mr. Arnold Moses, at the office of Art Smith, said Stage-Ball of husband Matt, who had gone to beat an old man in a bloody manner, he was going there to take a proper revenge for him. <br /> <br /> Based on the documentary-type drama, the real story, with the black and white on-site photography, this film reveals the film in a poorly valued view of the film about the fear of invisible and deadly void.
