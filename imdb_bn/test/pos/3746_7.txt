Gerald (Richard Karlson) and Kiti (Veronica Heart) have finished celebrating their link in France with family and friends in France, when he receives a letter to visit an ancestor castle in Scotland. Gerald's uncle became ill and requested Gerald's only successor. Gerald goes off in Scotland, leaving behind her future bride. Passed several weeks and he did not return. Worried, Kim sent telegrams but could not hear back from his drunk. Passes more than four weeks and what Kitty has finally received a strange reaction from Gerald, stops joining and tells her to walk with her life. Not willing to leave her relationship and find the answer, she decides to give up on a plane and visit Gerald. At the time of the visit, she had a head covering sheet (Catherine Emrie, who played the role of her most famous Cristher Isle of the Dead). When Kitty and Edith McCarthy reach the estate, they immediately suspect something strange. For the beginnings Gerald seems to be twenty years old in a matter of weeks. Secondly, this once nice and charming man has turned into a complete quarrel who repeatedly claims that they leave the castle and do not come back. When Edith cools down, the key uses it as an excuse to stay there to try it out. <br /> <br /> Why Gerald was so cold and cruel why she was just a woman about marriage? Why is Gerald so opposed to having company? Why should the house be locked inside their bedroom at night? Why are guests banned for entering certain areas of the house like guestcloth bedroom and why a big hedge mood is back? And that strange noise is making every night? These are just a few questions MAZE poses. The movie is not actually building up a delicate job mystery and conspiracy. You're really interested in what's happening, and look forward to slowly explaining such strange phenomena. And then IT will happen ... I definitely do not want to ruin the end of this film because you do not know well, but this is one of the most incredible and jaw wonderful wonders I've ever seen in any film. . It's pretty ridiculous in a way, but it also takes a very nice little B / D mystery and sends it directly to the Z-grade scalp region. And yet, this ending appears to be too much space, do not forget once you see it once. Even after the end (or even partially finished) <br /> <br />, I really enjoyed it strange birds. It is extremely running for the ticket and runs period, but managed to keep my interest in it. Director William Cameron Menezes (who created more famous inroads from Mars in the same year) is known as the Oscar winning industry director twice and its set designs are also really interesting. Often, there seems to be a silent film, some work for the outdoors, some painted backdumps and internal decorations with very high ceilings. There are no secret passageways and long staircases as well as a good castle set. This one threw in a few rubber-bat-on-string for very good measurements. <br /> <br /> A few actors are a little tough and weird, but I mostly like to cast. Heart is one of those who is obscure and mostly unknown actress who is unfortunately being caught both looking beautiful and gifted. Emery, who was able to act in a statement making shots at the beginning and end of the film, is quite suitable as a very psychical and cautious aunt. My choice was however, Michael Pat was a silver-haired sinner who walks during this hilarious straight-up jumbo ladder climbing. Also in small roles, Hilary Brooke (who played the title role in Sherlock Holmes Mystery, The Woman in Green) and Lillian Bond (Hall's Old Dark House). Of course Carlsen has played on ITC from Attack Space, made from Black Legon and some other awesome Flickr, so you've got pretty nice cast for genuine fans. I say check it out!
