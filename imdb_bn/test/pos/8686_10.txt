I saw the first 10-year-old Princess of Nile. I am 63 and I have not forgotten the movie. I've got my estuarine with Egypt. I've searched the internet trying to buy movies, but it can not detect it. This is one of Hollywood's lost films. I like the Debra Paget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such charisma together. If you used to ask me something about the movie, I could not say anything other than this. I unexpectedly remember a scene by nail with a bunch of other women Debra Padget. I always wanted to see it again. I've never thought of this as a movie of escape, but I can now see where it was probably. I hope they keep it on DVD and I'll be able to see it again before I die. It was a wonderful movie.
