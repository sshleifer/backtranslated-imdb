A small city to work in a big city becomes a huge star and then becomes spirals out of control. It shows you the rise of fame and then comes back from fame and gets a little increase. Great cast of actors, and a great director = a great, great movie named Boogie Knight. <br /> <br /> <br /> p. Anderson Boogie Night is an amazing manager who is amazing. From the moment you start filming, you can see how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are literally breathtaking. A great story, a great movie. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, he was excellent at Philip Seymour Hoffman in everything. Thomas Jane was also fantastic and although he was only a small part of playing it in perfection. I can not finish the scene of this movie, "The drug deal goes bid cine", it was amazing, music acting and cinematography combined to make surprises. I have not seen Bugi Night and I thank God for what I have done, its very good round and I am now a huge fan of PTA (Paul Thomas Anderson). Do it <br /> <br /> and watch this movie.
