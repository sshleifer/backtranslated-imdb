2005 was one of the best years for movies. We had many wonderful movies, such as Batman Begins, Sina City, Corps Bride, Hey Hey Histance ... We've got Brokeback Mountain, King Kong .... But this year only if the only great movie comes out all illuminated, then we This year has not been missed. The first film as a director of a talented live sketch is a fun, heart-warming, sensitive play that brings together Elias Wood's best roles. She is perfect as Jonathan, a leading man in Ukraine who was an investigator who had rescued her grandfather in World War II. Wrote the image Leve Screebbery, memorable scenery and (many) conducted an excellent essay with fun quotes. It's an actual mix of drama here with comedy, a movie that will be commented years from now. A serious Oscar contestant, everything enlightened is a strong, original, and why not, Enlightened Movies. But when entering the film you should keep in mind: go back to normal. This is special .------ 9/10
