Like other posters say f. 56 (local Boston TV station) showed this multiple times on Saturday noon on Saturday. They added it with the first signal "The Zint Mozinner Return". <br /> <br /> I have not seen it since now ... but it has never left me. As well as shocking dubbing and faded color this was a fantastic good imagination. Technically it is not awful ... until the statue comes to the end of life. It is a village ruled by an evil man. There is a giant stone statue that the villagers are praying to help ... no profit. But things go too far, the law comes to ruin lives and bad people ... but even after the good son it starts! In the end, some cool effects have been well done (how he delivered the main bad guy). There was also an enchanted forest which was very interesting. <br /> <br /> No nice composition but an unusual combo fantasy / horror film. Attention value - but it does not print dubbed.
