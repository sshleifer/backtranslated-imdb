The second part of the new "Lost" is the level of lack of fans - which is a fair amount of Writing Action. In the very first scene you see brand new features that you were not expecting to face. This is the best evidence that the series is consistently alive and difficult to kick in the fourth season. <br /> <br /> While the producers do not surprise us with more flash-forward, but the return to flashbacks is more than satisfaction, because it comes with some shocking events. Flashbacks introduce some fresh characters and the familiar ones are getting amazingly connected. <br /> <br /> New characters control the whole episode and I can not say that it does harm. Both their scenes and their actors work very well, giving us a brassing feeling - just after this episode, you will realize that the show really needs it. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Dead sure" is a strong step and widely written dialogue. I'm sure I'll quote the best scenes of this episode for a long time - they're just good that they're on the mind of the viewer. The episode is entertaining, smart, and intrusive. If you like "Lost", you have to see it. My vote ten
