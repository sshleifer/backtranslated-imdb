I'm so happy to not live in an American small town. Wherever I showed some small towns in the state, it wanders with all kinds of monsters, among which meat is hungry, evil aliens and terrible ghosts are the most harmful. In this movie a former doctor who fixed the case of killing his wife in a car crash, indicates his steps in the nearest small town - never seen any glimpse of his small town - which would be from Purgatory flat And, of course, as soon as he comes there all hell breaks. She meets a green dog, who is similar to both cows in the face and brain activity of all creatures and falls in love with her once. But there is a small loss, she is already married to a drug dealer in a very short time, who did not shoot himself dead in a minute. To know what has come out of all this, you will have to watch the movie for yourself. I just want to tell you that it is a memorable one by Oliver Stone, but it is one of the most amazing artistic features.
