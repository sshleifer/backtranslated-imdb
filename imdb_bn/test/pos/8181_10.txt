This story was the most expensive film production in Chinese history about the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unite the empire. <br /> <br /> It's worth every penny. Apparently amazing cinemmatography, a clear score and outstanding characters sometimes make it into the best of learning (foreign or otherwise.). Please do not miss this big screen viewing option.
