As a movie both fun fun and as an excuse to sit back and play 'Oh, that whassis name' game. Each of the stars in the golden era of English movies looks like this and was happy to see them. And the greatest of them, Richard Watts, was as great as before. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Alastair Simm is fantastic and somehow you believe that six feet, big stocking Scots can be a daughter of the boarding school of a girl. George Cole, Barrell Reid and Irene Handle all have their moments, but starring Joysteen Grenfell with Alastair and Richard. She takes a smile when she is an absolute one and curtains ... to complete her rolling walk and acacia accent. <br /> <br /> And for those who play, the name of the Vasis' game, if you look carefully, you can see Arthur Muller, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Serre.
