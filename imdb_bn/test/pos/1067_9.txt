Most of the housewives knew that Stenwieck was parading the barber while making this movie. Today, more than 50 women today think of Gladys Taber whose column "Batterstroke Wisdom" ran in the Family Circle magazine before the Second World War until the 1970s. The detective lived in the Steelmade Farm and his columns were collected in several books, the Stilmedo Season, Stillmodo DocBook, etc. Frequently the lines that Stanwick writes for his column describe how many common gladders are Taber columns. In addition to cooking and living the country, he occasionally got nostalgic and philosophical. He talked a lot about his favorite dog, most cocker spaniels. You might say that Martha Stewart is today Gladys Tabor. <br /> <br /> Christmas Connecticut may not be like a movie, but it's pleasant, light-hearted, entertaining, excitant, and it's good enough.
