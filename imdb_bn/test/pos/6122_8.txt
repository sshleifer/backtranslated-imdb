For me, Pinch Flamingos was surprised as its reputation, it was hoped it was a disappointing, annoying, annoying, nasty movie, which actually contained everything without kitchen syncs. We are treated with nearly two hours of pain, which never comes: Rape, sex, sexual intercourse with chickens, transsexuals, castings, murders, cancers, and horrible displays of singing on the cow. This is a strange couple who started to compete with the trailer trash family, trying to steal the title of "painful people alive". Divine (a fat guy dragged) an incredibly vile man, is actually painful to watch. When I say that this movie is not forgotten quickly, especially on the last scene where the Divine dog pokes, trust me. I always gave John Watson more ratings and I can not say that I love this movie, but if you ever get to see it, it's an experience.
