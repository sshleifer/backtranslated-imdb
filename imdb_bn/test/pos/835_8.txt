The original female imagery is one of the finest compositions of all time Scorpio. The first series, Zylhaus 41, was not good at my opinion, though it is true that it has adopted the idea from the original and created something completely different. Director Sunita Etoo has done the same again in this film; The story is a bit different here, but they are still striking the past as well and many are better than many such films and it almost completely composes something original. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (AKA "Scorpio") and this time she is not very interested in the idea of ​​going outside the jailhouse and returning. After fleeing from the police officers, one thing goes the other way and Scorpio finds himself involved with prostitution and his disabled brother. Prostitution extinguished by the disturbed brother (...), when Scorpion abducted and kidnapped a man who had made enemies from prison. But Scorpio does not like to spend time behind bars and not before long before doing what he is doing. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great start, we see Scorpion closed the joke. The purpose of his imprisonment. From there, the film became much slower and it ended more like a play than the last two films in the Weststyle. It still does not have to say that there is not too much activity - Scorpio still spends 'time in revenge mode' and the film is not usually short on the general puzzle. Meiko Kazi again reiterated her role as a terrible title character and it played another different, almost unclear role. His screen is superb, but he is able to maintain a deadly presence despite being physically small. The plot structure for this movie is similar to the other two, it all creates a reversal of the sequence of revenge. This movie has more people than the previous two because of rain, so this section takes a fairly large part of the film. There are some visible sequences in the first film and not as much as the second, but the film is in the rest of the series on that point. Overall, I would say that this film is not as good as the original and slightly better than the second - in the first two of the quality.
