I love this picture. There is something for everyone. It's funny, saddening, passionate and dramatic. The mix of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that can not help the audience but wants to be part of it. Colin Firth is nothing wrong with my favorite actor and my eyes (!), But his extraordinary acting talent in this film is clear and it is more furthered by the beautiful. Her co-star Nia Long's performance The problems faced by their lover's relationship are frustrating, more believable, and the general characteristics of the colors of Matthew and Nimi's colors, making the film even more interesting. I defy anyone that can not be moved by this story I found it ridiculous and saw it at least ten times, since I bought this movie a week ago!
