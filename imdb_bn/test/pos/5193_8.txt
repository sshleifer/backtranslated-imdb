After being cosmic in Western History, I was a college student by seeing World War II opinion and was totally wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody subject in the history of the world. Axis Powers led a number of crimes against humanity, which looks like today, and many people have forgotten that not every German soldier is destroying the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier has left a samurai sword and did not carry out a comic mission, not every Italian soldier is a fascist Was there. For the power of access, these soldiers were mostly normal people like you and I was caught in a terrible conflict and they could fight for any country. <br /> <br /> The Stalinager war was the most deadly battle that took place during the war of more than 1,500,000 people in the history of the world. Stalingrad follows Lieutenant von Wittland, a German Platoon and his leader, because they are re-elected to the Eastern Front for the Soviet war in Stalinad. Von Widgetland works as the main character of two other men, roles and frigijes. They are all normal men and fully informed about what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> This film follows the path of war. During the war, during the war and during the war, the film was completely unclear. We are shown many terrible wars and intense violence outside of the war (with a firing squad sequence). Overall battles are my first example, which I know is the loss of organs and the overall sequence of death and violence in your face. Most inspiration seems to have come from this movie to preserve the continuity of private Ryan's war. <br /> <br /> This movie does not aim to completely harmonize everything in Germany's film. Most of the senior army officers are depicted in general view, most people use evil. Most of the ordinary people of the soldiers often speak in the house. This film makes it very clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened in Holocaust, most of the countries and the army were completely unaware of the authenticity of genocide. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the German army are only fighting for a cause that they did not understand, and instead of reducing negative degrees in Russia, they simply wanted more than returning home. <br /> <br /> The film really looks like how the hell war, especially the second world war. War scenes will give you shock with your radioactive reality and during the war you just have to follow the story of following a platoon easy to follow. It does not expect much happiness seeing most war images. Most of the soldiers facing the front of the Front Front will leave you alone in a sad mood. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
