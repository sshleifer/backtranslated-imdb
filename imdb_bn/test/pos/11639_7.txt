Although it may not be her most comical movie, as well as the most satisfying French comedy of a Mus√©e Charlie Chase, twenty minutes of pure visual scenes, a dancer's physical comedy, and fun quip (presented through the title card) all based on a painful and wildly incredible premises. Do it. It has been said to us that it is "the stories of domestic people - with a mouth that will stop the clock - and will start again with her husband's face." Soon we got absolutely nose, see Charlie Moos and his wife Vivienne in Jharkhand. But when our plot, the incredible series of continuous series involving interconnected emphasis on continuous series continuation: i.e., firstly, that Charlie will correct his nose to correct his nose, secondly, every spouse that has their own cosmetic surgery The secret from the other, and third, since then the public's midway The clash with each other, Charlie and Vivianne would not recognize each other. Sound like a bit of a stretch, is not it? It is better to stretch more than one. Obviously, we are here in the petit world and will only roll with silly plot twists, as long as you can relax and forget the suitability, you are probably likely to enjoy this short <br /> <br /> As soon as the complexity of the story begins, a musette starts, but Charlie and Vivienne once made a "match" and set out to attend the meeting of the dentist in Charlie's house. They all roam freely, enter separately and are unaware of each other's presence. (Mr. and Mrs. Moses seem to be mostly wealthy, because they live in a luxurious hotel-sized residence.) There is a well-timed sequence followed, which makes this navigator a bit of a Bastar Keaton, in which the face of the husband and wife dash face most of the time without facing the house. And Charlie Gawky's wallflower cheeks were forced to dance with Henry as they actually reached the party once the comedy kicks in really high gear. Henry, who played in a very small comrade until 1914, is a hypothetical player in his own right, as ridiculous as a dancing partner, who is not very strong but gets little favor from his dance. There is also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence, when the camera only lowers down to show us the shoes of Charlie, Malle, Vivian and Vivienne dancers, but we are able to follow their steps properly following what is happening in the policies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Charlie and Vivienne, the party they are attending is attacked, and complexity arises from there when they flee the police, and return home. When Charlie realized that her bride's wife was trying to take action with another person, she solved her every lesson. . . When easily forgotten, of course, he is trying to do the same thing. The last few minutes of this movie have offered the most fun physical comedy, this is a good sight point for the fifth. Leaves the audience with brilliant brightness like a mush, and of course, artificial, sadly, with the most ridiculous comedies produced by Chargele Chase.
