And this is not the case for Barbara Hershari's serious unclear Irish accent in Matt's main role in Madeline, if I got more than 7 ratings out of 10 out of this. The pronunciation came and unfortunately which I went to get more than a little confused. However, William L. Petersen's performance in Jod's role was extraordinary, even after the interaction of Hawkeye during some time, he brought warmth and depth to the character. Impressive and genuine, I was amazed at the way he took the character. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> It's based, but I believe, in the real story and before I see the movie I heard about this staircase. <br /> <br /> It was an extraordinary engineering achievement for its time - a floating double helix made without nails or screws. Today it is now privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Small Spyler ** Good supporter throw and Barbara is dying so well in all her movies and she is not disappointed here. Many special moments <br /> <br /> 7/10
