The most amazing film I ever seen I did not read programming and I just stumbled onto the movie by accident. I felt it was a real documentary and I saw the sick. I found it in a movie soon after it ended and I was looking for more information about "Park the Park" on the web. It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that it actually happened in the US if you were from Europe. I must admit that after watching the film I felt really anti-American and it did not happen that it did not really happen.
