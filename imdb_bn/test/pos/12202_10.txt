I thought it was a very good tv series and I'd like to see it continuously. It really got interesting at the end and I really want to see it going from where it is. Sometimes we have to kill a series without a chance. I think I need an opportunity to go this one, and I will definitely be waiting for it. Ocean is one of the places where people know very little and I think it is a secret in itself. What is waiting for us under the water of the world? It has also been said that people may have come out of the water thousands or thousands of years ago or may have crossed the stream. Is this about a new evolution? Are we going to fight for food chains or our positions?
