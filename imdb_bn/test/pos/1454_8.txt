I've always enjoyed the music of Frank Sinatra, and recently I wrote a short story about his life story. I am fascinated by the life and legend of Ol Blue Eyes. However, I have not seen any of her movies. So I wanted to see if his performance was as great as his song. Well ... it was! I played her in this movie! He has done an extraordinary job of recovering heroin-addicted Frankie Machine, who is trying to bring his life back together and listening as drummer for the local band. <br /> <br /> Otto Prummingar's side is also good. I have not seen any other movie in it. I read his biography of IMDB He feels like a man who was severely mistaken and people thought about him. It seems like someone who appeals to the most enthusiastic enthusiasts. I did not see enough of her film to make sure she's bright, but now I'm weird. I would like to see more of her pictures, because of her talent in judging her efforts with "The Man the Golden Arm the Man". I like music for this movie. The score obviously contains such music that I remember, if I ever hear it again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, In 1955, the term "medicine" only creates controversy, and if you look at the film, they keep the subject at a very intelligent level. Frankie was actually the only scene that received heroin injections in her arm, and they showed her the effect of her facial expression instead of putting a graphic on her body. But it distributed its message without thinking of water-downs. In this powerful play like this, with strong performance and guidance like this, you do not need a graphic graphic designer for drug abuse for the viewer's plot. <br /> <br /> "The Man of the Golden Arms" is a dramatic jewel that will be examined by all the film buffs. This is really an amazing job! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (out of 10)
