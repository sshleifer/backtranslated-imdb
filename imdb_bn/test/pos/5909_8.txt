Billy Wildar Charles Lindberg made some of the usual biology about the flight. He formed the film to tell the story of Leadberg's story of flashbacks extensively throughout the Atlantic, which is currently being filmed. An airplane is not an element of flying excitement for hours, and Wilander will not deviate from Lindbergh's theme as the protagonist of the common man, so things are expected. However, James Stewart was well-credited and credible as Linneberg, and the air kept his watch just an observer of many obstacles he had to overcome. <br /> <br /> This movie comes mostly through success, because Wilder enjoys part of the story together in a way that causes tensions, then relief, and tension. Cinematography is quite good, Franz Wuxman's scores increase the view and Stuart really believes that Lindberg is alive, one believes that he can be Linburg. Finally there are some religious schmaltz in the 1950s, but overall direction, performance, and high production values ​​exceeded the prediction of the story (anyone who sees this image and does not know that Linberg made it across the Atlantic?) That the most enjoyable movie It was better than the movie. Billy Wylder has created many different types of films, and it is the best representation of its craftsman.
