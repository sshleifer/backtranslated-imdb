It is being commented on just because the Sergio Prokofiev (1891-1953) first is just how strong a score and how to actually mellow this song is really not familiar to you if you are reading Alexander Nevsky's song op.78. Nothing here is that most of the music literature Better than a witness through a song between beautiful and moving scores. The score collected with this movie has a special place and it can be exactly the same on the internet anywhere. Composers underwrite their property by providing extra scores for additional care of your website, such that this score really claims. It is deep to me because it is so brave that you want to be one, whose name is Great Novgorod! This is a song from Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the river Nava River, on the wide waters, in the Noahs River. There we killed our enemies in the battle of the war - the men fighting men, the Swedish army. Ah, how we fought, how we misled them! Ah! Shoot the fight from the child! War our blood is freely our great land, our native Russian land.Hey! Where was the broadaxe maternity run, such as an open street, a lane in their ranks, where we ran down on the slopes, mowed down the mowed slopes of Sweden, like feathers and grass. We will never generate native Russian land. Those who fly towards Russia will be killed! Get up against the enemies, Russian land, get up, get on the arms, great Novgorod! Weapons go), only weapons in combat, you get to fight the Russian people, fight the high honor, immortal fame of the warriors killed! You are free and courageous for the Native, to defend our fair homeland! To make the war fighters, Russian people, the Russian people should rise! There will be no enemy in our great native Russia. Surgery, get up, native mother in Russia! No enemy will run across the Russian country, foreign soldiers will not invade Russia, invisible Russia. No enemy road will ravage the Russian field. (Here the favorite reader we are asked to live forever with the following verses e) Title-I will go across the snow-covered field "Field of the dead", I will fly above the field of death. I will explore heroic fighters, my fianc√©, my invincible youths.Here One of the most endangered wild breed in this system, cursed by an arrow there. From our wounds our rains on our local soil were rained on our Russian fields. Who died in a great death for Russia, will be pleased with my kiss from his dead eyes; , The brave boy, who was alive I would be a real wife and a loving friend. I will not deviate from a handsome man, worldly glasses and beauty, and will die. I'll marry a brave man, you think this, the brave warriors! (Now its conclusion with the Nevskys entry in Pskov) will be a desperate campaign Russia war. Russia went down to hostile enemy. In our homeland troops. Whoever comes to death will die! Celebrate and sing, Mother in Russia! Our domestic land enemies will not survive. They can not see the Russian cities and the fields; Kill it! We are great in Russia, there will be no enemy in our native Russia! Encourage and sing, native mother in Russia! All the celebrities have won the celebration. Celebrate and celebrate, Russian motherland! It should be noted that Prokopje had several bits of pressure from Stalin, if you had to be, good.This musical score was really very approved by Stalin.To me there is an unmistakable beauty of Nevsky who loves this world and a hero whose god For the participation of all those love that is provided by the feature The really beautiful and inspired story of Alexander Nevsky's story
