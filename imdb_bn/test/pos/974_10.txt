I could see this movie all day! I love it Probably my favorite movie all the time. But, however, "badger1970" has a few parts, including bad language, bad, but it's not exactly G rated. Awesome movie !!!!! I say it to everyone. By any means, it typed me 10 lines, so I'll continue typing until it lets me post this comment. OK ... still typing ... it's boring. Disgust I still have four more to go. However, watch this movie! Even if you have already seen it. I do not care! It's still 10 lines? No Only 2 more lines left. I do not know why it wants me to do this I think I've done it. Wait a minute, I'm not done, sorry, man. I know that torture listens to me. Well, I guess you can not read this comment ... but you have to write it because I wrote it. I'm probably done now. Finally, bye bye.
