Everyone likes to make the cool, memorable Haste Cinema. Alain Delan provides antiretras, Melville cools down and other great talents (most often, Yevs Montand, Jiazian Maria Voltae, and Andr√© Bourvill) come to add a glassy cozy movie ... <br /> <br /> ... very little With dialogue This is great, because a certain aspect of the section is fast-debated and many dialogues involving their competitors are going on. However, this movie completely stops and can not be missed too much. The word does not sound bad, oh no, jazz soundtrack and a little movement of Christian audio slow slowing down makes the patient very appealing. <br /> <br /> This picture is really clear about that color cinematography is pretty fantastic. Generally, in the case of cinematography, black and white movies are trapped in my mind, but this film has some very strong and beautiful images that enable the film to observe pure visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
