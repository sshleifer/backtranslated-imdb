I really like the opening of the movie, when Colonel Ted Master realized his fighter radar that four enemy aircraft came from about 10. The good news is that the film does not mention very soon that the colonel tried to practice "freedom of navigation" alongside a Lieutenant's Wingman fighter along the East Medite Sea, but did a little restricted air space zone reserved for the countries of the Middle Eastern countries before they secretly Has exceeded. <br /> <br /> I love colonel combat radar textout and interconnecting all of the computer display because the enemy aircraft aggressively loves two American fighter pilots in an inclination to violate their airspace. That first dogfight reminds me of the famous famous pilot movie, "Top Gun". From the bomb blast of the enemy, the enemy jet engines hit the jet engine of thirty-millimeter rounds and forced the plane to force it to emit, it all reminds us ... dogfight fighter strategies can keep you alive ... but a false step You may be shot. <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie was the "serial order" scene. It was very little bit. Yes, when you see the conflict, it was great to open the movie ... which was related to the dog. Only when a boy told the Dug Master that his father was shot dead after the cessation of the plane flying down to the "snake" nation, only when we were forced to compel us before the conflict started. I think the order of middle class snake should be stuck in the middle of the middle of Bialad desert on the way to the detention center of the kernel masters ... when the music sequence is running for "snake". The film does not do this ... If it is, the point of the point will be smooth at that moment. Still another good. <br /> <br /> When the word is found that the Colonel Ted Masters trial (the violation of regional air sovereignty) has ended for high uprising and was condemned for hanging in three days, the Dog Master decided to go into action. Drug decides to rescue his friends and Colonel Sinclair (directed by Louis Gosset Jr.) to rescue Masters in the failed attempts to save the aircraft. Having a military marketing and risking a high probability to spend more than a year in a military stock, he goes against the policy of Air Force and plans to recover the Masters without the consent of the US government. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends are held in the master for hanging upcoming and get plenty of stuff in nearby areas near Bilyad (which finds out to be a fake Middle Eastern country for movies) to sneak into various classified areas of base base. One plan includes the firing of firecrackers as an isolation from fighter aircraft, warrior base, intelligence, and other military elements around the billiards, from the area of ​​the air force of the air force, to segregated photo and maintenance elements. <br /> <br /> When everything was spoken and done, Sinclair studied all the intelligence, then he almost stopped from the plan because Doug was very scary. They did not get two F-16 planes and tried to run a dry across a firing range until I realized what they were going to do abroad. I understand that shooting a dog fighter and dropping the bombs is not good unless he can hear rock music. I can remember when he dropped a Mach 82 bomb with a horizontal target and was bombarded with 20 feet ... I realized that Doug is unusual. <br /> <br /> The ultimate dog action of the last part of the rebellion, "Iron Eagle" was better than the last episode of the antagonist of the enemy dog ​​sequences. I like the way to express the final conflict, especially when Dog masters face a warrior pilot on the Middle East, who actually face trial against Ted Masters. After the second attempt by the toilet missile, when Doug took the fighter, the small but sweet. It looks like this was the colonel of Star Wars's "Darth Vader" ... in the air, it can be very bad, because if you've seen Star Wars, then Dr. Widder was an Aachen Skywalker, who was a pilot's place. Excellent good news for this but still works!
