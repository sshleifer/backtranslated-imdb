This is not a film that really deserves critical attention. It's not going to win an Oscar - it's not really a very good movie. Hack, it's not really a movie - just a little hateful, little skits get together to entertain. And as much as every critical body of my body cries as a failed score, I'm going to give it a better score. People who are going to enjoy this movie are not really taking any kind of critics, so I'm not talking about some of the groceries criticizing the quality of Zacassa's guest appearance, which is how we enter and comment on the society ... Oh, forget it. <br /> <br /> What do you say? There is no plot to develop, no character development - there is no real beginning - there is a semi-ending end that is not as surprising as it was before and everything in it is inappropriate, among junior high school laughing in the bathroom humor. It's actually quite fun. <br /> <br /> Leave all your forefathers at your door. Jacques: Number two only out-of-shit. That's really all that. Although I provide these to movie-makers: they come with some pretty fantastic elements. You'll probably cringe several times, want to throw a few times, do not wiggle and uncomfortably die on the screen and vomiting-defying stunts on the screen. Vomit, breph, urine, semen .... Virtually every body fluid can be seen in Jacques: Number two. Nudity, sexual smile, and so much more. <br /> <br /> This is entertainment. If you look for such enjoyable ingredients, you probably like Jacques: Number two. I smile several times. I said, it's quite a fantastic element. I never wanted to vomit - although I have a strong stomach. Just accept the movie premiere: A bunch of stupid people is not a weird shit for fun. Once you get it, take it and go with it once, you will enjoy. The only flaw in the movie is just the extra extravagant of all the weird and hateful stuff. There are many fantastic, very annoying skits, but it drags in many places which are less interesting. The last thing is to sort out, but the drag in the middle of the movie disrupts the overall film quality. This is not a problem for a half-hour TV show, but with the film's length of celluloid, it is inevitable that at any time there is annoyance. After a while, the whole handy became helpless. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < If you see it, hey, if you know that you do not like these things, do not bother. You just will be disappointed.
