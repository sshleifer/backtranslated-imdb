All right, so the plot point can be somewhat obvious but works towards a tight end which is an interesting concept. The performance is strongly lacche hulam, who plays one of the central characters of this pair piece. She certainly has a screen presence and she is interesting to see. It has a low budget feeling that works for the thriller / horror genre that is contained in four jacks. The film adds total charm, which does not try to take itself seriously. The character of Phil (Dave Sharffein) will be the most annoying character seen on screen after Rupert Pikekin / Comedy King. DVD is worth adding to a holiday pile.
