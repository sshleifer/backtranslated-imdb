Good Lord ... How can I never know how it ended in our DVD player ... My wife thought that it was a new release, she would miss anyway ... it's two years old and in Danish (I do not think) ... he was looking for English soundtracks ... <br /> <br /> Everyone ... the film was not bad ... good production value, good performance, and a cute story clean, dark-entertainment fare from the sea side Make yourself too far away from creating! The end will make you chocolate ... In fact, the whole film will be. Unbelievably weird characters that we would be really interested in creating a movie that could be your time ... without destroying the plot, movie titles and DVD jackets give you a good idea where this thing is going!
