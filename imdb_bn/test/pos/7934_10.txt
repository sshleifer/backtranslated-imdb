Nevsky is one of the great epic war films. Sure, others like a born nation and Napoleon came before, but it is the only dominant Acting stock, but the first thing about Eisenstein knows that someone knows that was part of the theory of his film. This film is in contrast to his silent acts, like a heroic personality, it is like a group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy which went forward in 1938. Yet, his film shows us the strength that can be combined to fight to think that humans are evil. Nevsky is just one of the many men. He is strong because he is strong, but he does not have a different reason than the rest. The romantic corners of the photo provide a more personal story than Eisenstein's approval. All of the elements do not work and the film is probably too long, but it is still similar.
