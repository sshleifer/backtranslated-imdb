'In line of fire' is one of the Hollywood movies that shows on several TVs, though I have seen it a few times, but I'm holding the whole thing again. Why? - It's good! Clint Eastwood is as great as normal, and he plays the character interesting and fleshed more than usual. Secret Service agent Frank Harrigan has forgotten the character that he had failed to save Danny's President Kennedy and is now compelled to match with a professional killer who is publicly publishing that he would kill the president. However, the film is not a boring, brooding, and obsessed character in him. He is impressive and individualistic, and realistic as a man who has gained many experiences in life and is comfortable in his skin. She is quite a believer even when she flirts with a pretty young agent even played by Rene Russo. John Malcovitch enjoys playing his best performer killer, brain, deliberate and playing high-level games of life and death. He also went on to become the president of the other president, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The picture is consistently enjoyable, and it supplies all the materials - mystery, action, romance, and the drama - to the appropriate amount. This is a fun movie that has really helped with its great actors!
