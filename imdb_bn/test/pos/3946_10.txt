This weakness comes from confusing stories, plots often do not come anywhere. But it really does not matter because I still enjoy it full length. Once you really accept that these movies are not taken very seriously, you will enjoy it more. It's basically a love story, the first one is a misleading, but it's actually a little bit more effective. Sure it has been long ago but this complicated version is quite inspirational and sensitive. <br /> <br /> The first top Fantasy and the CGI were great for the first time but I still enjoyed its purpose. And people scream about how they are borrowing from other movies! Guess what we know !! And its purpose was ridiculous and entertaining because it really does not matter. Sometimes people are so critical to stop and they have to remember for a moment before starting yapping. Compared to the Hollywood standards, it is completely foolish and unconscious, it's a completely different style and target audience. As far as I'm concerned, most of my best films came from the previous producers and directors. Your Police Story 4, Shaolin Football, Kung Fu Hustle, Dragon Tiger Gate, Legend Fist, Hero, Crouching Tiger etc ... I like this movie and for the healing from the Philippines, United States of America, England, Libya and now Australia, I always Kind of films will be interested. Now try and understand my perception, but I warn you that I can see things from the perspective of the 5 countries I have lived in. So you're better off as a more experienced and open mind.
