I love these young people stuck in a home of horror movies. I'm not just Linna Quigley-Jezel Trescia fan, because it's a lot of fun and really terrible. Because <br /> <br /> Special effects are excellent, especially in the lipstick scene of Linnat and finally when everyone dies and commits suicide. <br /> <br /> Nunnery provided by Linnie and Jill, a lot of humor, cool soundtrack, high body count etc. If you do not have it ever seen, try out / view / view more and rate it The version is missing.
