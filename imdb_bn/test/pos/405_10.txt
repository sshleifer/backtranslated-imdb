Note: After writing this review, I see that this list is actually about the TV series and not the original film. My mistake I do not have an IMDB TV show for a movie, for movies. But most people will see this movie under the Baghdad Cafe and not Roshnam, which is oddly named, the movie is listed under IMDB, I will put this comment here. <br /> <br /> I miss something, but when I read another review it seems to be a complete review of the CBS series - which was definitely dependent on this movie. I did not see the TV series and I like it or not, but I'm sure one thing is different from this movie. This movie is not like a TV show and Hueppe Goldberg is in it or any other popular Hollywood star (in addition to Jack Palans, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> This is a terrific sweet movie that is completely "out of the box." This is not a movie like Hollywood, it's probably why (what a wonderful word for the mushriks?) Who decide not to take movies or decide not to market this market. <br /> <br />, my heart and imagination captured this movie-go away. Cinematography is actually a cool song in music (which is only a part of the time so you can not tell it a musical). <br /> <br /> German or Bariyan women (very nice and very thick) agreed with another German or Barisal, with whom he traveled through the desert in California and in various ways - he got in the car and he himself was in exile and desert Like you have gone to save on the highway. There is no middle ground. <br /> <br /> She finds small and impressive but interesting cafe in Baghdad Cafe in Baghdad, California. The rest of the story is magic I do not want to try to describe this picture because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> As far as "part of the mixture" is included. <br /> <br /> I think this image is an originality, entertainment and mere joy.
