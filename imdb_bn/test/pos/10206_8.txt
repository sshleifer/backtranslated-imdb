If the Western Union is not the real story of the construction of transcontinental telegraph, it certainly captures the spirit and enthusiasm of the people involved with the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is an officer-in-charge and a beautiful day he threw a horse and carries some fractured ribs. Randolph Scott, Randolph Scott, finds a ban on the runner and his horse is ready to steal, but changes his mind and brings Joger to help. Later Western Union hired him and worked for Jagar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Youth is doing one of the few debt-out films away from MGM for 20th-century Fox. Young and Scott both have become friends, but Jagger's sister Virginia Gilmore's rival. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of activities in the Western Union, which are enough to satisfy Western fans. The telegraph crew has to face the expulsion, the Indian, and the labor problems of your garden. <br /> <br /> Salim Samarvilli has some interesting scenes as the character of the bunker reserved for the horror dog and Victor Kilian. They both provide some good comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang got good performance from her cast and continued to film the film intensely. Western Union Solid Western Entertainment
