I watched this movie on Galway Film Flyawad, it won the best movie. I said that the aspect was fantastic and performance from the original cast members was very memorable. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it happens. The kiss was certainly a great payoff, accomplished with great enthusiasm !! <br /> <br /> I can only think of shooting the film in film, and I have heard that for his work in this film, he won a prize at the Dope Tipbeka Film Festival and I must say ... <br /> <br / > <br /> I would recommend this image in the 1980's as a teenager. It brought some great memories and some scary back.
