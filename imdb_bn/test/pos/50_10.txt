Fantastically written, acting, and produced! Love this impressive, gifted cast - each one of them is single - such a great performance. This movie has warmed my heart's cocoons thoroughly! Saying great story <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for months of black history. The exact figure of recent history and complete real characters who suffered incredible pain - complete with faith in dignity and a better future. How these diverse adults influenced this child, and it was so easy to contribute to this fertile imagination that eventually the genius of their adult adults would burn. Remember the next time you are in a listening and watching child company; Exhibit or he could be a writer-in-the-creator!
