As a warm reader of Clive Barker, I really expected this movie before being released ... I was not frustrated. "Nightbreed" is a horse in a different color. The way in which we have never seen before the intrinsic loss of Western civilization is to jump with rich and alternative existence. Barker is shown at the best times of his time when he lets us enter into an unprecedented horror world, but we are shown on the other side of the coin. Here "monsters" are suddenly beautiful creatures, when people are deceitful ugly creatures of selfishness. We soon learned that all of us were wrong along. Often used by Craig Chefer for my favorite performance and the Bonus added as "Boner" by David Krebren is then a credible Cast. "Monster" is portrayed as a shame by the creators of English creatures, many of whom have brought "cenobits" in the "Heilroiser" life, including "Pinehad" himself Doug Bradley. For any fan of the "Nightbrad" genre, it must be seen, because of course, and of course (some) more than the story of their fear. It is its best Clive Barker.
