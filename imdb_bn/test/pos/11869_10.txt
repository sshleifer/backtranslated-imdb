This movie makes me smile even thinking about it. Such a smart comedy! Very precise yet simple. Welding can not be any good. All actors prefer the best of their roles and they all shout at the best play, and no stupid smiles or shouting out the whole movie. Levels and story progresses work perfectly together and smooth flow of rhythms. Most of the time, when the YMCAAT is directed by the people of the village, it adjusts to the provisions of Indian law, which was extensively preceded by the film, which is the most smart and funny measure among the many comedies. I think it is under a low ten comedy especially many times.
