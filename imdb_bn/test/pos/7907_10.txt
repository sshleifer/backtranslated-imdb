We were small, my cousin and I saw this movie. I do not know what this movie has, but we went to this favorite movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories. <br /> <br /> I exactly like this movie and totally recommend that those who prefer good healthy family movies are just because of this. The four kids find themselves absolutely sunny in things that get themselves in. It's an old movie but that does not let you fool. This is one of the best movies that shows each other strong siblings bonds.
