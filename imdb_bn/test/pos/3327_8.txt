"Side Show" is one of the most awesome movie ever made from full moon images. Some places are very serious, but it is not frustrating as a trailer (this shows all the largest parts of the trailer for movies). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this photo to the fearful fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of this type of movie should find puppet master, skinned alive, slam party genocide, sleep camp, and other full moon photo flicks.
