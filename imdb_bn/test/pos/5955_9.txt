How would I like to add it! Others said that the Necked song was filled with James Bond. I think I'm a bit correct, but I'm not neutral at that point ...; And <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This reminds you of old movies (50s and 60s) and it only Not for that period (1955, with the exception of the flashback exception), but it's made of the movie and its mood shows on screen! Here is the main actor (who said my country was very popular in France), he's perfect role here. She is attached to her with number 117 spy. There is a character who uploads it to the movie, asking a question whether he is good or not ... When you watch the movie you will see! <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a very interesting thing, and if you mix comedy with your spy old school flyer but with no importance for yourself or anything else, you need to see it!
