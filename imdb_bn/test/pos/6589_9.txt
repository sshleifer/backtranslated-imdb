Just a few days ago, I was very lucky to see this picture as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005. I must admit that I am very part of a film that focuses on human relationships and especially those who focus on the sad aspect of life. I love most of Scandinavian cinematic offers, the story is often released and dragged characters. This photo's character building is remarkable in its detail and its depth. Despite this we face quite a few of all the characters with very special personal circumstances and positions in our community. At the end of the screening the audience was very silent and apathetic. I'm still playing some scenes in my mind and I still amazed at their power and meaning.
