The most silent film I've seen has been serious in nature, so it's fun to see one with a ridiculous touch. The setting for "The Belvedere rug" and some scenes were memorable about the 1923 "The Hanbach of Notre Dame" celebration of Paris's Street View and the 'King of Fruit'. John Barrymore portrays Fran√ßois Villan, the greatest poet in France, who is romantically tender from the virtual slopstick. It seems that sometimes there is no change, and about a century ago, this movie was interesting to watch curiosity - it's a fool for a night in Paris, there is a time other everywhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Conrad Waddat's appearance in this film was a little surprised, I just saw him as a Major Strauss at "Casablanca", his last few movies in the past. As King Louis XI, he was a little ruthless, intriguing but suspicious with astrophysics, and it was a little incompatible to see him closely associate with Brad Derrief's Warmozouge character from the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings trial. The hope of the French king's confidence is not without confidence. The ambition of Burgundy's Duke (Lawson Butt) seemed to be most reasonable, until Vilon did not emerge on the occasion of the release of one of the rulers. <br /> <br /> I saw it that the inter-headline card was too excessive, only used when the story needed advance. Although without them, one would miss a weird nugget. It looks like his exiled army from Paris to Villene Larry Fly! <br /> <br /> The print that I saw was of exceptional quality, one hundred action from Mack Creek Entertainment and the first movie presented in the suspense movie DVD, which is now saying something for an eight-year-old film. Silent era movies have now found extensive distribution in this type of commercial format, which makes them completely accessible to new generation movie lovers. <br /> <br /> One question - does it seem like Conrad Vaudt is the purpose of King Louis, his nose or, as a continuous gesture that is only safe from the cutting room?
