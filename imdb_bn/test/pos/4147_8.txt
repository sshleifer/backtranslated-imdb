This is a good film, no doubt, but in some strange way. Without some confiscation it is only in 3 places - a Sicilian farm, boat, and New York at Alice Island. All shots are close up so we do not see anything in a wide basket. I wonder if I save this money? No street scenery anywhere else, and we do not even see the boat without closing. And music ... Nina Simone songs before the world was running, decades ago? I could also work in milk river business ... but hey, you think of me as a pure misconception, let me repeat, it's a very good movie, hearty moment, wonderful photography, great character and migration experience is normal More accuracy than (American) effort.
