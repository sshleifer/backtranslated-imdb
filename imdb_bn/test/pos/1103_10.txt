Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree with some things. First, this picture is not something that Paris ATE. IMHO not <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think this film was an element of spiritualism, but I think the filmmaker's basic method is not "very dear". So this is not really like the Paris Paris, I think a wicked euro job, which does not disguise "scary" with some scenes. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think Hugenroder's music is bright. They used the old word from the country and Western record, and it was better than most Australian movies, which usually makes filmmakers a partner, which is a stupid sound that the company wants to push, with the Indie band. In the name of the movie - I do not know why it is called modern love, I was hoping to drag David Bovi and wear lipstick dresses ... oops I started to show my age.
