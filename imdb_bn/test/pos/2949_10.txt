Seeing this picture is quite a mental reaction. What is this about all of today's documentary? It is refreshing to see something personal, honest and real. The thoughts, opinions and publications of Mr. Block are rarely seen this day and here are incredibly well displayed. It's a fine line of walking between personal truth and absorption. This picture is very carefully and successfully managed. <br /> <br /> Someone thinks that learning about how apparently the couple is worried about the expectation of society will lead to disappointment ... but that is not the case. On the contrary: It made me feel well. I now know more about marriage ... about women <br /> <br /> Check it out for sure, it will give you a thought - exactly what a good documentary should be designed.
