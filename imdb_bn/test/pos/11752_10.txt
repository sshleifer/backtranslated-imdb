I first saw this movie when I was a teenager, I was removed a lot in the mid-60's, the last scene where Han Sueen listens to Mark's death and then goes to the mountain of mistrust, where you hear Mark's voice "Give me your hand" , And then his image disappears, his strange money butterfly, music, broken feelings of Han Suyun's love, mango Who left my heart cold. I started crying out crying, my mother and sister looked and I was surprised to see my reaction. I just left the room on my own. Thankfully I did not react like that but I always cry at the end. I love everything about film, music mostly, clothing of Han Suyin, and location. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the handsome William Holden was both the best of them. I have this wonderful movie VHS and DVD. I've got two versions of music and songs from Arthur Newman and Sammy Fen. Han Sueen's book is also my book book. I recommend this film 100%
