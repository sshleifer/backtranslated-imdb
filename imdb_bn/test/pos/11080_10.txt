Falcon and Snowman are based on a true story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Dalton Lee, Timothy Holdman and the headlined by Shan Penn, received their code name from KGB. Why? Boyce was a warm falconer and Lee had a coke head. The movie is based on a true story. It is based on the book of the same name. Another critic asked, what was their motivation? Confusion is not it. It's not ideology. (Forgiveness is my bad grammar,) but I'm just a point here. What was it if it did not have confusion or ideology? A word, greed During the Boy-Lee case, money is not great motivation and ideology. Do not believe me Then look at the Walker Family Spie Ring which ended in the 80's. In the '70s and 80s, three of the spies had the worst damage to our national security. John Walker, who started his career as 60th, Christopher's age and Andrew Dalton's spy. These three countries sold these silver pieces for the silver. If you are not familiar with those phrases, then I recommend you to read the Bible.
