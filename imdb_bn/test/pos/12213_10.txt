I enjoy the show surface too. The show is very entertaining and it is a clean show. A show like the surface is interesting. It keeps my attention. It has compassion and mystery. I love all cast members that show. They all liked very well. I think it is very important to have the right cast of any event because it makes any successful and certainly shows the scenes and shots. Television has changed so much for years. It has changed the way and the bad. I love to see some comedy, action, mystery and romance And scifi But Surface is a show which I hope comes back for many seasons because it is a great show and it is something that can see the family. My kids have grown up, but my husband and I are happy to see such a show. I appreciate your time and letting me comment on my comments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
