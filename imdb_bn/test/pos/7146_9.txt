This film was recommended by the same person, which blessed me with a copy of the Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written. It is well executed, played and operated. Cinematography is a bit dark for my taste, but I am sure it can be such. The screen is a poem in the part of the movie, I have paused myself to reflect on the comments made on the screen by film. This is a wonderful piece movie and I can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews. Clear alert though this was a 6 tissue movie for me. Very touch Very hearty acting.
