I was happy that at least now the movie has started to gain appreciation (see only those votes). Not a top-class action like "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon", but still 7 of the 10 hard files: Fine scripts, well-known chemistry with chemistry, and the director who wants to know (Sadly, it was Hurlin's last good man The film "Deep Blue Sea" was directed to reach the position of Roller-Coaster-Side, but "Katthral Island, and especially" powered "flights are good Qualified!) Personally I think the box office may be "women as action star" if it has been closed. + Well, give him a chance, because Davis provides a performance on performance and, finally, the picture is next to "woman" But instead of good ol 'action, friendship (Jackson has been given a lot of room here as a sidekick, plus his action-and almost a thousand murderers The title of the savings!) And the plot (from Shane Black, the author of "Lethal Weapon" and "The Last Boy Scout"), the next one is on many levels as a movie ... the theme, the cute plot, as well as the underlying!) Overall : If someone does not meet this one, do not forget to rent it on the next Saturday night!
