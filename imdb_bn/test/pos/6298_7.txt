I read that the inspiration for Sorrintino's love results was only to monitor a businessman in a Brazilian hotel and guess what he could do there. The film unfolds to us in the same way. We have seen the existence of one who lives alone in a Switzerland hotel for 8 years. She concealed and avoided friendship. His life is commanded and commanded by regular. Gradually, the truth of his existence is revealed to us, finally, his world begins to separate. <br /> <br /> The mystery of love is the center of love and it's great part of the excellent performance by Tony Servillo. His character has become more intriguing to us because little details have been published - that he injoxes once a week, he has no imagination. Although some criticize the dialogue for not being natural here, it is not a matter of my view - it is not a movie and I think the script is great. The camera work is also excellent. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, then the picture may lose a way in the next scene because the mystery of the existence of Tita has been revealed to us, and its global collapse begins. However, the tragic final scene is the last bid up as well as every bit.
