STMD! There are some fun and enjoyable low budget movies that I have seen several times. Director Jeff Smith (who also worked as a co-writer, film-maker and editor) clearly shows love for his love towards the horror films of the 80s! Anyone who loves glasses, boring situations, cruelty of 80's horror and stereotypical characters, he must love this tongue-in-the-neck of the past. <br /> <br /> <br />! Definitely the poster described attributes and then something. It contains all "too much violence" and "unwanted nudity" that we remember all 80 people remembering the film. STMD saw the explosion! I did not get enough amount of stereotypical characters from 80 groups that bleed in blood splatters!
