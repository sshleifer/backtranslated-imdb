According to the fifth commandment "Do not kill you", Declight 5 may be considered violent against the death penalty: It is not for any reason that it follows the concept of a state fully in accordance with the provisions of an unfair law on the same plane, an assassin's image. The real catalyst character Defense Consultant Peator said, "But the law can not imitate nature, it can be right." The punishment is not a crime, but a form of revenge for returning to evil. In whose name does the law take revenge? Really innocent? "The last half-hour of a person who was executed by the dead and horrendous in execution of a series of executions provides the scandal of the forbidden function to threaten all potential criminals." How disobedience can be treated unfairly, which is a crime There are three different moral attitudes: the natural feeling of the Mudarara rebellion in order to encourage the adverse petit of the surrounding environment; The strong feeling of Victim's long-lasting indifference lingered on the needs of other people; The council's rightful behavior for the constitution is always ready to fight against adverse human life. Life The struggle for ruthlessly divides all the time; The characters fall into the scene of sadness and anguish, the urban landscape spoken by the green tones and the windshield of a taxi can be seen in their own image. "Decolez 5" describes everything's horrific sense of isolation and isolation: violence and False, the horizon of the uncertain conditions of the workplace, the ruthless environment is seamless The terrifying presence of the submerged building in the sky, the futile vandering description through the stupid environment. The main character Jajake is forced to fight with a stronger opponent than himself: A city is completely deeply indifferent, apparently hostile, its deformed for the help of the deaf, when a faded picture of a small girl in the first communion dresses goes gnawing her spirit. He is continuously pointing out his steps towards a disconnected route on the way through 18 mm distortion. Wide Angle Camera lenses make every detail distort, change the reality, it fade into distant and isolated echoes. Kieslowski is not brought to exenuating situations seasoned with sweet-tongued tones from some Hollywood stereotypes like "I want to live" on behalf of the opponent's tongues-tongued tone rival (by Robert Wise). He does not slip on the artillery of neutral cruel scenes to eliminate Jaikak's crime and to eliminate the cruelty of the crime, is not interested in concentrated psychological motivations to justify a demonstration of extreme or violent behavior, and a neutral judicial proceeding In other words, Kislowski's opinion "An offense is always an offense": According to the principle of "Para Cond√≠cio", he places the prosecutor on the same plane as the person condemned, using the many signs or symbols represents the most cruel light in society. And we can not be indifferent: Even if we do not agree with him, then by crying the jacock's pain our heart touches the same way that he is the eyes of Terri Schivo's requesting eyes
