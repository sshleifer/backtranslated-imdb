In terms of authenticity, the bandit queen is a real story, it is true, because the things that make it consistent are kept as true today as of 1994. This film is violent, powerful and thought provoking. This character is a female flesh and blood, whose dangers bring out the best (or worse) out of it. Keeping aside governmentalism, there is no doubt that the 8-year-old girl, who was married to her husband, took a loan from her father (for rebel purpose), leader of a leader who is going to be the leader of the lower caste, has introduced her own rights into a champion. His screenplay is so strong that the audience agreed to forgive him for genocide. <br /> <br /> If I realize that the Western audience can not appreciate this best composition but the bandit needs to 'study' the Indian context, and check out only stereotypes. I can not sell it at its universal appeal, but of course, Indian viewers must keep an eye on it, it is shameful that the movie was delayed, censored version was released in India. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman who fought against two discrimination in India, she was a woman, and then she was the most horrible experience of life due to the lower caste, her rebel nature and inability, which only strengthened her. Self declared goddess She responded to the violence violence and the modest women's society wanted to be her. He was called by the name of divine justice or judicial failure, he killed a person who executed him, killed him, killed 24 people, and paid tribute, respect, and glory. <br /> <br /> # Anyone who got his character "psychologist" needs to be sodomized at the age of 8, ammunition with 10 men and nude parade. Then they should ask - how natural are they?
