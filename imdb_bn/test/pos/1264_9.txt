Three years ago at the Hong Kong International Film Festival saw this. Christopher Nolan was not the name of that time, I did not expect any hope, but it was encouraged and became one of the best things I have seen in that festival. It works well on the big screen with the cutting edge scene out of order to add moods. Mr. Nawalan finally gave a good account of his creation, let anyone start a filmmaker! I liked better than Memento though it was probably due to low expectations. And it was more of an Art House movie.
