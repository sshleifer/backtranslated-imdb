This is definitely an excellent show. I do not have cable, so I rent them, because my friend suggested it. I think it will be a tin soap, you know, those types of dating, those kind of things. But it was not. It's amazing deep. It is very wicked It moves at very fast speed and as long as you see it, it is even more tight. This is a comedy-drama, which is done well. It's about Rory and Lorelai's relationship. Instead of a classic mother-daughter relationship, it's a good friend relationship story - about a mother and a daughter. Characters are thrown perfectly and do all a fantastic job. It's certainly the best TV show I've come across too.
