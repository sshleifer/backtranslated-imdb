Unlike most people .... I went to the film that it was not good and hoped to turn it into an extraordinary movie. I like the idea of ​​the cool cool plot, but actually this film was an actor. They all did an incredible job and it was quite calm to see fishburn and Dillon work together. This is a movie where you are going to think directly that you will be able to predict what is going to happen, but how you predicted it will not be fully implemented. I do not want to give me something about the story ... but I would suggest giving it a chance. You watched movie train movies and enjoyed that movie you liked. Maybe Lawrence Fishband touch everything?
