Never before has Oliver Stone been seen, and I do not know what I can expect from this movie, which is a film starring Erich Bogosian. While playing with the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I finally got it free as a supplement to a Sunday newspaper and I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> It's Barry Champline's story, a talk radio host who can be incredibly unsavory to his callers, often putting them in place before realizing what is happening. Although it has hosted its popular radio show host, it earned him many enemies. <br /> <br /> This film was not the actress's role. Eric Bogosian Barry Champleine-like, Broken Conversation with Alec Baldwin, Radio Host Barry has become a strong act like Dan Dan. It also shows the voice of Michael Wincot (my reason for wanting to see it) and the presence of Kyoyo. <br /> <br /> Despite its arrogance, the story was really well-written, you feel more about Barry, his annoying life, and you can see how weak he really is. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie because it is fascinating and more important, many levels are real, which is inspired by the actual conversation radio host and actually you are just as well as featured features in the radio show host and the real movies of the callers. <br /> <br /> High recommendation and 10/10 <br /> <br /> Hey you, cat squire
