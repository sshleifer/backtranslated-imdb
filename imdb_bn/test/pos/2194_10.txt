I could not get on score, book, and performance standards. This is the first production I ever saw Sweeney Todd so I have someone else to compare it. But the impact is so strong, I just can not think of anything better. First, take the music - "Johanna" (Act 2), whilst Swini, Anthony and Johanna sing an intervening song, the voice line includes the lyrics from three songs. That's like a batch chorale - just composing a best composition. And the intrinsic magnetic structure and voices are so perfect - some sadness, some amusement, some modest, these three singers have expressed their views. <br /> <br /> - Then - - Geometry. Rhymes are so clever Rhythm schemes sometimes seem random but they always add up to the end. (DVD, which I have seen, has close captions, and is essential for this dialogue and praise of songs.) Sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone. <br /> <br /> Finally, performance. I can not imagine better than George Heno. Why did not I hear him before? His singing, alone, efficient, but his acting range is simply amazing. Angela Lans Barbi surprised me. The song "You and me down by the sea coast" - can it make it even better? Its timeless, pitch is perfect, the score is calculated for each beat; And enjoying this feat in the musical industry is his delightful comic delivery. <br /> <br /> This is a dark story but I sometimes feel sweet; And the "johna" tune continues to play on my head.
