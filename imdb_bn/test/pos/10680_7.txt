When I saw that this film was broadcast on TV late at night I decided to miss it first. I was so happy that I saw. Yes special effects are similar to Gary Anderson's doll show. Some actresses have come from her other productions, she obviously used the same musician, because Chessy Soundtrack can only come from her needs and the plot is slow on the wet weekend. Get all that and shows a playful prospect that you have a film. What is the planet on the far side of the sun? Is it a similar world? Everything is reversed about it and if they speak opposite English? Gary's wonderful model is for cars, planes, buildings and spaceships only if I like this date SF. Some of them have not reached so far to come back. And did you see the European Space Center logo? Today the euro logo is very memorable. Suspend the faith and spend a few hours watching it, you will be glad
