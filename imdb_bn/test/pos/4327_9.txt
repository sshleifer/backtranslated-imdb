If the point of this message is to think and share without discussing the next season ... here is my prediction: 1. The hatch was actually blown up, but the way someone else was living in. But let me see that. 2. The last episode with Trent is watching a tracking team installed on Penney Desmonds Boat, an observer team. Now the magnetic slope around the island has been lifted, the signal has been lifted at the signal station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3. After the demolition of the hats, the island is no longer separated, and other ships / aircraft are going to reach 4. Others will eventually secrecy secretly with our observers. <br /> <br /> Is it really sure the Lost Season 4 is going to be? <br /> <br /> Cheers Mike
