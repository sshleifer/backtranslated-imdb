A movie like this does not come along too often too. Finally it took 9 years to see it. Before deciding how destructive people should live, politicians and civilians should see this, I saw this day after watching TV version of "rebellion" about Warsho Geto. Even though I felt new, I felt sympathy for the German soldier. I felt sympathy for all parties that could happen to this disaster. This one will take time to thaw out. I am surprised that they did not buy a movie based on Sajjar's "The Forgotten Sender". Cold share with this movie book. Both will hunt me for the rest of my life.
