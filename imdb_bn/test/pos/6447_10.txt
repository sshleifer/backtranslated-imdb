I was roaming through my local library, browsing VHS tapes, when I saw a movie that created a drop in my face - Waterbaby I was hoping to see this movie again - I saw it for 22 years (near cable-movie channel 78-79). I was recalled much better in detail - especially Grimes. My son, K4, and I saw it. <br /> <br /> She agrees with me that the grimes "is not good", and the best way to describe me is that she did not like Tom. He took that. It's amazing that I still remember some songs! They were trapped in my head for 22 years - which means they have some memorable moments, Ah? <br /> <br /> It is a good child movie, which includes parental guidance in the questions about children's children that go through the fraternity / society in that frame. These children face up to every day (without some lucky ones), and while we use Disney-quote films, they make more PCs for children these days, that does not mean that cruelty was not present - or even still not. I enjoyed the animation. It was not Disney, nor was it. I do not think Don Bluth has touched a paintbrush in this film. <br /> <br /> There is too much for it. David T plays two roles! (I really liked him!) James M. too. The climate is intelligent themselves. Sorry for you Tom, and the route for him. Then Billy himself is playing in the multi-role part - his eyes are so magical! I'm a huge fan of WoO, TLW & TW, and the company (and looking forward to HP!), And I filed it with this kind of movie. Yes, he jumped into the water, but not because of suicide. He jumped because he believed the black lady - he showed everyone to her. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have kids, pick a rental copy. If you are able to buy a copied copy, let me know where! Ian liked it! :) <br /> <br /> Dr.
