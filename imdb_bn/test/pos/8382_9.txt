Brad Pitt keeps his injection finger Dian Kruger in the leg of his leg and does not get what he wants until he keeps it. Funny, awesome. The invented yarn takes a ride "The Dirty Dozen" and sometimes abandons it for the tribute to other films. A lot of fun Even when "Paris sizzles it" a delightful organic part is mentioned in the dialogue. I was thrilled by the character of Christopher Waltz and his amazing performance. Brad Pitt creates a true origin. I love the actor's terrible lack. There is a quirk of pure Brad Pitt character. Tenantino visited a new universe but. Fortunately, his hand. His brain and his heart are visible everywhere.
