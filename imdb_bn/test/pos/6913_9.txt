I thought Rachel York was fantastic "Lucy." I saw him in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor / Victoria", and in each of these performances he has created very different, and very real, characteristic features. He is a cheater who can play (and sing) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, "Lucy." Even some extraordinary TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of his screenplay. Rachel does not really look like Lucy actually has many people focused on this. My response is, "So what?" I'm not looking for Lucy a superficial camouflage. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the shirt. And Rachel certainly gave us deeper depth. I just do not want to see "doing" the classic Lucy routine. So, with the most memorable flaws of Rachel's decision on the decision of the producer and the director, I was very pleased with Rayal's decision in the presentation of Richell - Vitamatavazamin and The Candy Factory. (It seems that some critics do not realize that these two scenes are not rehearsal and actual skits). In this approach, I thought that sketches have given an innovative twist that is known by many of our hearts. I thought Rachel was terrific fresh and funny in these scenes. And he duplicated perfectly restored routines - especially Professor and Grape Stompin. There was a time in the vineyard scene where Rachel's face had a small reverse, which Lucy remembered. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the whole movie. Finally, those of us who only wanted to know him through television did not have any idea how Lucy really was in his early film years. I have shown a natural progression of the character Rachel was brighter. He planted the right seed for us, which is just waiting for victory, the situation gave the right set. Lucy did not fit old studio system molds. <br /> <br /> I believe that he was disappointed by this disappointment of Rachel that he has kept comedy, drama, intelligence, sadness, anger, and extremism. , Passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexuality, self-absorption, childhood, and stoicism all rolled into a complex American icon. And he did it with an authentic and tanzha that he fully respected. "Lucy" Rachel was a star turn for York. I hope this will bring a great role in its role in the future. I hope it brings her an amy.
