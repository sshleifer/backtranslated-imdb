Being a fan of warm carpenter, I really like this movie (though Wieg is going to be preferred!) And agree with many comments that some parts of his life were not missing. Whatever - it's good to leave your curiosity and really dissatisfied, so I went off to discover more. I have to recommend Ray Coleman's book - Carpenters - Antoine Story. The book is an intelligent reading and opposite of the film, 'real' and below the earth. I hope you enjoy it. I think Cinemia Gibbs is a fame and gypsy from his day. He is a singer (as well as a dancer) in his own right and I think this character needs the edge to create it. Some other actresses may be struggling with this. This picture did not appear deeply in the story of Ashhem. After the title of these films, but I think we learned more about Richard, but I think like any of their salt actors you will always leave them more!
