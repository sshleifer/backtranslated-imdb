This is a movie that primarily selects the number of video rental ... to discover only a low-rated, entertaining and enjoyable movie! The police reached a dark and rainy house where "wife" killed ... or is it ?? And the rest wants to reveal what really happened. ... okay ... the film is a little "campi" ... but there is good editing and dialogue ..... professionally acting ..... often funny ... and the end of the scene with its facial expression 'Excellent ...... of course, the best one ... to see ... at least a 7 or an 8!
