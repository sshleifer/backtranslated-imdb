The film has started, spinning the wheels, your car entered into a race against the fox .... You are not going back, you think, "If I go out, I'm taking you ..." You parked on the street Break in, you hit Fox but your target is bad .... Bang, you went behind a VW, and destroyed you in a reservoir that has landed. Light your car in the fire If you wanted you could find out, but the shame of losing you ... bang! Hurt in your car, everyone is frustrated, some are crying ... a siran's voice tells you police is coming. Everyone gets your car and bolts, for you to burn. Finally sitting around the car's frame, hunting on the audience ... you're dead. <br /> <br /> This is one of the scenes; Actually its first scene in the movie. It has a lot more. When you have fox cockpit pumped its V8 Ford, Terry Syrio to its crazy GTHO, and many of the past explosions .... JOHN CLARKS'S BEST ARGUMENT, "EMPTY A THE RUNNING" "She Wins Any Cost-"
