All right, well, their right mind (s) will choose a film called "Screaming Brain" and it would be very serious. This is a harmful B-movie, and this means the plot of hockey, strange characters, clich√©s, top action, and a liner with the Oh-Tai-Chase. That strange part of the population (with me) that comes out of such things, it's a jewel. <br /> <br /> acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in her character. Bruce Campbell brought an enthusiastic, convincing performance. His physical comedy skills are really impressive in this movie and come back to the movie "Evil Dead".
