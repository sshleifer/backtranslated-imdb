I have seen this story before but my kids do not have The boy with disturbed past joins the military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. This time mentor Kevin Costner played perfectly; There is a tremendous determination to live a life of normal daily living. After losing his team, he took the teaching of next generation heroes to a teaching position. Young trouble-ridden recruitment is played by Kutcher. With interest in local love, his scenes are quite difficult and do not produce sufficient heat to dissolve the butter, but he conveyed congratulations to Coster well. I never understood Selena Ward as a neglected wife and she thought that she wanted to express her concern for the safety of Constant to oppose her selfish demands. But his presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two unknown stars of this movie are Coast Guard and Sea. Real power or both of these movies should not be supposed that strong forces. The film wasted 15 minutes to strengthen some slow and character relationships. But it still works. Rescue scenes are edited to provide intense and well-impressed and maximum effect. This movie earns the audience applause. And applause of my two sons.
