Legendary Italian painter-producer-director, who died in 1999 as a director with about 200 features in his 2002 feat. A large part of D'Amato softcore sex film, along with Laura James, with her infamous EMANULELE entry, was spent. They briefly covered his porn career, which kept him in his last decade or more. More interesting for me is the focus section on its horror and action efforts. D'Amato has a great deal of fame about the making of fake importers and his low-budget films while shooting at 2000-year-old Katakbom. Other interviews include George Eastman and Al Cleaver. I liked some conversation about his state-of-the-art filmmaking production (not a question about Trogl 2; it was then that it was not ritual).
