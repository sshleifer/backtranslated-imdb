This is actually the best movie of 1999. I'm not kidding. This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the very spirit of artistic obedience. Smith, any documentary, should do a smart thing: he keeps invisible and refuses to judge him. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < He is obnoxious and suffer repeatedly as a result. But we will not forget, Spielberg, Scorsese and others humbly started. <br /> <br /> And he chose a nice thing. Mark, his family and friends are all impressive characters, much more than any other character made in the fantasy cinematic products of the past year. This film is a comedy, tragedy, sympathy, and finally encourages a visitor to revive. Despite the issues of genius, their butts off and do something to do. <br /> <br /> This movie is about maverick artists and their passion. It can also be dependent and effective on the family, and how unique the animal is and how beautiful it is. Mark is not only for his dreams, but also to his family - and they prove him to be completely devoted. <br /> <br /> Why is this film not nominated for the year's documentary, and it is beyond my perception of crime (which has been assumed that it was eligible last year). This film is sought out and treasured.
