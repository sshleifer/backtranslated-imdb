Probably a long time comedy. You keep an atheist smile! There are many delightful cayos as Ben Styar as well as acting and guitarist folks. I was not as much as I expected but comedy was made for it. Because I can only hope for a single penny, they can still do much more. Although it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long, I wanted more :) :) There is also a scene behind one of my favorite parts of the movie! I love the good comedy and it certainly suggests to fans of D or Jack Black. You must also buy the album, the songs are very extraordinary and ridiculous, there are also music top notes.
