This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! It describes the feelings of a person who dreams of the dream and can not understand ?? But how it is said to fill it! I see "Cat and Moon Stories" as a beautiful metaphor for human relationships, emotions and love. <br /> <br /> Technically it also did a good job. Although very simple, black and white animation gives the voice of transformation in film and its message, but softness and nostalgia too. <br /> <br /> In the addiction, music contributes to this poetic feeling. <br /> <br /> "Nothing else! I will wait! He will come when he will, or he wants!"
