After clearing Dodge City (with a little help from W. Erepe) Bat Mastersson is going to Liberal, Kansas where they are going to fight a beautiful little range. An attractive plan for sharing instead of Plus. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott Bat Masters, and after the Revolution Billy House and Steve Brody, who are running homes from their farms. Among the owners of the funding scheme, which are run by Robert Ryan. It seems that he is cultivating the land of different farmers and taking possession of land for a percentage of the profits from their crops. Ryan's all-round loss of Shannanyan resulted in losing his shirt. Painted by Scott, Bat Masters is a stand-up Western hero who is eager to go east and has become a journalist who we all know later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreis and Maja Merithith are involved in romantic occasions that involve Brody and Ryan, who are somewhat stupid and refrain from action. Anne Jeffreys though beautiful songs. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gabbi Hayes always offers great comic relief. <br /> <br /> A good addition to Western Randolph Scott collection. In his next film, his western films are not as white as a hat. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Casey Hayes of Professional Bulldog Riders, who is a proud resident of Liberal, Kansas, a city bat with a great heritage, whether there is a martial or not Martyr there.
