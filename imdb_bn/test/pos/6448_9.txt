I can read the comments above and believe it! Of course it is a child movie, it is an adaptation of a children's book !! This picture is easy to catch, try play.com or amazon and it is very easy to achieve a copy! Humor is similar to children and adults alike, and adventure is clear with no violence! It is perfectly suitable for children of all ages! The songs are gaps, and yes, a little repetitive, but the children need it and I did not hear the song "High High Kokalroom" for my little boys! They love it, a story of solitude and friendship! Very prudent and well worth watching for kids of all ages and adults!
