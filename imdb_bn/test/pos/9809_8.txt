I heard many different things about it because I started watching this one very exciting. Wherever I read it is a play for child abuse and PG-13 rates for violence. Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure for kids (and I had to watch it for children). Well, now I have seen this many times and I do not know how it can be kept in any class. It is extremely funny but horrible sad at times and the next moment is depressing. Due to excellent relationships and generations I want to suggest this film to all the young people of this film, but I think that little atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect performance and magic of the movie, I must say: See this, especially the kids! Lastly, I want to say that after fleeing The King, the poor Bobby hated the script writer (who did not return Mary and Mikeo to Terrorism) to not see his family again. It is very good for the movie that everyone is satisfied with not being happy happy - and I do not expect it - but this solution has made me very sad!
