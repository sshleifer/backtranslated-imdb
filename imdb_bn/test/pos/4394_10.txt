For the first time I saw this movie, it does not seem to go anywhere. Although I have seen it a second time, it has gained a lot of knowledge. Give it an opportunity, see it once in a while, there are many key elements that shape the story which can be missed at first and even second time. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Kohin brothers were reliably excited in this story to create a credible setting and storyline. Clooney's main role coordination coincides with the supporting works of Tururou and Nelson. The look of John Goodman in the movie is ridiculous. Soundtrack is good as well. This picture is a family favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure.
