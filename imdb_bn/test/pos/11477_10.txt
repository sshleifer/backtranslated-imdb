Perhaps it was probably one of the best Portuguese movies ... I enjoyed the plot completely, because the way the story was developing, you will be more concerned about how the world is concerned about it ... okay the only part that really is not appropriate in movies That is, the women's strip ... it does not add anything important to the story, it seems that it is only for men, bin For the purpose of reducing The last one is unexpected, though, at the same time, somewhat expected. If you do not understand, follow me: After many strange happenings, so much of the viewer's curiosity is used so much that the film is completely natural after seeing the complete unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susanna) after watching the whole movie. But, most of the time, Soto Nulla is a movie that makes it difficult for you to try to solve mysterious events, making you sad about your unfortunate life and your perception of what can happen in a few minutes, when you are away from something ... For all that, I rate it 8/10
