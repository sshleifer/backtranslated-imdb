Gary and Silvia Anderson (behind team of space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbird, Fireball XL-5 and "Sun of the Seer of Journey"). Others). In the film, Roy Thinas ("Invaders" TV show) and Ian Hendry stars as stars for the star as a star on a planet that divides the orbit exactly on Earth, on the opposite side of the sun; Therefore hide previously from the view. A pushy European Space Flight Director (played by more late Patrick Wymark) gets the fast track of the flight and after the rigorous training, the astronaut is better to go. Thus, the film, launch, flight and landing 'The other' is the best order of the world. Wonderful rocket miniature work (by Derek Meddings) and a dream, elegant spacefight (Something better memorable "moment of the Smith ODisire") is a simple highlight of the film. "Doppelganger" landing on Earth is both exciting and eerie. After that, the movie's twistight zone approach has been kicked; The classic TZ episode, "The parallel", has been shown almost a plot. After that, the film is still strong science-fie, cheating some misleading 'mirror-world' elements (back writing and handshake of left hand, for example). In the middle of the 21st century the visuals are less successful; Where all men wear turtles and Nehru jackets and all women wear mini-skirts. Some of the relationships with women in the film today are 'non-pc' according to the standard. And (among the most consistent failures of most 20th-century science fai) computers, telephones and other hardware are all big, colorful and incognito (which breaks away from Patrick McGohon's "The Prison"). Digital microprocessor age nobody saw! If anyone can take these failures on television, then the film is a very fun, with strong lead performance as a scary astronaut of Thins. And a beautiful, artistic ending of the 1960s / 70s! For fans of the opposite science-fan (like me) it is a "journey" worth!
