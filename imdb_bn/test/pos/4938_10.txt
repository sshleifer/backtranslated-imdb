It's a great movie to watch with a great friend, boy / girl friend or family. Basically one of the best movies that you want to share with their loved ones .... .... All the American girls find you find all the girls crap like movies. This movie is light-hearted but makes you think, and you will laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a simple but universal plot. It seems that most people might be somewhat related to this movie. The characters of the movie are amazing and actors do a great job in sucking you on the movie. And the film has been the top of the true genre of Jewish comedy. I watched the first movie last night, and now I want to be its owner. :)
