After watching "Waqo: Rule of Busy", I was sitting in the mistrust of what I was witnessing. A big cover of FBI, a genocide / happy government agent triggered by Gang-hay? I obviously recall Waiko Stanford, I was 17 years old and watched CNN. In April 1993, I remember the mountainous hills on the hillside of mountains, reflecting on the burning children. I felt sorry for the children in my mind, but it seemed to me that they blamed their evil leader David Quresh and other Davidians. Gazakhi's film clearly and beyond doubt, although it is biased, the FBI repeatedly is a liar. I think the film was a major contributor to re-launching the new investigation into the incident in 1999. The result of this new investigation was somewhat predictable, the verdict relied solely on the fact that the gray was presented to the same as the Davidicians. I was very disappointed about the verdict, because as far as I know it is not covered by false, false information and proofs of the FBI and other officials. Why did not anyone judge the Texas Ranger investigators to stop the activities? Why not allow them to pollute crime scenes and bulldozed compounds right after the incident? These questions were not given to the government. Most importantly, what about the children? In this new investigation, I was not responsible for the dangers of burning the gas that is responsible for spraying the CT blazing tear gas and I did not find any answer because of the contraceptive gas due to the muscle impact of the children, when they were alive. If they did, I certainly think that Genet Reno or those who were in charge of the raid should be convicted of genocide or genocide. The question raised by Gazaki is not mentioned; Direct plan for the people and their tanks can cut holes and burn the building with bricks? (A plan that was completed with 112% functionality), or was the discrepancy of the charge officials, that they were aware of the consequences of their actions? Both are equally scared Even if the Davidsons set the compound fire, the officials must have given them the opportunity to work. If officials are charged, as they claimed, the Davidsians would set fire to the composite fire, why? Tanks cut all the holes inside the building, and why did they know that they did not have plans to deal with the fire? The darkest questions still will not go, the final and most relevant issue of this movie is demonized by the government of Davidson through media, which only feeds it publicly. I clearly remember the feeling that I felt for the bad davidsians I saw in CNN in 1993. Now I grew up when they could see a clear line of communication coming out of the government while preparing for the massacre of citizens. With aim aimed at Demonizing people with words like; "They have many illegal value", "they do not enjoy freedom" and "they are our threat of freedom and living", making them so easy to kill ????
