The details of Big Trill were so incredible that I felt that the film was created during the presentation. I have not seen that wagons so real! They were big, loaded with accessories, and they were meant to never see that the canvas cover was felt even with the details covered. Every splash of dirt, each scratch, each had splinter. Modern day computer technology can not revive the view of many wagons as they can save Indians from land or circle. Wagons were all real, separate vehicles, each with its own horse or oxen's own team. <br /> <br /> Actor's clothing can not be felt more realistic. According to the exception of John Wein's Bunkkin party and the beautiful dress of Margaret Churchill, the clothes were looking, bursting, or dirty at a real search. Many actresses and actresses were common to electricity and before the indoor plumbing, and they must feel comfortable with the surroundings. All Indians were real Indians rather than white tones. <br /> <br /> The women in the old West were strong because there was a lot of work. In each scene, Wagon shows the work of the train, showing women, wood cutting, logos etc. are shown. This fact was so natural that it did not come in the form of a statement instead of women's role of the day. Survival is true. <br /> <br /> Revenge and romance plot are going well. Nothing is excessive or overplayed. <br /> <br /> Some of the ways in Hollywood were lost in the 1930s. As much as I love the fake scenes and regulated environments of old movies, the big trill guides them to be realistic than everything else. The more I see the big budget movie of the silent era, the more I like them. I can remember some of the films of the 1930s, which I saw in parallel to the greatness of the 1920's. If there were films made in wagon trains, then what would be the big trill they look like.
