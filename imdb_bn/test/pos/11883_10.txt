Critters ranked as one of the 4th greatest film of the twentieth century. The term classic has not been used so accurately to describe this mind-blowing epic. I agree that the best of the original cretre series, but the cluster of stops of the space station that Critters 4 sets should really be believed. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing one of the main film landmarks of the twentieth century.
