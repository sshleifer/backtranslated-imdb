For me, this was another movie that I had to stop when I was shown the Los Angeles-based "Z" channel service. And when I was young it was another movie ... and I knew that there was a world ... I did not want to accept one. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Los Angeles and became a felicitation fame and fame to see international movies, no Premier Channel programming matches the "Z" channel in the international film scene. Three international film "Spatterors", "Beau Para" stuck on my young soil and of course it is "Pixot" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> life. It was one of the first movies I could understand that there is a difference in movies: entertaining and informing. Let me be honest ... grow up in a small town on the east coast, I did not understand anything like this - this amount was existed. What I knew from South America was the brochure of Brazilian Holidays and Colombia's many drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Then comes a film like Pixot. Sad Stress. Unexpectedly Scary You are watching: Children. Those who want shelter, love, understanding and all these things, they have the means of living in the day-to-day lives of drugs, sex, robbery, theft, sleeping on the street and homeless group homes. It is difficult to meet their surviving other street children. Prostitution, etc., and you start to think how such things can be done on this earth. <br /> <br /> Pixot is not a movie to entertain, it's a movie. It shows frustrating and annoying images - but it shows life for these everyday street children.
