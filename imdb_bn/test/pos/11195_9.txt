Nuri Billyz Cillan's 2002 film Destant (Wuzak) - his third feature film (his first 1997 black and white small town Kasaba) was a significant step in his good but flawed 1999 Claude of May (Mayis Siquetics). The previous movie was possible, but a small budget and improved qualities were revived in the worst possible way - the holes of the plot and the timber from the amateur. May Cloud of May is going to be successful at any stage, as the cinematic talent of filmmaker. However, Distant is Ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one who has other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (though his screenplay is not as loud as the conversation-heavy it is brooding, and he has Bergman's lack of tendency for close-ups - His shots are exterior and long shots for medium shots for exterior and) Yasujio Ozu (whose sharp scenes for Ceylon Reconstruction) . Most of the film takes place in the snowy Hebronnial Istanbul (this might surprise some of Turkey's surprisingly), which gives the film a definite Bergmanian feeling, as well as reminds of some of the worst snowy city scenes of the Kitzlov Kislowski. Decalogue Natural images reveal Warner Harzug's best ways - because they are forced to go for another beat or two long-term than the standard film-that will make them more memorable, the urban landscapes, almost ancestral works of Michellejo Antonioi, toward Woody Allen's cultural musical - near Manhattan From a bench on a bench A direct quote misses (read steal), to save the background of Brooklyn Bridge. In another scenario, Sillon likewise quoted famous shot of a ship at a port in Ojuru Tokyo Storyi. Yet, like all great artists, Sillan changed his own will to a little bit his own art and kept his film's spontaneity intact ?? Distant is a film whose title suffers characterization in film and some viewers will be on their side, but it does not describe the film itself, because having a long stay for the stay with the movie ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene in the film and the image when Mahmut Istanbul calls on his former wife at the airport and he sees his new husband that he will be forced to fly on the plane, which will permanently remove him from his life. From far away, to see him, we see him watching him with an eye on him. She will leave her husband Mahmud? Not in this picture. He pulls behind the back of a column, and the Nazin only turns his future back to his head. Mahmut is his past, and he knows how best to transfer - just keep going. Mahmut will never get it. Most rarely get their insights such as moments of life. The viewers who get the film, and will have the power to create a cigarette, show that ignorance can teach, until it continues. Remote, right at the right time though.
