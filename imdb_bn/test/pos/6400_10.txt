I think that "key west" could do as well as a DVD. Probably there are many failed star tracts that did not have the chance to succeed. We do not know if this could be a great series. Do I have a way to see such old shows or would they just know that there is another Hollywood footnote? Is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we can trust faithful peers again? The show was a great writing talent and some episodes were left without a feeling for the letters that you missed today's hits. I have often come up with a sense of learning from the story line and are very modest, very unique characters. Thank you.
