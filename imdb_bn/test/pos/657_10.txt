I saw this picture in the first 1980 and it touched a cord that reminded me more silent times. Norman Rockwell's first opening, music, and images set the voice for me. Do you like the movie or hate it. John Michael Vincent portrays his best and CPL Merion headgrip in the most innocent and tactical way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorite, it is not a shame that it is not available on DVD or VHS. The end was also wonderful. John Hankak did a great job of understanding the time.
