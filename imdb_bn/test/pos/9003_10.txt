First of all, I do not know much about rugby, although I think the rugby-view of this movie is interesting but it can be a game and I think I have enjoyed it as much. It's not good for me like rugby or bad. <br /> <br /> This story is based on the real facts that happened in the last 30 years. Highland Rugby Club. Like coach Gelix Coach, every guardian wants to like their children, who thinks of a person more than sports (although they have won 17 national championships and have lost 9 games for more than 30 years!). The more I learned about the coach and the team, the more I liked this movie and its message. <br /> <br /> I saw other sports movies that looked great, but I only searched it for detailed search. Most movies were 10% true and 90% were fiction, 10% of the events were overwhelmingly exaggerated. Not so with forever firm. It may seem too good to be true, but it's so surprising about that. It was imagination, it would be an enjoyable story and something more. Instead, the film is inspirational and you want to be a good person. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie due to some critical reviews by these critical critics. I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have been given terrible reviews of the movie. These are usually annoying about the same critics who are mostly hate people. In fact, I would be worried because of some good reviews of some of these critics because I often disagree with their views. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and post your review (positive or negative)! Most of the viewers of this audience are currently encouraging (here and Ratane Tomatoes and similar sites) and I am interested to see whether this trend is continuing. Thanks!
