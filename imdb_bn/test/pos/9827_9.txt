I really enjoyed "Random Heart" I was surprised to see such a low rating in IMDB, but a boy turned up the Gout. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit that he was ill in this movie and I gave it nine instead of 10. But Christian Scott Thomas was just wonderful. She was believable and beautiful, although she was crying for a few days like making the movie half-movie. "Shuffle heart" has been good? Of course, but it's seen as a lot of value.
