When I first bought this movie, I was skeptical about it, though Cast was quite impressive. But after watching it, I'm really sorry for spending money. Actually, I want to cut it again and again in these movies. .... Humor, drama, thriller and irrational combination of big questions. It makes a great movie just what it is. OK, some may not enjoy what they see, and after some time it may even stop it. Your loss This is a great way to deal with the things we are going through in a way or the other, and the character that you think will not enjoy the company throughout the film, you'll actually come to love a little later. Anyone open mind, and a sense of humor and living - watch this movie, I promise you will not be disappointed!
