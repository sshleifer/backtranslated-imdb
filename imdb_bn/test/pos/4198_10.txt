This is a movie where it is easy to see that some people will not like it. My wife never seen it, and when I re-run it last night, I waited till I went to bed. He might have been surprised by some small snippets, but I knew he was enough within ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There is nothing like a conventional story on the head. The film is strongly leakage in the cyclical period. It can be briefly seen as a filmistic spirituality or as a postmodern acid trip through the film general. Psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and "acid trip aesthetic" (assume there is a difference between them), you probably do not have a big fan of things that should stay away from this film. On the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff, but if you do not already have it, you will need to run out now and buy head now. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, the film never received much respect. That's probably a lot with preconceptions. Finally, it was a music group starring together with Star de Monks - Mikey Denzen, Davey Jones, Michael Neasith and Peter Tark - and Monks Producer Bob Rafelson and Bert Scendor together, it's a children's friendly, bubble- for a television series Gami Beatles In their era, new children were respected to them in menus, blocks, spice girls, etc. A fellow IMDB reviewer correctly notes - "Perhaps in 1968, Man, refusing to see Manciss (Head) as a pop belt rip off made of a stupid factory in Bakles." <br /> <br /> Monkees and Head have not been able to run that negative public perception. This is shameful, because Moni was quite talented and talented. Perhaps Raffles, who gave instructions here and cooperated with Sendara and decided to accept Monkey on this unusual aspect, Jack Nicholson (yes, _that_Jack Nicholson), who wrote the script and co-produced it. This new children of the block suddenly released the same album of Pink Floyd's Umamaguma (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). Indeed, the songs of the headache written by The Monks, and often like collaborators such as Carol King and Harry Nilsson, are in the middle of the Sid Barrett era and the Post Barat era Floyd-like quality. It is much more prominent than a Beatles match. Some people complain about music in this movie, but to me, all the songs are gems. In that case, some people dislike the Barrett era (or other) Floyd, which is so hard to surrender with me. <br /> <br /> But what _is_ head? The fundamental issues are that Moni is traveling in a series of films - war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenery, drama scene, western scenes, science-watching, romance scenes and more. Except for the reality of the film, it is primarily on studio lots (if not exclusively). Root, we're watching a movie shoot The Monkees. Of course, the scenes of different styles have some weird and self-referential information about them, and they and each other in the scene directs to each other using separate logos, which are not different from the Monty Python television show. As a dream, the head sprouts between a good dream and nightmare, while often you can laugh in sleep (which I'm going often). <br /> <br /> Technically, Rafelson used different techniques to realize above. There are scenes with massive negative images, there are a lot of quick cuts (with a great order, which dances together Davey Jones and Tony Basil with the white and black cells, and mixing white and black mixed mixture in each, sometimes two frames are fast and in front ), There are many malicious seagulls, there is an animated cow face, Ad In this way, the device is prepared to edit. For my money, I do not want this thing to be a residual of the cyclical era. This is the kind of artistic method I style. It takes like a good idea again and I still think it's a good idea. I would like to see films like The Life Acoustic using Steve Jeisu (2004) using such incremental techniques. Now that the film must be surreal. <br /> <br /> Interpretationally, those who did so in tune with acid trip aesthetic have complained that it basically bs.s. Give something intended for doing something. I do not agree with such a dull / nihilistic view; The meaning of the head was for many purposes, and it is not just a film without conventional plot which has more than one interpretation. Nicholson, Raffleson and Scendor have many interesting topics to talk about in The Monkeys - the film postmodernly comments on the situation they created; Pop Starder - The way before the Pink Floyd, the head pop starred and violence, destroys their statues from the images of the fight from the image of the war; And uninterrupted US based ideas of international perception and respect - Disciplined foreigners in the desert surrender to Mackie Dolenz because he is an American, then he blows the coke machine (again in the desert) for him because he is thirsty and can not gain access. From the big industry to police, surveys, visitors (especially related to tragedy), and many others - this movie comments on other topics. Heads are intelligent for their ideas, many good things with good creators, just enough. <br /> <br /> The head is worthy to be considered as a classic - it is essentially shooting for the same VB like the Beetles yellow submarine. Both were interesting enough in the premiere of November 1968, and both cyclic aesthetics were intended as briefly for something. Yellow submarines were not quite successful. All of the heads should have been yellow submarine.
