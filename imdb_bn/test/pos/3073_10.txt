If you do not like Mel Brooks, you do not like this movie. That's a given I do not know why anyone would love his movie, but avoid those who do not see the light. <br /> <br /> Everyone else: This is a classic. The whole cast is perfect: Care Elves is a shaky, clever, british Robin Hood, a perfect maker, as Amy Yasbek Marian, Richard Lewis, his usual confused, boring self, Roger Race Fluster, and a brilliant combination like Marcin. Sheraton of Rottenham, and Dave Chapel, Eric Alan Kramer, Mark Blankfield, and sadly included Matthew Brorta's Perfect Mary Maine <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here, But why do you want to change its style if you do so well? The pop culture references of this movie are old to be old to be fun ... at least 16 years old. It's a complete and utter parody, a game for a smile every second. Some of them do not work, but most, and better. I saw the picture for the fifth and sixth time the new joke was discovered! <br /> <br /> Of course, if being barred by a strong visual and oral mess is not your style, you do not like it. It's not the Academy Award winner, it's Mel Brooks. What do you know when you get into it. If you want to keep nonstop smiles, surprisingly developed letters, and lifestyle choices, see this.
