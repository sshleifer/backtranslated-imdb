Is torture ever correct? No answer is easy and absolute with no qualification possible. The reason for showing this film is the dominant torture on society. Through the revolution and struggle of many centuries, the standard of hard struggle in Western society is allowed to live in a free and open society of all men and women. One is where people are treated equally and with respect to their necessary rights as humans. To protect this society, organizations have been developed to work fairly, fairly and honestly for doing wrong. This organization has been selected and respected by hard work. Someone might argue that these are all of us, as the real basis of democracy, to allow us to listen. If we commit undemocratic, inhuman work in our name, if we share our society with their rights and who do not, then we will undo the work of our ancestors. Moreover we all are complicit and all are guilty and tainted. We accuse that there is no gravity or no importance. We are defined by our attitude and our response.
