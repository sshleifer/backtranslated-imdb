These critics need to find a new job !!! This movie was based on the real story, which made history. It nicely portrays that even the fog of the war and the tragedy can win even all of the love. Exciting Chefonia in Greece holds my heart and soul so that I was there too. Blue eyelashes and colorful cruise were amazing! Together they have fully described how the Mediterranean can be close to war only during the war. This movie will touch your heart like you did it, you will definitely see it !!!!
