I enjoy reading the user's opinion as much as watching the movie! It seems that it is classic "love it" or "hate" movies. And I want to say that I'm not just beside "love", I said it's my favorite movie, always to say! I thank the sky in the first place. It is almost impossible, I was lucky to record it on a fortunate UHF channel about ten years ago. Of course, my vendor's preferences can make me a little favorable, but I do not see any blanket, with a good wishes (like me) nobody can love this flick. The plot is great (but perhaps the previous poster said, maybe this is not a well-known movie ... why the medical field is bad?) Acting is great (I can see why some acting was horrific .. but this movie has been so great that ... it is fairly Convincing) and humor gesture. I'm proud to say that this image is not about 20 times less and it is very nice to remember almost every line. This movie is gifted !!
