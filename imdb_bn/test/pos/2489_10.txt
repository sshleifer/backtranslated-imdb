Penalty park movie is a bright piece. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two groups of prisoners follow (one <br /> <br /> was sentenced to another) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Park (being hunted by locals <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A live action training <br /> <br /> ground). I can not say enough about this movie. Sometimes it seems <br /> <br /> If you are watching a real documentary. This is Peter Watkins's most <br /> <br /> accessible movies. I advise you to look for it. You do not regret it! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend <br /> <br /> A <br /> <br />
