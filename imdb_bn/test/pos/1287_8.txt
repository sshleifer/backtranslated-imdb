I just finished watching the followings and I thought it was great. I gave 8 out of 10 rating. I am planning to see it again with the director's comment and then again in the chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of my fascination for Christopher Nullan's recent movie Memento. The following are some similarities; This movie was probably Blueprint for Memento. Even in some parts the music is the same. <br /> <br /> It's a mysterious feeling to shoot the movie in black and white. The stories and dialogues are really good. Actor's performance is credible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nalan made the film really low budget. I look forward to his next release InSomania, my favorite actor Al Pasino, for a big budget movie.
