This picture is just plain beautiful. It's as fun as hell and old as the mountains. Acting is supernatural and it is interesting to see after Britain in the war, and how we behaved that day. It is considered to be a pre-runner of St.Trinion movies (with the connection of Alastar Sim and Margaret Rutherford - there are many George George in St. George's Calls) but I do not understand the connection. Recently the biography of St.Trinion creator Ronald Serre was shown on BBC4, but I missed enough biographies to miss the connection with this photo. Anyway his own right is a great film and something that should be preserved for all the time!
