"Riffey" is an awesome hit movie, and since the next hijsted films have been drawn since then. These thieves of Zeus Dasin had a feeling for the underworld resident - you will not find the Hollywood Glamor of the "11th ocean" here. Robbers of "Riffey" are not hiding for the thrill, and they are not playing a game. They looted for survival, encouraging themselves and others to encourage their children to prove that they can still give something to the world. A much more acclaimed Haest scene is a nail beater depicted in visible silence. I had the feeling that this plot has been going on for a little longer than necessary, but the classic movie that ends in reaching its mother in high speed competition is classic. <br /> <br /> Be careful - this movie is very inferior. But it's very good. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
