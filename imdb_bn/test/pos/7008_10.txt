Most of the films that hit the horror of excessive terrain have ended due to the cheap imitation of the 'Alliance' series, the pitch black stands as a fine part of Saifai and almost the best movie Perhaps my favorite aspect is light. This film works in the light of many different colors, shadows and intensities, which sets the mood and lends itself to the film's own unique feeling, which is usually different from the 'normal' movie lighting. Bin Diesel brings his character to life in a wonderful way, to avoid the ruthlessly scrupulous ritual screenplay of the criminals. Finally, the film is about the personal journey of radix (diesel), so thanks Vin does not exclude the ball. The rest of the cast (with talent and gorgeous Claudia black exceptions) was unknown to me but turned all the wonderful performances, animating different characters with unique quirks and approach. Pitch Black is a perfect example of creating a great movie about the wealth of a huge budget. Special effects are high enough, but at the same time they do not focus solely on high budget blockbusters. This is a great movie because it is telling a medieval story of using science fiction instead of using science fiction as a medium of storytelling, provocative storytelling.
