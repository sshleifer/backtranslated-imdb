I found this one movie best for this time and era. The cast was very exceptional and it was most entertaining to see. I want to show this film to my senior generation, but I did not find or see the movie in the past. My first visit came back in the early sixties and I was looking for it for everyone. The film shows me how far we are going to be gifted in a crafts where we can only play a meaningless role in acting as a BFF and a servant. <br /> <br /> Puppy and base showed some urban life around me, because I saw that time where my strong firm male role model was needed. The singer and actress spent me playing part of the character of this wonderful movie.
