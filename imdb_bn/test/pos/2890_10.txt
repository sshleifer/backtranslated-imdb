Rush in Rio is simply an amazing DVD. This concert is one of the final moments of Rush's history and they provide their music brighter and more powerful than before. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to be on this concert, in the first phase, I grabbed the gate which separates the audience from the stage !! This is the first and only time I saw a live concert live and it has become a dream come true for me. I have no words to correctly describe this experience, but I can tell you that this is one of the main issues of my life. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about the sound of this DVD that it is not very clear and smooth, but the sound you hear is real, what the concert was like is true. It's raw and strong and so genuine that when I see it I go back and revive that beautiful moment. Many artists have recorded live shows and then they make many tickets, so the final product is actually far from the actual concert. Of course you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished word but you do not get the actual thing. This is not the case with Ryo, it is the real deal! I acknowledge that I enjoy that fancy vocabulary concert DVD, I like music and the word is a very important aspect, but it refreshes it by listening to a concert which is very honest. You hear live sound performance in live performance, no tactics, no tweaks directly. This is a real live concert DVD <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Ryoet Route, the set list is fantastic and JD, Alex and Neel's performance blown. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love the rain and sing along with each melody, YYZ is even an instrument !! I actually appear singing twice; In Tom Sayyar, I sing "Always optimistic yet uncomfortable" and I sing in Arthritis "It's Reflected Only" It was just a few seconds but I could not believe my eyes only when I saw a crowded DVD !! O of non-SM-fold!! I hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the world's greatest band.
