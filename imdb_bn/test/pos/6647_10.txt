I do not recall a movie that reflects the psychological destruction of the war, as reflected in single marital relations. The center of the film is the union between Olman and Von Saido - each scene has two. Through the film, they experience the transformation of a role - one of the survival strengths and the other is emotionally escaped through dreams. Both humanity will lose a measure, but a greater degree than one. Characters and viewers go through a growing period of close relation - the camera pulls away, the word disappears, the words are lost, only for the camera it can go back to its sensual stars painter bands. Confusion and extravagance can make this movie difficult for some viewers, but it is all motivated under Bergman's master hand. I think the use of a "fake" war has made the film shameless, as relevant today as it is today, and focusing on human relations through war, making the movie relevant to everyone. Can be someone to pair. The film is not grounded or the time is grounded, rather the emotions. Unlike any other, a unique and effective battle film. Bergman's films are commendable in presenting human relationships - that he will be able to bring it into a war film.
