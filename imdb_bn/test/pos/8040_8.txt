It worked! Director Christian Duguie created a very clever action / spy thriller. Actor Donald Sutherland and especially Eden Quinn played the leading. It is so sad that we can not see Edin Quinn in any other movie so far. He only played the best role he earned for Oscar as Ramirez / Carlos. The picture was very beautiful. The scene is quickly packed from start to finish, and the story does not allow you to get annoyed. The movie is very intrinsic and I recommend it to someone else otherwise you will miss something great. Trust me, do not be frustrated. That's why I give it 9/10.
