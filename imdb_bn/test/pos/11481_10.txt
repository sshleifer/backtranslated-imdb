There was a video in America that was known as 'cartoon scandal', which was worth about one hour banned cartoon. <br /> <br /> Most of them were in WWII era. This is the first place I saw (and heard). <br /> <br /> During the open news broadcast, the rooster has turned into a lane with an Asian face saying 'cock-a-doodle-do please.' Then it ran an 8-minute campaign. <br /> <br /> Clearly, racist but it can be forgiven (and should be) seen as part of history. <Br /> <br /> Slicing ration cards for sandwich creation <br /> <br /> The remains of Rome are being telecasted by Mussolini Rui # 1. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An intelligent bomb with a pilot is saying, 'Find me here.' <br /> <br /> And of course, stereotyping. Every Japanese was pulled with big teeth, continually bowing, and saying 'grace' at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> Interesting bit? Searn attacking two samples of men by pushing each other with a pine. "Oo-woo" <br /> <br /> Hey All. Let's put this one out. It deserves notice. My wife laughed at And she is 100% Japanese.
