I could not believe that adult swimmers came with this character. I just laughhed for thinking about this show Finally I've seen the pilot I guess I'll be surrounded for a few episodes. Asi is quite funny and around the character of the whole crew of police, but Asi was difficult to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most comedians revolve around the fact that the title character is literally nothing but a walking donkey, but the holes in the legs and socks with the feet play with the conventional wing tips. Asi drank too much and "you play according to your rules" as you have guessed. The only other fun moments Assi's many, shooting many people and spending time at home - the bathroom. It's not funny at Squidbillies, but it's worth a look.
