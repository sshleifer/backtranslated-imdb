I just wanted to let anyone know who was interested in being interested in the "My Jersey Drive" movie always my personal favorite. I appreciate the work of this movie from Nick Gomez and Spike Lee, a wonderful composition. This film had a great impact on me because of its realism and description of life in urban New Jersey. It has personally hit me badly because I grew up like friends painted in the film. It made an impression with me because I used to spend tin some years ago, so some letters were kept "real". Occasionally, this movie looked like a documentary because you did not know whether these true facts were happening. Though the movies "Boys in the Hood" and "Men's 2 Society" attract more attention, I personally feel that these films were "extended" to appeal to the larger audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an incompatible part of the "your face" reality. Lee and Gomez covered every detail in this urban drama music, dress, violation and location. Actors acted as "actors" compared to some of the films I mentioned earlier. There was no compromise to create a good "theater". The only misfortune to come from this movie is that many are "sleeping". I hope looking forward to working more from Nick and Spike in the near future.
