The well-known Czech director and writer co-founder Peter Zarksky is extraordinary for his specialty but his story is boring and confusing. Robert Graves took his theme and title from poetry, trying to survive and save his two children who are related to a few men and some overwhelming relatives of his life with a woman, 15-year-old Lukinie (Michael Michivova) and little blonde Asturias Cuba (Adam Missik). Many of the proofs of poetry, but the theme - it is a little lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> In Prague, in the flood of 2002 and there is nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they like in their small apartment Lusina and Kiba, with revenge in front of the telly, will have to hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek embarrassed or liked such explisitness and skates at shock edges. There is no good explanation in the right way, but financial disappointment has led Zardari to process the stolen vehicles in the big garage, which is connected to its flatbed. His car-thief coat runs a fur volvo, easily leaving Benazes (Joseph Abram) in his butterfly while leaving his own property. Bains is a super nice guy, but no fool. His Volvo is stationed for tracking by this type of satellite, and as a result the police goes straight to the Jordanian garage and he and his assistant go to jail. <br /> <br /> "The beauty of the trouble goes away to the good angel, on whom he can rely on," the poet's poem begins. But in reality this Freak takes Marcelo to Benice, when he meets with the police station. He introduced him to Sushi and how to drink alcohol and introduced him to a photo book about Tuscany, where he was a lovely villain after Prague's birth and spent most of his life. He is here to recover the house of Prague, where he occupied a couple with an old and weaker soil, whom he allowed to stay. Jinnah does not prevent him from going to jail, although every gesture in Benise is brilliant, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brzechowa) and Zenner's current husband, less harmonious companion than the harmful diabetic Richard Hirsta (Jiri Schmidz) - for those who have committed their sin by eating dietetic cookies for the kids, Jeremy Schmayeger has hijacked the movie at the moment, and it does not allow it to go quite a bit. Even in the final scene, he is an image of learing danger. Surprisingly, Richard does not torture one or both of the sex children in sexual abuse. He insists that Marcela must come out of his own, and when Richard proposed to take him under his wing, Richard became an unlikely ally. Impossible - probably impossible. Why should Benis love him? But then what is the whole story of Benix? The film gives a lot of information about some things and is not enough for others. <br /> <br /> Clearly "good angel," Ben's impossible kind - and a polished, handsome young man, whose behavior enjoys his Italian enthusiasm. In the end, when he pushed his people to the border through the devastating inhabitants of Prague, he proved that he would not lie and he would not walk. <br /> <br /> Zardari will also have to deal with religious lady Shenya (John Brajchova), and look forward to seeing his interactions with Zdane and Richard. But he just does not increase the deck which is another wild card. <br /> <br /> The poem is set in the lyrics in a Czech translation and the first was played in a small scene, performed on the screen by the actinist-singer Ruduza, then Zarda and Car Thief Pal in a more extended prison. If you respect Hughz as an outsourced person you can enjoy this sequence; Otherwise it seems gratuitous. There are also several songs from the Oscar-awarded Irish musical film 'Once,' by Glenn Hansard / Market Eglossa, followed by the song "Falling". They feel more than ever because of their contact from 'Once' - although this movie came first. <br /> <br /> People of Heerbeek are being arrested; Even Koba Koba has the wealth of Shakespeare's children and common wealth; But the director and his writers seem unable to prevent temptation to spread digress and dilation. Property feud can be beneficial to show its tough side of Benin's endurance. But such a massive protest was not needed. Acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the fundamental theme of love, sex, and money is lost and conflicts of Marcela and how he lost their solution is never lost. After going to Tuscan with Bens and his children, there is no solution and truth to the theme and grave poems as there is a hot sex with Zarda with Marcela during Prague's re-review. But there is a lot of questions about what should be done about the abusive Richard or Zarda's nervous holy mother (Emilia Vassirova). Suddenly how do we know that a letter from Koba being sent to "India" has been received from his father, who are? When does that come? Interesting descriptions, quick paste. This is a world where you can not see the forest for the trees.
