The movie adaptation comes from the book when I would say the BBC rarely gives me down. Now about this mini series. I love Sterling Novel, it's the best kill / mystery I've ever read. Mini series, it's defiantly made my day when I saw it The initial story is kept close to completely intact. Characters match with the novel very well, personality and methods were spotlight for red and jazz. I think Dent Kate was done very well, Eric came far more than a simplified character, there was a little depth in his book, but he changed his sub-story so that he could deal with it. Of course there are changes, but most of the cosmetics, but I have become frustrated, sub-stories have been changed with Eric's murder, and the whole mobility has changed in Red and Eric for the film, and they are spending Triathlon training jazz. Some other book events change viewers to be friendly. If you like the book, you would like it, if you like the mini series, then you like the book. I must say that this is the most accurate book of movie adaptation.
