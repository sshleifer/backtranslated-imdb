I saw this movie in the "Art House" brief introduction of '69. I think it's so funny that I literally cut the part of the movie on the floor, being very disappointed I fell from my seat. After several years, I think it was made by Melvin van Pieblues. When I mentioned it to a friend, he said, one of his friends, Donny Sen, has played almost every non-acting role in Flickr: Director, Writer Producer, etc. He was certainly and my memories were wrong, this is that sometimes made funnies Without the movie one. The "Arab" part was especially worthless.
