Four of the stories about the drug business in Europe have been separated by these six parts. A businessman was arrested for drug smuggling in Germany and his wife tried to save his family by keeping her husband in illegal business. Meanwhile, the British Home Secretary traveled to Pakistan to discuss a support package which he hoped would stop the flow of drugs from that country. Even he did this though his own daughter heroin addicted succumbs, their family isolated. It was such a small thing that was based on American films and miniseries. The original is much higher than its two decendants. Third world poverty and depression are very well illustrated. It's stark, uncompromising and cruel.
