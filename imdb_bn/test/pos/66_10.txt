The first film came out for the first time and bought the soundtrack LP recording. I liked it very well, I went to see it many times .. I can not understand why it was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was beautiful in this movie, her voice was the top and Costume was beautiful! <br /> <br /> This picture has a little bit and although some scenes were a bit heavy, they were still fun. <br /> <br /> I recently discovered that I could get a copy of the DVD form and it gave the order ... I was disappointed that some songs and sequences of this movie were not included in the DVD version. I ordered.
