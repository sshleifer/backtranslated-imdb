Recently Norway was touring Norway in Norway and stopped the small town of Vaas in Norway and had a memorial in honor of Nus Rocken, who was born Vaas years ago. People are very proud to know from this day and tour guides stop at his monument. This film is a great history of this great personality and his great love for the note demeve never realized that Naun's chemistry and laboratory science have such great talent and has been chemistry for years and simultaneously trained by the football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Zip (The Zipper) who was a great football player; Reagan had a small role, but this film gave a great support role. Donald Chris, (father John Kahahan), was as wonderful as the priest, who always believed in Nietu throughout the lifetime of the note. This is a great classic movie and will be seen by many generations. Enjoy.
