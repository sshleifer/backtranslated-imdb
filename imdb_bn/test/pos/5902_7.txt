This is sometimes not the best Canadian movie, IMO I do not get track and name 3 or 4 well. Just a few nights ago I saw "Bicycle Thief", which is high quality in Italian classics, and some parallel. Both filmmakers shot and shot their film with specific time and specific locations with the help of cast and perspective. And in either case, the result is realistic, realistic and attractive for characters and a joy. The lingering shots on the face and landscape make this value almost his own observer. That said, this is not quite the same in the same league as Italian classic. Suddenly, the movie shoots Quebec asbestos in the barbarous Quebec city. This intensity is contrary to human warmth and filmmaker Claud Shawr. Basically, what you get is the nostalgic memorabilia of Jutra - which is not a hacker, ridiculous - but harmful, and probably from time to time, but now it is hot with nostalgia patin. Movie mandurs; Have a little tension. Nowhere about half-two-thirds start stories through stories. The people you met at the moment are involved, and you know these letters rather well; So have a little patience at the beginning. The story is a good one; It will think of you and it will include all basic elements of sex, love and death. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, all types of these types, then you will not be disappointed.
