2001: A Space ODC <br /> <br /> Is this an advert? An account of human history? Looking for the failures of people to fail to advance the advancement of technology technology? Is it about the brittle balance of time and space? Evolution is a lesson? Or it displays a spectacular effect; A picture Kubrick simply shows us the unlimited possibilities of motion pictures and presents the truth to us that the pictures are stronger than words? <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space ODC is all about this. One of the most explanatory movies ever made, is that instead of watching it, the plot of the film is divided between plot and more fun to divide and discuss events. But it is open for discussion deliberately; If Kubrick explains the meaning of his wonderful 1968 classic (# 22 on AFI's list of the 100 Greatest Movies of Today, my personal 21st favorite movie? Currently, and 4 Academy Awards are nominated for: Director, Original Screenplay, Art Direction, and The visual effects which won it) have lost half the attraction, its complexity, and a good part of the value of its movie. We will only be left with technical expertise; Which itself is worth appreciating. <br /> <br /> Because each shot is valuable to watch time. And there are plenty of time. 2001 is very elegiac, and is coolly remotely; Isolated Although the unique visual experience of emotional remoteness and slow pace provide perfect respect; Beginning in the beginning of 2001 with the original ancestors of mankind, who upgraded the planets and toolmakers after the invention of a huge monster in the middle of their desert house from planetary missile, then (the most inspired jump-editing bone in bone photo history) is similar to the astronauts moon The object has been discovered and the space traveler Following the crew of the discipline, following the sequence of the space, after the merge sequence, transferring it to an airplane, transferring it to an air and becoming a satellite. Their incredible computer, HL, who tries to rob the shuttle and kill the crew, eventually the only surviving person can die, grow, and die through a space and time (that drug-induced colors probably give a hazy shock in the days of hippies), and a "star baby" To be reborn. Kiss <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> HL Destruction. The crew's final explorer closes the machine, the red light is danced in the holy aurat. Kubrick is always used as a repetitive form, HAL singing a beautiful melody, it is a strange emotional experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Manage the film; His actors only provided extraordinary, extraordinary lines. The most famous being "open pod bare doors HAL"), satellites are often dancing in orbit with miraculous music and it is the inspirational shot of the world's first fear; Gradually it reveals the sun's shining, explosive, acting on the sound of the conquering horn. <br /> <br /> 2001 will always be a mystery, and there will be a rigid stand in the film's strong position: the scene is stronger than writing. This is one of the best and best directors of film history, whose unique aspect was always his own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> "Open PW Bay Gates HL" -2001: A Space ODC
