A warm emotional story from Walton's author. Someone had to make me material pitch, I would probably reject it as too maudlin. But here the drama runs a tear without the expected embarrassment. There was no lovable ditch in the 1950's, compared to Arthur Hunnicutt. Here his appeal is used as faithfully faithful to a faithful hunter, a mountainous man. Their luck is tied together as a human chain. Well I see a delicate environmental message here. All critters go to heaven, how can we condemn any poor devil that follows mere instinct for having a living. There is no deception in the state of animals and we still deal with them cruelly. This important message ensures that a strange pleasing period.
