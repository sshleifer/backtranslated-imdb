Chicky game with the process that simulates the death of cocky medical students, see a (hopefully temporary) next-life. Some plot twists and theme marks off a little, and the acting sometimes moves upwards. But the underlying message - about our real or perceived sin for forgiveness of God and others - positive and unique in the movie, and cast very well. The last sequence of Julia Roberts and her father is so effective that even after a few years of seeing this, I still think about it. Highly recommended.
