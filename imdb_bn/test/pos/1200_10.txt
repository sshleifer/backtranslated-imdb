The songs are fantastic and story lines are good. Like many other acting schools, mine also produced HAIR. For most hairstyles, it was a golden opportunity to work nude, but my production was fully dressed ... I do not think a full nudity of a movie or play guarantees artistic quality ... and the filmmakers have done so. Impressive climax development is great in movie versions with classic hits followed by each other. A great cast of actors, dancers and singers.
