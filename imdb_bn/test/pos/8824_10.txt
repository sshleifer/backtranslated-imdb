I saw this very emotionally painful screenplay and it was interesting. Williams's public and private face-to-face conflicts and its pressure were enforced as the ones who knew something about him would be surprised. Acting played fantastic, but Michael Shane was outstanding. I only realized when I saw the previous comment. In this role, I look completely physically different, the other role I saw him or saw myself. Williams's autobiography represented this photo as significantly different from its diary. The film can sometimes be boring because it causes emotional pain. However, it is a suitable experience and a film which can be highly recommended.
