After my personal research about the 2012 "last cycle" pending by the Mayan calendar system, I believe that as much as "what do we know about this movie?" While some may believe that top-level science subjects should only break such barriers in "Doctrine," "The Elegant Universe" at the doctorate level. The visual and dialog dialog makes it easy to understand the walk through the history of physics. There are numerous messages in this movie, in which the educational sciences should always be ready to correct what is being taught. Indeed, pure discovery science is beautiful because there is no courage if we dare to face "established" science.
