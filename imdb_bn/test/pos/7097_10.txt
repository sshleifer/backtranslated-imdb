This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. Again Frankenstein marked the star as Wolfman and Glen Strange as Lon Chaney. Oh yes, that's the carving John Carradine back to Dracula. I like every actor in this movie. I am especially Like Ansell Steven as Adelman. (It was made with 2N) I thought, heart-breaking doctors had a good idea to destroy yourself like a taboo. One view that I think is very good, when When Edelman thought deeply, he changed. Everything that's troubling you is flashing in front of him. No one is saying when the good doctor is saying yes to his bad side. The only reason I did not want to completely remove Dracula's character from this movie. I thought the Hacker of Frankenstein had no business in Dracula. If his character is taken out, do not miss him. In this film, the doctor's blood is contaminated with Dracula, his jacket and hed curse him. I hate John Carradine and I do not think he ever played Dracula. After the great Carloof Frankenstein monitors, other actors did not mind because they all worked well. But when they play another actor Dracula, it stops there. John Carradine He was so high and sturdy. They once gave him the role of Frankenstein's mind and he turned it down because he thought he was very trained. I could only portray Caradine if he had argued with The Monster about the director of the set, "I do not have to take it from you, I've done Shakespeare." John Carradine was not Dracula and he would not have. Sorry Jon, Bela Lugosi is the only and only Dracula. Thanks to God, they got Bela to return to Abbott and Castello with Frankenstein as Dracula. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. It does not disappoint you and you will enjoy it like others. This is a very good addition to giant movies. If you are a collector, make sure that it will not be left one. <br /> <br />
