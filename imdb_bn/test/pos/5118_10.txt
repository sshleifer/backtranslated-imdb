If I could decide which movie I decided to make the best, and that would not always happen without doing those things, but this would be the case. <br /> <br /> All the Ernest movies are entertaining, but the best ones are Jim Verney doing a number of different characters. In addition, I am known to enjoy Bill Steele and Gyleald Sartain's joke styling as Brother Chuck and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest Gayes to Jail" includes all those elements as well as a fun script and a supporter cast that combines many favorite character actors. <br /> <br /> That's why I've chosen "Ernest Goss To Gel", all of the Ernest Cinema King. If you certainly disagree with me, but deep you know I'm right.
