What do people expect when watching the movie in the Al Adamson? Are they hoping for a classic movie that will leave them with incredible and lasting memories beyond belief? You would think so by some reviews. Al-Edson's films are frustrating and chocky and cheesy, not so much, so if you go among them, it's already helped and they do not have to face them, especially when they have so much unrecognized entertainment value. First off, it starts off the music from the outskirts to the end, so that you think things are committed. While trying to increase the living in the mountains and raise the dead body, some stories of Waqo worship, the leader suffers from heart disease and end up in the hospital. Of course, the nurse Shery loses his needs and everything, and when the operation is needed, when he goes to the operating room, his soul attacks him. And the nurses begin to change Sherri. And good nurse, he develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are a few short story stories about trying to burn a blind-headed leader and blind dark football star that has become an object of love for one of the fellow colleagues. It's not bad if you're a movie fan of a movie, but it may be a "bad" fan if you do not want to like it. Occasionally it is "respectful" (for census), but it is "weird: with some ridiculous events." If you enjoy Adamson's movies and similar trash you can choose it, find someone else to find lost treasure, dig. 10 out of 7
