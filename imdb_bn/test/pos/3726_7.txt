Well, I think I was in the movies that really caught me from the beginning. This movie was not there. It was arranged along with the intentional speed for the first 40 minutes, but it was really not something that I was very interested in - a playful and mysterious conflict between the character of Jean Reno and an old man, but by some other first 40-minute main character casting Affected, about whom I did not know much and could not really be related to it. He is often walking alone, he does not show anyone; I'm thinking the director is trying to illustrate the loneliness of human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or anything else, which is all good, but I still want that it will be pruned for 40 minutes to 15 minutes because it can be incredibly annoying <br /> <br /> <br /> But after 40 minutes, things start to be very interesting. I guess I will not say anything more because I do not want to hide anything. So if you've seen the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking about closing it (just like I was), just stay with it - it gets better. <br /> <br /> My most interesting things about this movie were true that it was not a dialogue, I had to think about what was actually happening, how the characters were feeling and what their motivation was, why they did this post -Pocalipatic world, which gives a lot of room for the interpretation of all the stories. And it's amazing that the film is more convincing when the actors are not telling you exactly what's going on.
