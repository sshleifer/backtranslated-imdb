Although this movie started a little slowly, comedy gear came quickly. Three "teen girls" each offer their own credible, uniquely, strong and entertaining personality. I particularly enjoyed conversations and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If someone was going beyond the "act of belonging", then Keith's character considered Lisa "harmful" behavior sincerely. Followed comic development was drawn into the skill of my opinion. David Boryanens has given amazing performance like an adult man, which clearly gets more trouble than managing himself. The dialog was sharp, fast and pretty flowing. The director and writer of this film have clearly shown how the main characters claim all the sensibleness after taking over the moral highlands. Although the image is visible on the surface, it reflects an adult, all gray areas of human emotions and desires.
