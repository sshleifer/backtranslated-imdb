The remake of Alfred Hitchcock's "The Man Who Who Nee to Two Much" is not generally considered to be original, but it is one of the best movies for me. I like it on "hertgo" and "rear window". <br /> <br /> "Like the North Northwest", this is the story of a common man who is unwittingly thrown into the world of international conspiracy. James Stewart kidnaps a son's father because he is mistaken as an international spy. He will do something to get his son back and to protect his family. <br /> <br /> Although its time was real, it is difficult to see today's standards. There's a nice production quality of Remix, a favorite Doris Day, and a really vague villain. <br /> <br /> Do not disturb this rental because you want to over-over.
