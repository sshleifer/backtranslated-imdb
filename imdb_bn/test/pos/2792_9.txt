This evening my wife and I saw this wonderful movie because we will see the Russian doll tomorrow and the first to see the second is important. <br /> <br /> We both liked the apartment in Spaniya and followed some letters through the early era of their life - now in St. Petersburg, Russia. We are a little worried about the rough structure of both stories because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script was not completely foreign to our initial life. Our life was quite different, but with this movie you are going through the same way of living with young people, because people of a developed world will enjoy their same lifestyle. <br /> <br /> The public was confronted with personal problems and public issues, and in it the beauty of this movie, and perhaps its sequence will be seen tomorrow. As I wrote, these conditions are familiar to all of us as well, and so we can enjoy their life for a short time. It must be one of the great powers of the film-the experience of the people who are very involved with the emotional enthusiasm and still allow them to be neglected. The audience wanted to think through this distance, "I could not do anything that was stupid" or "I could avoid the trap." Maybe we go to the movie.
