It is the story of the three brothers gathered in hardship and hardships, and the real important things of life are family, love, faith and forgiveness. Full throttle manages to pull a strong performance despite a few lousy one liners. Life is a great movie for true fans of befalling the credible family. Also worth a look for Dermot Mulroney or Shan Astin fans. They are both a wonderful work, often bringing tears to you. Take my word for it and rent it today!
