There has been very few great comedy films in Hindi cinema history. Approximately, you can be one of them. This film is based on a very simple story of two poor young people (Amir and Salman), who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire daughter (Ravenna). Amir and Salman Khan tried to disturb each other and kiss Ravenna. Paarsh Rawal and Co. The plot continues to grow while planning all the resources. The movie is well-paced and very funny. Very rarely comes across a Hindi comedy which is both fun and intelligent. This is one of the few pictures of Amir and Salman together (probably the only movie), one of them. Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box office and we can not see a movie of this ability again. Amir Khan is brilliant in this film and proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a gentle intelligence. Rabina plays a strong role as a distraught rich girl, and Ravina's assistant / friend who is Curshmao funny Paresh Rawal, Junior Aziz, Shakti Kapoor, Dave Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsaniya just added the smell of this photo! Above all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I want them to make more quality films like this. Would you like to see this movie again and again? <br /> <br /> PS - For those of you who have seen this picture, I am also saying that round, silently silent, small beet, Narman garam, diamond ferry (old and new), etc.
