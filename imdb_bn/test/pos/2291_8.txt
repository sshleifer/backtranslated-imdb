I do not like this movie because Tom Celeck was in it, but it was a good story about baseball and it was also partly dramatic that any baseball player will face major league games after their time. I also enjoyed the cultural differences between American and Japanese baseball, and little information about how games are played differently. <br /> <br /> Overall, only a good movie rental is available on TV or winter winter. Be careful about the "dog day" of summer and know spring training is just a few months away. A good movie for a baseball fan and a good "date" movie ?? Believe me that one! * Blind the eyes *
