First, it is a romance film, where it seems that the girl loves the boy and falls in love, it seems that there is no other person like this movie. For the first time I saw it because I could not see it completely. Had to leave. But when I was walking I found it again, but then I had no chance. For a year I saw this movie on a free channel and I saw it and I recorded it. I've seen it once, twice ... not up until 200 times and do not have fun. I knew all the conversation in the heart and I do not know why I have seen every day and never got bored. And let me say that I do not use to watch more movies than twice. This work is very good. Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and Kathryn Higelo. I want him to stay in a good movie because I think he can do it. Unbalanced, this is a movie that I can not take out of my mind.
