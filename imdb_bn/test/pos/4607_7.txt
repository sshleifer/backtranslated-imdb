The best thing - and it's pretty good - it's a black and white fifty gothic possession of Black Castle, which was composed in 1952, which included a killer crazy count. This star is probably British actor Richard Greene, an able leader who reminds Roger Moore of the previous version. A crazy countdown by Villain Stephen McNally, he is said to laugh patiently without doing a credible job. Schooling around the shades is a long-known Boris Karloff, the perfect second role of an elderly doctor who may not be saved from our hero. <br /> <br /> It is determined in the mid-18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Green) to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared in the area around Count Carl Von Bruno (MacNally), a deep forest in the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends helped Von Bruno in Africa to defeat a brutal plan involving slaves and elephants three years ago. The count was not with the failure, but with his face and a black patch he now wore the cover of the debris. Von Bruno promised revenge, and it seems he has partially succeeded. So under a fictitious name, Sir Ronald arranges a hunting invitation from counting and we often travel through dark cyclones and travel to the cat's creek until the fortress. It is the stone's thumb and stiffness, the galaxy's staircase, the huge fireplace ... and the strange passages that make up the Dunk Dungeon Cells, the Torture Chamber and the snacking of a big hay, crocodile pieces. It has been found in the Fifteenth decade of the lovely, blonde, sensitive wife of the county, Elga (Palma Corde, who sometimes pays the bill as Rita Cord) and two close friends of Kant who are constantly poisonous. Costume, John White and Michael Ansar. A dangerous leopard victim, banned kisses, imitating the servants, growing signs of wood and cold air and poison slope in a cup. Not at least, Dr. Maisen (Carloof) is a drug-filled villager that fills a drug that slowly starts the function of the body's death. The risk is that ... well, when a person wakes up after ten hours, he will also hope that he has not already been addicted to his coffin. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, for all the cleanies, the black Castle is running gently. The film takes itself seriously, but it earns enough skill to maintain our interest, even if we are asleep, we are laughing. It is even cheaper to find a way to realize that the most dangerous game has strong echoes. When Battan realizes how crazy Von Bruno is, he is more firm to bring Brno to the accounts. And, naturally, he has fallen for Elga. Von Bruno, the madness by revenge is still sticky and capable, engorged by a man who loves the victims and murders. The second creative rule of Hollywood has always been, "If you're going to steal, steal from the best." This is the first creative rule, "If you are going to steal, steal from the best and then make it a leverworth." A great bite of Black Castle Austrian Braunschweig.
