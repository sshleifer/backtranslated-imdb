Successful as a single, single unit single out single solid. All departments are working on the perfect union for creating the most running human drama moving in the film. <br /> <br /> Respect for the production writer, producer, caster and crew combined efforts. But to name a few, Hugo Friedfar's superb score is a mystical surprise, the fine and striking paintings of Gregg Tuland and the incredibly effective direction of William Wyler's connection to the ideal cast for an American classic. <br /> <br /> A special treatment to see the DVD format version. How delighted it is to see "the best years of our life" and to be so well preserved for generations to enjoy.
