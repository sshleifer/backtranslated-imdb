I'm not a big fan of musical instruments, but I was always stupid about Mrs. Haven's appearance, so I thought I would try it. <br /> <br /> This can be the best showcase for multi. Meritorious May He was never looking at a boyfriend in a film (Potential exception of 'Gilda' where he was superior to sex symbol). <br /> <br /> Rita is much more than the support of Jean Kelly and Phil Silver. Comedy may date, but it's still quite fun. Kelly is one of her tour-de-force dances, dancing with her own image from a window. <br /> <br /> But Rita runs this whole movie. Otto Kruger and always wonderful, cute-cracking Eve does not hit Aden, it's a nice cast. <br /> <br /> Rita, Rita dance, looks pretty impossible! Music can be classic, but most tune tracks are quite tricky. <br /> <br /> I do a better job than this film 'Gilda', which I consider to be a faulty film. From Mr Hareth's credit, he is running 'Gilada', and Gilada runs a red bloody male madman. <br /> <br /> The film has been running well for all these years. An excellent bonus for many legs candy for the male audience!
