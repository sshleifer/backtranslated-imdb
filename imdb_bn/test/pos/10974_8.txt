No bullets, no secret agents, a story that's funny, fun, and trustworthy. Some of the producers / actors of this movie have seen in the theater. They take as attractive as individuals in their character on screen. You may not hear this movie with high-dollar advertising on TV but it must be verifiable. I had spent $ 8 for a movie ticket for many other movies that this was not entertaining. Looking forward to future projects by this production company.
