I watched this mini-movie when it was first broadcast, and liked it! It's fun to see how fun it is to see how many people will go to. It is interesting to see how much "whip" can be made to "lovers" to see how funny it is. Kill enough to "kill" I think cast was wonderful, especially the character of Christine. Without its smooth conversations, and catchy looks, the movie was not the same. <br /> <br /> I never used to see the United States but now it's my station <br /> <br />
