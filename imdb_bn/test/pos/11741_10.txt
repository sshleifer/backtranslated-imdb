Its spokesman William Holden is isolated, who loves a great Eurasian doctor Jessica Jones against Hong Kong's stunning backdrop. The film image on the hill next to Hong Kong is amazing. This story is based on racial tensions, mixed relations of society and additional marital issues. But what I like about it is the strong character of the heroine Jr., who is the heroic doctor, who was humble and strong in his greatest mission and loyal to his love. Nevertheless, he secretly married a higher ranking and got married to a married man and was admitted to the hospital. One day, William Holden was called in the Korean War and then he got the news of his death on that sick day. Last, of course sad, when I went to their hill, I cried. It was a very sweet love love affair. It defeats all intrigues, has been expelled from his job, how will his wife not divorce him, even though his love has fallen in love - they have experienced the love despite all. I personally do not believe in marriage, and it seems that she could not start something while she was tied up with someone else and she did not allow herself to happen, but despite the fact that it was a genuine film. I think the heroine threw the hero. Jessica Jones was proud and gave an extraordinary performance, though I thought it was weird that she did not rent any one with Asian Asian actress or Asian blood. I agree with one criticism, when Jessica Jones stepped out of the ground and quietly looked at William Holden while speaking, but now she brought me with her eyes. <br /> <br /> I found that this was the best film to be made before my birth, it seems like many Hollywood movie depths, lack of extraordinary performance and full stunt and heavy sex scenes. This is truly one of the greatest ill love stories in the film.
