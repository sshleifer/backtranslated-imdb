I was surprised how much I enjoyed. Sure it's moving in a slower speed, but what else would Rolin expect from? There are also lots of nudity, there is no mistake with it, especially it has a lot of gorgeous, Brigata Lahai. Some spectacularly erotic female dead, more dodgey bits, perhaps, but most effective. Finally there is a sci-fi story with a brief explanation, but I will not be very annoyed with it. No, there is still a living organism other than the most fascinating findings and memory losses and memories of our memory. Although my DVD is mentioned by David David Craneberg and it is probably not as good as his best movies, there are some similarities here, especially with the use of apparently visible mensing architecture and the useful and unclear use of the interior. As I tried to indicate that it is not a rising girl thriller, it's an impressive, nightmare movie that makes its position the most, in which there is a stunning rail setting in the end.
