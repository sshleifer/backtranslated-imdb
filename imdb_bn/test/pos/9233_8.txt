I'm not sure whether to talk about the television series, but on television where Lone Ranger has really made a name for himself. I'm not referring to the original radio broadcast of this mascaid rider. Plain, Aum is a point where a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old, I was watching the movie "The Lone Ranger" and never forgot. I can remember that I was in a line or we were walking to the Paramount Theater - the theater was located in the theater district, if I think it is right. It was old, going east to west from the building, which falls on the eve of the new year - it certainly does not know, New York City. There was a time on the roof above the roof and even today the billboards are notified of what is being shown. So at that time I was looking. I was looking at SE from the billboard when I was not impressed by E-lon Ranger on the roof-it was great- it made an impression and never forgot. On that day we went to see Lone Ranger - story of the birth of Lone Ranger. The Rangers entered the worst attack in Texas, and the birth of their fallen heroes was one after another. In this film we learned that Lone will not shoot Ranger but will be able to do so that law can be judge. This kind of thinking is so good that we can be good to learn something from history. Here we learned that Tonto has discovered the Fallen Ranger and Lone Ranger was founded a few years ago when he saw the childhood friend's friendship when he came to his colleague as a young person. For the injured young man-his partner in Tonto, Tonto thanked his trusted friend, thanks to his thanks, which was now part of the Tonto Accepted Necklace. Tanto said, "You are chemosh!" Lone Ranger said, "Kemo-sob, this is known? Then, Ricci scout" (Chemosabe's money) by saying about this story of Tonto. I think Lone Ranger is the true hero of the silver screen and one of the great heroes of television. It should also be said that live life according to legend of this respected person Clayton Moore and Jay Silverwells Lone Ranger - it is very good that Lone Ranger and his trusted partner have an inspirational story in Tanton's story. I was so glad I was able to find and buy a DVD. , That I stayed on Saturday morning and saw many episodes now available. Long Live the Lone Ranger and his trusted partner Tanto-hi-ho Silver-
