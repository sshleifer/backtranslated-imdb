Often when you take the 400 plus page book and try to sequence it in a two-hour film, many are lost. Here director John Maden (Shakespeare of Love) takes a very ambitious project and pulls it off almost What we found is an impressive and emotional compulsory film that seems incomplete. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of great and pretty about this picture. John Toll's cinematography (Brevehart and The Legends of the Foll, the Oscar of the Cinematographer for the Phone) is both fantastic Works with Madden, the options for positioning at the Greek island of Cephalonia are spectacular and these royal positions in different lighting are visible and lovely in the pictures. Maden uses innumerable Greek actors as well as urban residents, who make the city a genuine feeling. Soundtrack is awesome and Mandolin's passage and voices are wonderful by Italian soldiers. <br /> <br /> Maden has done a wonderful job of grabbing Italian and taking romance, which takes the greater part of the film. . There are many sweet and fun moments throughout this segment. However, until that time, there is a lot of film left in the rail, and this material is highly circulated and compressed. Although the war scenes are well done, after the war, it is clear that the film is being increasingly compromising for a long time. While we reach the post-war scene, the treatment is only the skeleton. Another negative point is the special features of the DVD, especially sparrows. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage seems like a thriller captain in the romantic leadership, who has joined the army to sing instead of the war. When he will have to fight, the Cage remains politically credible between both the gears switch between people and solving a serious policy and solution and both individuals. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, who loves the camera, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia. That's why the cat influences the screen, but the cruise looks very clear in a section that should be mentally dynamic and dynamic. Instead of establishing himself as a strong character on his right side, he could instigate the character for the love interest of Caroline. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nature as medicine. However, the Christian Bale is somewhat overwrought and feels solid as Piancé's fiancé. <br /> <br /> I think this image is an 8/10 rate. Although there are some difficulties, it is a sensitive film that is good to see. Prices of photography alone are worth the price.
