I did not plan to leave a review, but to watch some of the other awesome reviews for this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give up or give something, but I give some important plot points to this review, so you should be aware that. My review version (non-spoiler) - Samuel L. Jackson and Java Davis both stick to this movie, and it's a lot of fun. See it. <br /> <br /> This movie is my darling all the time. Gina Davis is perfect as a heroine of action, her existing life as a housewife and mother, and torn in memory that her former life is resurrected as a CIA killer. Her performance is remarkable, because she plays perfectly both sides of this relatively complex character. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson's performance is always an excellent, private forgery, as well as his forgotten past to see the character of Gina Davis. He did a great job to play with unknown sidky in the strong role of Guyana Davis. Among the few lines he used in this movie, he made the best of all time in any film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you do not see it, do that. It's a fantastic story with unexpected twists and a lot of turn, and it is highly directed and played.
