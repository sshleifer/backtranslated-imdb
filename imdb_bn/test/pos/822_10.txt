This movie was created in relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars) without much publicity from its distributors. I only knew about it because I'm a fan of Gene Cloud Van Dam and I always hope to see his latest movies that they are at least observable and away from some real Turkey (Darrield, Second in Command), they This film is a simple plot to follow and Van Damme offers a good, ridiculous performance, but the movie covers all of its achievements in Van Dam, Scott Adkins and the final one involving war between them. For most of the film editing and camera work is terrible but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. I'm also very happy that Van Damma is doing very well (Hell in, till death, till death) but good acting came in low martial arts. In Shepherd, Van Dam proves that he still has.
