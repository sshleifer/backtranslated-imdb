A beautiful small thriller from Hitcoo, a murderous espionage, a kidnapper kid, a nasty church, a foreign plot, and some random taxadmists, many beautiful scenery around the scenes. Jimmy Stewart is known for being the greatest hero of all time for Hitcoak, the story of his cool hiking in the embassy's function, but it's a hint of black and white, low budget critical issues. Yet another wonderful film from the great Master's stable.
