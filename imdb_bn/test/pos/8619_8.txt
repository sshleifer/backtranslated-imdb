Another cathartic film by Catherine Braillett√©, this time about the issue of sex scene shooting in a movie. Using comedy ?? A new trend for Breillat ?? We get a backstage view of film making but the documentary style. Filmed in the film based on Brillette, his sex movie was taken from his previous movie? A mother Swar 'is the main teen actress. But the film is not just entertainment like Brillat's work. It shows devotion to philosophical observation on the nature of sex as well as 'Purity' (in contrast to pornography) which is the foundation of Brailleet's work and the real emotional devotion. We see the director character of young leadership actress and actors, to bring out the best among them, to highlight the parts of which they have to play, the director himself can see that he can bring his own part out but he will not see himself until he Claims gained the acting height. He makes meaningful films, not titles, but it shows the work needed to produce it, and so gives both insight into both the process of making film (perfect French) and man's psychology ?? Female sexuality
