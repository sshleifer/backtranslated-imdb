I hate movies about sports. I think the pre-made Hollywood sports movie is a bit harder for me to swallow because it follows most of the opinion every year, what I'm trying to say is that there is not much creativity in this genre. Use the exhibition "A" ?? If you want this proves as "game planning". So, not saying, I was hesitant to see this documentary because of the theme of the sports theme, but at the same time I could not wait because I liked the "step-in-fluid" and "billabond odyssey" surfing documentaries. I took a step, I drowned in the unknown, and to be honest, first I was not happy. I did not like the direction, people, or style I liked to present these young sports entrepreneurs. By seeing my first, I thought the history could not be fully recorded, so I thought Stacey Peralta, in the late 1970's, actors spreading stock footage with wrong actors. The music was intense, it was a good Pearl created a mixed tape from this generation for our generation, but the visual was some stimulants. Amazing scenery, while using amazing music for support, my eyes were very long and very long to attract. I want to know the pioneers, not to see their skate for just ten minutes of the empty pool. I wanted a combination of these kids, where they went during their emergence to fame, and where they are now. It seemed as if I was running their boat throughout the day with great scores for the settlers in protest of the birth of our nation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, there will be another negative review under my belt. , I again saw the film with the paratari audio commentary. His emotions, his voice, his knowledge of man, and his film that he had to do to achieve "woo-ed" This suddenly turned into a film I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it is to get them to the camera. Many of them have not seen many of them in 20+ years, so the human element has been brought back to the surface after hearing these challenges. He was sincere; He is sympathetic, yet he has shown so much dedication to this project. Although I do not agree with what he wants to do (i.e. Shan Pen Jagabhi is not a punk rock), he revived this film for me. Due to this comment, I lost much more than thinking about this movie. <br /> <br /> J. Adams Tony Alva Jeff Ho Peggy Oki Wentzle Ruml Some of this name needs to be mentioned which should be mentioned and it is continually appreciated if skateboarding can continue to be a fast growing trend in the present. Tony Hawk's name sells products, but these people, these light-minded pout slackers that redefine the whole sport. Sure, others probably did it in stone age, but these boys style it, did it with grace, and moved it to the next level. It was a hobby for them, but it also led them in the direction that I believe none of them was ready. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" are living in the story of evolution, in the right place at the right time, without televisions and friendships to keep us alive in a generation. We have seen many stories for many years which show progress in humanity, and it must be a story that should be added to it. I can not say that I liked this movie, I will do it, but it should be a standardized vision for everyone to gain experience in school boarding trend or for everyone. It was sad, it was psychological, and these guys are not multi millionaire again ?? They are people with a passion, and rarely do you see that in the documentary. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not see this film again, but I would recommend it during the time after friends and family. I think, the fall of this movie, what was filming to me ?? Attempt to be avant-garde with style, which is finally drawn away from the characters and events. As mentioned earlier, there were some components that dragged too much, which gave us a little time to know where we were now. Perta was obviously a passion for this game, for the people, but he occasionally focused on getting out. The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. San Pán, he was modest with his voice-over, was not needed at all. They could spend money elsewhere. On the positive, audio commentary captures everything the regular film was missing. Instead of pirate, Perta's voice scene brings a powerful human element, when she told us a better story about man, place and events. Check out this picture, but do not expect to fly away. Listen to audio commentary; I think you will be affected. <br /> <br /> Grade: *** ½ out *****
