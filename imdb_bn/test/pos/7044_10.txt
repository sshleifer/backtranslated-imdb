Meatballs works its way into conversations like any other movie. Especially during summer time. It's CIT (Consultant Counselor) or Cut-Down or Inspirational Rudy The Rabbit or Brick Song Songs Without Speaking Only ... It pops up! The poor Mickey / Monte, who knows where he sleeps !! It's a great snapshot for seventeen years and a cultural icon for my generation who understand that non-PCT is really fun, you are not! Favorite wheel and spas, such as eating hot dogs with famous dogs "What? .. no mustard?" Oh, how many times I've been repeating that line and only laughed! Thank you author, actor and director! Congratulations, applause!
