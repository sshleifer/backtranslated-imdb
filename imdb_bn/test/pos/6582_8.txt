Imagine the most depressed winter that you will never experience: white instead of gray, no snowflake, and of course no surprise. This is illustrated by Finland 'Frozen Land'. This film follows a person whose life is weirdly related to each other. Yes, most of the letters are only faulty in celluloid characters - which can be completely annoying and frustrating, but for some reason you want to change their fate. <br /> <br /> Some randomly arranged comedies and a fiction that combine with some mainstream faces of Finland, the frozen land gives a glimpse of Finnish mentality that its depressing downward spirals are driven to restore some belief in humanity. More than the Kurismiki, at least say.
