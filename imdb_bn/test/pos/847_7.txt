All right, everyone agreed on the best season. The first. And killing the knitting was a bad fault. The killing of others was also bad. Blame it for the director and writer. Bad guys But then I still think it's the best CCC series! Sorry guys, I can not help it! I see the quality of the series diminishing in the first season. If you're still on Boone, it's easy to take Liam as the new protagonist. He's really ... mysterious. It was my biggest surprise to know how the Lilly story was written. She was something she did not deserve! And what can we get? Some blonde chick called Reni with absolutely no character! But these Taelons remain mysterious, and ultimately they remain amazed about the true plan. True suspension. Conversation between Jouro and Dawan is sometimes brilliant. <br /> <br /> I understand that when you enter any episode from 3rd, 4th or 5th episode, you can not understand this show. But when you watch the clock from the beginning, you can not just break it! <br /> <br /> Acting great, special FX is awesome, music is beautiful and intriguing in the plot. This will be seen, boys!
