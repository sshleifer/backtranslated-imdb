After the success of Gailal, the ricks started working in this film, which was a comedy. This image was created for 3 years and was finally released in 1994 but did not work for some reason. Prior to this photo Damini (93) was released and worked well. /> <br /> This movie is currently a crazy comic movie, mostly like the most favorite movie, but it is fun and well-managed. This film is a perfect plot against today's movies and lets you laugh that most of the characters have become famous, this is what criminals master Gogo (Shakti) Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and others <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> This image laughs at your running time even though it is very slow and exaggerated yet it is still the most fun movie <br /> <br /> <br /> Good music is good <br /> <br /> Actors Amir steals the show and gives his funny acting, it is his first out of the wonderful actor Salman works well but the Amir's amateur front shows, but it is a good work and his chemistry is a lovely charisma boring and sounds like a child, Rabina suffers both the role of Paresh Rawal Very funny, Shakti Kapoor's top job Shahzad Khan (W. by Ajit) is very good and very funny in Vizu Khot Aki is very good there.
