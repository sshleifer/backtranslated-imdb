I was fortunate enough to see The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those who do not know you, a Canadian-made movie tour in Moving Picture Film Festival Canada). Before the film began, I was told that it was the world's premier and it was at the end of an American-delivered contract that added to my excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm a big horror movie fan, and yes, I love the trilogy. So when I came to know that Rose McGowan made ten Little Indian movies, I knew that I was for a treatment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was set in the middle of a snowstorm (it was portrayed in Vancouver, BC, Canada) in a MountainTop Motel, which adds suspension. Rose McGowan keeps a great performance as one of the cast plus-girl-next-door (?!). And at the end what will happen, okay, what I'm saying is that you do not guess the end. <br /> <br /> Sadly, this will probably not be a mainstream North American theater. Because it's the only decent money-maker Rose McGowan But if you get the chance to see it I will recommend you. Bad if bad, always have video. <br /> <br /> I gave 9 out of 10.
