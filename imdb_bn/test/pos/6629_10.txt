Being a huge fan of Bergman, I had to find literal years to find this movie (I was priced at $ 60) and finally bought it a few weeks ago. The basic basis for Bergman films is the relationship between the characters and how they try to cope with the situation. Although this movie is the same, it is different because I saw this setting much different than most of Bergman's movies. <br /> <br /> It is found in the battlefield and caught in the middle. <<br /> <br /> It starts from the beginning and it again proves that Love Wolman is one of the best actors of the 20th Century. A must see.
