About four years later the Iraq war started and we are in a bigger hole than ever before. Okay, so those flag hovers were so sure about the rights and powers of American roads, they are now running behind their tail, right? You bet it. From the beginning of this movie, say so. The filmmaker is so strange, or I would say, knew what was coming. It's about going to the lucky teller and what's going to happen in the future. There was a point when I felt the feeling of standing behind my neck because GWL announced that "Great job is finished" mirror. I understand what I mean. But if you are not illusory or even if you are not in favor of war, even this movie will have some impact on you because it is embedded in history.
