I saw Champs during the release of the four-day theater. This is a delightful and fun movie of the soul of 'Benji', though the performers have more attention and attention than the dogs. Sunny life is a ridiculous way of life simple, bullies and villains are both sympathetic and heartwarming, getting them just desert. It is thought provoking. This movie with cruel degeneration affects awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and rape. There are different genres and different purposes in the movie. This film, which is pleasing to all ages, gives an interesting interesting look into our own experiences. Everyone will recognize the nature and kind of behavior of themselves and others. Everyone will see ridiculous. Make the humorous move enjoyable and bring life's burden to a new level. <br /> <br /> Litehart smile and a 'well-liked' movie Champs are an excellent choice. Memorable.
