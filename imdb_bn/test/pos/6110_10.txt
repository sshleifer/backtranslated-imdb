After watching the Dispatching Live, I was fond of John Waters. I had heard about Pink Flimins and had to see it and the boy was worth it! Do you believe it, trash it! This is really the main plot of this film which is packed with all the dirty. These include: Brutality, brutality, rape, chicken shagging, nudity (as you have never seen before - be careful about baby birthday entertainers), eating food, arson, trailer trash, distortion, transsexual, egg fetish, cross dressing. ... you get the picture. After all, this must be a certain course! Just near the birthday party entertainer and the Divine Gardens Park Park!
