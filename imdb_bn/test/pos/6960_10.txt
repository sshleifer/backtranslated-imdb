I highly reccommend this movie. It makes childhood imagination and linear reality in such a fashion that it can be believed. Calling a name of one view that actors and directors have such a perfect time became a dance war. I like story lines, actors, everything. Although I think there was one or two perfect Chess scenes, all the movies were done in a shameless manner.
