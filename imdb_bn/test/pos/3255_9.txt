Light spoilers <br /> <br /> And that's 'Top Ten All the Time.' I was frustrated over the 'Two Hands' by accident at IFC one night (maybe it was more special - there was no cheerful expectation), and I could not believe I did not hear anything about it. Now Heath Laser is becoming more popular in the US, I'm sure it's more available. At that time, I was telling friends about the film, and sometimes it was not finding anyone other than showing the IFC. However, in the black comedy / gangster style it fits well with me, and the film seems to finally end up what they deserve. Brian Brown made an orgasm with his younger son and was delighted to be the chief gangster in Scrabble play with his pregnant women. Also a fun car with a random car thief quick edit fate. Even Heath was quite good at it. At that time, I vaguely reminded him of the short series 'Rare' in Fox called Fox. Hopefully Gregor Jordan will hit another, but as far as I'm concerned, it's his best.
