Unfortunately, I have never seen the full version of this movie. I double the 87-minute version again, which was in the 1950s. Directed by Julian Duvier more floridly than the norm, it is a wonderful out-of-the-ordinary piece, through and through the magnificently atmospheric set of transmissions, through a wide range of tracks, Photographer Andrea Thomas has published very well, but Black Jack is not an adviser, but there is nothing. Strengthening this imaginary visual style, a script that allows one of our favorite actors to roster, such as Agnes Murehad and Marcel Dalyo, some brilliantly malicious, full bloody characterization. George Sanders provides a polished performance, although a brilliant millionaire (who turns rival racquet) is praised by Agence's Murrayhead. Also realize most from his role, Patricia Roc. The film was created in Spain in 1949.
