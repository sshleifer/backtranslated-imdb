After making a buzz at the Grand Central Station in New York, an innocent person (Kevin Speacy, "the common suspect") arrested the police, who believes he must have the effect of hallucinogenic drugs. People have realized why they wear their dark glasses because "the light of your planet is really bright." And so the prototype (since he identifies himself as "goat," with an orthography) is sent to Manhattan's psychiatric institute, where the tired workhell doctor Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski") tries to understand this man's So-called illusion <br /> <br /> Preeti method is modest and cooperative. When asked why he believes he has been in the institution, he really answers that, "You think I'm crazy." Within a few minutes, after abandoning his insatiable new hunger for the Earth-fruit, it has fully demonstrated directly that he is exposed to the K-pack planet, which is 1000 light-years away, the binary star system Agape and the Saturni located Lyra stars. He has also described in detail how his infinitely more advanced species has achieved a rapid stir with the help of light energy, which is an achievement acclaimed for mankind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was very suspicious about these disrespectful claims, although he was fascinated by them, and surrendered himself to understand how Protok came to believe in something like this. Meanwhile, in the Protective Psychological Ward, he uses time for observing his colleagues, eventually offering him all around him to live and hope for healing. On July 27, Proto is published, he will go back to K-Pack, and he can only take one man with him. Actually what will happen on that date, nobody is sure. <br /> <br /> Basically Dr. To play Powell? As Will Smith Prote ?? Kevin Spacy played a major role during the withdrawal of Smith from the film. You can say that he had a lot of fun with his character, and sometimes a completely controversial issue of ridiculous conversations ("Your production is worthy of traveling alone") often makes genuine smile. There are unaware intelligence behind many promo words, but logic maintains that he must be confusing ... he is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do the visitors have to move forward in the possibilities ?? For the first section of the film, we probably take Prote's almost the possibility of an external world (this is not a science fiction film, does it?), Before being fully convinced when the prototype unknowingly displays the astronomical knowledge of astronomy, a newly discovered planet system Dr. A final investigation by Powell gives us a neatly-furnished landline explanation for the confusion of the prototype, but it quickly leaps forward and we're leaving the skull again. The film, quite properly, keeps it open last, lets listeners think about what they've seen and discuss with the people around them. Nevertheless, if you believe that the competitor can be a proton, your uncertainty is guaranteed in your mind: the universe is really an interesting place and probably there is high energy that we still can not discover.
