Texas Ranger vs. Indian has been taken far away from a great Western West written by MacMarty. This screenplay only accepts this short series to fill with many warm vague relationships, which in fact is the second in the original story. It does not end with a completely unbelievable and disconnected book that asks you how we are going to be transferred to Lonesome Dove. <br /> <br /> The original characters of the series were really cool, the film's locations were excellent, but this mini series should have a great book to be true.
