I really enjoyed this movie. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This film is about the mother of the cat named Detectus and her 3 children. Dude and cats love music. They have to practice piano every day. But Batler called Edgar Duchess and tried to kidnap his children and tried to keep them asleep. But he failed. The first Duchess meets a cat named Thomas and Miley. Fall in love with Thomas Dutchess. Break in the cat song. Everyone wants to be a cat with the song. Thomas gets the love of music like other cats. Thomas and Duchess are really like each other. <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I like cats!
