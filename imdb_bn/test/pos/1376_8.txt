I had a horrible day but this movie caught me, and in the end I could not keep it down ... and I forgot my awesome day. And last ... by the way ... where is the sequel !!! <br /> <br /> The budget is probably too low ... but ... do they see it? It reminds me of a game ... They are basically working with a tent, a 'escape foot', a few guns, uniforms, camping gear and a 'scanner' thing. That's it for props. Perhaps it is a good thing, to take action for acting and writing and to take their proper place in films, instead of using an excuse to do CGI fights (starwars), instead of work centers. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not just 'Simlles' ... but it still works. Why? Because there is not enough in it, and what is there, they are not 'accepted' with any influential army, which people can try to do whatever they can on the shot. It proves imagination ... it is a bit of simple material, beautiful compositions (especially heavy freight shots). A long shot that can be at least ten seconds ... which tracks the entire length of the ship ... it must have been in the last 10 years Saiffai series of warfare sequences, action sequences for more than 0.75 seconds) and related to the story. It may not be old or 'state condition', but it does not look stupid and does not go away from the story. <br /> <br /> Good acting, except when the letters die very quickly, they know. The captain was fantastic, but some of his scenes could use another one. I also lost his body with his character cooling and kicking, I think the captain is calm and in control ... what's going on in that scene? Think about the other crew losing that moment? Has he lost control of himself? <br /> <br /> Now for the plot ... mostly good ... why? Because it does not try to explain itself. That's right. It is called 'planet', it is a mystery, to get it ?? No one knows why the idols are there, and they can not find it. Mysterious religion? The strange scientist with tattoo? What do you hope to find out in less than 90 minutes? It's not war and peace. And thank God, it's not Star Wars / Track. No midillers, a 5-minute exposure boring conversation that has no purpose in the story. Characters are frustrating, and only able to find some basic things ... This is not a star track episode where they find a child like Leonardo Davyki or the space store. It's mysterious, and I like that. I do not know why, I can become more familiar with this boy because they do not know what is happening, and I do not ... they do not disturb many places or tell them what's going on in the magic box. <br /> <br /> I would say, in fact, one of the most vulnerable moments, when the 'traitor' turns the crew and tries to explain the reasons for the planet, religion etc. Some poor dialogue, emo, in the whole movie, and it prevents the flow, and some characters consider that scene irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Well, sometimes I felt it was a little mysterious, though. Like, why was the man frozen with his eyes? That was odd. Just curious 'Hamlet' is over ... again I want to know some of these characters well. And finally 30 seconds rescue scene was so difficult? This is not a serial show, it was a movie, and we like to stop in film if we can live in a movie. Imagine Hamlet. No 'the angels' flights will sing in your rest' <br /> <br /> However, What can i say This was the price of the dollars given in the supermarket 'red box' machine. It was, the better part of the story than Emo, the Storker part 1 or 3. I said, it sucked me, wanted to know what was happening, and finally I could not wait.
