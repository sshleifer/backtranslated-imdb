I think this movie is really entertaining, though it lacks some of the features needed for such movies. First, when Doug and Chachi start their mission, they go through the F-16B and during the war scenes, they run F-16A. I dislike the second movie, it's always the F-16 rolling repetition of the missile to escape ... Still no significance and flares appeared in a movie? Thirdly, once you see FM-16 almost empty-handed, it again appears in a lot of missiles ... The model used to imitate the destroyed aircraft is not good. However, I think it was really good to use IAI KFC as a competing aircraft, much better than the F-5 shown in the top song (but this film is not as good as the best composition) <br /> <br /> is an interesting movie , I love planes and I saw it 3 times more.
