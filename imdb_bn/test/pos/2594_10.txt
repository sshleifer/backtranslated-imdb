Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that features a fight between the words Baggs Bani / Duffy Dock / Elmer Fudd and it is a rabbit season or duck season. Always stirring the "pronoun problem" with the love bug and Daffy Daphy always being dismembered as a result of his beak hunting Elmer's shotgun victims. Then the rabbit cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Mulitz are always my favorites in the writers-director group, because I laughed because of these delightful hunter trilogy cartoons because I was a kid. And at least two of the Deferees wondered about the mockery: "You are frustrated!" That could not get good!
