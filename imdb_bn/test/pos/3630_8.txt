Dook is a very stupid film - a dog is becoming a Duke! But it's a very funny movie. There are many children films, but there is no physical activity joke (physically), since many animal films are forced to comply! Most dogs and dogs are dogs. . . Well, man. 'Good guys' are interesting and interesting. 'Bad guys' are ridiculous, and of course, many jokes pun But something is proud of this movie, though it is stupid, but it is not "for the cheerful" and for all the cheap laugh like others. <br /> <br /> Crackets, Simon and Copper are playing a great black job and Tan Noble "Hobart" who is his favorite owner, dies after a real die dies. In most cases they act like dogs, 'do not speak' or emotions and attitude like human beings. However, they do stereoop poodles, and Habart falls for him, because he's a podel. Come on! These dogs - they have a different view of beauty !!! <br /> <br /> Overall, charming, fun and enjoyable.
