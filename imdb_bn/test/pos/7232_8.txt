Once upon a time, we were brought with a film such as: The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Granny, Poltridgestrich, Redneck Lomis and Surf Nazis Must Die, and Shakespeare's famous play 'Romeo and Juliet'. This adaptation has decided to spice up the story by adding strange sex, extreme ferocity, genital mutilation, body piercing and ill-treatment, and it has succeeded in creating a bizarre but ridiculous film. Anyone who wants to go to produce a trumpet must know it and it is unreasonable and unfavorable comedy with political disqualification. Expectations of other tromba films and lots of used gags (flipping cars and head squashing) Many people think that it sounds like a whip that only the season will be fun ... they may be right, but at the same time they need to lighten up and enjoy Trudeau and Juliet's madness and mind-flexibility. <Br /> <br /> A great cast, a funny script (by James Gunn and Lloyd Coffman), an appropriate soundtrack and a great looking gag, how Kauffman has been flipping back from the opposite direction and succeeded in getting out of it. ? Everybody Get some popcorn, drink beer, invite your friends, and enjoy tomo and juliet, with Shakespeare's adaptation of a lot of balls. The end <br /> <br /> 4/5
