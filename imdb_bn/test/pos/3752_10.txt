I love this movie because it was originally IMX (previously unknown). They were at the house party at the age of 11, but now everyone has grown up! I was a little surprised about what I was doing in the movie (almost my hair was ready to tear), but I realized that they were no longer my younger boys. I think Chris Stokes has done a great job, it seems he was his first movie.
