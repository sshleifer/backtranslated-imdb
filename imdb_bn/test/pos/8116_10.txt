I have never seen a movie like this; It was not planned to be seen, but it was the opposite price of the TV channel. I was mostly a Cinque filmmaker, but I'd be happy to add it to my collection. It started with a simple love triangle as a sided film, then it became somewhat different. (Then it can not say anything more, but it involves two boys and one girl, and the film also played Hugo Weaving from "Matrix" and "The Lord of the Rings". I did not want to play such a role. Very funny guy, this movie is going on TV here, but if you do not have a satellite, it is a rental price. So try it; you will not be disappointed.
