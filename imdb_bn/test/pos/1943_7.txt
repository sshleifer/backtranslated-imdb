I was going through the channel and when I came to this movie, I had to stop and laugh. In the early 80's it was clear about thirteen kids, and I started my mother "Hahaha, Kallyan Channel, if the child is completely baby, it seems." <br /> <br /> Um. Yes This movie started with my father and his friends. <br /> <br /> I even want to watch this movie based on my father's childhood! <br /> <br /> It's weird to say just ..., but at the age of thirteen years of indifference. It is a good "human interest" and is shown in some strange aspects of emotion.
