First, when my PBS station started showing it in 1981, I became a fan of listening. I learned a lot about the show and those who were in the show. <br /> <br /> This latest installment of the doctor has made a great impression on me. The original series, the Ur Classic series, was made fun by the special effects and / or wobbly set. Well, this is no longer true. Special effects are awesome, but more well written. You can learn more about our favorite doctor and learn more about why he loves the world so much. Without too far, it's a very good series to watch. Christopher Eccelston does not see that we bring a side of the doctor, a bitter and angry one but still lovable at the same time. <br /> <br /> must see a must!
