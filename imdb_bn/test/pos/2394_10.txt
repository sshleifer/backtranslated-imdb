I like this picture, the best of film making independently. Cinematography, pensing, rhythm, and acting are perfectly synchronized. Fred best carpenters work! The film is well-written with many plush twists that will take you to a great end. It keeps going well and involves you. Being a photographer, I was most impressed with cinematography. The light creates mood and a beauty which is usually found in a big budget film. This actor gave a great canvas to start from, their magic works. And that's what they do! All performances and great performances from each one were well cast in their role. As I said at the beginning, this is a wonderful film and one of Fred's best-known films. You love it
