I'm a thesis on the border sounds: the female cross dresser and I'm using Velvet Tipping as my main textbook, no comment on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as a performance, sex as a fiction, penis imagery, an erotic As cross-dressing and revolution as the imagination, the effects of male costume etc will be greatly appreciated! But did anyone stop the sight of Sergio Toledo's 1987 film? A young lesbian possibly a possible cross-dresser. I'm dying to see it because I think it would be really helpful ... does anyone know where I can get a copy of it? I've tried Amazon and some other sites but no luck ...
