Somehow, Chengie lost my brother Jack at the AFI Awards. Later, the high quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel was outstanding - but, in my opinion, it is not as good as Shakespeare. I have heard that many critics have dismissed Changi as irrelevant, insignificant, historically incorrect or even disrespectful. Who is this critic and where? Pringle is awesome. That's more than that. Bright It is not supposed to be a documentary - of course, I can forgive the real survivors (or indeed a survivor of a POW camp) to be frustrated with production - but for the rest of us, Changi repeatedly represents the tremendous power of friendship, extreme adversity. It seems to be a part of Australian culture that seems to have diminished, it seems to be reduced when it becomes easy and less challenging, but we will never forget: Australians have been honored globally for their global respect and humor after Gallupoli and WW2. Ratings: 96/100. See also: Gallipoli; Paradise road; Last bullet; Sugar factory
