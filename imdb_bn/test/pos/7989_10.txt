Batman Returns It's my opinion that the first Batman in Batman series was the only movie that Batman Returns Among the first Batman of Team Burton, we only played wonderfully by Batman and Joker both Michael Cutton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> What we believe in the Batman Return is the fully played Batman movie (yes even better then the Dark Knight). Keaton returned as Batman and is no longer in the top with Batman's character, perfect for the two villains he got when he played a perfect role in this film. First you have Danny Davito who is as pleasantly crazy as the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cath-Umman, I dare say that Batman is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the film. I feel like a puffer because he has changed the way he has become a cat woman and has dived his mind in the dark and what you got is a woman, who is trying to make a villain a hero and then I Think back to a hero in the end. Also this amazing cast you have the worst businessman Max Schreck played by the wonderful and legendary Christopher Walken. In the supporter's role, I say something about this role of love, and perhaps in Sherlock's appearance in this film that makes its performance even better, it is already there. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that Batman Returns has done much more during this time in opposition to the first Batman. Because I love this story so much that Burton wanted to go a much darker and twisted side, which opposed Nicholson's top antics. There are stories about penguins and how he is trying to make Gotham a new hero and city mayor. Then you have the Kate-Yumman and his struggle for determining who he really is and what he should do with his new personality. When Batman comes to me, I think he has put together two stories together with this ring leader, but he kicked the ass at the same time. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was like dark and atmospheric stories that take it in. Gotham did not see what is good in City-Blue-Ray and HD, so if you have an opportunity to view it in this way, do it all the way because it is really associated with the overall experience of batman returns. So I really feel like all Batman films that Batman Returns believes that it does not hold Dark Knight for me because I enjoyed that movie for the great performance of the Lewis laser, although the Joker felt that the film was a bit There was a lack. There is no shortage of Batman Return, so if you want to see an extraordinary movie, it is a perfect cast, then the batman bats the batsman.
