If you listen to Win (Pod, God / Satan), then I know what is happening to "Split", seeing the film under the influence of LSD, helped to deal with audio / video trusses from superb editing work. The plot was important only from second to second. This acid acids help to communicate with the word, supernatural and general speed. Do not get bothered to write anything beyond the reach of your comprehension ... Here only these great independent efforts are not enough in raw, amateur level expressions. I dare to create a movie that can make messages evenly with my head and I can change the way to visualize the visual arts and the world. Not to mention the many reality that has yet been discovered by this human mind. I love Chris Shore's vision. I appreciate E Eliase Merge's texturing terrorist film "The Begate".
