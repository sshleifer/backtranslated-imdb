What a wonderful film, wonderful, unique characters that are realized by throwing a great ensemble are filled with unique characters The director also holds the story together, has received a great performance (without messing with them) and using music (and what a wonderful music) it is making great impact. The main role was played. Efta I have always heard that he enjoyed a bright stage actor and law and order, although he really shows what he can do with a filling, complex role. Messi Gray is awesome, Moose Def, as usual, wonderful. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smith is awesome, and he does not try to pull the focus because of a star. A true piece of acting ensemble Rent it <br /> <br />, enjoy it, its gravel, and enjoy it. Something special
