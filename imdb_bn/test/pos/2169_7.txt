This movie will not be considered for the Academy Award, but if you enjoy a movie that does not take yourself seriously and wants to enjoy the viewers only for 90 minutes, it is not frustrating. You will enjoy the Darth Vader a send for an ongoing joke that is very funny that you are fame (short), a female batman for the heroine (but many virgins with much less costume), and cigarette and police captain. No way is a great cinematographic achievement. But you enjoy the camps but it was a visit price. God helped me, I loved it.
