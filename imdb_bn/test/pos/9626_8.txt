I saw five Fingers in-drive ... what, 1973, '74? It was the first Kung Fu movie I saw and I was very entertained. I recently bought the DVD and saw it again. I was very entertaining for the second time too. I believe this is probably most likely to be modeled after the Kung Fu movie. Competing school, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black hat" bad guys They even threw in Japan (very bad guys) karate and judo style. I remember remembering being dubbed by the dubbing dialog, "Hey you! You are a very bad guy!" And "they will not go away with this! I will go to this bad crowd!" This time it was not so confusing, I guess I'm using it. If you appreciate this style, you will see it.
