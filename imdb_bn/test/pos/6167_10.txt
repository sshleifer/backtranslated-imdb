If you want to see the real nature of the communist, see the movie Dark Blue World. (Tvamomodr√Ω Volunteer) How to flee England to join the fight against Nazi how it refuses to surrender brave Czech pilot. After the war, the Communists feared that they lifted the dangerous western ideas of independence. So, these heroic check pilots were thrown into a night prison, where some guards were the same Nazi, they risked their lives to defeat. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to know why many of its movies are flat, they should compare the role of the play "Pearl Harbor" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really made a connection to all the characters. At Pearl Harbor, everyone is just like a deadly cartoon version of an original person. <br /> <br /> There are numerous examples of brilliant writing in this movie. The stick in my mind is a funny scene when Character Karel is being taught English by a formal English woman. When he can not pronounce a word, he laughs lesson. Usually in Stokk English in English, the teacher quietly beat up Karel, but forced him to behave brutally. <br /> <br /> The series of sky war in this movie is amazing, and they help keep the film alive. I spent 11,000 dollars per hour to rent the plane, but it was worth every price. <br /> <br /> Girls, you expected to cry in sad movies, but say ... be careful! This movie will be the General Patan's crying. And if you're a dog lover, you use the half box of the clennix. I do not say I warn you.
