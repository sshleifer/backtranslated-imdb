This movie was astonishing to me when I saw it in the Senate at the Big California Theater in San Jose. This is a musical instrument, which I usually do not like, but it was a different one. Robert Peters, who directed the film and stared at it, did such a wonderful job. During his question-answer, he told the audience that he had only two people for his character! Dialogues were mostly made on the fly and actually made the film another film festival in Germany! I can not say enough about this movie, the only bad thing is that you watch the camera work and it hits a bit. If you come across this film - check it out!
