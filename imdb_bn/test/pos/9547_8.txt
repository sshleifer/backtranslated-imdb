What could happen in a dull Texan town in summer? Well, teenagers can find out some things and can happen. <br /> <br /> This version of the Mexican verbose is nothing less than L.L. Chupacabar, and this film will be contrasted with this name, not a retreat or appearance of American Weaver movies, but completely different. <br /> <br /> It's not bad for a low budget movie! Some clever driver cameras work, perfectly appropriate traditional animals and gore influences, and once the omniscient people can not make mistakes and can not, such as shooting a colleague, it thinks like a big animal and is disturbed by something that they probably know. No <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sit with the hope of a little entertainment and relatively simple stories, and it's great! It's 8/10 for me to be creative overall, it's okay to act, and stop some good work for this movie's budget.
