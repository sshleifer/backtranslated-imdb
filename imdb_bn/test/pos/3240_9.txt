I got this BBC my BBC "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptation) and did not like it at first. It is completely different from others and it lacks, or so, I think, one of the other attributes I enjoy in other Austin movies: Delightful Common Thoughts The nightmare scenario that Mrs. Richards apparently sews together with her fingers was particularly upset. <br /> <br /> I still do not like to see fingers sewing scenes but I'm Mrs. R., when she sews, "My only known ... tap my gown." This movie is now my favorite Austen favorite. I saw it up to 7 or 8 times. Acting, my mind, incredible The way I see a good performance is to see myself find out from what I see (sewing, though my fingers together, hopefully, or bundoguling or whatever) to give the character its line. This is the turn of expression, the shield of posture, which makes the words alive - which performs well, as much as I am concerned. <br /> <br /> Well, I see almost every part of the "North's Abbey" because almost all actors play their role in charisma. Peter Firth is amazing. Mr. Tilani, the perfect combination of the Ba'athian Fop and real, male hero - are not sure whether you are after Catherine's money. I love her touch (Welsh?) To pronounce. Mr and Mrs. Richards are impressive: the combination of their behavior - especially Mr Richard's high voice, the reflection of his intelligence and knowledge - makes them so real. Generally, Tyler is probably an impressive father who might be a murderer. And Captain Tillini, who is clearly enjoying myself, miserly sill ... and the sister and brother of the payment whose name I am currently unable to remember - both of them are absolutely smart and memorable. <br /> <br /> Another reason I like this adaptation is the most romantic of Jane Zen Austen adaptation. I know it was one of Austen's weak points (well, I was as concerned): Although all his novels are about love, his heroes and heroines are really in love. And if they are not really love, then what is the point? The other all the other adaptations I saw (except the last Olivier / Gerson one) ultimately have a nice cold-fish kiss, if they kiss. I do not like all of the sex in movies but in the hearts really need an impressive kiss. And the last kiss of Uttangar is a dosage. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm worried, costume, music and top of the discussion work. And the script is very clever - we are very well educated about Gothic romance, high living standard of Bath, the emergence of Cathy in the normal country, because they usually live in BBC Productions. Also, I like the part when the small black page cartrules do. And MARCINES, I think, it was completely suitable and very clever exposure device. <br /> <br /> Some people objected to the fact that this version contradicted what Zener Austen wanted to do in North Nangar Abbey - that means Gothic romance is fun, it does not promote it. But I do not think that he meant to keep "the mystery of Udolpho," etc. He just made the point that you need to distinguish between reality and imagination. And this point is made when Mr Tyler rides catherine in his mother's room. Besides, General Tylene was a villain, though he was an extraordinary person. That point was meant to be made, of course.
