One of the most successful shots in television history is the return. Now I admit that I have never come to the real show .... OK, so I have never seen it. But the new event is impressive. <br /> <br /> This weekend, Size-Fi premiered in the first two episodes "Rose" and "The World of the World". We see Rose, a prominent Clerk, which is followed by the remote controlled Manquin. He called himself a doctor who was rescued himself by a mysterious stranger. Using the Internet, he has found a conspiracy that warns him that wherever the doctor visits, death follows. When her singer boyfriend Mickey was replaced by replaceer, the doctor told him about a plot to use the world as a breeding ground for these plastic grenades, which doctors are fighting in space and time, traveling in disguise in a Tardis in the 50's, style police calls Box. <br /> <br /> She helps her save the world - otherwise show - and agree to join her. But when he kept his life in danger, he was upset and questioned whether his company was at risk. <br /> <br /> While special effects are harmful, some scenes are a little sticky, "Doctor Who" (after two episodes in the United States) is a smart, well-written job. Apparently, the second season has already been broadcasted in the UK, so I predict the same success here.
