Monkey Island Curse has always been my favorite of the series. A vibrant visual look, an extraordinary soundtrack and brilliant voice-cast all make a memorable and ludicrous adventure. <br /> <br /> According to the game the graphics are definitely not frustrating. Although some angle has been overcome, all the feelings of the game are Disney's feature length animation memorable. The gameplay is easy and even a bride will get it hanging very soon. The game offers a little extra for more experienced players with its Mega Monkey mode. <br /> <br /> My darling is voice-cast. Dominic Armato's sympathetic voice makes Gaibresh complete and charming like Alexander Boyle Ellen. Earl Bowen is a surprisingly scary yet turned out to be the leading villain, leech. The character of the game is also linked to Wali (Blue Ross), Murray (Danny Delke) and Alan Young of Smith McDutton, a memorable character in my personal choice. My hat goes away from his memorable secondary role as late, Great Care Kuter and Griswald. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The business smoker The game is not perfect and some locale is not as well described as other, but I had no gripes with the simple finishing of the game, which I got very satisfying.
