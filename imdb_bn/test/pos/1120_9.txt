One of my favorite films. I like the horse, I like the happy ending, and like Walter Matthew. I miss him and am glad to be such a great movie that reminds me why he was so nice. See it with your kids (or your horse). <br /> <br /> Older hard boot horse trainer with kids, and down from fate. If you ever appreciate or appreciate the horse racing, then you will praise the madman in the story of the rich. It may be a little below "Seabiscuit", but not much. The story is about the same, Quarter Horse version without. Good acting, precise racing terms and equipment, and excellent racing scene. Do not accept my word for it, get it and make up your own mind.
