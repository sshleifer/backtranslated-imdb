Hey, you see, this picture will not change your life! But if you are a woman, and Richard Gerr was always a little bit; This movie is right on your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere are the way of going back to screen chemistry. 'Nights In Rudante' is not an Oscar-winning film and it will probably be forgotten later instead, but if you want a beautiful love story between people showing an atmospheric, beautiful shot (they do not turn your stomach and even when Gere 'up' he does not light too much Look at) then this is the movie for you. I liked the theme of stories and it was quite relevant in many ways. Of course the whole thing was presented in a patronized, which was not impressive and used in real sense ..... I want to know more about Father / Son relationship between Catherine and James Franco, but the story was really a great love for you to change for the better About the idea that you can; Whether a lover, a child, a friend etc. Love the photo theme and its mysterious ways. I am surprised that James Franco took such a small part in this film, but he was also good for a few minutes of screen time. I really liked this picture because it was moving and sweet.
