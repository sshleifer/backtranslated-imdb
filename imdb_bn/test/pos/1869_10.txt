I had a huge fan of this series. Yesterday I saw the DVD again. Laughing laugh or laughing? But in some episodes I was laughing violently and some episodes were good. Actor Rakesh Bedi (Raja) and Satish Shah are great, and the dream is wonderful, but I think he gets the job. Maybe a better actress can be used. This series shows a beautiful, clear comedy. <br /> <br /> If this series is in the air in the current year, I could have given it 9/10. And this series is about 25 years old and her comedy is still good. I think I'm 10/10. I would recommend this series to watch the DVD.
