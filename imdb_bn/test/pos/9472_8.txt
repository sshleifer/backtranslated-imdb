I saw this movie today (yesterday was open here) and was just fun. <br /> <br /> I saw a review that said something to the effect that the critics thought it would be just another teenage movie, but it was found based on Shakespeare's twelfth night ... and then to pick up this flash on Shakespeare's field Started trying to justify. I really think it's going to the overboard: The only connection that I can see with night and night is that (a) the main idea of ​​a girl with a problem like a man; (B) Extensive male and female humor originating from the original foundation; And (c) some names (including Viola and Dukes). <br /> <br /> Apart from those names, thematic formalities (A & B) are really cool themes for a script and this script has no exceptions. Outside of it, though, it's really a simple, delightful and very contemporary / traditional tin flick. And that's a completely legit genre even if the upperman has to find an excuse to choose it ... like Shakespeare's dictation. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of bright, expressive, emotive, stylized, funny ... teen age hormones and teen humor and male / female humor suitable for all ages. And it's really the best part of IMHO: Truly almost every male stereotype and every woman stereotype is pictured in the up-the-top fun pictures. These stereootypes are uninterrupted but tenderly stimulating, with the discovery of the complexity that I am still a little frustrated ... but does not really feel frustrated, it's not a movie: things come to you fast and fun and you get a smile and a groan and Then go to the next split second go. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is really delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful duke; David Cross works a wonderfully on Top Principal Gold. Acting and characterization was all fine and target. Cinematography was excellent. <br /> <br /> Excellent entertainment from the beginning to the end ... Check it out!
