Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is not much different from previous games (apart from Tony Hawk 3). The only thing which featured at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is the new selection, and the graphics are tweaked. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x offers a new carrier mode and it is a 2x carrier. 2x career basically Tony Hawk 1 career, because there are only five challenges per level. If you miss Tony Hawk 1 and 2, then I'll buy you Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, but if you've played the first two games, you still have to try it. Overall, there's nothing really new, but it's too fun to go from the game. Hope this review will benefit you. Graphics: 7 of the top 10, Clear Scenes is not one of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x's main features. The atmosphere has changed much closer than Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and character models look slightly better. When you look back at Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and 2 in the old PS1, it seems that old graphics are run ugly through your head. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are rendered much better. Character models are not filled with jaggys, texture is more smooth, but not far away. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x visuals do not compare to the graphics of Tony Hawk 3, but the action probably did not want to create Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x Excellent Graphics. Overall, graphics 7 is worth getting the average score because they have not kept the full power of Xbox for use here. The graphics are nice and clear, what I would say is <br /> <br /> Sound: 10 out 8 does not provide much more than sound effects, but skateboards are off the ground. I think the sound factor is the main reason for a rating, because you are not obliged to listen to the below average Tony Hawk soundtrack, because there is a custom soundtrack feature. Sound effects are a much better word than Tony Hawk 1 and 2, especially it is more obvious, and only everything seems cool. One of the main reasons why I bought this game is because of the custom soundtrack Grind sound effects will still take the same sound as the first two games, just a little tweeted out. One of the main issues of the sound factor is that if the song ends, it will not go to the next track, the song you just heard will be played again. I do not like the in-game soundtrack, but as I said, you are not obliged to hear it. <br /> <br /> Control: Out of 10, 10 of Tony Hawk Pro Skater's best parts control 2x. The control set up is superbly comfortable, and easy to use. In the days of PlayStation, people thought that control was the best, but it looks like the XX control has done well with the controls. Surprisingly, using Control Stick to run the strategy is very easy. Acton Tony Hawk's Pro Skater has done great work with 2x controls. They created the best Xbox controllers for Tony Hawk games. You will not be disappointed with the control style and it is a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Play: 10 of 10 Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x Tony Hawk 1 and 2 together, keeping the game together is still incredible fun game Factor of the game has changed around a bit. During this time, you get a lot more air than the first two games and the tricks are a lot easier to run. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, each character has three carrier modes, including Tony Hawke 1 carrier, Tony Hawk 2 carrier and 2x carrier. Tony Hawk 1 Carrier is rather simple because in the first game, you do not get anything for the wind. As the PlayStation version, Tony Hawk 2 career delivered the same difficulty. The only problem applicable to 2x career, is to find out where all the items are, but after you complete it 2x carrier is not difficult. There are 3 levels in 2x carrier and the first two layers are to find hidden tapes, collect the SKYA and do whatever it takes for that particular level. From three to the third level, the level of competition, where you get the amount of certain amount of gold you get. In the first two stages, collecting hidden tapes and S-KA-TI characters, both of them featured. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Scatter 2x still retains the old Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. <br /> <br /> Story: - <br /> <br /> Fun Factor: 10 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 Many of 10x, the most fun game in today's game. I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, and yet, I did not like them, but for some reason, Tony Hawk's Pro Scatter 2x is really fun. There's really nothing to say, since Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is 2x away, today's Xbox's best game. One problem, if you have already left the game once, you will play it a few times, but it will be repetitive. <br /> <br /> Rename value: 10 Tony Hawk Pro Pro Skater is distributing a high quantity replay value of 2x. There are many cheats to unlock, and a lot of character videos. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x has many formats, mainly because it's so funny. Best Features: You are not lazy to hear lazy in-soundtracks. The worst feature: the custom soundtrack is a little burst. Final statement: Many people have complained in the past that they do not like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x because there is nothing new, but they should stop the complaint because you have got lots of games for $ 50.00. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10 Sound: 8 out of 10 Control: 10 out of 10 To play the game: 10 out of 10 Story: N / A Fun Factor: 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Overall score: 9 out of 10
