OK, I'm Italian but there are not many such Italian movies. I think this plot is very good for film 3/4 but the final is very simple, very guessable. But it's just a little wrong. My opinion has a great sequence especially in the beginning of love results and great soundtracks. I would like it to work much light. The best thing about it is a great, great actor. You know, if your name is Al Pasino, now everyone talks about this performance. But it's only a great theater Italian actor named Tony Sorvillo. Yes, someone will tell me this movie and such performance is very slow, it's a lot of annoying, many silences, but I think this stuff is pretty cool, it's the perfect way to describe a story of love to a talented young man. Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and old mysterious people Tony One of my favorite Italian films.
