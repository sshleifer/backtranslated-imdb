Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays a ghostly lover, who will do almost everything to win his lady, in this case Juhi Chawla Zubair has a problem with Shahrukh and constantly calls him. I must admit, what he did in this movie was quite surprising ... by threatening the phone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the film. But Juhi and Sunny have made a fair couple of films. Though Shah Rukh's role was psychologically, I think he did a great job of playing it and probably could not imagine the role anyone else is playing. At 94 he got a prize for Dar! <br /> <br /> Juhi ... what can I say ??? She looks especially amazing in this movie! It does not always look amazing in other films, but Darra has given a great image to John! <br /> <br /> For the song ... it was nice! Especially "Magic Thirtee Eye," is one of my favorite songs. I thought, "You kill me" was very nice. <br /> <br /> Everyone can see! Fairly 9/10!
