Frank Sinatra is one of his best roles as his reforming heroin addiction back to his Chicago surroundings after having his clinic widespread. He plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can not avoid going on in his old friends. He was not originally arrested for a drug related complaint, but he was caught playing an illegal poker. The skill of the insect has earned him the nickname of The Man of the Mandan The Gold Arms, and the one who runs this game has become known as a former heroin connection. Meanwhile, Frank must take care of a woman injured in a car accident, made up of Jocch (Alan Parker), and his old girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak). Our pictures in the emotional position of Sinatra are great. When he was sure of himself at the beginning of the film, I feel good for him. However, when a promised phone call does not come one day, then he falls in despair and goes back to Smile. Later, when he finally reached Ultthur, he came out completely. Its embarrassing is devastating when she can not play the right beat. She had such big dreams, and other musicians do not even pay a little attention to her as she rushes out of the house. The film quickly came and shows Frank's drug problem in a realistic light, without converting it into a social message picture. Actors uniform fined. Elmera Bernstein scored the best of his time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can work a little more to fill her backstory. The last little pat is. There will definitely be guaranteed paths with the characters after the movie is closed, but with the death of Josh, all the looses end up gradually. Frank Mulie is in love and he can not go to jail. Also, its dealer is dead, so at least immediate threats have gone. Well, I guess in Hollywood, always a willingness to tie everything up a well-organized little package. It makes the movie harmful, but it stands, it's still one of the best and most mature films about drug addiction. 9/10
