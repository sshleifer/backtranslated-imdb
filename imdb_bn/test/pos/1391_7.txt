Seeing this strange little adventure film, it is hard to believe that it was guided by the same person who took us such a high quality giyal classics, despite the case of Mrs. Ward's The Strange Vice and the The Scorpions Tile Case, Production value, fish men's island is a recreational journey, and it's definitely more than that Deserve praise Like many Italian cinema for 70 years, this is a symbol of a successful American film, this question is Dr. Poor Island criticized by Muriur Sergio Martino's film accepts concepts such as mutation, greed and adventure, and makes it a little compelling film, which most often creates it for the logic of the curiosity ideas and the lack of logic. The central plot follows a boat in a small island crashing. It has quickly become clear that everything about this place is not normal, and soon it is half that half of the population has become "fish-men" - cross between a man and fish, which is completely selfish due to ... <br /> <br /> The fact about this movie is that if you ignore the trashy production prices, it's a lot more fun. Central monsters seem to be completely ridiculous and most of the movie sets seem to cost a few paisa - but despite the film it is shot well, water photography is a special highlight and the pacing film is done in such a way that the film is never boring. The way the plots combine is not really a genius, but it takes a lot of ideas and I have seen films made in plots that have minimized the least concern. The film's biggest position standout is definitely Los Angeles City Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of adventure movies, and therefore this missing city can not be mentioned much - but it's always nice to see it in a movie. The location of the Central Island is good that it provides a suitable setting for the story and provides a fair amount of mystery to the film, such as Martino Voodoo, which uses the theme well. Overall, this is not just a classic and certainly has a much worse trashy adventure movie than this one.
