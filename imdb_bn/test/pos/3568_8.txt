"When I die, someone will kill me, and if they do not, then what is the difference? So the philosophy of life (or lacking there) is less than one and this is less than the classic, but the funny spin off of Sergio Leon's" Dollar Trilogy. " /> <br /> In the first scene, three apparently evil gunmen entered the western city, and with the help of a mensing glover, they used to mourn all the unfortunate natural people hiding in the house. Each of these three beers, observant monitors, will notice an interesting similarity to Leon's characters for a few dollars. There is a guy in Eastwood's fifteen, one of Lee Van Clay's black suit and is like a Jean-Marie Volt Indoir, but this movie is not about these guys. . As soon as they are known as stranger a mysterious photos New hunters are gunned by them even more cool than they do not go to the city. <br /> <br /> This is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> Leon's The Good, The Bad, In the copy, three gunmen are again waiting for hidden treasure. Again again there are hunters and Mexican bandits. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a fantastic supercollo giftor to shoot a gentleman like a director general.

This movie is fun - 60 seconds nihilism, Spaghetti Western Style. There is no rule, no permanent loyalty, and there is no right or wrong - just treasure and it takes it to get it. And, even though the movie is not classic, in the end, of course. Hey, maybe we can all get 100 pieces in pieces. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is fast, furious, and worth the look.
