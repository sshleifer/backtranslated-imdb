After reading this adaptation, after reading the book, you think that some of its romance is missing. However, the story is so clever that I could never tire. <br /> <br /> Sally and Yell really keep their heart in their role and leave a lot of letters. I fell in love with stories and women again. <br /> <br /> Nice to be thankful for instructions, and costume. Despite the speed of televised plot, I do not realize that something important is lost in the transit. With lots of stomach-vibration moments it was on my bed edge. Enjoy it thoroughly. This type of television I was waiting for.
