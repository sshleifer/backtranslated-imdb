I have seen this movie at the Philadelphia Film Festival today and enjoyed it overall. It was more faulty and harder than our parents were compared to common and imagination. In addition, this film is a wonderful example of the process of discovering the truth about our parents' life after their death and related matters. However, I found the sound quality (recording and editing) relatively poor and annoying. *** It may be related to very good theater and projection status *** I am not a filmmaker / student or anything and do not demand any real understanding about the sound production process, but as a consumer, I found the audio part of the movie confusion . In particular, I've outlined the unexpected lip term (especially a long interview with a younger sister), and often the background noise level was higher than the volume of human voice (for example, when a small group is arranged in a mother's papers). Someone else has seen this movie, some noticed about the word ... thanks
