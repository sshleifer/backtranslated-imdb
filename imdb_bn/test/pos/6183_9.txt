Lubitsch's touch is much more than ever before. Anytime and very fine humorous. The plot is simple but turned out to be a delicious way by the director. Cut the film, add to the very clever and comic effect. A real piece of comedy is not so old for an XXI century audience. Gary Cooper and especially Claud Colbert have played this role, smart and money with this poor Michelle of the film. She avoided every trap from her husband and turned the situation very fun, its advantage. And there is no problem with Lubitsch, always have a happy ending. A film for men is very confident with the men. Do not let your girlfriend watch this movie ...
