A few years ago I saw "la pianost", I told myself that I would never see it again, was so strong and boring. Time has gone, but I could not get the movie and its original character, Irika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, a cool and collected, classical music expert, is so dark with the internal world and boring, fearful of suicide and suicide, which is powerful enough to destroy his claim. See more than one I read the book "The Piano Teacher" by Alfred Felix, after reading this film's controversial Nobel Prize Winner and after reading this, I saw this movie again. The second time, all the pieces of the puzzle came to the right place. Often an outstanding heeroning book is not shifting to the screen with brightness as "Le Pianoste". Three actors gave outstanding performance. Franz Schubert's piano music, "soaked in morbid humanity", is another brilliant star in the movie. <br /> <br /> I only have a problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the movie where Hane has made some changes to Eric's character than the novel. In the book, to introduce himself, the young boy, the young boy, went to publish Walter, he was in the letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed him how much he refused, he stopped contacting him. Erika never wanted to throw Walter to her in the book. She put everything inside - she did not like to work, she was not a cheers - she liked to see. The big scenes were not needed during the game of hockey. It tried to sympathize with Eric (and of course, Huppert was heartwarming), but the secret surrounding it was that - Jelinck did not write that scene, otherwise it seems to be lying in the finest movies.
