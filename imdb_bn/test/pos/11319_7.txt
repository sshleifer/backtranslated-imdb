I lived in London before I lived most of the adult life, so after the film was missed and seen only in HBO. I do not agree with anyone who thinks this should be a Hollywood production, the UK team gave it a cool and predictable atmosphere from the very first day, and I was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes on what was going on in my house. City. And of course, 7 months after 7 months of the film will happen. Yes, strangers rather than true fiction. As a result of living in both countries, this event is much more likely in the UK. In the United States, Muslims live in the Gateo and detach themselves in the United States, they are more easily assembled in the United States.
