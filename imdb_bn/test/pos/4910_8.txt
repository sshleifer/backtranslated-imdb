The story about a widowed father (cloud rain) is bringing up his four girls. Emma (Gale Page) is preferred by the big horny Ernest (Dick Foren). Theia (Lola Lane) is romance by an old but wealthy person. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to be a singer. Anne (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. The dead handsome handsome Felix Davis (Jeffrey Lynn), who is a business associate of their father, came to live with them. All the sisters fall in love with her. Then entered the tricky Mickey (John Garfield) film ... <br /> <br /> A very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five academy awards. It is nicely managed by Michael Kerritz, has a pretty good (if presumable) script and a very interesting cast (especially Lin). It was the first film of John Garfield and made him a star. It was so popular that three or four series (which I have never seen). It's an engrossing, entertaining, big budget soap opera - good value to see.
