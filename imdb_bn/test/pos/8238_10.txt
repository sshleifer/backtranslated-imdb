A light, uplifting and compelling movie. A pleasure to see Irene Dunne! As you see him, he becomes close to being in Irene Dunne and becomes the way to the gutter Wharton. <br /> <br /> I saw that every movie Irene Dunne I enjoyed and that would be almost all. Most of her movies are so shameful that the recovery is needed. I hope Irene Dunne's movie is too late before it's too late that they are such treasures. Thanks to Mars, not more than 21. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> serious overtones I agree with a previous comment about the "World and Apple pie" statement, it was a lot of highlight in the movie. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne helped write the speech along with Bhadra (Irene Dew was very good in private life and charity person) and obviously it seems to be in her movies!
