Gilmore Girls is a ridiculous event that never ends, wit, and elegance. At the age of 16, Lorelai gave birth to Gillmore's Rory Gilmore. He left his parents' house and got a job. Now, Lorlie and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends There is extensive knowledge about girls' movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoted by them. In the first season, money was needed to send Laurel to Rory to Chilton (very high school), so she was reluctant to return to her parents. They are happy to pay their money, but in return, Rory dinners with them every Friday night. I highly recommend this show I love it
