I'm not sure which movie we saw, but it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I do not know "Twins" (Jillian Chung and Charlene Choi) before watching this movie. It seems that the English translation of the title is somewhat confusing. <br /> <br /> Martial arts is very nicely done. I especially liked them, because there were many judo / rider who were portrayed very nicely. Donny Yen (Hero, see him in great acting) As a director, he knows how to shoot these scenes. <br /> <br /> Everything started flowing for me, only a scene where girls are fighting with the bamboo poles, the roof. It's really nothing to do with the plot, but it's still entertaining. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good (modern) HK action flicker I've seen a while. Although in some cases Chess, it still pull it off. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 9/10
