Until I searched the web in "Y Alice Foundation", I did not understand that the name of the film was added to the title of Levi√©s Carroll Books. The book's full title is "The Linking Glass (and Alice Available)". <br /> <br /> The film comes from Alice Lewis Carroll's Alice from a different background. Its fresh and strong character, however, is similar. Alice's film begins as a young girl in New Hampshire, who steals money from her donkey-chatting boss and benefits for Miami, plans to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She rescued from a motor home (retired from the husband to the military) who faced a middle-aged couple who made him a strange guy next to a street and from the breakup of his car (probably caused by their mechanization). <br /> <br /> It turns out, the couple's truck stop is heavily involved in prostitution and as a committed appointment, see the sweet, young Alice. Wife (Judith Ive played for some acting portrayals) has bought Elise's sexy costumes and shows how to apply hot makeup to her. Initially, Alice inactively accepted her ministry and made some strategies with the couple's instructions. In most of the movies, most of the movies are seen as being different from most of the movies, but in most cases it can be normal in what is going on in real life. The man is shy and proud and apologizes for "ending" too quickly. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful about Alice (and different from her prototypes from Clarence's Seyster Carey) She learned from her experience and emphasized herself. How is this thing really? Prostitution everywhere People are not all good or all bad. Alice leaves the motorcycle with the feeling of her well-meaning and mutual respect.
