Watching Stranger Than Fiction Director Mark Foster's The Night Runner is similar to your vegetable eating film because this art-house epic PG-13 is good for your movie running food. No, this is not a kind of movie that I like to hang on the couch and the twinkling of an eye on a difficult day. Kite Ranner is not your mainstream movie that is designed to entertain you and forget about your problem. First, no celebrity stars appear. Secondly, nothing can be cut and dry, black or white, or miraculous that you do not believe in the picture you see. Thirdly, Kitty Runner's subtitles will eventually speak when their letters sometimes speak their native language. Fourth, Forster's film is not a romantic rebuke with boys and girls, boys and girls, and then children and girls. Fifth, this foreign language film can make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your idea of ​​your life, friendship and survival. Here the main theme is the coward and is released. The drama commits a horrific crime in the first half half of its activity to cover its own personal security and honesty. All right, Kite Rana is about to free himself for the sins of the past. We're talking about personal accountability, so do not rent or buy some extravagant movies to celebrate the boy's night or to get bad taste of the day on your system. Based on Khaled Hossain's best novel, this culturally illuminated melodrama looks like one of the teenage-teen friendship films on the right and the bottom, primarily of Tom Swar and the Sandals brave fighters. About half an hour in 127 minutes, nearly two young people, traveling around Afghanistan, become dark and helpless. Nevertheless, if you can manage the rest of the plot, you will be satisfied, you will be satisfied, perhaps even entertaining. <br /> <br /> In Kite Ranners San Francisco, we received two boxes of our hero, Amir John of the Afghan Amir (Khalid Abdallah of United 93) and his wife Saura (Phaltakata's Antza Lenny) in 2000. Amir's first novel copy. Amir does not have the chance to win the life time in his life time, more than his phone hugged him and he reluctantly turned back, which was best for him to forget. Rahim Khan (Shawn Tōb of the story of birth) asked Pakistan to request Amir. Amir's servant was at Rahim Amir's house in the 1970s, when Amir lived with his wealthy Pashtun businessman Baba (Sharif's homeowner Ershadi) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. Rahim informed Amir without covering his sugar. Basically, Rahim wants to go to Pakistan and then to enter Afghanistan against war, and to rescue Rahim's younger grandson, Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhti Ari), who was arrested by Ashef (new arrivals Abdul Salam Yusufzai) as a sexual slave for his will. Cruel Taliban leader and Amir's most fearful opponent <br /> <br /> Kite Ranger changed from an extended flashback set in Kabul in 1978 in San Francisco from 2000 when life was lazy. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zakiria Ibrahimi) and his father Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmudzada) love John Sturges while watching the seventh greatest films of the West. Eventually, this sleeping flight did not see flying kites. Not only do the kids fly them, but they compete with other kids to see who can afford the other children's horses. The scenes of Kite War Aircraft created similar excitement that the dog war scene was the top song of Tony Scott. Hasan Amir's best friend, but against the Amir, Hasan is an aggressive minority. Earlier, the young Amir and Hassan faced a clash with the young Asaph (Elham Ehsas) and his two fists. Asaff was going to kill them, but Hasan dragged his slingshot and threatened to use it in Ashe. There is no alternative behind Asif. Meanwhile, Amir was ready to face the fate of his hand. Amir's father, his son lacks starvation and fears that he will raise one half of the people because he is a coward, lucky little laugh, who threw Amir out of the prophecy. However, Amir and Hasan came out of the showdown without scratch with Asif. After, after Amir flying his belly and having a new record with the skill of fighting, Hasan scored after claiming it in a beard. Hasan title mention eponymous character. Hassan claims to have fallen pit, but he finds himself in Asaf and his two-minute mercy. Assfus Hussein allowed to sleep, but Hassan beat Spad-Eagle in the small part of his ass, when Assaf resembled the youth. Worse, a terrified Amir sees an attack from nearby, but there is a lack of courage to interfere in favor of his friend, who intervened for him. <br /> <br /> Along with the extraordinary air scene of the browns, the Kite Runner is down to earth, straight-forward stuff. When Amir came back to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab, he forced the Taliban as a warrior but he did not carry firearms. The Kite Runner rescue scene is like a runaway scene from Midnight Express. Forster does not explore local politics or cast us into ethnic and cultural issues in partnership here. In fact, Trio Starr David Benioff had to remove some parts of the book and ethnic and ethnic ancestors were not explicitly defined, so you have to accept some things of faith. Forster give it a realistic look about China's China Film. Forster deserve credit for making these two hours plus epic interesting. Especially run by children, stand for their credibility. Kite Runner is a movie that you will not easily forget about.
