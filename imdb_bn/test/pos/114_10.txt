I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a wonderful work. I would recommend buying this movie for DVD because it is a movie that you can only want to watch more than once. And believe me, you'll find a little meaningful story after seeing it many times. <br /> <br /> Characters - except grandmother - all too unstable, not black and white. Although you follow the story from the perspective of two characters, there is sympathy for other characters. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb ratings for movies are very low - perhaps politically controversial content.
