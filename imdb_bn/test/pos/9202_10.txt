Frankly, I'm just glad to see James Kane. Wonderful actors With such simplicity you know exactly what he does. A real pro. <br /> <br /> I've seen the show from the very beginning and it's different - it's something that's unique in Hollywood - a new concept - not the third edition of the current hit show - <br /> <br /> I'm fun and thrilling to show- I like pacing - you'll never get annoyed - I especially like the mystery of each episode - the way it's released. I have read a great mystery fan and a lot of great mysteries but I write good stories in the show and the results are rarely clear. Also very interesting for me, maybe I do not play gambling because there are different challenges to 'gambling players' - I was fascinated by the number of schemes to loot in Las Vegas. Music: I like music at the top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show ... tone and atmosphere sets. Just wonderful. And of course, James has ears.
