Although I'm not the first movie I bought for myself, it's often the most I've seen. Animation is well-crafted by experts in Tokyo Movie Cinema, and animators often use shiny tricks to hold the sun as a "lens flare", so that the camera becomes leakage (and "the camera operator's hands" clear the lens!) Etc. Although the film is becoming "Animation's Gadget-Fest", it is still intelligent, but the liberal appeal of such strategies makes the image much more "realistic" than the cartoon. <br /> <br /> <br /> The story has many split plots that do not appear to be much more than one another until it is combined with each other, as the authors also self-deliberately acknowledge. Each main plot line has its own music theme, which comes from the "Pop Wiesel" [Hampton and Plakie] theme of love from "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi and Janit]. The transit between the platinum is a little diverse, but consistent. <br /> <br /> is really a wonderful movie; There are not many original songs, even though the new song "Spinning Song" is shiny and enjoyable. Highly recommended.
