I have to admit that when I first started watching this movie, I had no formula. So started a little confusing for me. However, that movie does not reduce my enjoyment. Characters can be more complex than the first release, and this is a memorable movie. At first I heard it was a real "Hollywood" movie. Although it clearly lacks its stratotypical "gun and fist" ingredient, but the talented actors like Martyn Shane and Sam Neil have more convincing acting than this. I'd rather see a film with more substance than shooting any day.
