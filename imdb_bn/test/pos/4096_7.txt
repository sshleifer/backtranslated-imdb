This version of "The Lost Harrison" is not actually a bad movie. I think the problem is that people like to choose musical instruments, especially in the 70's. I saw the film on its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, especially music. (Bart Bachchach was always a favorite.) The story is funny, well played, and technically it's great. Of course, there are numbers of one or two rather silent dance, but hey, you can not win all. This video is on my video and I see it every time ... and I enjoy it every time!
