I saw sleeper cells with a pitch worried about not being able to glorify the terrorists. This mesmerizing series not only manages the responsibility of responsibility, it also creates almost every character depth and material. Did Odhid Fehr just show the screen on each screen? And although his character is a charismatic leader of the Jihad Terrorist Cell, he still has a hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy held his own well, although in some scenes I wondered why he was not shot on the spot why Scott wore on his face. <br /> <br /> The series is headed by two professional, Fehr and Ealy, well-written characters - all of which were credible and tragic, and tackled in the story of disconcerting problems. Being married to a Muslim herself, the built atmosphere was quite realistic. For me, personally privately, was that there was more women and more? Most of the senses, as well as sex scenes, were some. Nevertheless, this is a raw secret series that will make you think. Some people give such a more juicy role to the fayer and allow him to walk with him. She has an incredible screen presence and emanating him off with a weird kind of normal energy.
