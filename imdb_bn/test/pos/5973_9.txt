I agree with other critics, this is an isolated movie, it will be difficult to meet again soon, although it is only for quality, it is worth watching again. The complexity of the letters, the incredible cinematography and the superb aspect make the movie worth the mental value. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that pulling themselves through the ice to protect the two sides from a snowfall. Probably, mere physicality, the most amazing performance I've ever seen. In fact, though not episodic - the flow of stories - a movie of this memorable scene. Particulars, snowy scenes, ruined farm scenes, clashes in the houses, interrogation, "basement" scenes, "enthusiasm" have passed ration. All stand out like jewels in a necklace. <br /> <br /> For me, religiousness is not overt. Actually, it will not be allowed in Soviet films. I see this as an existential paradigm about the quality of life. Here is a story where the hero - and he becomes a real hero - villain, and the weak becomes stronger. Is this determined by a mysterious process or circumstances? Have a transition, but it comes inside or without? To understand the movies, you must see the movie, because the story can not be discussed without much. I can not say enough about acting. It is difficult to choose which one it can raise for me. I am not familiar with the 70s Soviet film and are not familiar with actors, but they all are fantastic. Please note how I use the children of Larissa Shepitko. They remind me of the angels of Geotoro's child. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is obviously a previous relationship between soldier Tsatnikov and interrogator Portnov, but it is risky. And the final scene is a bit uncertain. But these are the quibbles compared to the total experience. This is a movie that will mark you for life.
