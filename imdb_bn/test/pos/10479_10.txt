Two perfect, perfect films considered as "Babes Feast" and "The Horse of Mouth" are two original painters. The main lines of "Babat Feast" are not here, because here some other commentators have said, "An artist is never poor," but the two lines come before and after: "I was able to do my best when I was I gave them a lot of happiness, and I cried a lot from the heart of the artist all over the world, give me the opportunity to do my best. "<br /> <br /> I tried experimental multi-media music in San Francisco Iyetara've spent nine years to build, some singers, actors, designers, etc., involved in raising money for production and support the artists that I have done very well in their attempt to expand the money. They were like Babbet: they were frustrated to get every dollar they needed to do their best work. Babbet's art is good for French cuisine, and for him his best $ 10,000 is to act in Frank's best art. After a few years after the political exile in France, after splitting with two careful spinster on the coast of Scandinavia, he suddenly received 10,000 francs; he did what every real artist he did: He saw that he had an opportunity to do his job unexpectedly very well, and so He does this. He spends all the money so that he can do a very good job as an artist. The film's cover is that we do not know that he is an artist, until he is actually cooking and serving food. Until then, she considers a working-class French lady, who is somewhat frustrated with the businessman and very serious (her husband and son were killed in Paris in 1871). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> So the author has set this dinner into a community which is probably no burden on what they are taking. Babbett did not cook this food as a gift to two spinsters or religious communities. The goal of achieving good news is not among the members of a small religious community. In fact, he never left the kitchen, talking to any of them. After the meal, he is sitting alone, drinking some alcohol, giving little attention to the guests' reaction. She is basking basink to having the opportunity to finally do her best work as an artist. <br /> <br /> This story is so convincing and so important that the general appears unexpectedly - as soon as it is known immediately, a general will know what he has placed before, and it will be grateful. The artwork shown by the audience is a tragedy in a noble task, in which one person is not worthy of gratitude. He was happy, very happy, he came, he was the only guest of all time he mentioned at the time of the whole dinner, he was the only one for special treatment - not in spinsters. But he does not plan food that he will know that such people will accept it. <br /> <br /> Anyone has the opportunity to enjoy Paris first dinner in any first-class, I have (my dad was Navy Attache in Paris in the 1980's and was my honeymoon in France), and for making it, Bob's Satisfaction, and diners, it's the joy of joy, absolutely believable. If the industry has the power to fully associate the recipient with the feeling of happiness, it is a good French cuisine to cook and serve in France. These film claimants claim about the impact of the transformation of great art. Before dinner, members of the minor religious community are dredging, old resentments. The old song failed to recover good fellowship; People ignore them, talk on them. But the fate of the great industrial experience - can enjoy the taste of food and torch for the people, even if they have no idea that they enjoy a great artist, keep them in a forgiving mood, reconcile them, and make them happy, to love each other Encouraging and thereby have a sacred effect like God to bring peace. Today, in the modern industry movement, this claim is available - that industry can provide traditional religions to make mankind more peaceful. In this way, in contrast to the commentators who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian faith, it is more correct to claim that the film claims that the art can not make the wounds harmful in Christian shows. For my whole year in the art world, I would like to say - The industry that comes to peace is not possible for religion - too much and illegal. But it's a beautiful feeling and this is the second major theme of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> One last note: At the time of Babbet's arrival at Spanter's house, special French General Golife was named. In 1871, father's husband and son were executed, and he imposed military rule to flee. At the end of the film, the General General said that he had enjoyed some military coups in Paris many years ago (before 1871), it proved that it was his host in the same calorie diet. The General General told the story that the French General Galliphate praised that food chef as the greatest woman, the only woman who risked her life. Of course, that lady was a bobet. So, surprisingly, the same French generals who said that he honored his father on all other women, was responsible for taking him away from France forever.
