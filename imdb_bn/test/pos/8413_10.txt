From the direct followings of the last episode of the previous series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jim Hacker has now found himself in the 10th Downing Street as the Prime Minister of Great Britain instead of the Governor, and a member of the government, he is now leading his mood. <br /> <br /> After resigning as the previous prime minister, after all the strategic intervention by Sir Humphrey Appleby, all of these resigned as Yes Minister. <br /> <br /> Sir Hamfrey Appleby is now the head of the civil service. <br /> <br /> I think this series was better than the first series, or it will continue until the first series is unfortunately.
