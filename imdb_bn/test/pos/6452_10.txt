The street of the city is surprisingly talked for a modern modern technological film created in 1931. Also inspired by the powerful magnetism of Gary Cooper, who can not be respected, the listener strengthens the attention. The plot is quite wide and clear. The situation, decorations, each detail is exceptional. All actors are above average. I guess the director and his staff can highlight how editing, sound, lighting, photography etc can be. I can not find any flaws to understand that the street scenes (abstract travels) can be found in 1931 with the background of large motion picture screens. I would love to see this film as a fantastic and a very alive one. Gary Cooper to charisma.
