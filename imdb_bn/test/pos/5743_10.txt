Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> There is a new name for Horror: Garnani. The plot is simple but efficient. The actor is good ("Michelle" and two cures for the killer) and the dialogues are even quite tricky. From the beginning to the end, the action will cause you to breathe, you can not just escape ... blood, horror killings, funny moments and outside of any kind of system that goes beyond distortion. "Deja bhu"? Of course not: "Granny" is not another slash movie, it's really a classic of its own ... it qualifies for success and gets more success with its reprint. Congratulations!
