Although the brain bullet is higher than the smallest film without any question, it seems to be a brief part of writing rather than a film. And her smart ass comment sits a little hard to feel very sorry for the teacher when she gets him. But why did we know why he got so awake with life after entering the bullet in his brain. This reasonable short film contains a lot of detailed packs and it seems to me that it should have been expanded a bit - it seems that it will take almost the same time to get the details in detail at once. Fast A little more comfortable in the final episode and less confrontational, this picture will benefit slightly. Despite these allegations, Bullet In The Brain is a great work compared to the small and even full-length movies. For the quick joke and the current climate of Hollywood action, it should be praised by manufacturers for trying to create a truly psychological and educated film.
