If I rate the film a bit more, you can blame it on the feeling. This is one of the first films I remember and remember completely lover. I saw it in California's Drive-In the late 70's. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV so I was premiered for the movie, and the film was not frustrating. Originally, it takes complete unreasonable features of the Mupp pet and transmits it from a road to Vaudville. Frog Kermit is a Quest to Become Famous; Because he does not want to take a champagne bath and travel to the private jet, because he "wants to please millions." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They sing "Moving Right along" , A song that has always attracted me with my enthusiast tune and the discovery of his friendship theme and shared discoveries. He encountered enough Hollywood movie stars to complete the film of Stanley Crumaran, including Richard Prior, Steve Martin, Edgar Barzan, Milton Berl, and Mel Brooks. Especially less than the Brooks, and you think Henson could have cut some of these Kyosos if he was not afraid of star accusations. However, the same thing as the road trip movie is that the first person who fulfills the first demo of Dem Diwes is <br /> <br /> "Children" movie. The dream of Hollywood always seems to be growing around them, when breaking a real fueled Hollywood set with its true joy and mystery. I'm sure this Jim Henson was concerned with his personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> This is a long shot, the best movie with Muppet. If you or anyone else thinks why Muppets were so popular in the 70's, but considering how poor these movies have been for the past decades, I think the film was young enough to provide at least one formula.
