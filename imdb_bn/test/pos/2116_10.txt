All interested in Texas must have this DVD. It's just a good movie about real Texas with great scenes. To get it right, take a bunch of Texans. Hollywood will not have gotten it. Still, there are so many fine things in the movie that kept in the movie and did not even think about it. However <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Guests are not seen as guests. Each star fits perfectly and does not get confused with the movie. Guest guests mix so perfect that when the credit rolls you get back to the film to find the character. Stretch's roll died, it did not do any good work in real life. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is completely different from the very beginning, it got a small "hawk", but it's okay. Somehow the story works. "Hockey" stuff looks like a school special but it looks credible and natural. <br /> <br /> Someone else does not use the Sony Priw line before anyone grew up. That was icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Right with a collectible, accurate country, Sugarland Express, Junior Bonner, Texas ville, The Last Picture Show, Giant, and of course Hood. <br /> <br /> Gigem Aghazi 86
