I did not know to know what I went to "Hunting Night". I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> This is basically a mystery / thriller where this girl can not remember anything, 'Rescue' by a person who drives past. Two fast friends and lovers and together, they try to determine what is going on with him. With some unforeseen flashbacks and scary memories, they finally go to the bottom and the last is quite cool. <br /> <br /> I really liked its setting: with a lonely, next-generation Paris backdrop gray sky and lots of tall buildings. Very metropolis Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity. <br /> <br /> It was amazing in the 1980's; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
