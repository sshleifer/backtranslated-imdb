With the most recent release of Carlos Solar's 'Fados' in the United States (Aliet Limit Art House is free only), this is a great time for the republication of this great documentary by Amelia Rodrigues. This image is a collection of Amalia's Vintage film in Portugese and American Television, along with other clips of other films, including one and her mom, which can easily reduce the tears in the eyes of most people. I saw this exquisite documentary the first few years ago, when it gets the unwanted "Art House" release (it deserves even better). Fortunately, Amelia's best recording is available in various recordings "budget line" recordings (which is usually found as K-Mart, or Best B), or if you search for something, someone can make some fine on the original publication, either e-bay, Or a distribution service that supplies specially to valuable European imported CDs. There are at least two versions of this documentary (Original Portugas version, no English subtitles and American version of Portugues with English subtitles, European versions can not be played on most USVD players due to Paul's color line system). Not rated by MPAA, but there is nothing objectionable.
