"Van Voice" is at a high speed that reminds me of Indiana Jones / Star Wars films in some ways - like you're fast like a train or a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> This is a romance, mystery, thriller, and fars; It is also very clear, with clear observations on the reaction of the French society during the Nazi attack at WWII. And it is an exhibition of juggling involving 7 main characters. Scenes were historically correct (in my eyes) and gave a wonderful feeling for the time. <br /> <br /> All the actors have performed well and played great, but the IMO was the most spectacular one by Eshabil Adjani, playing the role of self-centric French cinema star; He did not play the role of a young actress only half-old, but he also acted in his wonderful wills, but the spectators saw that he was half as serious as a person, rather than a gold digger. Introduce the film to its character and strength from the beginning to the end. Roger Ebert reviewed until I discovered that he discovered 48 years of age at the time of the film. What beauty !! <br /> <br /> I finally expressed gratitude - it is satisfied but what is happening in the main characters lets you write your own decision. <br /> <br /> Another user commentator's opinion - not reaching late; You will be there from the opening scene. Good advice <br /> <br /> I gave 10 10.
