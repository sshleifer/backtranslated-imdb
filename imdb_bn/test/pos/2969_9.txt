A gifted high school graduate is forced to play a state-of-the-state high school football game with a bad attitude. When he meets an interesting local girl and falls down, she realizes that if she is playing well, she has a shot in the 'full ride' scholarship. <br /> <br /> All the time, these plays fall into a formal form and say that the same old story is a boring and confused teen. The matte sub of the flower rider must of course fit this profile, but at the bottom of the page we usually see this description as a more unique person. Matt is the center of action and he is a realistic teenager, both confident and weak, optimistic and in turn both. Affected by Emmy, matte character and heart grow in a man. He formed friendship with his team colleagues, which as an athlete and influenced his growth as his team player. <br /> <br /> Full Ride has all the elements that we like to see in a movie - great acting, pretty characters, exciting sports scenes, ruthless drama, and a love story. Still, somebody else has seen on other elements of this material, Flair Ryder is offered with sincere and sometimes even moving performance support. Perhaps the most impressive about the full ride is the sense of reality. Although the author of the previous comment expressed disrespect, (obviously a disgruntled student who received a poor grade in his film class for very obvious reasons) Director Mark Heigher played a key role on the basis of credible situation and position, and did a great job life in a small town No? These characters rooted in realistic realistic situations, which often made the most compelling entertainment. At one stage it is a love story, on the other hand it is a character study, and the other it is a simple football film. All of these ideas form a collective vehicle together.
