This film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (especially acting by the gentleman character actor Richard Karl), so that he is expected to sell a story for an upcoming game. However, there is a bad storm and their car stops mud and so they are forced to find some places to spend the night. Fortunately, there is a nearby palace, although it seems very strange that people know the writer inside and he says that he does not understand that it is the house of a person he knew (and abusive). However, when it appears to be a bad and fabricated text, it is not. The writer is a part of the team acting around its author, and its part is of a broad form. However, the partner of Reus, producer and his browbeaten assistant house that is happening in the house is the mystery of the murder and the whole thing is quite funny. But no one can understand that a fleeing dog has become loose and he is going to enter this satirical little plot - for some wonderful twists and turns. So when it seems that a real murder has occurred, then the actor is really scared when Carole and his sidekick have become convincing, it is all a threat. Although I have explained some intrigues, there are many other aspects of the film that you have to find yourself - and it must certainly entertain and guess you. <br /> <br /> It was considered a B-movie public domain, I did not expect too much for this little film. However, when the film became much better than the average flick, I was thrilled - in a old clayed plot a dark and windy night spent in a palace with a guest and guest's guest. Plus, when the plot of the film was very good, the dialog was even better - a lot of amazing intelligence and a beautiful light-hearted pace. Have fun pleasing full and good value in your time.
