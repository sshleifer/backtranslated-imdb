This movie is the best one I have ever seen. Just remind me of this movie on TV some other day. It's like a dam coming back to me. I have been more touched by a movie than this one. I could not cry for about two hours after the film was over. Before any movie has moved me that way. I was at the age of 15 in the movie and I did not see it, but hopefully I can buy a copy so that I can see it at any time. If someone recommends you watch this movie with them, go .... Do not be frustrated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peggy freeze
