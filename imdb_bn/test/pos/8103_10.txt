"The Great Dictator" is justified, one of Charlie Chaplin's most well-known films. It is notorious for Adolf Hitler and Nazism's henchman. Until it was seen, I only knew about his fame. Now I know how much the film claims. <br /> <br /> This film mainly shows the exploitation of some of the tired, ambitious, low-connected and influential dictators of Tamenia, Adinod Hindeke; And with him, his closest and favorite staff: Field Marshal Herring and Hare Garbitch. Also, it is a reminder, emotional and often cruel Jewish barbarism, the exploitation of a brave warrior of the First World War. <br /> <br /> By closing this plot, I want to say that the film has different qualities, it's both unique and wonderful. Although the comedy is both verbally and sticky and loyally, it shows how the film's fullness makes the Nazi or aggressive nationalism very serious with different identities. Chaplin's unclear acting skills are far more in the film, he keeps it up and up until it explodes easily. As an ambitious Jew, the position of the Poult Gourdard will be rebellious and Henry creates a nasal, calm-death-deadly-heart attack attack line for astonishing philosophy. Also, one side of the film makes it special: it does not interfere. It's not "secret", it's not a business secret. It is an "overt", blatant, clear lampooning of both your face, Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> To summarize briefly, check it out. Just look at it, you'll see it.
