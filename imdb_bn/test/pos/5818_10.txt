Life is crazy You are crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We're all a little mini, and a little Moscow. Sometimes it seems good to be intelligent ... but then what might you be missing? <br /> <br /> You have to be. You do not have to park in cars and do not have to scream people in semi-randomly, but you can not hide yourself behind a screen (or dark sunglasses) and pretending that everything will not work properly. And sometimes, you really have to throw air alert, why are you living another? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to rate this love 'Cassavetes' compared to other movies because they all work 100% unique and each express their own and personalize our life explorer. In that sense they are all great, and comparisons are irrational. Certainly, this movie is a crazy, sometimes narcotic, but finally, all the movies that are surprising and free - you do not know what's going to happen next, and you're never going to think, act, or feel the characters next. Do not characters themselves- and do we really want to live our lives in any other way? Contrary to Moskowitz, you can do a great job and make money in exchange for your IRA, but you can still live an adventure life in your feelings, your soul, and your life experience. Yes, we can have it in both ways, that shows us what Cassavetes is. Thank god no one whats
