After editing a series of B Horror movies, known as Evil Ed Hall "The Loose Limbs" series, Swedish film and total madness about a person named Ed. Ed has become so crazy that he thinks he sees monsters and monsters, but in reality he knows that he and his close friends, such as his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie again in 1998 and I was baffled by what I saw. Today, this movie is considered as one of the dark comedies. The movie is often fun with funny scenes, there are still some vague moments. <br /> <br /> This is a cool flashing but do not expect anything extraordinary. It's just a fun movie that is good for showing some of your friends for some laughs. 8/10 stars
