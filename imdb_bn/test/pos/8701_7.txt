King Vladimirs (Angus Scream) is a vampire in Romania, but a paw of light that does not want anything more than peace and harmony with mankind. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), the cruel creatures of his heart (which you will see him as soon as possible) Three female students came to study local people, but found themselves in Vampire legends at the time of their mistake: Vladimirislav was killed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Scrimm? I can not say that I want to say, I had some less expectations after watching other full moon images (especially "puppet master" and "daily toy"). But despite the really bad animated effects of ghosts, this movie is really well done and very interesting to watch. Lots of blood, a good plot and backstory (the Blackstone story was surprisingly refreshing) and even vampire's false new cones, which you think would die. (Perhaps I'm wrong, but perhaps it's the first picture to be fired from the gun). Along with vampires and blood, you share the nudity (exempt, welcome,) and I would like to see scores from musicians (not sure enough to get credit, but the people involved include Stuart Bratman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Jerezka Have done). This Fall 101 is All Way. Hack, you get even two sequels, which is a true horror photo symbol. (Of course, some bad movies have also received seagulls - did I mention "puppet master"?) The Romanian theme is well done and the film seems to have been made by the Romans even if I guess their names correctly. And score - Music - really standing for me as a beautiful change of pace, very mood setting. I love Richard Band, but I'm happy that another musician was shot because he nailed the atmosphere on his head. If you like Vampire films and want a little diversity (one of the Eastern European varieties), it's worth watching.
