This movie is a "fool" comedy of the year, and perhaps probably the best thing in Mike Judge from "Office Space". If you are a Mike Judge fan, or enjoy futurama shows like this, you are doing a serious helpless work for yourself, avoiding this little known, limited release. Although DVDs have very few "bonus features" tutors, the film must be "interesting enough" to consider it a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> This film is about a military package named Joe Bourse Seer (directed by Luke Lil Wilson) who is a top secret army test partner designed to save the soldiers during the peace, so that they can go to the heat during the war for war in our country. . However, things take an interesting change because the general responsibility of operation is to prostrate and that the test is all forgotten. Bauer, and his Sidekick Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) both of them have sparked in 2505, where the American population has become increasingly stupid due to natural selection. Now Joe and Rita Frito (played by DAX Shepherd) have had to find their way into a machine to come back in 2005. <br /> <br /> Have I really enjoyed watching this movie? Interesting satire in the history of the United States in the last 50 years, and how mankind's progress is continued in the next 500 years. This proved to be the most by advertising of movie, which has become the staple of American culture. Through mainstream media such as South Park, it is easy to see how conclusions can be drawn in the future, profanity has become a marketing tool. The name "Food-rollers" changes to "But-F ### ers" and shows a billboard "If you do not smoke fluid ... F ## # you!" I can not laugh at Carlos Junior's role in this future, their slogan "F. ### You ... I'm eating", and their automatic kiosks by their self-advertised "Extra Big at ##Takos" (With more molecules)! There was everything I was going for in this movie. Nice, sharp, wicked comedy, as well as a harmful plot, these DVDs are made for ages. Be careful, however. If you are not a mic judge then there is no difference to "Beaves and Bottled", or there is no sense of humor, then this film is probably not a good match for you. Otherwise, I would say that this is probably the most fun movie from 2626 ... I mean 2006.
