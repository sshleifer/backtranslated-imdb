It has become very difficult to find a good lady movie, this movie was a great thriller. <br /> <br /> There may be good production prices, but what I was about was mysteries and twists. Before watching this movie there was my original reservation (due to the cover). I was afraid that it would be too bloody and poor. I was wrong <br /> <br /> Although there are many scary parts, there are plenty of mysteries and plays too. <br /> <br /> The performance of the Dead Line was better than you expected from a micro budget horror flick. The character was trustworthy <br /> <br /> The film is really thrilling and very scary at the moment so it makes your seat until the last credit roll <br /> <br /> due to its production value (the word is not very good for example) 8 / 10.
