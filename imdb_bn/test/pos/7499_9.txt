George C Scott is sometimes the best screen performance. Chifsky's screenplay, satirical dialogue is perfect ('Where to train your nurse?'). As the Rigg disaster is surprising as the rescue angel who saves Scott, the whole throw. This is a ridiculous and serious movie. This is a movie, 60's, but it is not a date in any sense. What is it about, chaos and irrationality of system chaos are timeless, near the person. And "we do not cure nothing. We do not cure anything" Combining (actually controversial, like none other than Scott) the cloning of his modern science and the other 'wonders' are written this morning. <Br /> <br />
