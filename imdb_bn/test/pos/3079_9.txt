This movie is amazing! I can see it again and again Robin Hood is completely cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is with the most fun character, Latrine and Sheriff! After the space ball got annoying and stupid, this one always keeps your interest! ODDERF was a great movie and never got boring. The role of a great throw is, and it is perfectly spoofed, and makes so much sense, and can be seen repeatedly! If you do not hate the comedy then you love this movie but you can only see it, or do not think Robin Hood should be cut off. But this old story gets annoying, and this movie gives it a great new smell!
