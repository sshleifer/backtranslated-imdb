Keep my focus throughout this multi-level thriller. It can be the opposite human behavior on how annoying and informative are. It is also the guidance that past wounds can inspire current behavior. Sandra Bullak's companion can not save anyone, it's a favorite. However, all credible. Sandra did a great job. Her character, Cassie, comes alive with all her pain and fear and defense. She is a living and so her life experience finally brought her to a cure moment. I enjoyed this movie very much. Tom Landers
