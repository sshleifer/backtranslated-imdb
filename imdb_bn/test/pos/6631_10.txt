When critics miss the most obvious things in art, then I should not be surprised, because they are people, and most of the people are idle in nature. That said, the simple idea that the 1968 film by Songer (Songmaker) of Engmer Bergman works a lot of harm for the fame, the complex, and superhuman film fame. Compared to her more painter ornamental predecessors, compared to Persona and the Wolf of the Wolf, another classic film by the direction of Shem is visible. However, the original word appears to be quite apparent, because the absence of pop music psychology and lack of respect for the glorious horror film of Wolfhurst, is one of the best films made against war, but not as a war film, nor a pro-war film. For example, it would be one of the best films to be ranked with wild strawberries, as well as one of its best images, if not the best. <br /> <br /> Before that, it is truly The people are more realistic about the mentality and the desire to survive. It played Max von Sedo and Live Olman John and Eva Rosenberg (probably a request to unexpected American spy, many European intellectuals were absent), two musicians who used to play local Philharmonic orres before the war, and they had a small plot on an island, in Greenhouse Worked back to live in the working things. The country they live in is anonymously as an unfamiliar island, although the image was created from the small island of Bergman, which was at the end of the north of Gotland in the island of Sweden. It seems that their country has fought for aggressive country for years, or perhaps engaged in civil war with rebels from other provinces. All these deliberately left idle, this war is meant to symbolize all the battles. This is as strong as the credit roll, warts warts on screen starts with quote. This includes these quotes from American military figures from Vietnam to Vietnam. Early scenes that describe the enthusiastic nature of their rural life, and then the war arose, where even old men were recorded, an air attack invades the land of Rosenberg, such as flying enemy jets, leaving the bomb and chemicals seem like nature. An agent orange weapon. One plane is hit, and a parachuteist blends and ends hanging a tree. John, who started the film as a spilling couture, refused to go and help, so Eva was alone. John joined him and they were shot in the pilot. It seems that he is actually an attacker, or perhaps a part of a rebel force. A group of government soldiers immediately stopped in their homes, asking the questions of the dead pilots, then their couple is advised to leave their homes, as the investors are nearby ?? In the film's DVD, there are incorrect interpretations of a small-scale film like Bergman Pundit Mark Garvis, which has film commentary. Like other critics, he claims that Jacob is a quizzing, who cooperated with the attackers. However, it is clear and sporadic, because Jacob is with the fundamentalist government. As proof, first off, attackers are repelled after the Rosenberg land attack and after their agitprop shoots shoot. We know this reason because the government questions their next question and the words written on their faces, this film is seen as the supposed proof of their cheating and Jacob works with them clearly, fascist Big Brother statics. Secondly, Jacob is taking the decision that any townman is sent to the attacking camps, to co-operate with the attackers, and Rosenberg is among them again. Thirdly, in the temptation of Eva, Jacobi tells him that his son has gone from the military to the holidays, and apparently, if he was an attacker, then he would not talk to his son so much joy in the state service. Also, rebel forces are not the official forces, and do not give government leave. Finally, Philip was clearly with the rebels, or the organization's organizers, and why did he kill a colleague? <br /> <br /> The gravis and other critics who miss such a brilliant and inaccurately incorrect explanation and flat-out keys, and the exposed point of this movie asks for the ability to understand any and all aspects of Bargman's films. It's a wonderful and gorgeous film, and Bermans canon is very much, but how less critics and spectators have been frustrated by understanding its complicated message, rather it's just a cheap, lazy and easy to defend against the war, and it's easier than its two predecessors. Movies. And that, long run, Shame is a real shame.
