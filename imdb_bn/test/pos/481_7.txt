If you want to see a brilliant performance of Micro, you will not see this version when playing full-time with expert timing and panic ache. If you want to see a Hammy version with Arid Idol Stringing around the 1972 English Gentleman's private club society, it will be seen. It's a lot of fun and Gilbert and Sullivan play a good role, but after that, leave the Canadian Stratford version and rented out. You'll see the difference between good and great. Better than Gary and Brian McDonald's and Stratford Group.
