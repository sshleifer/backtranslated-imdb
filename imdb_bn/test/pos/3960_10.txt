Let me make that clear. This is not a "good movie", but I'm happy to see that I'm very happy to see it and that it plays a role in my DVD collection, that's nice. This is the final PG-13 template, it is the college which we imagine that when we are young in high schools, it is necessary to suspend so much disbelief that it may be on Mars. It is so healthy that even when it wants to be dirty, it will not make your grandmother uncomfortable. It needs very little sophistication to watch (actually, thinking hard about what's going on will come your way towards this work), it seems to me that I feel 12 times again. And that kind of experience is worth more than $ 9.99.
