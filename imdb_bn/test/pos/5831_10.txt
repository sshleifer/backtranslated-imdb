Ozzy is an old TV series of HBO. It shows life on a security prison named Oswald, but the main plot is focused on Emerald City, which is one of the prison levels. <br /> <br /> Oz is an extraordinary plot and outstanding cast! There are a lot of characters and almost all of them are very interesting. Basically they are divided into groups (gangs), Sicilianans, black people, Aryans, gai√©s, Latinos and many others who do not have a specific group, but Ryan O'Reilly (Irish). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All are not only exposed to violence, it is all very intelligent and smart, because nothing will happen without reason, all connected and guess is very interesting! I really love this series, and who want to see something intelligent, very well produced and very well produced with performance, must see OZ!
