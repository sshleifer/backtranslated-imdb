Plunettes and MacLean A nice update to the tradition of SashBalking, by predicting Hello Depp and his pirate friends. Voice is comical, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. One can see the Eral Flin and Basil Rathbone. <br /> <br /> It starts with fewer gears as soon as the introduction of letters and the establishment of social discrimination and rebellion themes; But the boys fell into high gear when they hit the highway. Robbery with grand and stylish, romantic touch that swashbucklers with bread and butter. The actors are engaging and helping the little bit of the material, which is fairly hollow There is not much depth in these numbers, but they have played with such impressive and skill that it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Muhammad was told about modern music. The music of the period is more quiet, which seems to be out of place. A classical score with the Celtic rhythms for the action piece could work, but more modern, adds an edge to the works of rebel rock and techno music. Since the characters are more legend than the reality, the accuracy of the music seems meaningless. The pieces tend to fit the mood of the broadcasted scene, so it works mostly well. I just miss the "Stand and Distribute" of the chattea and how they wonder. Do not make any mistake, it's not a serious film. It is pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows some of his father's visual flash, but I do not think we've seen many Oscars in his career. She seems to understand the material here and pulls a fine film. Over time, he may prove to be a name. His father took some time to mature beyond the visual style and became more circular director. It is of course the one to visit for an entertainment evening or a swashbuckling film festival.
