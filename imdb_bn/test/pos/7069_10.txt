<br /> <br /> A movie that demands a lot from viewers, but most of them are frustrated. I remember the Mexican people (who tried to support Mexican movies or were interested in seeing pictures of top Mexican stars), when I went to see half of the people left the theater, it certainly would not have expected a kind of movie. I think the people of other countries who dared to spend 2 hours watching it for a long time, "bad piece" To understand Croññica de Añasununo, one must be Mexican, and one must be familiar with the lower middle class (or better, be their part). There is nothing accidental about this movie, the family is declining and most of the families in Mexico have shared. To fully accept it, you will see it with a wide open mind, it is not a movie that you fully understand after seeing it. The elder brother does not let anyone sit on his red sofa, the sister wants to leave anyway, no matter how little she is going, the younger brother is going for a trip, and all she wants is yellow radio, prepare the soil morning for the family, how severe the situation is and Intolerable Who knows, how long after the father came back, which means that the mother can stay on such a night that can be fleeting at any moment and the whole of his son is repeated by repeating ... The stories surrounding the house are a miracle (and so the movie), a travesty is looking for her penis , A factory worker and attempted suicide, kissing his girlfriend, an interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister After riding his bike subtled by a fat man? Wife? Mother? ... the song does not play much drama but it achieves a lot, it's not more than a trap drum, mussel, some strings. Thanks a movie that has been completed and released. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican movies !, and Mexicans even less understood, it does not matter whether or not a matter should be felt with it. <br /> <br />
