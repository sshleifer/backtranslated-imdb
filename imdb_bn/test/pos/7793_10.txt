The first time I saw it (1994), and the last time I saw it was before writing this review. It still laughs to me my brain ... After all these years, it will not be frustrating. Truly intelligent Bollywood comedy ever made. It is an Indian film which has earned its ability to compete among the top 250 IMDBs. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan are probably one of their best performances in the comedic lands. This makes it a little time classic, which is its comic time and amazing editing ... Jokes are refreshing and not cheap. It's actually a film before its time. If you have not seen it go see it now !!!!!!!!!
