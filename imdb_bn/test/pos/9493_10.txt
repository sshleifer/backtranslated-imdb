I have seen some episodes in this series again very bad on VHS tape which I recorded the series. I'm glad, though I did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has fun with friends and family and gets much trouble like many eight-year-olds. All ten epochs are very beautiful. The "mysterious food" consume me as a symptom, but parents are trying to eat the tongue of the parents of the children! And Godzilla Versus Smoke mentions twice in the brain that no episode can be bad at all. I like more "Ramna's bad days". Although Ramona has been frustrated to go through rough days, she is thinking of taking vengeance on her friend Haver's uncle (pre-PC factor Barclay Hope), who always tissues him. "The Perfect Day" and better. <br /> <br /> Lori Chados Boms played Ramona's sister. I swear that I saw him something else, but IMDB does not list anything alongside this event. Unfortunately, this series is not DVD. Why do I make every vague show in DVD rather than anything I want to buy? If there was ever an injustice!
