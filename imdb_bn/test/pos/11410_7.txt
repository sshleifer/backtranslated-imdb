About the Simon Wests PG-13 Thriller A Babysitter who does not get boring scandals sitting in a palace, is also not enough to be original and dramatic. Although there are some elements of mystery, good eye candy and suitable characters, the film is only known to me what you did last summer, because it does not take it seriously. The performance was right, but nothing special with this flash, I'll skip it, unless you're looking for a medieval movie, you can sometimes find better movies than lifetime, not just the lifetime but at least America or somethin, haha. <br /> <br /> 7/10
