The film was praised with appreciation of Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger of the 1990s, and I enjoyed it, but this TV original is just as good, and in some ways it has been fitted more appropriately. Claire Bloom is not a BRASS win, but she is still confident and has cast her cap on her favorite author (played with her best performance in Jobs Auckland). It may be compared to quiet, quiet, and less emotional Attenborough movies, but it justifies justice for a remarkable game full of meaningful conversations. You will still cry in this version, but you will probably not have musical prompts to stop. There is room for both <br /> <br /> - and it has been phased out, I would say that Accland / Bloom is a little more trustworthy. But they are both excellent.
