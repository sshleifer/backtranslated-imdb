As I hope, many reviews of this movie (not just for professionals and amateurs), focus on film ideology. The reason is that a film about secrecy inside the sea (Aka Mark Adentro) Obviously, this is a real story in the name of a notorious Galiciono Ramon Samadoro, who fought for many years for suicide rights, denied the right to the Spanish constitutional court and who was good - I did not want to destroy the end of this film for you. <br /> <br /> The real life Sampadro created national debate over the espionage in Spanish. There is now another rhetorical assistance in the international debate on the hot button issue, producer / director / writer / songwriter / editor Alejandro Amenbar (Abre Los Ozos, 1997, and The Honors, 2001) "Biopic", The Saga Inside. <br /> <br /> But as I'm saying (Deaf ears?), your opinion, pro or con will not affect your movie ratings on the ideology of the film. You are not supposed to rate the philosophical or political message that you want to do in Amberba. You are supposed to make film rating as a film. Maybe it's a very idealist, because none of us can completely abandon our evaluations from our ideological bias, rather than idealists or not, this is a goal. <br /> <br /> Forget about philosophical and political issues for a moment. As a picture, Amenab has become one of her most elegant and mature jobs. He does not focus on social debate. He does not concentrate on Sampadro's legal / political struggles. As a man he concentrated in Sampdro, living his bed in his brother's house. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the movie began, he has been a quadrangle for 26 years. This situation was brought, as Amenabar shows us through flashbacks by a diving accident - Samadoro was confused by a beautiful woman who threw water, surrounded the pigeon, torn his neck, and nearly drowned. As a quarter, he finally started writing poems, in which a book was published in Cartes desdele el Infinio ("to hell from hell"). Sampdor's book has become the best seller in Spain in real life. Perhaps Samador's artistic work was taken as a cue, Amenba made a beautiful poem. <br /> <br /> Most of the sea is set inside the Sampadro bedroom. Focus Bardem's complex and magnificent performance in this scene. As a quadrangle, Burdem moves his head and is limited to talking. He mastered the subtle changes and the transmutation of expressing a deeper character with multiple, intellectual methods of life. The combination of Baram and Amenbar is often the philosophical of the couple, but always humorous humor, aesthetic passion, music and women, and sadness and sometimes even the bottom of the surface is not the ugliness. Different intrinsic emotions sometimes break like waves of the ocean skin. <br /> <br /> People often communicate with Sampdras in a complex way. Among these others included his father-in-law, Manuel (Melabel Rivarata), who was his chief caretaker from Samador's accident; His brother Jose (Cels√≥ Bugalalo), who is one of Samadro's voices, and who has an underlying problem (looks like Jose could save Sepadro from sinking?); His nephew, Xavier (copper nova), who is probably the most burden for him; Right-to-Die Advocate Jenny (Clara Segura); A lawyer lawyer Julia (Belen Ruada), whom she wanted because she had a degenerative disease, Cadacill (including subcritical Intosomal dabanote entrepreneur, subcortic infarts and lecovanopholapathy), and thus she was more sympathetic, and she fell in love; And Rosa (Lola Dignas), a local woman who works in candlelight and moon light as a DJ, who has heard about the media about him, who wants to satisfy her desire to live and fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> In this picture, large amounts of these characters are interacting with the Sampadro of his room. Samadoro's father has several innate characters, which are remotely remote and an infamous and media-conscious Pastor, Pad Francesco (Jose Maria Pao), who has done the best to change Sampadro's mind through philosophy / theology. Apparently mistakenly labeled "comic" - it is a ceramic comic element, but the scene is primarily very serious). <br /> <br /> The picture that takes place in most of the movie is immediately added to the couple's major changes, the greater effect is the settings. Sampadro has a nice, large window in the house, which he said he is satisfied with observation of the world. Perhaps more importantly, he has regularly portrayed the window as the opening pad through which he is walking towards the sea beneath the mountains, which he always liked and which was the most powerful force in his life - it was small in his living conditions and his dynamism took away . Amanbar gives us a fantasy sequence of imagination in one of the sea flights. It is shot nicely, the lower corners of the mountains (probably from a helicopter), until we follow a wide open ocean flow, which represents freedom, infinite and natural forces in this film. <br /> <br /> Other important changes with Sapredro reached the settings, eventually going to a wheelchair (he denied them otherwise, said that they "laughed at his instability") so that he could appear in court to file his case. Amenabar shows us a deadly, tragic itinerary, Sapperdora's life and car works from the window to the world. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree with the validation of legalization, it is difficult to deny it a good performance, good script and well-built film. You can not believe that it is ten (and if you disagree with the legalization of legitimacy, there is no more chance), but it is a fine example of artistic, sophisticated filmmaking.
