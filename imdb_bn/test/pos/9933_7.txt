An opera Deva has an accident, take the role which leaves the door open for her understudy. Betty (Marcelach) is now the star of Mac Beth, but someone hiding in the trench has an opera out of her planned out. She gets out tight to beat her, putting needles under her eyes (so she can not stop them) and killed opera company members in front of her eyes. Certainly, more ambitious films to blend in with Shakespeare's Macbeth of Argentina, "Opera", certainly must be that the version of Macbeth's version of MacHeod's version of opera Huespe and the like of Argentinean Shakespeare's death and unfortunate behavior is Shakespeare's Is used. And like the Ravens of Dansin's Castle, Skyming predicts Macbeth's death, an important part of the fall of OPERA's Ravens killers. Besides, like the old game, the murderer works on the advice of his lover. But as far as I can not say that Oprah is intended for the reconstruction of Opera or Macbeth's Phantom, the compositions are very fine. It's just a standard Argentine masterstroke, and with it it gives a vibrant color of otherwise quite basic thriller Gothic mystery. <br /> <br /> Although this film has a heavy soundtrack like Downside, it is not right with this movie and the final scene of this movie is a bit weird. <br /> <br /> All "opera" is a defective masterpiece but still good.
