If you are a bobice in a house you do not know or if you have seen the original and enjoy it, it would be a good choice. Ignore reviews and posted here, how I rent this movie due to the memory of me being a teenager. This film (of course) has changed the original story with some young people, for example, there is a problem of mobit for minibut on his cellphone and he has to accept a child job to pay his bills. However, it's quite a good stick to the original story line. If you are related to Babuet, the house does not know and it is quite suspicious of normal pop and cracks. When the killer is shown he is very awesome and you find yourself yelling at the girl "get out of the house". If you have never been in a child or a situation, you probably will not be related to it and do not like it. It's all about understanding my fears
