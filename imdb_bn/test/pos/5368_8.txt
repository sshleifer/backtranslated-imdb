A young couple - trapped in a small California desert city of the population - Father Ben (Tough Charles Betman), wife Nicky (lovely Ahna Capri) and their daughter Katie ("I'm the uncle's disembarrasser"). Violent lunatic Even worse, there are devil-based disciplines that kidnap small children for their own brutal purposes. Director Bernard McKay, William Welch and L. Who Working from off-offs and inspired scripts. Jones ("Devil Times 5" director Shane McGregor came up with a bizarre story), slowly related to strange weird plot, slow speed, and immediately created a vague, lively, mysterious ogg-trap atmosphere. Strath Martin Dock distributes an amazingly robust and robust performance as Duncan, who is a gentleman politician of the evil community. Unusual character, the top-rated cast of actors qualifies as a fair asset: Jones, Brutality Sheriff Heilzbaro, Alvie Moore, the friendly local Toby and Charles Robinson, shine, as a devout Pastor Jack. John Arthur Murray's brilliant, polished widescreen screenwoman, Jamie Mendoza-Nava's amazing scores, and wild, enthusiastic climatic black mass performers are in the same pace. The idea is simple to open the toy (a toy tank is coming true and a family with a crusher opening in their car is really exciting). Excellent eerily vague end, too. A delightful idiosyncratic and under-winner.
