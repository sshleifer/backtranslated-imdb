Monkey is one of the best shows ever seen on TV. When I was young, it seemed to me, I would go home to my grandmother every Saturday and I would start the TV so that I could see Moni. I love it It was sure to leave the Kikas action scene, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song which leaves your head and sunny dubbing. But it is a strange thing in China and Japanese actors are portrayed in Japanese and Japan, but it is no bar to make TV show fits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Piggy (Toshuiqi Nishida), Sandy (Shirya Kishib) and, of course, The most memorable and most favorite character, Monkey (Masakaki Sakai) who is going to collect a bunch of world scrolls from China to India. <Br /> <br /> Monkey is very funny and it's magic.
