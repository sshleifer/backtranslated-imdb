It is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-played film. It's funny and sometimes ridiculous. The last is a little frustrating, since it's trying to wrap everything up into a package very clean. The film is considered good for its invaluable vintetas: Jane Austen Staging, Camping Trip, for example. B & H does not try to reflect the main attitudes toward homosexuality and bisexuality. Most of the letters are mostly taken from sexual diversity. In that sense it is a delightful vacation from homophobic society. And it celebrates a flexibility, a loosening of strict sexual divisions - perhaps a happy harbinger to come.
