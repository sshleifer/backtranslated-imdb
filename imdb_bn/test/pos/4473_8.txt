A movie about the relationship between a man and a leopard, which is very memorable, "the English patient", even the role of Ralph Fiennes in the desert-rock hill, and also holds the body of his boyfriend. "A feeling in the desert", the main character carries a leopard body on the desert-rock hill, but on the opposite side (counting or unconscious contrast?). Historically very briefly extending from Balzac's story, the film is perfect but no less a treat. The final shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 of 10)
