Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra movie never disappointed! Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayena is a romantic classic. Dil To Crazy Hei was fresh and was perfect to see. Mohabatin remains one of my favorite movies ever. And there were super-corrosive wizards. Dar, not the best, the romantic thriller that is different from the previous movies, but certainly a clock value. And repeat the SRK a villain law by expelling me through an excellent performance in the bookie. At this moment, he got an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deal to support him. <br /> <br /> It is not just acting before commenting on acting, but rather nice script which makes it worth the watch. It's great acting congratulations that it's writing. The story is gripping, but the characterization is what stands out. Comedy tracks go as well. But the film has a tendency to move too much to romance. The visitors are bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns. But the movie is still good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is also sympathetic and cruel. You are bound to cry at the end. Juhi Chawla is beautiful His screams became boring after a while. But he's nice in facial expression. But in his last scene he was brilliant (though he was overshadowed by SRK). She is a writer's backdated role that makes her very favorite. Sunny Deol is enough. Its character was very likable, but very perfect. And it gets annoying after a while. He does a good job though. Unparalleled khair is really fun, but his role felt from a little space. Tanveer Azmi is well supported. <br /> <br /> The songs are enjoyable and in the right time. Magic Thirtee Eye (Magic in Your Eyes) is my favorite song, and the presentation is about 90 films. Tuur front (you are in front of me) and hi hi (here's written) excellent love song. The Darwaza Band Car Lo (Door Lock) is a decent love song. The instrumental song is full of perfection and naughty wedding songs are danced on the Solah button. The film can not be perfect, but your favorite actor, especially if it's worth your time.
