In this era when almost everything is done on DVD (I can see my Mother the Car Collection now) this movie has been inappropriately neglected. Along with 60, there are countless stupid comedies from many eras that have received at least one cursor DVD treatment. Despite the genius associated with the creation, it (even Arthur Hiler, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgle (notable for co-authors Tutsis) even involved with the debut of Dustin Hoffman). It's obviously a product of the sixties but so much about the era of that era. All the movies reflect the taste and customs of which they are made. In the same year, another stupid essay was released as the president's analyst. This image was finally released from the DVD and created the following one culture. There are many memorable bizarre, silly, mad moments in this movie. Of course, it is drawn in wide strokes and it is stupid to have full music, but it is part of its character. It creates its own illogical universe. Whoever is responsible for the production of the DVD for the publication of Columbia Pictures (I think Colombia expressed it) voted for the new release, it gets my vote.
