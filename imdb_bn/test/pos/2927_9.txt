I say to you, though, how curious it is that in such a statement I am not sure that the number of vain and oaths will probably count about 200 people, because I have finally heard that the maximum oath sound is 165 words in the sound park. Compared to this, it is absolutely funny as it has the oath and the title of the words which you see on your head for shooting. To specify it, look for the survival of kartenagulira hyanasasiyenera father and Chris from annoying voice and kailerao pedophilasa kartamyanake would save (caught like a hunter mourning detalainera), and when they arrived they piodoke tracks and then piodo "shot himself"
