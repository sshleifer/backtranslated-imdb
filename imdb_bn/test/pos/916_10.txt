"Rouge" is part of a triangle, but stands very own. This is not a kind of signal. The very end, which I will not disclose, is related to three movies together, but it does not make much confusing, not seeing the other two. <br /> <br /> This picture makes me wonder because it is so subtle, simple and easy, but effective, mentally and intelligent, as any big budget philosophy or miracle melodrama. Kieslowski investigates the opportunities and fate incidents here. Both themes are loosely woven together with the stories. The film is a bit of a puzzle, but the message is pretty straightforward: everything happens for a reason. Love is as long as our destinyies as long as we open ourselves to ourselves. The title, "red" refers to the French flag, where red represents the "Brotherhood" or Brotherhood. Color affecting the movie's visual. I tend to think of it as a symbol of love or emotion, or life. It's great when a movie gives freedom;)
