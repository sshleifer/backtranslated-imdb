Simpsons must start with Christmas special "Simpson's Roasting on a Open Fire", which had a basic drawings and did not laugh at all, but this episode probably smiles first with it and the show gets better from here. Good This episode is located around Burt. This episode swims in a test of Martin and falls into a highly gifted school, it burtts Bart to follow his friendship with his father and defeat all of his companions. The episode is ridiculous and shows what happens to be the greatest show of all time. Overall fans of this event will love this episode because it features the character exactly the character after 20 years. So watch this episode of a Season 1 package and initially enjoyed Simpson, which meant that people laugh at people. I rate this episode 73%.
