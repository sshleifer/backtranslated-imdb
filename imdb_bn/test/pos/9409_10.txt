I heard about this case, but I did not really pay attention to writing the whole book of Fahrman's Scalcel, etc. However, this movie involves the murder of Martha, Scakel brothers, murder, Fuhrman's involvement and the results of his investigation. I especially liked the flashback view with Martha talking about her last summer. The actor who glowed with his life literally and was probably like that of Martha that is even more elegant. It considers Marta as a real person rather than a victim. I'd definitely recommend this observer.
