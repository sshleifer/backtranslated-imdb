I like this movie. It has never been the first film master p. It is based on the story of his life. It's a low budget, but it's very good. It shows how masters grew up in the projects of New Paul New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Master PK not only started this film, he was also the author and director of Chand Jones. There is no limit ice cream party in the DVD. This film shows how Master P becomes very bad and how to deal with the things around him. In this movie there are many of the Limit Record Roster. You can buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to watch, whether you like rap, or a master pan fan. I will not be spoiling this movie for you. As soon as you can get this movie and see it. You would like it
