I remember this picture nicely when I saw it in the theater. I recently found a copy in VHS and it was held in my memory. Although not explicitly a "big budget" film, the acting is quite credible and scenes, local and costumes are very well done. I just saw more of the mammoth photo, but when you see them, they work well (remember, the SFX was done without the convenience of the computer on that day, some poor devil really should have kept all the hair and mesh tusks on the real elephants!). .. The same effect is used in "the search for fire" elephants. Better than the average adventure film and an opportunity for the star, Rod Cameron is able to play something without a cowboy, which he did very well in years.
