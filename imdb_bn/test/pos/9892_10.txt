When I first heard that the check out was a self-autobiographical suicidal party, my first thought was how the brainless, wasted and then a comedy. I was skeptical. But I was wrong. I absolutely love it. Cast, funny one liners and especially the surprise. Suicide is a subtle problem, but it is managed very well. Sunny yes, but where it needs softening. Checking out also deals with other common issues which I believe that many of the family can be related and it is a joke and humor. I highly recommend checking out A must see. I look forward to the public's release.
