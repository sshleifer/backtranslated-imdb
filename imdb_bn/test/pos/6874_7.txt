A wonderful mix of comedy, romance, and medical disorder, 50-ish swinging-a single doctor, tired of going to Rock Concert with Newberry Airheads, and meets her round with a patient of her own age. Julius Epstein's screenplay shows most sophistication, although she does not have enough material to fill the last three of the film, and one can almost return the movie. The sub-plot does not work satisfactorily in the hospital's poor business investigation, and it seems very sensitive anyway. Still, Walter Matthews and Glenda Jackson are a great team supporting the fantastic team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney. Director Howard Geoff puts popping on it all, and even when Epstein's one liners Neil Simon feels like refusing, Zieff happily zips right along. The results are dry and sometimes quite sweet. Followed by a failed TV series *** *** to ***
