Likwana Blues Rub√©n Santiago-Hudson adapted his life story for a fine stage and as an even better film writer. This bright film is rich in color, fine music, bright editing, George C. Wolf sparks a splendid screen and a past stunning movie that makes it mandatory to watch a repetition! Yes, it's just good. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the author's life, because the child is 'Junior' (Marcus Curl Franklin) vivid sympathetic Rachel "Nani" Crosby (Sampa Markerson), a woman who is from a mental hospital in the south.

The boy reminds all the lessons of life from the residents of the house - rescues strange characters with painful postings and the Nasi mixed mixed family family by him. There are many extraordinary reasons for outlining the unusual characters of the house: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Moses Def, the beautiful Carmen Ezo, Louis Gosset Junior, Jeffrey Wright, Arnie Hodson, Charlton Woodward, Jimmy Smiths, Patricia Wetting, Messi Gray, Liv.

Ipatha Markarson has completely submerged in this role, he illuminated the world of chaos as a cause. He gave an offer of the most amazing performances of last year and the film was released in theaters instead of Habib's film, but he would like to put Oscars next to his Golden Globe Award without any doubt. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is exceptional and plays a story like Wolff acting and master: like a razor in a jazz piece, she spins the matrices' story scenes as well as the tiny moments of conversation with each character and junior, with incredible blues, jazz, dance and fun Top clubs dance festivals at local clubs A crew with extreme care of the production crew has mounted this little miracle and has not disconnected from the speed of the story for a moment. Highly recommended, almost mandatory to see! Grady Harp
