Cute characters, nice animations, dynamite songs ... all this and cute kitties, too. There are many nice humor, but there is no real danger, so do not worry about your little ones. Two farm dogs steal the show, although they are only present in two scenes. Artwork has a linear quality that can close some people, but I think it's charming.
