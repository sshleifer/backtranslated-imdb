From the production of Los Angeles in 1982, it is probably the best example of an illustrated level musical that you might face. A remastered digital transfer is issued on DVD in 2004, it is quite stunning. Harne and Lansbury give performance in their lives and the rest cast is quite clearly seen in the production of electricity. Of course this is the sound of music and songs that make it possible. If someone suspects that he is one of the "great" of American music form, listen to it. The set is clever, smart and cameras, to make use of the plot and to change the changes in faster scenes, making it a stage production that activates without actually surrendering the truth. A central, moving-capable and rotating platform, Mrs Lewat's Pie Shop, on the side of the next store. Various steps near it and running stairs allow for the rest of the execution. The torrid story of revenge, killings and injustice to the great liberal generous torch with dark humor and comedic moments. What does Hitchcock do for Sondheim Shower Shop? An important function of American musical theater is to give an electrical performance here.
