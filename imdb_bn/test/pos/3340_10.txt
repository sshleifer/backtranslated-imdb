Bruce Hack I did not know who was before watching this picture. I just saw Mog Doc, which was right, the only problem was that the mug had lived a very content life, and the dock was good ... content. The story of the hack is full of all merchandise tragedies sold on this day, but it carries a lot of heart with it. Although the film did not come with such tragic things, but someone could understand that Bruce took the price of the message. There are many elements that make its heirs IE. Pipedalian discovery, where Bruce can actually play music by touching people. It must have been challenging for documenting the 'Scatter-brained' output of the hack, which was imaginative (even rap music) fall into each musical section, but the director was able to cope with the concurrently together and keep the spirit. And Cast ... what a group of Bruce surrounds himself, but what do you expect from a telephological guru, traveling with kids, fighting against the music industry? I recommend this film to anyone interested in music history, it's mainstream, but that's important.
