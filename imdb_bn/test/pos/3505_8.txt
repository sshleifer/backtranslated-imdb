I'm going to be one of the most fun movies I've seen for a long time, and the script of Cohen's British gangster is ridiculous. This movie has a classic classic written on it and it has some great lines. Ali Ji Indahouse is a good-time party movie which will literally leave the audience to laugh literally. Definitely Ali G voted and kept it real.
