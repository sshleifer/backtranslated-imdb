My original title for this review is going to be "End of despair, film winning." But I actually thought about this one at home. These are not fairy tales of most movies, it takes different forms and when it is frustrating before it ends, it gradually shrinks and strikes the original with a satisfactory vowel. <br /> <br /> A man named James Haroon, who is a writer named Jeff Garin (who wrote and directed Kurt), is a struggling actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and is related to his obesity and his inability to find someone's love. Yes, it sounds corny, but it tests with some elements that make it a bit unpredictable and in fact you want it to be longer. The last came suddenly and said, "What is that?" But once it starts to take a toll, it really makes you smile. <br /> <br /> It has very serious importance, but do not be afraid, because it is very fun. Some scenes make a huge smile and those who have seen Jeff Girlline's study-up can recognize a couple (initially when he speaks for his nephew's kindergarten class and bomber on career day). It starts from a few serious notes that you do not expect, but it's fun to follow, entertaining and quite appealing. This is a movie that you see and enjoys always. And as I said earlier, at the end, the first seems to be irrational, once it takes time to think, it is a real joy.
