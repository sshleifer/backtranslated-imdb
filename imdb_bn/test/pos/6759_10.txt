Stevevich's endless inventor and his tactics are still amazing after 70 years of animation fans. We can now live in computer-generated technology, but in 1934 everything was a fantasy that would not accept "no" to answer. Whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he made. <br /> <br /> He wanted to see some really wicked things - Every fantastic piece of scrap is called to serve: old shoes, chicken bone, pot, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats ...
