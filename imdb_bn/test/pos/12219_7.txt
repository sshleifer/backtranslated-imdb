Can i say I got up early this morning and started the science-fi and saw half of the first season and got it all out. Strange, unusual, and bright. It all gives potential, and first thought I think this looks stupid. This could be the best thing in the X-file, but as always, I will never see my views. I'm telling you, it's scary and then suspicious and then mellow ellow. In the end you have Miles as a love puppy with a strange pet that is a new species. You have two people on the run of authority. And the killer tsunami strikes! How nice! And I have mentioned a potential killer of Miles Pet (well left of his species). Surface spin and twists it with a great show that delivers it all.
