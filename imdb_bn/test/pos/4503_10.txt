It's absolutely our darling of 2007. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It never fails from childhood to adults. <br /> <br /> A brilliant insight into the lost culture and the very best way to understand Persian culture and heritage is an exceptional story in its own right. It is both sympathetic and thrilling, raised and endlessly full of sorrow, joy and depression. <br /> <br /> With the great performance of the camera and great technical expertise behind the camera, it's really the best. <Br /> <br /> The highest recommendation: the real part of life which festive and informs.
