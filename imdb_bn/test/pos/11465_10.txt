This is a horrible film that crumbles people into pieces and does not want excitement. This film has the same horror, mystery, humor and even a slight light nudity, but nothing is big. Linna Kogli was not at the top because she was "Living Dead of Return" where she danced naked on a crypt, but she still essentially characterized the same character. Before going to Dallas, Catholie Padwell has become a virgin and pure character, and Amelia (soon soon) got acquainted with the Kikisar, it will be dark matron in the house of the sexy and gentleman. After taking the house surrounded by him and Linna, they revive the bodies of their dead friends to cross the living limit. I've heard that many people compare this movie with "The Evil Dead", but if there is anything, this film competes with similar rival Freddy Jason. This movie series is much more than that!
