Master Kislowski came up with an idea in 1993, from the White (a visual comedy film about marriage) to Blue (from a illustrated visual masterpiece about a woman's life) to finally reaching and eventually reaching out, how human relations have been pictured around the world. Red (a wonderful composition to deal with people's interaction). <br /> <br /> When I'm not going to waste this step, I can easily say that in the decade of the decade, Red is the best movie because it has a strong message <br /> <br /> The picture is a bit slow Slowly starts, but you hide enough to keep the order through full movie. <br /> <br /> performance is perfect, magnificent. Since the character is completely realistic and they are not clutched in any way and can not expect less than an actor and do not be frustrated ... seriously I believe that Jean Louie Trintataniate has at least qualified for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Gebiegun Prisoner's music is amazing that it is sometimes the best musical score. Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also outstanding, he got an Oscar for him (and deserve to win). <br /> <br /> Overall the movie is a perfect 10 and those who love foreign movies and who 't. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> I did not understand the way the great fiction that performed this great compilation
