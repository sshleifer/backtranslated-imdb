Like many other commentators here, I hope the music taste which will satisfy my curiosity - and I've got more than I wanted. I have heard and saw a powerful, subtle, sometimes hunting, sometimes touching, lyricist, sensual (honestly) and absolutely stunning blend of music and musicians. I reminded me of several forms of Indian Music (East Indian), but at the same time it was very different. <br /> <br /> The Turkish singer Ianur (no voice) from Babul Jula for the first time bursts of small Turkish bars. Selim Sesler (now big fan :) :), I've enjoyed every minute and will not end if I want. /> <br /> I have seen and heard one of the best musical specs for a long time. <br /> <br /> I like the soundtracks CD and hopefully I'll be able to find it online anytime soon and for the old and latest album of Babul Jullar <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , The music is still etched in my brain and I do not want to go away from it. Turkey and especially Istanbul now seem to be such a beautiful and exciting place - and I'm going to start saving today to save it. <br /> <br /> Faithfulness - it's a jewel.
