Like the second end of Chaplin's Essen movie, Carmen Cecil B Demil parody of the same drama play. Demil's accredited film did not affect the comedy king much, which he later admitted to his autobiography. <br /> <br /> Paradis Chaplin did not have a new test. He has already done several of them, such as his previous past and his new job, and will continue to do so until the end of his career in the film (for example, in a King in New York). <br /> <br /> Chaplin Dawn Jos√© is a very good painting, and Edman of the Purviance as well as Carmen. We do not act as we are used; Charley is loving, loving and very far from an innocent small woman in Adana, but Chaplin's intention was not. A Barclay of Carmen is slightly different than the Chaplin-film, but very different, but it has good elements. <br /> <br /> While the original story is arranged very differently in the original drama. Don loves very much with Jose Carmen, but not alone in that case; "Carmen, Carmen, (The) loved by all men under the beautiful Carmen, (96)," But he has a great advantage that he is an officer, and we are there; This is a ridiculous perspective seen from famous stories about competition, love, greed and respect. Thank you for Chaplin's and Pavillion's performance and the awesome, awesome music of George's budget that I highly admire could actually be the best of the comedy, it was taken into consideration. It could have been. But unfortunately, even though it's a pretty good comedy, but I do not think it's okay to blame people who accuse Mr Carmen of being a great composer. But it is important to remember that there is nothing to do with the lack of talent, rather the result of the conflict with the business. After completing his last film for Chaplin's company, he refused to sign the Essayar's contract again, Paulis, and Chaplin actually took revenge by editing all scenes edited by Carmen. Thanks to this, the film is a bit confusing and has a lot of unpleasant scenes that are more annoying than the fun and the film has become Ben-Tertin-characteristic - Tappin plays the role of Reddados compared to Chaplin-Short. Naturally, Chaplin was frustrated when he did what he did, what he did in Assan, and he had to stay in bed for several days. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, a Barclay Chaplin fans of Carmen are highly recommended by the beautiful music admirers.
