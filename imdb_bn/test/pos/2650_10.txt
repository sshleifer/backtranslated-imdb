Must be a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange, "Of course there was no question about it" which I had to see. However, I put it too far because some of my friends canceled it with comments like "very annoying" or "nothing happened", "complete wastage of time". But when I saw the picture on the Internet of mysterious black consolidation, I saw a glimpse of the 2001 amazing experience: A Space ODC I have no doubt that I will rent the same movie in the evening. <br /> <br /> It has turned into the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, showing a very good picture or picture can be wonderful, but showing a film with the same quality of each frame adds a whole new dimension to it. My god ... I like my friends very much but it is very sad that I can not share anything with them that excites my heart and my soul flies like a bird in the sky. That's the thing, my friend, beauty. To show this film, the beauty of our technically advanced, intelligent shallow, consumer driven fast food is very much involved in Western societies. This does not mean that I refuse these fleeting societies or do I keep an eye on them (and not even Kubrick) but only if they stop for a moment and take some time, they can be even more so that we can absorb the perfect beauty of the world we live in. To do this, and to slow it down at the elegant speed of the movie and move it between dreams and dreams. There are good opportunities. <br /> <br /> It is possible to get so called "natural high" when we go to this place. Our soul can do it whenever we meet pure and unlimited beauty. And sometimes in my life this is not called by someone as "natural high" or "spiritual fierce" or "samaddhi" others have become more intense. Yes it is a regular orgasm ... much more intense actually more intense. Many religions claim that these special feelings prove that they are right. Are they right? Such a direct answer for me would only be prevented from the impenetrable mesmerizing mysteries of the universe. In my opinion, the film tries to publish the same mystery through the filming of black unity and by telling the following about it: "Four million-year-old black consolidation remains completely inactive without Thursday's only powerful radio emission, its main objective is still a total mystery." Bowman Experience that Trance is the same superb visual observer while I am in charge Nata. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the mystery may be frustrating for those who need direct fast food answers to the major theoretical questions. But instead of giving us comfort, we are constantly annoyed by the awareness of the simplifications in these answers. The subsequent doubts and discomfort created will indicate our deep intellectual activity as the source of these deeper problems, although there are really easy answers to blame us. But this film shows us that when fast antigenic statements do not wake up anything without any doubt, then we can always rely on the incident to make the world somewhat intuitive. From the moment you can understand that beauty is such a thing that can only be presented as an event to us, and sometimes not as "the thing itself", mysterious black consolidation is more annoying, not terrible or annoying, rather interesting, interesting and even May be comforting. There is no need to answer what we really need to contact the greatest forces in our lives. When we let the mystery do, to embrace it too ... we can finally rest our souls. I'm sure that even though a movie that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth, it can never be overcome. Especially now we are no longer the greatest director who lived.
