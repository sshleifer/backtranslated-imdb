Chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Ellen Cassidiyan was incredible. They were totally convinced and their role was truly liked. Imelda Staunton played Mrs Sucksby brightly conniving. Even though he was fiercely opportunist, he was able to finally express your sympathy to him. Rupert Evans plays decorations and gentlemen with low humps and snacks. He was a scene runner. The story itself was very unique, just as it was said in the way. Victorian England's setting consisted of two gay lead characters, which were interesting and delightful. Some gorgeous and unexpected twists were active and that really kept the audience involved in the story. A wonderful cast and nice story made this picture fantastic.
