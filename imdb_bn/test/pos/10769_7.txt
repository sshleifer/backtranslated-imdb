Surprisingly enough, the Independent Film Channel showed this picture this week by showing cart beer byte - although the beer film was the second place in the triangle and the picture was the first !!! What were they thinking ?! Although these three films are probably based on the life of this great Coco Kishin Karate Master, but you can not act in this way, but do not remember - especially in this first movie. Certainly, the man evidently did battle the DID and killed a calf, and later a beer (actually, he killed many calves during his career and killed), but at the end of the film in the early 50's, heroes actually beat about 60 people. And many of them kill ruthlessly. I just can not imagine that this happened. So I have tested some and saw that most of the details are correct, this movie is a bit of a perfect shot! Yes, he killed a man for self defense and yes he followed the widow and his son and worked for them for a year - tried to forgive them. But the end of the film is great to watch but Hogwash. Seeing one of his opponents jumped on his head and jumped all the details of glory and otherwise the Japanese government stopped Omama to protect the society! The film is entertaining and the fight is excellent. There is no complaint about action or acting. The only small charge is the camera work - this is a small topic during some war scenes. Despite these minor allegations, it is one of the most enjoyable films. In many ways, the filled Karate Master theme is very memorable for Jyotichi films - which are very fun to see but many exploits are really impossible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie was a dubbed version of "The Death Champion" and I also saw it. This is not a bad dubbing and it was characterized (a big plus), but I still like the subtitle version.
