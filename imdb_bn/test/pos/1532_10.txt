I really love this movie. It has a very real feeling. I believe it was not popular due to the content, but due to its content it makes the movie more important. <br /> <br /> This is an "A" movie and I highly recommend it. If you like the book or movie "1984", I think you would like it too. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say, at least with emotional and physical abuse, quite beautiful. Not for weeks in the heart or stomach. No Gore, but his film is so emotional to the generation in a psychological context that blood and breathing is not needed. <br /> <br /> If you are not realistic or not a toxic person then I do not think you will enjoy it. It leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling of human being, which they are capable, and in the interest of our government (s) our hearts do not have personal personal interest.
