Second picture of the triangle of the Romani people of the Lacho Drum, or Safe Journey, Tony Gottffe. This movie is a visual representation of romantic life and historic records in European and Middle Eastern countries. While most of the scenes are planned, rehearsed, and staged, this is not a conventional storyline and the dialogue does not explicitly explain the visual activities. Instead, the film sometimes shows a glimpse into viewers, sometimes in these ages and in different countries, from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain, these people give a deeper perspective. <Br> <br /> The importance of music in Romani culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. This is an important part of each event and an important way of communication. They are all expressed with music. Dance is another important activity. Like Romney Music, it's special and deep personal, some know exactly how they're alone. We are providing glimpses in their daily activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. Rather, it is a convent of their culture, they have created music and focusing on dance and which made them unique. <br /> <br /> m Galitf represents a psychological group in a positive way. However, we refuse to reject the non-Romany population, witness the rejection, and the separation. It seems that the cultures that have developed on many cultures and have been inspired from different countries will be confused because there is no place in the psychological way of the current society. <br /> <br /> Other quarterly movies Les Princes (1983) and Gad Jo Joe (1998).
