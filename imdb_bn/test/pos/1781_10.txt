Dialogue five was an interesting observation experience for me, because Kansławsky was asking the audience by uttering. Three have focused on this chapter, and Kislowski combined both the characteristics of both good and bad (in one case, almost helplessly bad). With such cruel character, I felt happy that they would be punished slightly. However, when it comes time for the murder (and the subsequent effects of the murderer), Kisłowsky takes an interesting angle and thinks in our mind that "Are you not as guilty as this person?" Visitors' indirect address makes this type of decolase end five, which Koslovski (normal) does not have a literal limit of their themes. Just as other parts of the Decalogue do not take the theme of their order in its literal sense, not even the five decklaws. It asks us, what is the murder, who is guilty of murder? What should be a good punishment? It's a fantastic film, Kieslowski ideal, absolutely stunning.
