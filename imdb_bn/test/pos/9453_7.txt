The film was fantastic and everything was very wrong, "Football" was wrong in the scene, I wonder if those who are working in the movie have seen a football match some time ago? After all, I do not understand how he wants to try for the boys' team? Football players and girls do not play in the same team and this is the rule of FIFA. And when they found out that she was actually a girl, they did not let me start ... Secondly, players can not paint their face with colors and can not play like that, but FIFA rules are not mine. <br /> <br /> and do not start me as they achieved the goal. It's ridiculous to be completely unrealistic. And all the players thought that they do not know Jack about football. <br /> <br /> And when Duke was training Violet, why did he concentrate on fleeting shooting and shooting of Drebling? Or was his only shooting problem?! And why did all the posters in the wall have players from Chelsea? They do not like any other player from any other team. It was the only party they knew ...! But the movie was better than that and I enjoyed the rest, just training and game scenes were unreal for me. They really advised anyone ...!
