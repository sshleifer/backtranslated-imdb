I absolutely love this movie as a child. I can not find it anywhere! I was just mentioning some friends of a few days, and none of them thinks! Can anyone help me? My older sister remembers vaguely. Another movie I thought it was half live action and half animation, but I could not remember its name. The characters were animated and the background was real ... I think it sounds about a kangaroo, and I believe that the setting of the film setting was in Australia. I'm going out of my mind trying to collect copies of these movies which are a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood. Edit: I have searched IMDB for this other movie and it is known as Dot and Kangar! What I had to do was type "kangaroo" in the search bar under the letters, and the movie was going to a bell in the name of the movie! Man, I love IMDB! Thanks!
