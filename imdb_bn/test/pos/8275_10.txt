During the 30-day Aggressive Arcade Games, Chapett's leader Brittany was involved with her younger sister Janet (Simon's female protagonist) and Elano (female protagonist of Theodore) during the 30-day Aggressive Arcade Games while playing against her female counterpart, they attracted the attention of two rogue foreign siblings, And he wants to steal diamond, but it needs a way that their enemy Jamal's Do not draw attention. 2 The evil siblings, Claudia and Claus, encouraged the rebellion between Alvin and the Britishers, and decided to use them as boys and girls for their loot (more claudia than Clauses idea, later it seems very dangerous for children). The two siblings offer a proposal for boys and girls - through the air balloon, leave 12 drop points in return for money by ordering their drop and / or money order from dolls (which are similar to children), promises that anyone who won the money will receive an indecent amount of money. But different different talks can be said about each other, Jamal's pregnant people bind him, but who is Jamal? Is he friend or foe? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> A highlight of the beautiful animation, the absence of strange humor which today's family films and compelling songs (guys and a stand out of rock and roll) Eagle eye pants will probably notice that Brittany's character design has been avoided from the animated series, to give him less round face and an apparently permanent glow is added to the cheeks (which also shows Janet and Elano). <br /> <br /> An ear-off for Nancy Carte, Bart Simpson's voice.
