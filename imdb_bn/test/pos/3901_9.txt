It was a great movie, which really attracted me. I am a great fan of William H. Messi, and he keeps an amazing performance. Combined with his great feelings, the way his character broke the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his action. I waited so tightly for myself (and limited myself, as a believer and a silent witness) for the whole room of the breakdown card around me. After finishing the film, I started to rest for a while, I was covered in it. <br /> <br /> Very good performance with Messi. Armen was quite good, Cromwell was (he was surprisingly awesome). In short, I highly recommend this movie to any fan of Messi and / or the mysterious mysteries. But you may be ready to feel a little guilty.
