I personally love this picture in the Halloween series. I found it after seeing it with many friends, that you enjoy it completely, or find absolutely intolerable. Personally, I saw dozens of it, and it is not old. The film has a great back story and finally many things have been explained. It's a small movie, at 90 minutes shy, but it's certainly a romance journey. <br /> <br /> This picture looks pretty brutal, but the act is still walking like that, stalks and kill. There are many good small screen shots present in Michael's background, which adds a wonderful element to the film.
