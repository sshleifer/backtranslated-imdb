I was the first 20 year old college student when I first saw it, and I never forgot. I am a huge Joan Hackett fan, and this film is perfect for its extraordinary talent. I am very happy to see that such a lot of people have such a memorable memory. Naturally, it is not available in any media! It will be perfect to show lifetime, but due to its age, they will not do it. You could not see anything there before the eighteenth century. I could remember that how it looked at me during the first run: It was reviewed by Rex Reid in The New York Daily News and said that it was a threat to the big Hollywood movies of the village and it was created, the hact and grim part of Stanwick and Crawford Was played by Fought for that! Twenty-five-year-old Joan Hackt has left us so sadly so sad
