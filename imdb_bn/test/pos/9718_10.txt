Jim Henson always looked to make amazing television shows. This sadly one short lived. It was respectful to hear each story with their lovely morality. Each episode had new characters, a new story. Playing John Hart Storatellel did a great job, and the dog was always enjoyable as Brian Henson's sarcastic voice. <br /> <br /> Set designs and costumes are done very well. Mup pet work, when needed, work in classic Jim Henson. You know it's a muppet, but it's more than sorry to look unexpected. You find yourself enchanted and forced. When each episode ends, you realize that you were completely entertained. An entertaining that is laid out, kind of does not wear off after a few moments. If you sit back and think about each episode, realize that each story is really timeless, and morality presents a powerful story. <br /> <br /> I still show it to my own children, but it's a series that is more than family entertainment. I request you to find it on DVD, and snatch it. If you can not do this, then find out how to find it.
