This is one of the earlier movies of Stanwick and it definitely has an unusual theme. She is earning money by dancing with men at a dance hall. He really does not like to work, but it's a living. His boyfriend looks like a superb nice guy, but he is followed by the wealthy guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marrying, it turned out to be a heck of a "nice guy" a thief, feminist adulterant and rich curtain turned out. At the end of the movie, Barbera was easily enough, because no stalwart woman would walk out of this awful marriage. <br /> <br /> In the 1920's and early 30's, Hollywood wanted a lot and some of its films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today - such as nudity, fornication and bad language. Although ten centers, a dance is not a great example of this morality, it is a theme that is not allowed to be produced in the year 1934 after creating and producing strict code. In some ways the code was great - after all, parents do not have to worry about their children's movies (e.g. Ben Har Nude, 1925). However, it was also common to sanitize several films - and there is no way that this special film can be created and approved because it glorifies divorce - after 1934 and a serious number. It's really embarrassing, because the ten ideas I do not think were a bad thing to discuss - especially the star (Barbara Stanwick) had a beggar marrying a thief. Even if the movie allows her to finish her divorce and married a man who divorced herself twice, she could not have been. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. Plus, it was well read and suited during its relatively short run. FYI - Sadly, Ricardo Cortes was not actually Hispanic, but Jews were because they changed their names due to possible favor. He is an excellent leading man in his time, but today all are forgotten.
