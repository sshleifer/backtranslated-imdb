I felt cheated out knowing the whole story. Although there could be a turn, these bends were so important, I felt betrayed. I believe it can use a good writer who can wear all the elements of the story together well. The author could publish more than 'Twist' throughout the whole time, but to the very end. Then, I believe that the actors did very well with what they did, especially Matt Damon, who was actually a small character in his character, was not a little joke, which was not arrogant or like a ruthless criminal who always knew That's what he's doing. Other major characters were their own separate organizations that talked with each other. The octogenarian group of eleven groups has gone away.
