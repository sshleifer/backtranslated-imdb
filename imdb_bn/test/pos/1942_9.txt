The method of playing Crespen Glover (and only his) way is remarkable. Because you want to trust him really because his physical language and performing person fits perfect. He gives this extraordinary bit to an extraordinary personality of Layne. Along with this, Fiona, Dennis Hooper's role has been done very well. It's about logical thinking about the scene, about right or wrong side selections. Friendship is more imported, and makes what makes this difficult choice just what I feel. River Edge gives you this experience with serious tones and family mathers. I really enjoyed watching it. I saw it for the first time a month ago, but if you feel like 80 it's good to see it. I do not know before that the same.
