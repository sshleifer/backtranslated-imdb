This is one of the best and most charming vampires ever! I really love this movie. The character is great, even the location and the story. In fact the image is not a big budget production, but it is completely valuable to see. <br /> <br /> There are some errors (especially the Castle and location names) in this movie, but such errors are usually and almost every horror movie. The story fits perfectly in the scene and near reality, I can honestly say, because when I was in Romania in my vacuum, I went to them once. <br /> <br /> According to me, this subsidiary is the best part of the series.
