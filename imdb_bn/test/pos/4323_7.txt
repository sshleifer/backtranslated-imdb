Woaww just now you notice the link between all the characters? Of course it's Liby! And for the people who are with Desmond, no idea what ??? Yes !! He was the "same person" who paid Syed a second soldier on the second season of the second season after the assassination or torture: One of them. Well, it is not exactly the same person, in the 14th episode she named Joe and Kevin of the last two episodes. Twin ?? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm I'm not sure :) :) There are some links in all the letters. <br /> <br /> But it was only in response to Liby's comments. <Br> <br /> I saw that much more interesting than the whole season of those 2 episodes. In those seasons I felt that I missed a lot of things and I learned a few things. Especially at the very beginning, the first episode of the second phase is excellent, and then the second one is the first one flashback ... even if I've been frustrated even if I'm sure that everything in the heart has a meaning. Looking forward to that episode, I was disappointed that was an example. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last two episodes. I think we learned more new things in two episodes than the whole season. But what we learn is the small fragments for the next puzzle, such as Desmond's "relatives" involved (sorry, I do not believe I'm sorry). In the last season of the past, a lot of the issues arising are still unclear or never developed. And still, there are new elements such as all the holes in the photo were not enough. We all want to see its big picture, but I think we have to be very patient. I hope I will only have 3 seasons. I am sure that I will see no more than 3 seasons. There was a lot of work in the very last episode. And very good cliffhanger at the very end. <br /> <br /> So basically, yes I like the last episode ... and yes I want to see the third season.
