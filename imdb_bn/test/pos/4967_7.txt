I first came out of the city while watching TV in the middle of the night with Jennifer; I fell asleep before it ended but it stuck to it until it stuck with me. Its appeal is, although it does not have much to do, it maintains a confusing atmosphere, and shows lucrative, low key chemistry at Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (real-life man-wife). Lupino plays a female resident living in a large California estate estate, whose former caretaker - Jennifer - has disappeared and disappeared. (Jack Nicholson's film shades, though in this example, it does not go lupinos or become crazy). Duff is the man who manages the financial management of the estate and shines the lupinos, who work hard to get it. He does not get involved more and more, with what happened to his ancestry, surrounded by stairs in the old dark room and cellular locked up. The atmospheric and romantic bipelli are the best part of the film, because viewers can find some bit of this resolution bit - not only that much (except for a little friction at the end of the tail, which Brian hopes for, the film's cadas). But it's good, and, again, it's stick with you. Extra added attraction: This movie has started the song "Angel Eyes", which will be part of the original editor of All Blue Eyes.
