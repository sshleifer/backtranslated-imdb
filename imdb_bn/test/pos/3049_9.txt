This image was spellbound to me this evening. Thanks for watching this for Fox movie classics. John Voight, this cast of little black actors and most of the children, made it an appropriate way on Sunday evening. This season's actor's initial work, as well as Paul Winfield Mad Billy, is a wonderful screenplay to see how wonderful it is. I do not see why anyone would say why the Human Crown Superintendent is wrong in the role. Who will they choose? Rock character actor, Charles Lane? Although his career was commendable, an actor like Lane could reduce the role. Cronin was an excellent choice for the part. Keeping memory is a true treasure as I will count this film.
