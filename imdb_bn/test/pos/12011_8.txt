I think this film has become an important record of the most terrifying aspect of the East German government - this ruling is called its fascist defensive wall and the people's imprisonment. It's a document to miss frustration and courage. But I would like to comment on the actual position in this escape. This did not happen in Berlin or surrounded by some respondents, and did not do anything directly with Berlin Wall. Escape balloon was blown over Iron Carten which was not shared by Germany only, but at that time the whole of Europe was divided. In the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), 170 miles south-west of Berlin, took the balloon from Poncec to the airport, and gained 14 miles from Nyale in Bayrea and gained independence in West Germany. After the inauguration of Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. The balloon flight creates an entertainment mystery film, it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives while trying to flee from eastern parts of Berlin, the GDR or other parts of other Soviet-controlled states.
