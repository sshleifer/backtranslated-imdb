Based on the famous artist Masamun Shiru Monga (comic), this animated feature was a bit disappointing to me. <br /> <br /> The story was good, but the animation should have been simply mindblowing "ok". Movie IMO is adequate, but looks flat and uncertain in some way, if you know what I mean. A vain opportunity, if you consider that another work by shirk, "devil ghost", is considered as a classic in many cases. It sets new standards for Japanese animation, and among other things, creates a bright series called "GITS: Stand Allon Complex". <br /> <br /> I think this rental is valuable, unless you are sure and want it all. Check out the main square, which comes highly recommended.
