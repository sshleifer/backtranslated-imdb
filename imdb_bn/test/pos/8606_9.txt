Shah ImaMaara Black Rain was released in 1989 only after the start of the AIDS epidemic, it adds to the film with the slow growing events of Hiroshima radiations. The black rain in the head refers to the combination of ashes, radioactive decline, and after one or two hours of explosion. There are other books and films about the collapse of nuclear bombs, but there is no one unique and powerful like this. Based on Masuji Ibus's novel, who collected information from interviews and real-life bomber diets, the film describes how the mental explosion is affected physically and physically in bomb years after the original explosion. It's a terrific sight but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film begins on August 6, 1945 in Hiroshima because soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities. Suddenly a dark light was shining and a blast was heard. Almost every single building is damaged or destroyed by damage. The first nuclear bomb has fallen into a city, now it is part of history. The life of the living must certainly be repeated, after the impact of the bomb, is not devastating. Illustrating in black and white high-contrast, Yasuko (Jessiko Tanaka) caught in a radioactive rain, was caught in radioactive rain while returning to town to find the central friend and relatives. In Hiroshima, the Imamura shows continuous images with us: A young boy with his hanging skin requests his brother to recognize that an old man is in tears by the inability to free his son from the ruins. She is tormented as her child's black body stone. <br /> <br /> When the family comes back to their village home, Yasuko's life changes forever. He sees his friends dying around him and waits for the inevitable battles of radiation sickness which has already affected his Uncle Shizamatsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kittamura) and Anse Shigeko Shimuja (Ituxu Ichihara). Claims to have only business as usual, the family denies that Yasuko has influenced. A friend Katyamaa (Akij Kobayashi) said, "He has forgotten how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, everyone forgot, they forgot about the fire and went to a rally like an annual festival." Yasuko tragedy feels ashamed to feel different than others, to be shameful and guilty for contamination. <br /> <br /> When her aunt and uncle attempted to find her a husband, the eligible person refused to marry him due to suspicion about her health, although Shigematsu has copied her diary to prove that she was not directly exposed to the bomb. He feels comfortable with the only SUUTER, another harmed person, Uchi (Keissuk Eshada), who attacked the engine every time he attacked terrifyingly. Finally, the beauty of life shows itself so fast when Yasuko goes to the pond and for a lifetime he sees a lasting perspective, King Carp jumps into the water, as the joy still exceeds frustration. Sadly, we have heard radio statements by the politicians about using bomb again in the Korean War. "Humans can not learn anything", Shimmatsu said. "They misguide themselves, and the harmony of peace is better than the war of justice, why do they not see?" Imamura's black rain hope we all can clearly see.
