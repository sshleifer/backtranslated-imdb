I really love this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was working on a video store. When I went to buy it they told me that it was out of print and I could not order it so I thought today I want to see it. And then I put it in the DVD "Algo Month Koo Amigos" in DVD and it can buy it in English and Spanish in DVD ... hope it helps ... I know the movies we like without releasing in the US market How difficult is it to find Good luck. For more information here is a place to see ... http://www.zonadvd.com I think it's using USD for 10 ebay dollars.
