Being a veneered Tyler of a retired medical / healthcare field, I will not be tired of seeing this movie. Paddy Chefsky was a friend of my college coaching teacher, and in 1958 he met him and with us in a number of episodes. His writing skills were tested in time and in 1971 it was as fresh as "hospital". Find weeks and still some new ones. So many supporters cast members play a bigger role in both TV and movies. George Scott has made only a few comedy, but his time and pattern are just as good as Jackie Gleason and Steve Morton. Daily humorous instead of daily / slapstick win my books every time. And still a family film with only 1, four letter words during the whole film time
