I like this movie. Casts were all horrible in their illustrations of different characters. Judith Ivy portrayed a weak, fearless, dependent person who was an aggressive offensive between his accusations and self-related character, which had relief to see the transformation of the character. Blethaner applied equally to some of his judges as Jewish mother, devoted wife and his role as a loving sister. Jonathan Silmerman, Bob Dissy, Stacey Gickle and Lisa Wawz have played their role equally well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
