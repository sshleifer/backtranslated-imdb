Despite its critics what might happen, I enjoyed it very much for exactly what it is. Eyecandy for both sides of gender spectrum. Soderberg has done the hard-end staff of Ersky before, winning the Oscars, at the top of his game. 12 light ocean shades, commercials, sculptors, Steve's day at the midway if you want. I'm not generally fond of Zeta-Jones, but Kate is going to accept this film. It ends the screams of upcoming tracks and I'm going to see 120-minute George and Brad and Matt Parallle, who are pushing the rich man again and again through Cloney Digs in Logo de como. If we bear the ring lord's 3 installments, I'll ask if we can drown once more with clonari's salt and pepper lid.
