I'm a miniser in DVD because I love this story a lot. The best piece of civil war I saw is the story of friendship divided by war. The costumes are great, the lines of the story are great, I love how to jump around the character from the character I love, so that you can guess what's going to happen in the next life. There is a great balance between good and evil. My opinion is not good to see some of the characters that are bad. Being a little more humiliating than the last time, I cursed the TV so that they could hear me. I think how these miniseries makes my drama involve. I would suggest not to watch the third movie of the DVD series though. It does not deteriorate compared to the first two films and most of the original characters do not return. I do not want to remember the end of the third movie, I like to live with the thought of ending in the second movie. It makes me happy.
