Apart from the boring scenes of the body, I really do not have any complaints about this film. When I was switching around TV on one night it fell on. Acting was really amazing, I did not expect it to be better than it appeared! I played Keanu (who looks the same since 1986, which is a very good thing). * He was fantastic * and Crispin starred in his role perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! 'The new awakening of the reality in the' 80s, compared to other movies in the big pack, (though I like those movies too). Above all, I give it thumbs up!
