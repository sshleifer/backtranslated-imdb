This is the story of a man who went to see a comedy and it turned into a horror movie. The real story of a man who is inspired by the picture and when he finds himself unexpectedly he is afraid. The lady hero feared a guy's incredible story while confusing himself with Man and Villene. Lord, what has this happened to us? How do people make perfect look inside themselves? Delusioning about the perfect face? "Toto, I think we are no more in Kansas".
