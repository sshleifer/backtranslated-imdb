I saw it because a friend told me that it was great, and I saw a video in it, so I really wanted to see it. I saw it, and, not, the war scene is really good. If people can not fight this way in the real world, they definitely make me fool. There is no fight I want to fight, I have to say, but the fights in the movie are quite spectacular. They do not show much, but you can say it is violent and calm. But there is also the plot, which goes around the love triangle of the main characters, though it is a bit bent. Tae-sung is an indifferent guy who seems to love getting into trouble, as well as fights. He is the leader of his school, and hei-jit rival, who is the leader of his school - a bit of a playboy, a hot head and a rich boy. Then Han-kuong, a girl who did not take much for her - her father just died and she came back with her mother, dating the old friend of the guy who she liked - and then she wins he At school, and Tai-suung, who called him "Nuna" (big sister). Finally, he invented his brother, the fruit of his father's relationship, so-and-so, and he loved her despite her blood relations. Meanwhile, hey-jit falls for him, and takes him as his lover. But she has been leaked between her boyfriend and her younger brother, who acknowledged her love for her. Overall, it's a wonderful movie, but at the end I was really frustrated, and I just could not think, but could I remember, all the Korean movies are aware of war / death / depression / habits? 'Because of the fact that the old boy, and the wolf was the case with the temptation. This is a very good movie, but people will finally be ready to cry.
