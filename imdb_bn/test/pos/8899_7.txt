The first animated starred film for more than 12 years since "Asterix Joy America" ​​from Asterix and The Wyckings, 1994. It is the first digital-colored star to honor the animated animation, which makes it much more exciting to watch most entertaining stories. <br /> <br /> The comic book color scheme was based on this beautifully presented in every color of the film. Character designs are relatively close to better or worse than comic, preserving the simple but unique look of characters. Simple in terms of character design, it allows more time and effort to spend in real animation, which crosses the big screen theatrical animated film. Character movements are very fluid and possess a quality that generally exceeds in a decent budget. There is always some evidence moving in every scene and there is no evidence of cutting costs of normal cost cutting animation. 3D computer images are traditionally included in the animated 2D industry exclusively. If anything, the film style lets 3D elements look like a traditional comic book figure compared to the CGI model. <br /> <br /> The story takes much of its elements from "Astricus and Norman" comics, and this is where its main flaws are false. As an adaptation of spoken hilarious, "Astrics and Vikings" takes much more ways with its source material. Fans of comic fans will not find much to dislike about the story of the movie and the lack of source loyalty. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, one can really see this story as fun. It's taken over yourself without comparing its source material. Very ridiculous, well-written joke pepper obsolete scripts. The most interesting parts of modern day 21st century life were references to pop culture and live. Mobile communication, shopping channels, commercial airlines and even sports vehicles can have a great impact. Exceptional chemistry and cast performance (I saw it in English) Although some voices like Cacophonox are really annoying (but I think it is all part of its character). <br /> <br /> There is nothing to criticize about the story, it lacks "asteroid". This story plays a supporting role just like Jesterfires' teenage romance story and "age is coming" with acriches and obelisks. This gives Stalai a great idea because most of the elements in the story are the usual pillars of such tin films. At derivative and retarded, only malicious comedies and traditional "asterisks" (romance, pirates etc.) prevented the film from falling from simple mediation. <br /> <br /> Asterix animated movie library, it's definitely the fun one, the best script and the most beautiful animated. DVD seems a bit difficult though ????????
