Lotsa action, sugar love story, unexpected actor and overall great fun. Special effects are acceptable / decent, somewhat clean with some interesting shape moves. The whole story is moving along, and going to happen inevitable when you have enough sugar to keep surprising, although there is a bit of a bend (just a small). At the overall naivety of the movie it would be quite scary. Many more cute cute girl what you want Psyche If you want to review such a film, try reviewing it in terms of the category of the movie (it was not intended for reducing). That means, do not make a good Chess movie bomb!
