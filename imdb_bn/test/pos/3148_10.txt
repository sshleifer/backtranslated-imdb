I saw "readers" at a movie festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in such a way that it worked in a few small films. In ten or so minutes, it's a mad two-character story which tells me to be deeply resonated. Duncan Rogers has done a great job that holds very real, flexible moments in the film. I really appreciated this movie that the director has chosen a story suitable for short formatting. These are really interesting characters, and their stories are called in the perfect period. This is no small achievement. Are we all seen shorts that are embedded in just the layout or are the stories not properly adapted to the screen? To really do this I congratulate the "reader" and I encourage anyone to be interested and tell the story to be interested in film and critically watching it. Price per moment!
