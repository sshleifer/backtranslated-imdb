I do not know why critics are it weird and drunk I really do not. Dark, weird - no. It is tragic and with many emotions, especially the story of Pingua. They said it has elements of S & M, but I really can not find something like this that without the Catwoman whip. <br /> <br /> This movie is deeper than its genre and villains are not sorted just like some crazy fix. A mask. They have strong motive with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michele Pfeifer!) Is not just a sexy chick who likes stilling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin ... well, at the end of the film you really feel sorry for her (by strong performance Danny Davito). Again, I think Michael Keton is the best batsman and he carries his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can see that it is Team Burton, because it has a great style and it is a talented person. But the music fits gorgeous and passion.
