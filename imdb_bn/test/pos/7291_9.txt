Well, I'm 12 years old, so here you can see the pre-teen philosophy film. I commented on both great magnolia and bicentennial man, if you want to test it Well, here is a beautiful movie on the world, amazing scenery and pictures, which are very happy in the eyes. The author (I did not know who, check IMDB) has done a very difficult job or has appreciated for love, poetry, and drama. I screamed this movie 4 times, once more than 30 minutes. It's really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful. It's a great movie for, say, 11 and not romantic-comedy freak. Yes, it's romantic, yes, it's ridiculous, but (in my opinion) it's better than "everything" or "whatever it is". I do not cry This is a flexible story Rent it and go tap it :)
