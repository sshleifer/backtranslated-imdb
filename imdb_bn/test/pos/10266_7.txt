I had a great time back to returning Femina Ridens, somewhat hungover. For most movies, this is mostly two tools, which shows the strange relationship of crazy doctor Pilip and the wonderful Digamma lasander. In some pictures of Phulasi, I saw him before in a terrible death, but here he is young hip and beautiful. The film is quite predictable and must be light in front of the exploiters, but due to the sensation of its stunning colorful cats, recreational Set design, music, lighting and cinematography are all classic late 60s, a guest festival for eyes and ears, and although it is not difficult to predict the common thread of the plot, but there are unusual abnormal phenomena and memories of wonderful sights and sounds all the time to be interesting. Both the leads are quite good, and it is true that Digamma Lasandarra really is really good. The music of Stella Ciaprian is very serious, perfectly suited for images. Director Piero Sibzpa came here with most crackers, but it is not perfect. Although very lucrative, there is little material here and the absorption element may be light. I think it gives a charm and innocence but I can not help thinking that the subject may work with more deceit, more threats, sorting the subject, especially to identify what is going to happen, which is very easy. This is something I'm strongly fanatic of absorbing and certainly sex or a lot of nudity for people who are somewhat vain suspicious. It's a light, funny pop art dealer, loving but incomplete, like bubble bath. Specially recommended for the 60's, Digamer lasander or sweet set design.
