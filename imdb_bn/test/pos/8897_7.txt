It is a matter of shame that Astros and his friends Obelix can not get recognition worldwide that other cartoon comic characters may be found. <br /> <br /> This is another funny Octagon cartoon jammed with entertainment. Animation is excellent and voice characterization is good, even if the synchronization is slightly. Music and scores fit well in the story and some modern songs have a nice touch of slitting numbers. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Modern (like Disney) animation kids, Astricians fans and new comers will be captured ... Enjoy Gaul Adventure!
