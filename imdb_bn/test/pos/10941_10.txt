Twin Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Jillian Chung) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This vampire action comedy is my favorite because I was completely entertained throughout this movie . First of all, the character is a remarkable contribution to the classic scene. Charlene and Jillian are naturally clever, kind and ridiculous. This movie was my first exposure to them, and what I wanted to do was reach out to my television screen and they would have a big hog. The rest casts did well in his supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mack, "Duque", Josie Ho, Edison Chain, Anthony Wong, and Vampire's Bad Boys (in which one will become known in the future). Even this terrible horrible Icon Cheng was one of these good. Good letters are important, because they are the reasons to avoid the feeling of rarity, because of the interesting aspects of the actions. <br /> <br /> And the action to say, this movie contains plenty of it. More importantly, there is an emphasis on the quality of war choreography. Is this aspect an aid to this point of view special weapon? A sword with a retractable spear-finish rope. This weapon itself and continues in a variety of ways which was otherwise impossible. Josh Ho and Jillian Chong, in particular, use some of these devices to perform some evil air strikes. In addition to <br /> <br />, the sword is superb, and is highlighted by two great sword fights ?? In the opening train station order and taking time one of the other churches happening in the end. Indeed, the blade-wading manuscripts displayed in this movie put on some long pending extra-fascinating fan favorites, and I'm really sorry for those who have been quoting scary dancers known as Asia's Time, Storm Riders, or A Man. Twin effect is shown in well planned, precisely executable sequences with heroes. It does not even close. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why this movie is so critical. I am convinced that it will hate the deadly apology for Hong Kong's "The Golden Age" because it does not fit the view of the narrow mind of Hong Kong Action. We have to learn from the fall of John Woo - a strategy that is a new strategy that has never learned to re-discover itself. We do not need another clone. We need something different Twin Effect is a good example. <br /> <br /> This picture was so good that it actually set me up for the same actors and actors to be frustrated with other Chinese movies. This is particularly applicable to Icon Cheng, whose other films almost always suck ?? And yes, these previously mentioned paragraphs include irrational overrated and absorbent voxia shit. Even when Twin did not match the price of this movie, both were actors in a movie, although they were able to hit a good movie when one or the other leading role (for example, outside of our time, the Good Times, Bid Times, Foundation House) or when Supports one or both roles (for example, color of truth, new police story, just one look). Twin Effect 2 was supposed to be a direct sign, instead of imagine a family. I'm still not interested in meeting with Charlene and Jillian team and doing some butt in other movies, but the reality is that twin effects hit all the cylinders, but they are also annoying to make Karim happy (e.g. Protoz de la Rose Nayere) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All of these pictures need entertainment. And can I remind the reader that this is correct? Entertainment ?? The film's greatness judge, more than the critics' dramatic material or the critically acclaimed academy, has no idea about what they are usually saying. <br /> <br /> Finally the Twin Effect is not to miss classic. <br /> <br /> Ratings = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? The Hollywood film decides to kill this movie when it is released in the United States and it can rename the vampire effect and spend up to 20 minutes of footage, which includes parts of the action scene. However, the final version of the US version has a better soundtrack than the original version. Therefore, I bought both versions, which allowed me to see the original up to the first 1:20 mark, and then swept the discs to see the final battle in the US version.
