Alistair Simms This is a wonderful one. She makes such a good headmistress. The role given here for George Cole was made for him. Therefore, the welding work on this photo was perfect. I think this is one of the rare instances where everything was clicked. The story line was good, a scream of sport dialogue and a joy of the old Pure Girls !! You are endeared to each character, even villains. Why can not we do more films like this. Basically, it is a very good English comedy with good movement and fluidity.
