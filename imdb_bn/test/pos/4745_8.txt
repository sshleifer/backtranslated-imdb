A compact crime drama with a good amount of action. Unique NYC location shots add these difficult little films. Technically well done with good aspects and acting. Not to mention that the wild car starting from the downtown center extends across the George Washington Bridge on the upper west of the Washington Heights and expands in the NJ. It must be one of the best of all time in the film. Time for me gets better with 10. 10 out ... easy
