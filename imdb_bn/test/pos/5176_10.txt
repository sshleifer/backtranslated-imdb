Great news is that this movie is now available on DVD from http://treasureflix.com, who wants to be the owner and owner of the video. This is a good news because it is one of my favorite movies! <Br /> <br /> I saw this image for the first time in the 80's and it's mandatory holiday viewing scene. We are also a healthy community living in the small market town, with texts, beautiful and with its own heritage, reunion, and heritage. We have now faced big housing development threatening to destroy the community and you can see why I love this movie, the first and most important, ice showers !!!! Then there is the lovely legend of the Christmas tree and Christian secularism, since the whole community reducing the indifferent farmer to save his farm and to finance the community. Bad Developers- Only after packing money, the whole city promises their money to keep their money safe, which is very special. The whole community likes hackers to send their message to Santa via a misunderstood post office. After the death of his wife and mother, he and his daughter have a long journey. (There are potential candidates for this) - Sly Voyage Side and the most impressive taxi driver, whose engine is broken, has given a new gift on Christmas morning and no one has created its engine! There is a lovely moment where Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. Christmas is a great gentle film for everything really about me.
