After a few years of my first review in IMDB, this site continues to use ... <br /> <br /> However, the other night saw the tube, liked it. It is a dangerous mind or an alternative, but thinks a lot better. Rez was in quick pace, he was sure for a moment to save life, but after checking, it does not seem so. <br /> <br /> I see why there are many issues with this plot and its poems, but I Also think these people are close. Certainly what I expected was not the end, but overall it was so unique and well done, I can not complain. I would not call this hilarious, acted as a critic, dragging the scene more well than most of the 80's. And they refrain from playing a truly reputable 80's music. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that I can not remember everything about laughing, but basically it is actually a very creative personality surrounded by mediation and I love Rex or not, I love the original effort to describe the meaning of life. And his mutant theory, my knowledge, original. He was very angry, but at times he was confused and showed why he may have some mental problems. And then at the time of his clarity, he was a philosopher, a person who saw a little detail of life and tried to express himself to them. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with John Savage as a teacher. Usually the role of actors that fails. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> PK
