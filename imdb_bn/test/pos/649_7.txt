In August, there was a country-ish buzz in the '81 movie, "Urban Cowboy", "Everyone Who Were But Loose", "Smoky And Bandit" was a big hit to all the rage. That's why I liked the producer of this movie "Honey Tonk Freeway" and hoped that the title will help draw the box receipts in the same "city cowboy" crowd. Instead of being bogged by the bomb attack in the "Honky Tonk Freeway" theater and I suspect it is partly by being understood by a badly selected headline. The same problem is now on the video and it is very bad because it is a beautiful movie and its comedy style before its time. No matter, probably anyone who can think of 1981 will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad. But I think it was not saddled with a poor title, even if it has. Earlier, one of her movies. Someone can now see this movie and like today's comedy, it can clearly see the father or * big uncle). His day "Honky Tonk Freeway" was pretty cool and a kind of sincerity about life that is not popular in the comedy. Clearly it is a child of "aircraft", but it is more mature and it clearly indicates that direction if it is not "fake". The characters are more "comedy-mature" and they are less-rooted and they do not think anything is serious but nothing else. What the jokes should emphasize and camera views and opinions of their opinions and ways. <br /> <br /> However, "Honey Tonk Freeway" is a real time capsule. A great look back very quickly in the 80's. The people of this movie wear everyday clothes in 1981 and work everyday. It was clearly meant to make a ridiculous comment about the daily reflections and everyday life around them. <br /> <br /> I do not know if my review is helping you, but it's really good, sometimes kind of nice, the movie is worth renting, if you want to see how many faces are known today, Was old. Beverly D'Angelo is sometimes so difficult to grasp her. So Beau Bridge and Terri Garr are. Terry Gower became toast of Hollywood as her next movie, and the latter was "Tootsie", which finally made her a star. When Howard Hesmmann made the film, he was the biggest "current" star of the day. WKRP in the hit hit show "Sininkin" on the Hot Hashman Hit Hitman in 1981. He played his main character, Rascally DJ at night, Daniel Storne breaks into a star as the voice of the story of the child of the title of "The Wonder Years", about 80 citikomas. These days there are many faces that we do not have with us. An old married couple, Hissa, on a journey See Bay Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy, Jessica Tandy will finally take her Oscar for ten years after "Awesome Miss Daisy." One of the final film appearances is the geraldine page, although she has a brilliant career, but the 1985 "Trip to Beautiful" After four years, he did not get an Oscar, for which he had earned it a great deal and won the award <br /> <br> Also, there are many other faces in this movie, actors who are not big but those who support the work. Many people are known even if you do not remember their names. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a beautiful little split. In a separate Altman-Esk road, a bunch of people from different places to walk differently to Florida and to solve various problems from different locations due to their own individual related reasons, for a Rendoox, in their small Tiklau town unknown to them. Florida, which can be stopped by the recently-built cross-border effects of Bypass, which does not exit Ticlo which effectively closes the map. <br /> <br /> And this movie is also almost fascinated with the complete concept of the interstate system, which has recently been "completed". After the approval of the Congress in the 1960's, several parts were created and then "went live" and by the end of 1980, most of the systems were built and all joined together and the promise for what would be the first interstate system for the first time. And people were enchanted by it. By the end of 1980, everyone considered "many of the interstate freeways older", then everyone used their parts and knew how it worked and how it was different from the other road so that no red light or symptoms could be stopped. And off the ramp, and it previously went to the place that was less accessible. By 1980, anyone can drive somewhere comfortably and do nothing other than food, sleeping and bathrooms. And this was then all new. <br /> <br /> The end is anti-climatic and it is not satisfied at a spectacular moment. What makes it superb it is not a travel destination, which makes Hong Kong Tonk Freeway shameless despite being such a product of his day. Forget his title; Instead it will take you down memory lane.
