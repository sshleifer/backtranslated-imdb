(Movie mood description may be considered explosive - because there is not any action) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Strange interest for dystopias and utopias? It is for the atmosphere of the movie. Or is there some magic? If yes, this is definitely the greatest man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is no doubt, very artistic / artificial (depending on taste). Most people (and those who hate Ming Liang (I did not enjoy on other occasions), who are hated to show the film slowly, are the slowest one of them, which is suffering from film time, yes, people are unable to pass slowly and - and it They destroy it to see it ... Someone can take the torture as torture or as therapy ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The lack of communication - even We are in the rabbit cage - next to each other - but not together? People are tired, some are sick and unable to describe it - just to show, to touch, to talk to others, do not want to face others ... if they disappear. The block seems inefficient and the rain continually stimulates the strange curiosity and sometimes it is uncommon, unexpected, as a hole beneath some concrete. Vacation should be an unhealthy decay - which allows us to reach each other. <br /> <br /> The possible way to see this is: Do not study the internal world of characters - consider the entire movie space to be in itself. And ask - why is it? Where can this depressed state and mood form come? Have a place for them, do they have the right to stay here? And search for answers between blocks of walls and halls (if you need them) - Instead of a very transparent mind in humans. <br /> <br /> You can not understand the key to understanding - from a movie lends us - as a subject of study - inside ourselves - and finally securely bring back our more colorful and "normal" looking reality. <br /> <br /> you might reach - for example, I feel real, potentially, unrealistic hope that we are still human ... and this mind condition can help many to live in this world.
