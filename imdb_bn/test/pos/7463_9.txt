I'm really surprised how little fame this picture is. I think it is with the distribution company and etc. <br /> <br /> Do not Idiot - you want to take this movie looking for a good fun - pass several hours with this very nice movie and the music is great. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ..... about girls and boys and there is not too much story in them, but should all the movies be puppets? It gives nice and clever and good time. Girls feel very happy and this whole movie makes it even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Why did I give it only 9? Good stories can be a little more believable in the middle and over. At some points you start to see events that are a little less reliable. Little Spirir: The child is crying and the father goes and tries to relax him. Now I'm not talking about some tears - no - violent tears and after 30 seconds my father goes out and "the baby is sleeping" - forgive me, when and how you can calm him and sleep and leave him in 20-30 seconds Room. But avoid this little piking because the image itself is not a document - it's fun and it should be ignored.
