The box office stars are great stars! William Beldwin, Kefar Sotheraland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This movie was made for my favorite one year in 1990! I'm a Chicago, and setting in Chicago is very familiar and the artist was dynamic as fast !! I love this movie, and the motivation for the final episode in this film is a powerful element for the plot that was extremely exciting! <Br> <br /> "Flatlinens" focuses on centers around a group of unsatisfactory pre-med students, who want to be flat-lined as a way to justify society !! When life is not sensible, it seems very irrational to be weird about mysterious nightmares !! At the same time, when their terrible curiosity gets better, there is no turning! The king of the hill, (so to speak) he cried out loud: I'll do two minutes !! Whoever is going to do it !! Someone wants to try two and a half !! Finally, these new emerging and very unwashed conspiracies now have a universal nature in this re-proceeds life! There was a 360 degree perspective on the issues that were compromised to their reasonable or inaccurate misguided! This helpless and academic chicanic serve any purpose, it is an essential method to present your personality firmly! I like this picture, 1990 was a good year for me too, things started reading that year !! When I watched this movie in November of 1990 in November, I was so happy that I did !!
