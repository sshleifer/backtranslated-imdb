Although I'm a little older than the recommended age, I really enjoyed this movie. It will break a bit from reality and it will be a dream to become friends with every young girls a pop star. I know it was me, be sure! The first 10 minutes were really chessy and some of the average girls had a little chessy. Once you get over, you can really start to enjoy it. I like the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really sweet and you could see how much they started to like each other. Soundtrack is perfect and it fits into really good film. I love Jane's family too, her sisters are beautiful. Made a very good film.
