Recently released from the British DVD, this is a good film (as long as you have attention time and IQ compared to a fruit fly). It's not frustrating, it's the kitchen deer at the most dirty time. Terrence stamp is great, music is sweet, just like Carroll White is the only MaMart, who can not love the criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene where Carroll and his friend work with is sitting with him (a large eyelid that falls under one's eyes) and everyone is sitting quietly with those who are walking past. <br /> <br /> The only one who played this deadly role was Violence Carroll's first husband, but if you can get past, you are right. And Donovan provides some of the most vulnerable, gentle, beatiful songs in 60 seconds.
