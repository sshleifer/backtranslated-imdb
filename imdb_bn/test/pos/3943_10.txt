May be just this wine conversation but I've seen very long time may be the best movie. I spent the first half-hour that after the surprise of what was happening, I once admitted that I did not understand everything from the subtitles, I could enjoy the film. <br /> <br /> Do you really hate a staff where an employee turns the enemy into a flock of traffickers? When faced with a gay alien prince when the character development is the people whose pyramid is built? Why does Buddha seriously wear bling diamond earrings? This subject is no doubt the face of humorous visually appealing character and characters. Once I had won any war for my heart, I saw the main drama as Spider-Man - awesome! Many will complain about the lack of story solidarity, but you can not do well to laugh with a bunch of companions for a mutation movie, especially if you make an alcoholic shot every time as "love 10,000 years of love for me".
