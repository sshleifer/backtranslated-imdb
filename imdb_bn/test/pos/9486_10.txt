What can I say about this band, I was bound at the age of 68, I was a ten-year-old child, even though my father grew up in blues, these people came from Midlands, the combination of country rock, heavy rock and music. Blues, I hope I could live in their early years, I was lucky enough to be in the 79th (Connephart) which I have seen today, the best concert, I hope the full version of the warm August will be very real soon. This CD gives me the opportunity to watch the boys repeatedly, the song remains the same, but this CD goes to a bad cat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
