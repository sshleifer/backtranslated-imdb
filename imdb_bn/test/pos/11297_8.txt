One of the great tragedies of life is that Disney is so successful with what they do. If they are not, our animation may have a little more unique gems such as "Willingly send Mr. Wanderers." The story grabbed the throne of an evil king up-and-down-land (I could give the wrong name). He hates everyone. His favorite hobby is shooting birds, and sometime in the past, he killed four young girls to kill his wife, possibly Mr Wonderbird (a bird starring Peter Ustinov's general trait). Meanwhile, we can see that the evil King's hobby is another one painting. He has three paintings, especially: a portrait of a self portrait, a shepherd (which he has fallen in love), and a painting of the chimney needle (which he is jealous). One night, shepherd and chimney shoes get down from their drawings and walk together. The king's autobiography also rose from his frame to the real king (you think I'm making it?) It actually sends young policemen to the royal police forces later. Mr Wonderboard then tried to protect the lovers from the help of the King Forces. <br /> <br /> This plot is surprisingly supernatural, and the up-down-down-landing setting is an incredibly fabulous place, accessible by huge buildings only by elevators. This "metropolis" and "1984" and more. Equal mix of lead painted pictures. <br /> This is a unique philosophy experience that does not fit the ideal formula for maximum animated. Feature
