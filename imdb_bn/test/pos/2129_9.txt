It is a beautifully well-received story given to the beautiful music, many dances, many big sisters / small sisters interaction (it's almost all positive), and many wishes. When Kingdom Randolph said, the fun moments that older children and adults would enjoy, "they're just shoes, are not they?" And when Princes Genevieve is like her smallest sister, Lacey is a flexible moment to misunderstand. <br /> <br /> Animation is probably not as good as Disney, but it is still very good. Particularly Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rovane and his servant Derek de Kobler and little princess Lacey My only rhythm in the animation is in Dance Signage, where the dancing princess copies one another's absolute carbon without deviating from each other - even three short dance steps are completely copied. I did not like this dance professional ballerinaas or chorus dancers, loved to see a little more personality in dance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There have been some violence for the defenders in the story, and Vilnese's monkey has the meaning of other animals in the story. <br /> <br /> My 4-year-old girl loves this movie and has seen it repeatedly, and I It was found to be quite acceptable for her to see.
