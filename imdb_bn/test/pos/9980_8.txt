Shia LaBouf impressed me with her acting ability, but I can honestly say that I am very much interested in her next attempt ... her 20-year-old screenwriter, Fran√ßois Wimit, who insisted on her father that golf was not her place of life And in the United States Open tournament in 1913, he entered the city ... the beginning of the movie has dragged a little, but Tu Shiya was doing so well to set up quick subplot ... The whole cast is well selected and they work very well together in a story that based on the actual event, everyone can finally find the movie before watching ... however It is also known that this information does not spoil the fun ... Josh Fleetter as Eddie's delightful Francis Caddy Lori, who is known as Frankis As part of the effort proved invaluable and gave him a hug ... Stephen Dale extraordinary as Harry Ward, Francis statue of the famous British golfer who is still afraid. ..And those backgrounds come from Francis because he was very humble ... Bill Packethon took a formulaic film and made it worthwhile ... Bravo Mr. Packeston, and Bravo to Cast ... a movie in the story from the imagery, who makes the living, it's a movie, a pleasure, and revel ... It's nice to have movies that we can feel good watching ...
