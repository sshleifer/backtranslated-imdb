I like this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt has co-authored director and co-starring a great work co-author. David Duchovny is just plain hot. And mini-driver is ever as intelligent. Assemble all your talents with David Allen Grewer, Carroll O'Conner, Robert Loggia, Jolie Richardson and Jim Bellouis, you have Oscar-worthy films! I was surprised they did not get one. If you do not see it, then rent the DVD, once it's been commented on the managers ... Bonnie Hunt is awesome!
