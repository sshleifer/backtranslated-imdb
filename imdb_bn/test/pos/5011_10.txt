I saw the film on May 1, 2003 at the Nashville Film Festival! It was amazing! What I read about Steware was incredibly portrayed by Tony Weeder (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperiali (incredible work like Stew), and all those involved. I'm glad that he (Vidmer) did not go down to "leave Las Vegas" with Stuey's bad habits, but instead kept us inside our family, family, and his gifts. The whole story announcing the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great car and showed his screen writing skills. This one big "thumb up"!
