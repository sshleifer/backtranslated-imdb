Central airport Jim (Richard Barthelmus), a pilot's story that has received a bad flight for more than 4000 hours and is forced to leave commercial flights. He met a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Yeller) and started a work involving two flying and stunts. The two started the relationship, but when Jim strikes, his brother (Tom Brown) takes this task for a while and takes his brother's girlfriend. From there, some are exciting and horribly tragic. <br /> <br /> This image is a pre-code due to various reasons. First of all, Jim and Jill did not get married and got married without satisfying their relationship. Secondly, Yellar is shown in his underwear, and the limited production of the production code is effective. <br /> <br /> This picture is not jumping on the dramatic love triangle and as a result, the end of the Beatersyte ends.
