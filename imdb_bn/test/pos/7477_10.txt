This movie was excellent since the beginning. I was riveted by the action, each turn of the black humor and incredibly bad luck facing our hero. Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him watch many more movies. Reading through the comments of others, I admit that I have never thought of tarantino when I visited "Thursday" but now I think about it, I think there are some similarities. I think I do not spend much time connecting with everything else. Porizkova and Thomas Jane are one of the sexiest scenes for books to record rapes scene.
