I went out of a Coen movie before and is not quite familiar to how to feel. Two of the best examples are: Big Lebowski and Fargo Lebowski was so ridiculously original and filled with so strange humor that I had loved it. On the other hand, there was some unnecessary recovery with flying men and killer balling balls that just do not seem to fit in the film mold. However, I liked the film and now it has a copy of it. Fargo started crying violently, sometimes I was not sure why I could laugh so much that it made me cry, but I was still. There were many unexpected strange characters in Fargo, but after more investigation, they actually talk about the real situation. That is why the toilet (or it was a broom) was so confusing that the police officer was talking about showing some interesting people in the veranda in the night. And that's why the theater laughs laughing when he said that some funny clouds are coming. (I have a copy of this movie) Coen's film and their characters are slightly warmer and probably a little off the wall. But if you look closer to some of the characters that look like Johnny, you will always find it strange that they are all true. O my brother, where are you? It's a film that's out there. I do not even mean the same ballpark as a traditional film. Last summer I reviewed the film's Shafts, and in the meantime I said that Shaft is a good film that I have seen thousands of times before. But you can not tell it about Coen Brother's film and you certainly can not tell about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is broken in jail, south politician, hard, reference, I can only guess historical figures, river baptism, bank robbery, violence against animals, feudal feathers, Kekke, link maj etc. Here is the most mentioned of Homer's Odyssey, but I did not know it because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew a thing about it. Critics of all other newspapers think of it all and they think that this stupidity and almost insulting quality like it makes the movie even better. Well, coming from a person who does not know anything about this, I can tell you that this is still an entertainment movie. Again, when Coen was normal for the film, I was not sure why I was entertained or had to laugh, but I was. <br /> <br /> This is a street picture where three people travel along the way, Cloni said that she is hiding in other hidden cells. He had to take them with them, because when they got an opportunity to escape, he was also chained to him. <br /> <br /> I like all the major actors in the movie and many of them are Krone Cronis. It was good to see Goodman again. Hunter and especially those who see Turturro seem to have had a place in every Coen film. It is very bad that they found a place for Steve Buscemi but that's a different story together. But Cluoney returned. People just have charisma. He is not an actor, and here he is not as good enough as others but he also has his own stupidity. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope he is able to play a range of characters. "<br /> <br /> Now, after making this film a compliment, I also tell it, I did not really enjoy the first movie, I found it quite tedious and a bit annoying. There were so many ideas and taking enough care for their proper care. But then the film started to grow on me.It took a while but it turned on me.I do not think it's their best film, but it's a Not good, and I'm giving it a 8.5, but for that reason I recommend this movie for just one reason. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Oh, last year saw it, it's the same as this movie and it's the same as that movie. + Most movies have been recycled in some form or another. They are not recycled and if they are not recycled and they do not know about it, that's enough to see something that they put out in. Originality is counted for a lot of my books. Coens are original and they are good and that's not common in today's movies. Enjoy them when given. Because you do not get such an attitude in many movies, so when you do it, enjoy!
