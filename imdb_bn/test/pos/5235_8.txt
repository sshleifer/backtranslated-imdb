One of the earliest word myths is that they could not make the West because there was a problem recording the sound on their location. Indeed, it is the financial constraint of depression that temporarily kills "A" budget bonds. However, before the economic slowdown was kicked in the period 1929-1931, there were notable examples, including "A" Western encouraged, The Warigion, Billy the Kid and Siemann. Big trill was probably the biggest of them ?? A domestic pioneer Western Shot is an early widescreen device appropriately titled astronaut. For a recent DVD release we can now see the full screen as well as the WideScreen version that was shot simultaneously. <br /> <br /> Director Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the spirit of courage was in huge external visas, and thus in many ways a perfect choice. He makes great use of the larger frame to display the western landscape at its most exciting time. Walsh has a lot of shots on the very beginning of the shots, such as cutting a female firewood. Most of the curtains are tightly filled with wagons and other clutter, but in one corner we need to expand the desert indefinitely. When the wagon train runs, the open plain will be gradually revealed to us, with which it will pull away like the screen curtains. These shots are not so effective in the full screen version, but the outward expression of Walsh in the larger canvas was never good. <br /> <br /> But it's an unfortunate flipside. When it comes to the scenes of dialogue, Walsh's trend is to give the actors the space in the middle of the shot, as if they are in an imaginary fullscreen box. Is that just that extra width ?? Extra. It may seem like logical at first, because it means that we can see as many characters as we can in the full screen. But the players show a small and tiny look in the frame, when all the backgrounds affect the business shots? And Big Trial has many background businesses. When the WideScreen formats appear again in the 1950s, many directors make the same mistake, eventually they realize that actors are framed around the chest, losing their height, but allowing the screen to fill. <br /> <br /> This is a sad cause, Big Trill attempts to script a particularly balanced and subtle. Romance and revenge subplots are easy but well-defined, and do not threaten each other's or the advanced story's equilibrium. This can be a great close epic, but it can lose dramatic weight because the letters begin to talk to each other every time, we are confused by filling cow's meat, stray wagon or any other additional frame. Still, Walsh's sensitivity is still on display for a deeply emotional romantic moment, and she manages to make the final scene work and memorable. There are some nice comedy touches, mostly by "ridiculous Sweden" by El Brendell. <br /> <br /> While Wayne is another victim of remote framing of dialogue scene, we at least see his strong physical presence and his warm but strong voice Hear me She betrays her lack of experience, but there is definitely definitely possible. Sadly, the potential feasibility was not realized at that time and finally slurred in the second decade before shooting Starudom. This picture is also displayed by Wen's friend (and the next cheerful character actor) Ward Bond. He did not submit, but you can spot him in several scenes, near 80 minutes, where he is standing on the left side of the tiren power is often the main. <br /> <br /> Beat yourself as a play. And it's a fantastic scale that Westerns (and widescreen) will leave in bed for some time. And although the 40s and 50s are now considered in the golden age of the West, but according to a changed tradition, with the story of personal adventure and heroism in an established western ?? No good or bad, but a different form. The first tally was the end of an era that could be truly surprising in the West.
