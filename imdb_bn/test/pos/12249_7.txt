I actually did not see many movies with Hunter, but I was very surprised to see him on Broadcast News. He is a hard-working journalist, Jane Craig, who has been engaged in TV news shows all the time. His colleague Haroon Altman has carried his torch for a long time without saying something. The love triangle is done by Tom Grunnick. He is a new reporter who is the current former athlete. To Jane, he did not give a symbol of what he liked about the news report - it is not a serious business, but a beginner. It's no wonder, Jane draws herself to Tom. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I could not find much more interesting about Tom's new colleague, Tom, I did not see anything. It is something with them that prevents us from being close and personal with them. Often impressive is Albert Brooks, who plays a professional who gives more than 100 percent of his job for more than 100 percent of his job but in most cases he does not get any benefit. Actually, for a while I thought he was from the Steve Gutenberg Police Academy (1984). It has some funny lines and it was a meg Ryan-picture, they call it a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Running in two hours, some scenes can be edited or completely abandoned, eg. Journey to Zen and Haroon in Central America Also, I wanted to finish a happy ending with a farmer and seven years later, between the three of them.
