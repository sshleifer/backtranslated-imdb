Shajam was right, but Hero was my favorite when I was young, I was already Sky Hyai (2005) and Zoom (2006), there was a hero hai, a school for super heroes training, teenagers with super power to help the police catch the bad guys And at other times they will be in embarrassing situations like The Great American Hero (1981). It was a funny cartoon that was fun, it was a live action stage show that was known as Shawmah, the Kid Superpieu Hour. Actors who have voiced the letters, also have showcase characters. Rex Ruthless (John Berewieck), Mighty Magic (Zer Fields), Weatherman (Jim Greenlife), Captain California (Chris Henssel, who also sang the theme song), Dirty Tricks (Malo Maksalin), the magnificent gal (Beckie Pearl, who thinks Superman and Wonder Woman's love child), and Punk Rock (Johnny Venicker). When the curiosity comes, the whole cast, went with something. The cartoon was a funny superhero comedy, I got off the shore and it will be back in live actions such as Albert Albert (2004).
