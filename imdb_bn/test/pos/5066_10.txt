It's a nice movie with good acting and it keeps your attention to the very end. Maybe people are tired or uncomfortable about this issue, and this is getting too much down. It may be too deep for the audience to offer movies like the higher ratings of the American P series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He is not supposed to be a harsh agent and used so asked question comes off as stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The end of the puzzle comes as everything falls in place. Supporters have done a good job to help actors carry the film. I thought the movie to be strong and excited.
