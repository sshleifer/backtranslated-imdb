This is a video version of a stage production with additional shooting for the video version. Gain both dramas on the stage with good effect produced film effects. George Typin's set with Julie Terore's sculpture and masks is a great one. <br /> <br /> JC Norman is fantastic, and a young Brian gets to hear terifle (and see). This production is stunning, emotional and royal. If you do not want to see it, you missed it.
