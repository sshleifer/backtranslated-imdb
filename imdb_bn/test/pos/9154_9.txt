Fantastic silent version of the story of Fran√ßois Vilan. Although I was king in the 30's, with the performance of Frank Lloyd, Prosten Strigu scripting and Ronald Callman played, this version is even better. Barrymore, a charming fool and a bitterly viohon with comedians' classmates, did not match the pen. Photography has stolen its beauty and innovation and supporting cast, especially Conrad Viett in its American premiere, incredibly beautiful Marseille Day and supporter comics, Slim Samarville and Han Quality, each of its scenes. <br /> <br /> It's embarrassing that Barrymore's first few comrades. Among his sound films, in the twentieth century only his leadership and his supporter's role of Midnight could compare this, and who stood only in his gorgeous voice. In this silent film, Barrymore must tell his story about talking about his goodness, and he does it, as a laughing-hearted King and as a lover in love with Vilaan. Even in the Fairbank Sashblocking style, he almost ran out. He gave the opportunity to share his supportive cast with pride, in this era, he works in this world as a talented comic of the era. Finally, a short word about Allan Crasland, the first conversation feature to direct the director, this year the release of Jaj Singh in the same year. Crosland is not a known, innovative, delightful original director, and her shame that her more work is known. Perhaps this movie is even more interesting than the movie, compared to its famous work, its role in other aspects of it. If so, you could do much worse.
