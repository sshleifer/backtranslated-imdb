I like Home Bet 2 and 3 better. The cast was ridiculous and quiet at the same time. Chris Stokes, who conducted the film, as a car repairer, it has a very funny camio; Find out his mother performing the lead role of John's grandmother. And as a credit roll, at the end of the movie you can listen to his rap title song "Down to the Last Minute". She is very funny and really a good actress, as well. The young actors who made it (the main triangle) and who are actually part of the music group IMX, did a fantastic job. Before this movie I could not pay much attention to this RB group. Now I'm a fan. The number of songs in the Single House Party scene is worth checking the film. I was pleasantly surprised. I love it
