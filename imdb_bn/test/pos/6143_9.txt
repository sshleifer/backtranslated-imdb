I was surprised to read the comments of a person who dislike this picture. It's really quite funny. My boyfriend and I quote each other that some of the lines out of that clearly smile. In some situations, it may be uncomfortable (double-mindedness, drugs, sex, especially the attitude of a strange child) but at the same time credible. It's about communication and contamination between men and women.
