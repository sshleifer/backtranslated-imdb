Hi! Being able to say Cantonese, I found it very interesting and was able to enable those jokes due to the language barrier. War scenes are spectacular and it is a good movie. However, I have criticism. Above all, I can see that it is not the first project as a -GOGO and now! :-) Because if the spinners do not watch the film, then do not read !!!!!) Because in the project, Jackie ends up fighting his enemy; He was sent to kill Sanpo. She has been struggling to make all the films and the showdowns are spectacular. But in the second, he fought with Chan, the showdown scene between Jackie and his generosity is not long enough and measures against the ocean's men are enormous. They are not nearly as "bad" and played only a minor part in the film with Jackie, although their war sequences are spectacular, they are not hunting across the whole movie, so they are slightly unfulfilled in the audience. However, this is my modest opinion so take the word for word-go and see yourself! It's a great movie of its own right! Take care and thank you praising Jackie! Sincerely, Ian PS Do you know the second police officer? He is the same guy in the first strike - he's still strong to know going strong!
