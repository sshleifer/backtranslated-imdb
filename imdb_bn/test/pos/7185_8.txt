This movie is just great ... it is becoming really slow and annoying but the film is going on ... good fun is coming. The power of film is probably in most of its subtle references (and I mean many more) in other movies. Perhaps the best part for me was the Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, hidden dragon scene. How the two actors switch from the French to Chinese or whatever the Asian language, it was awesome. Then joke with the name, they are ridiculous but perhaps when you are an American (no crime) you will not understand them all. Overall a great movie
