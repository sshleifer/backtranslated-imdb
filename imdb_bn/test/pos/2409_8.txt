I'm not sure how I can make ten lines of this question, but I will try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to dance and started dancing to make the music slow. What was the name of the song that was played, and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love the song! And I only see the movie over and over to hear that song. <br /> <br /> I've made several searches online and even saw the soundtrack but I can not find the song. <br /> <br /> This may be the reason that they did not sing the song full of songs and just partial. <br /> <br /> If I knew someone who knows the name of the song and who sang it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
