You have forgotten any spy movie - this is what life was in the USSR and there are still a lot in Russia's former Soviet countries. The dream of a dream is a dream, as he thinks west; His reality is very sad, drunken father, a violent father, and always the current wine. And its prospects for the future are not much better. He has found a man and they are trying to save lives together, but both of them are social and physical in the same environment - the scenes of this film are comfortable in the bright, post-apolopic film company, but perhaps a special effect; They just shot what happened in front of the camera and shot them. <br /> <br /> Forget your stereoated, cold Russians of spy movies. This is the real deal: You can never see in a public drama, as enthusiastic, vibrant, and present.
