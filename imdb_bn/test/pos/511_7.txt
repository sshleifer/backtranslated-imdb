It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero movie similar to X-Men, Daredevil, Pannier and Preferences. These heroes (and in case of X-Men Hero groups), the common thing is that they conceived in Marvel's magical world. Blood is basically a normal person (a blue outfit) who was driving vampires due to personal distraction and eventually faced with Dracula and he was due to better sound frustration. So the character was really annoying and in reality it was not used in the Marvel universe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although he can not accept all the credits, most of them must go to Stephen Nerington and his distinctive visual style reflects the character's best side. Blade character (Wesley Snipps) mixes martial arts with amazing surprises and bats like Batman in this film. Snipes are quite good as the title character and are successful to find out the character dual and inner demons. However, he is both a voice and gesture, both very attractive to a very harsh actor, and only enough for a film (which is clearly visible from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson brought good character and well-being to Whistler's pain character from life with really energy and timing. N. Bush Right, however, makes her character relatively flat and ruthless, as a leading female, fairly weak. Donald Logo is quite funny and runs a lot of work with a small character. German, Udow Carr also should be mentioned because he brought Vampire Race to many skills and styles, perhaps he was born from Dracula's game experience. Stephen Doroff has made the best of the film and stands as one of the best screen villains I've probably seen as his fantastic acting like Deacon Frost. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I think the vampire renewal section (which is not composed of Robert Rodriguez's Dus Teal Doon, by adding contemporary elements and maintaining a sense of comic book). It is not about saying that the film is a comic book feeling that the film is unrealistic. Away from it Many efforts have been made to try to think of the movie as realistic as possible. Including the effects which are quite good for their time. I found vampires "dustings" to be very nice touch. When killing a vampire, Norrinington sculpture spontaneously com-bust looks great on adding blood to many blood. The overall effect that was well done adds to the reliability of the film, which is otherwise flat on its face. <br /> <br /> As previously mentioned, Nerington is a very unique visual style that keeps him separate from her. The following paddle movie director. Although Dell Toro is almost efficient, I like the style of Nerington. His style gives a very special look and feel, but most importantly it gives the film the atmosphere. A very sophisticated dark atmosphere that works with sun protection with the main character and the story. Music with visual style that works fine and adds a lot to the film's atmosphere. <br /> <br /> All Blade is a very entertaining movie which probably got 8 from me, but a few annoying flaws (which can not be released without spoiling the film, enough to say, many of them are near the end of the movie) Should the height of the film be fixed by 7? <br /> <br /> 7/10
