I saw this little short series and although I'm no longer a child, I love it !!! It's hard to find professional copies, even though it's on DVD, it's MIN !!! =] <br /> <br /> Great casting, wonderful plots, and lots of action, romance, and even a pretty good comedy. I'm not a historian of nature, but I love this great piece of historical imagination!
