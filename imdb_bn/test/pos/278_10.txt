This is a very moving movie that we are going somewhere new: It is about relationships to end. Christine Thomson's performance, like Tess, is trying hard to connect with Bobby for just one day, it is very convincing and moving and taking you right in the story. No one was facing the end of the relationship and at least tears to scream, "Just one night!" When he gives him one night, the two people who divide the journey break you and how much each real relationship can be valuable and how it is all or permanent - should be respected with it thrown away.
