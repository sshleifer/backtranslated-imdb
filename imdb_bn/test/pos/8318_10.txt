Walking with dinosaurs is an extraordinary documentary, educational (like me) for both dinosaurs and dinosaur-lovers unknowns. I admit, I was very young when I discovered, but I was immediately obsessed with it. (Spliers !!!!!) This series has 6 episodes, which at the end of the reign of Datosaurus DÃ©tosaurus first developed near the last creatives. When I first saw this movie, I was really like a trip back to time. Dupodocus' greatness, the bravery of Ophelalmosaurus and the careful mother version of T-Rex are astonished to me and my family. This is a wonderful movie, and I believe that the BBC only handles what they set to do. Excellent work!
