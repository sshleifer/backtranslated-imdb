I recently stopped broadcasting television broadcast in the 80's with Dean Brothers (with the commercials). I lend it to many friends, all of whom agreed that this is one of the best B "bandit" movies. One day, while going to my NYC apartment, I saw Stacy Kitch in a TV show, a scene for Mickey Spillen. We had a moment to chat, and I've enjoyed how much she admits Dean Bros, and it seems to be a pure classic. He thanked me and said, this is his career's best and most memorable film experience. He was very friendly and sincere, and I was grateful for a few minutes to chat with a fan. This is a classic that needs to be in DVD.
