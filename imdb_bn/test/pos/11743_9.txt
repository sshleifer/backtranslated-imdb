This film always hit me emotionally hard at the end. Although the subject of movies - various romance and adultery - was controversial at this time, however, this film has crossed the path more than the narrow parameters of ground breaking innovation and trill burning uniqueness. Here is our love story of love, as written by a woman involved in this love, a brilliant aggressive style that expresses the passion and greatness of crazy love. This is the only passion I "love" that gives life really valuable. Jennifer Jones is full of mercy and his role as a reporter of William Holden is simply gorgeous. An extraordinary movie that only contains such love can really grasp and understand. And those who still do not love, hope that electricity can strike for you one day, makes life worth much - because love is worth less for a little while - even if you lose - even love "element" - summary - summary. This film works for me. A warm-felt experience!
