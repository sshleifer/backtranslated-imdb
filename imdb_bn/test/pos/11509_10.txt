The film is Paul (Pal), a young man worried about his condition in a tough world of madness and "Kleppur" in his mental hospital and his friends. Victor (Victor) thinks Adolf Hitler during his education in England. Peter (Puteur) who takes a lot of LSD and tries to fly on the roof, leaving a broken bone or physical damage only without dementia, he is tied with China. Oli Beetle (Olly Bitil) Oli has been admitted to the hospital most of the time, although Victor is older than him, he claims he has written single beetles songs and has sent them to telepathy <br /> <br /> The novel is a better film and Paul's life is in his death. I've spent a long time watching the film, but if the film does not cover Paul's childhood, br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "England aliensis" is funny, sad and powerful if you are not seeing it now! And to read the novel, it makes the movie even better
