I'm not a big fan of movie musicals. "Annie" I loved to have a stage show but the movie was a flow. "The feeling of an opera movie" (and I believe that there were three) did not match Weber Staging. But I love it. The DVD will take a place of respect in my "keeper". Although it is a movie adaptation, it captures the taste and atmosphere of the live theater in any way. Bette Midler, always a treat, this role is just exceptional. There are great music, lots of smiles and even a tears or two. I saw most of the musical instruments of the eighth and nineties. Somehow I miss this one so there is no comparison. But if it is revitalized then I will be the first to be the ticket! But this movie is so good, I will be in astonishing position to wonder if the production of the stage will measure up to the movie.
