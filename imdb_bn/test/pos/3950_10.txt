I can not get this flick of my brain. It's definitely something that is totally different. I saw a ton of movies on the holidays and some things have not really blindspot rocked my world's stone. There are some ways cool about the way of the actors and the way they put movies together. It's like there's really scary things mixed with some pretty f **** sunny black humor. Franko is a cool but stupid dude stole some scenes from the scene, as if he threw the child from the tomb. I do not appreciate some politically correctos vibe (not to bring your grandma) but it is totally extraordinary. The best thing is the calidhak style. There are some really serious elements mixed with super interesting footage on the road. The film really makes you sad and scared, but it spins your head with what's happening and how it is illustrated. World with WTF? So many critics are embracing these supposedly revolutionary roles on broken films and when you see them they are annoying and anticipated and not everything. There are a lot of good choices because I do not get it. Blind spot is really great because it gives you the thrills and the cold and the main upcoming star power, but it does so in such a way that it is a completely fresh and completely complete original.
