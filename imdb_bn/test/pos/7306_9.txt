I think many have already commented on this picture, but I like it well, I just want to say that this is good for a movie. I gave it 10 to 9 rating. It did not get 10 because it is very slow. I leave it around, but I'm not happy. <br /> <br /> This is basically a movie about relationships: deception, belief, and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Michael Falphar, Jessica Lange and Jason Roberts are all working in this movie. <br /> <br /> Set in the Midwest Farm Country, Jason Roberts is a farmer whose first grandfather had settled there. Jason's character became older and he decided to set up a trust to share thousands of acres of agricultural land among his three adult girls. The plot of this movie really started while the <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > They discover something about each other's childhood, and with an adulterous relationship with their current marriage, when the parents become increasingly humiliating, demanding and paranoid - until everyone comes out of the terrible truth warmly. <br /> <br /> This picture has really reached me emotionally, I got angry with some characters, and sad about them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />>
