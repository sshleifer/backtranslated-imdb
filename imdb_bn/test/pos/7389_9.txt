I saw the Dark Harb of the '98 Seattle Film Festival. Filmed against an autumn Maine backdrop, this film is a wonderful cast and a plot that guides you throughout life. Occasionally annoying, I want to say that it was with me for a few days after seeing it. Rickman and Walker are wonderful marriages and Rudas is one that you've heard, I'm sure. In the evening, a shocking, lonely street start shot (and the accompanying score) sets a very good voice - just fine. Excellent, excellent work from a new-man director / screenwriter and his talented crew.
