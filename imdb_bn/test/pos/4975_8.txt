This is my favorite west one. What a Cast! Glenn Ford plays his role in his normal light, controlled, but firmly. Ford is in the shade of a strong anchor farm that wants to consume the entire terrain in a game of small ranchers. Edward G. Robinson Anchor is a helpless parent of the Ranch and Barbara Stanwick plays his intelligent planning wife. There is plenty of work to do this on the west, it is quite impressive, the scene is breathtaking and the Leisurebox is taking photographs breathing photography and soundtrack stereo! I would say that this Western was a size capable budget, it looks expensive. Great Glenn Ford is one of the Western series.
