After many days the Marathi film came with some good movies. This movie is one of the best mother languages ​​ever made. It shows how an old grandfather tries to save his granddaughter's eyes. She tried everything possible to save her child's eyes. The doctor and his relatives tried to help him in his attempt. <br /> <br /> The role of grandfather, boy and doctor is simply fantastic. They showed the true picture of a common Marathi life. Every bit of action has some meaning in it. I would recommend showing this movie, at the beginning I thought it would be a documentary type but it was more than my expectations. <br /> <br /> This picture is really going to touch your heart. I hope more dying movies come with performances like this.
