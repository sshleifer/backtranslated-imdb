I saw this in the first demand. Or on TV I'm not really sure. But this will be my favorite time all the time! I mean, this film is about the film, blood, gore, smile and chill. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and I found it because I saw "Monster Man". Trust me, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> The funny way of DVD commentary While speaking, they said something about "Monster Man 2". Let's hope they will make "Monster Man 2"! If you have a chance, rent a movie or buy it. You will love it This is the best movie released in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
