SPOILER Nothing but SPOILER <br /> <br /> I think other people who think that my name will be added to the list may not get it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, he shoots an old shirt down the slope, shoot off the cliff and ... "fly away". Perhaps the complete account of death is a fairy tale or perhaps he committed suicide like a madman. In any case, he "flies" (Commonly, this is not a difficult metaphor). <br /> <br /> Maybe I have a thing for Tom Hans, but I was fine with the description. He is raising $ $ for WW2 memories and for that you also have to love him. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I like the movie and it's incredibly moving.
