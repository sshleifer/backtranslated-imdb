Finally !!! The most tragic serial killer in history is a good movie. For lesser acquaintance with Ed Gene, he was originally a madman who was known for grave robberies and his victims' skinning (which is the most horrific fans leaked). Shot in a style that perfectly reflects the worst plane of Wisconsin, which is still the most atmospheric horror film in the genre and portraying its deadly killings. Cain Holder (Jason from the 13th Series on Friday) and Michael Brewman (Mountain Eyes I and Eye), giving a steady performance in this series of killer tears, which easily goes behind the unimaginative former gene attempt. So far, I will say it is one of the biggest horror films of the year (Turistas = 0).
