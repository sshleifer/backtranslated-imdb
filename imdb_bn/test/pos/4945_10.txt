Soul Calibu is more difficult than ever ... The new character created, and the bad ass chronicle of sword mode in the home version. <br /> <br /> The Arcade version is even more complete, though the character is less than the Home version of the roster, this version certainly eliminates the "Incognito / Unreal" battle styles found in two more beautiful, home editions. If you were disappointed with the Home version, or perhaps it seems "too much," you might see more of the likes and direct play of Sol Calibur on the arcade. Do you think there is a legend?
