Where to start, I like Jack Frost, the terrible snow-giant. The whole idea works well for me, we thought she would come back and she was. Local changes to work in a tropical resort. See the old friends and fill the new letters. Scott McDonald did a great job like Jack Frost, when an actor can have fun playing a villain, you can see it or hear it in action in this case. Yup, Jack Frost 2 is a welcomed seagull like the first one. I have a complaint, as little jacks or jacklings I call them. They looked like hand dolls. I think they could do better with Jacklings, the face could be bigger, but the CGI was good and was completely valuable to watch the film over again. If you like Jack Frost, you'll love this sigl.
