Beginning from the beginning, the fat ended with a group of students who met together and literally killed each other by hindering their hearts and then reviving them. Then they study what happened to the "near death" experience. When they go through every experience, they feel frustrated by their deepest fears which are believed to be implemented as reality. These ranges seem to be looking at dead bodies from dead children with hockey sticks. <br /> <br /> Cast first rate and Oliver Plat play one of the best roles in his career. I'm not a big caf√© Sutherland fan but he does a great job. This is a movie that I can watch over and over!
