This movie is a benchmark in non-mainstream movie history. The use of Montage Strike (Eisenstein's first film) represents a quantum leap from relatively easy juxtapositions. Take a look at the footage and watch the recurring shot of the soldiers, really repeat the horrific dots happening! An extremely intelligent memorabilist film, one must watch for all the film students!
