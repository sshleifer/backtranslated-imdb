Kelsey Grammar (probably his first major role in a feature) is a remarkable naval sub-commander who strikingly good and fast-fared courage to run his own nuclear material; He achieved this by competing against the American Navy in the continuation of war crimes, competing with uneducated, suspected, and loving men (and a woman) also a cricketer. <br /> <br /> Director David S. Ward ("Major League") and his authors have created a wonderful, clever and enthusiastic comedy that tries to understand the film easily, which they do very well. Second, in addition to the character of the gramma, most of the crew movie provides some or a lot of humor, which is treated as double the sword. Supporting Cast Three Members - Harland Williams, Toby Husse and Rob Schneider have provided the most interesting scenes, among which are strange gestures, camouflage and good, their personality. <br /> <br /> A Navy version of "Police Academy" or "Darty Dosage" is more than "Down Perisse". How does the film work properly and I like it.
