George C Scott is the best of this movie, Bernard Hughes is the best and Diana Rig is at its most fascinating time and certainly Paddy Cubsky wrote in the title "Best Composition"! Susan Sarandan, Starkard Channing, etc. are some of the biggest small snippets in the future, with a view line that you can not spot in order to see your fifth or six times. Nancy Murchand and young old nurses are also excellent supervisors, as well as every "face" of Hollywood in the 1970's. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies that you see. See "Wonders" for ALA "Wait Until Dark"! One of the few movies it bought in DVD. It's that fantastic.
