I spent an hour watching this great monster Fintie and his "Dan Band" in my special show in Bravo, which I have watched the most enjoyable hours I have ever spent watching TV. This young man (donate) as a singer, actor and even dancer, such incredible talent. He can go from the most influential songs of the ballad pop song, all of which are only songs by women, hip-hop, rock, songs written for women .. This guy can do something. I have seen him alive at least 11 times, so I do not expect how much his program will look like in television or film format, but because of the great star quality of the donation, all reserves go away after the show begins. A favor and this is good, or better yet, buy it.
