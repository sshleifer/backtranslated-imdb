The story begins with a soldier transferred to a desert, then he came to this place how time goes back to telling the story. He started working as an officer in the Egyptian war in the Napoleonic army but separated from his unit. After almost the hungry and / or thirsty death, he came on a leopard as his bosom became the friend. This brought him food and long before the soldier became almost completely wild, so his relationship with the animal was intense. But everything ends and the man decides that he has to leave the crew. A very curious film, well written and illustrated. Beautiful scenes from Jordan and Utah which do not always blend perfectly, but who care.
