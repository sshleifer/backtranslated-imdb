I really want to thank you for the chance to be the first to see the movie. It really does not make you grip John Paul can finally see the light and stay tied for himself with his own mother's ant strings. <br /> <br /> I think today there should be many families in the same position (imagine that children are out of the house but I do not want to be impressive), very sad parents who did not really own their own life Makes life sad. <br /> <br /> I think this film must be an odd audience - audience. I would say that other actors played well as good part. It's a deep film and very moving.
