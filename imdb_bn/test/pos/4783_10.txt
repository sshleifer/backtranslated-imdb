This is the first cartoon with Mickey Mouse cartoon release and the sound of the first. It was based on a silent film called "Steamboat Bill, Junior". Acting in Buster Keaton At the beginning of this early Mickey, Mickey did not speak and did not have gloves. He could just play stairs and music. The song that he played was "Barnide in Struggle", using musical instruments such as musical instruments. She plays a cow's tooth as a golphon and she plays teats of nursing seeds like an association keyboard. Captain stomach, however makes micky rock potatoes in very crazy and lane. Pitt's parrot flies up to the window and gives order to sprinkle potatoes. Dry potato powdered half-akher and gave a smile, closed the cartoon. I was able to get this cartoon tape and I really liked it. I think design shorts are much better than the length movie.
