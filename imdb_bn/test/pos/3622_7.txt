Spike Milgigan's books and plays have overtaken the filmmakers for years, and 'Pookun' in 2002 is sadly no exception. The 1924 novelist influenced the division of Ireland, especially the single community (title 'Pukun'). Due to a huge mistake, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, in the other half of the Republic. Locals go out to find their bandwidth fences in the toilets below their garden. Enjoy the cheap pins for the crowds of water like sardines in the water corners. There must be a passport in the name of a deceased person before the villagers reach Churchyard to bury him. <br /> <br /> Irish 'Under Milk Wood' with plenty of comic characters and spiritual phenomena 'Fink'. The lead character, Dan Miligen (called 'Madigan' in the film), played abusively with Shan Hughes and talked with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). Also, Milo and Shia, Graf Rie Jones, David Kelly (from "Robins Nest"), Freddie Jones, Joe McGan and Elliott Gould. In the film <br /> <br /> Documentary, writer / director Terrence Ryan has expressed great appreciation for the book. It shows on screen. But, like the unfortunate movie of Hit-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a good book certainly does not make a good movie. The problem with 'Pookun' is that, like other books of Milligan, they simply do not work on big screens. 'Pookun' basically collects jokes in search of a plot. <br /> <br /> 'Potato Male Sex Life', 'Fat Slug' and 'Lashyan Vampire Killers', but then it should not be that which was good. In the last half an hour, police, British soldiers, some local people, who kept the explosives in a coffin, were walking around and they were really tired to sit. Rayon's decision to engage closely with the book is the root cause of failure to act as a movie. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the absence of the total absence. The 'Walking Ned' was frustrating when the 'Father Ted' television series was a lot more fun. Spike takes a long time to watch the movie, and apparently enjoyed it. Her daughter J. Jane has a kayoma as Madigan's bride. <br /> <br /> Highlights for me, though the quote was in the beginning: "I'm not going to die!" Spike says, "I just don", it will happen when you want to be there! ".
