This is definitely one of the most scary and spell-binding films ever made. You are stuck in the film from the beginning to the very end. Although there are some plot holes, it makes the final showdown exciting. In addition to "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom", it is one of our best cultures about "snake cinema", which is the forbidden theme of our culture. If you like scram trillions, you probably like it.
