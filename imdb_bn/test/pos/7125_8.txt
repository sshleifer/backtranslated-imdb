There are some films that have been waiting for me and waiting for release. This is the final film of Dead Gentleman Group responsible for the original gamers film and Daemon Hunter films. This group has not been actively active in the past few years, but this film is a specific reason to try to follow their progress and keep things going. <br /> <br /> Following a group of gamers who are trying to finish this film, a campaign managed by GM is frustrated by his team's neglect of his story. With the help of some new blood they again try to campaign again with the hope of repeating this campaign again. <br /> <br /> This movie is a new breath in the movie community and a great improvement over the core. The film shows tribute to the game like the original film, but its movie shows a dramatic improvement with its special effects on the simplicity of movies. Acting is fairly decent and jokes are quite funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately most of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a gamer you will not find funny pictures like others. So I gave this movie 8 instead of 9 which I thought first. If you are a gamer or know about gaming, you will enjoy it in one of them.
