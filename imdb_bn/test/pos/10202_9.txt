A sort of this hidden gem. It's no promotion, little fanfare, there's little to no classic status, and it deserves all of the above! The film's great director, Fred Lang, created a real jewel in this wonderful west. Randolph Scott (probably in his greatest performance), always a strong Dean Zagger, Robert Young, an amazingly accomplished couple and many more experienced character actors: Chill Wills, Slim Somerville, John Carradine, Burton McLean and Western Union wire across other countries is an exciting Zane Gray Story It has fictional drama, humorous fungus and great effect. It is a memorable way through the way of the comments and yet Fred Lang leaves his own stamps. Very rarely this great western!
