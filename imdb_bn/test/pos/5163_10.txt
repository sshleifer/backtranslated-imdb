No short follow reviews except spoilers. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My initial reaction is one of the wonders and happiness. I'm making this kind of movie at the age of blockbuster. <br /> <br /> "Anderson, the new film" You, The Living "is nothing less than a complete masterpiece. You are composed by some 50 Vintet, pictured with a static camera live. I will not provide the contents of the scenes here, because I hate when people loot the smallest details. But, yes, most of the scenes completely annoy and surprise 1,000 people in the Cloud Debus Theater. We finished the film for a few minutes, we had no choice. <br /> <br /> So what's the score with "You, the Living"? HM, Anderson is not afraid to take heavy questions; History, crime, and the World of Holocaust during the World War II (and these themes work well together). <br /> <br /> Photos are bright, depth sometimes beyond the "Songs from the second floor". <br /> <br /> Sorry, sorry for this annoying, review is appreciated. People look at the Flying House at the beginning! <br /> <br /> 10/10 star - a masterpiece (I never throw this grade).
