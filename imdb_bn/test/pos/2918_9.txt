Being interested in Akhnatan for many years, I was surprised to learn about this movie via e-bay and bought a DVD copy for 99p. I enjoyed the movie, wandered with the plot and basically made Sinha a main character, instead of an action film, instead of making a "Family Saga". The detailed time dress and attention was extraordinary for his time (1955). The projection behind the journey of the chariot now looks weird. My main interest was the character of Akhenatan and his monotheistic religion. In this picture, he is portrayed as "Jesus", as he indicated with the Hittites to go to war, even when he attacked Egypt and in his last lecture he also spoke about the inability of material and political power. Initially, he established a connection between Snoh, who had jumped along the Nile River, and the Old Testament was cast into Moses. But this connection is no doubt that it will be fully searched in a new movie where a character like Moses carries a monotheistic religion of Akkashan to the greater world, if such a film is ever possible politically possible. It has been universally acknowledged that women were concerned that people are stupid creatures but lacking the relationship between Sinha and Merit, acting by Gen Simmons is difficult to play. And an educated physician, Sinuhi, will be hurt by the "deadly fatal" of the Baby Nafar in the amount of mother tongue given to her father, and the grave is not really believable, nor her parents will be buried. Nefer (Nefertitti) in real life was Akhenaton's wife. And even though Horemheb was Pharaoh, he was still with Tantankeman who was the son of Akhennath. <br /> <br /> But of course it's just enjoyable to watch and watch movies and it's a big bonus about Akhenaton and its monotheistic religion. Perhaps following the book "The Vs. Code" and the film, this film will be rebuilt in the central secret as the basis of our current monotheism! I look forward to the great expectation of such a film, the topic already has numerous books.
