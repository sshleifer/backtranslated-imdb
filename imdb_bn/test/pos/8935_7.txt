Only Brights can make such a film and it can be so beautifully charming! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more than life, but she does not know when she realizes that she loves her childhood friend Boris (Alfred Molina), who owns the local funeral porter. Meanwhile, an American mother tongue (Christopher Walken), who wants to "bring" fun "back in fun" accompanied by his assistant (Lee Evans), comes to this small Welsh community and wants Boris to give sticky, themed funerals for his money. . (Star Trek funeral, someone?) Brenda and Boris Brenda's death and funeral decided to resolve, alternately with ridiculous results. A very enjoyable movie - if you're a fan of the British joke as "Watching the Divine" you would love it.
