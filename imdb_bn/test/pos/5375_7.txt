This is a common and main example of the horrible devil shocking of the complete weird ball properties 70. The event is totally confusing and it takes a while before knowing what it's going to be, but the skin of the skin will expose you immediately. Spontaneously from strange articles, showing some of the cruel kids being bitten by toys in real life instruments, you are simply becoming an incompatible and bitter shock. "Satan's Brotherhood" seems to be another installment in a fictional and unauthorized "dark secret secret mysterious city". A young widow who is traveling with her new friendly girlfriend and an 8-year-old girl is stuck in a remote marine town, reporting a car accident that has been seen near a highway. The villagers behave very hostile and insist the visitors to go straight away. The city is clearly washed by fear and panic, because local children invisible and invisible forces keep everyone in the city limits. Hillsboro is ruled by an elderly members of the community, apparently in the stronghold of a devil worship. I really liked a lot of "Brotherhood of Satan". The story reminds me of a novel by John Saul, but I can not remember the title. It is abused by the young villagers for their greediness with a worship of the youth. The film mainly relies on vague scenes (like dolls and magic consoles) but little more involved and coherent screenplay is excellent. Subject often raises many issues and questions, and director Bernard McKeebie can not always answer us. Climax is awesome, very seventy (meaning nasty meaning) and unforgettable. Nice film shot,.
