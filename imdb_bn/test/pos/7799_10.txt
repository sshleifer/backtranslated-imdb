My favorite movie is Andaz, which is also one of the Top 5 Intelligent Comedy Films in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I was 8 years old when the movie was released and I heard it was a floppy but I still can not understand why it was a flop ... but let me tell you something ... By selling cassettes and DVDs in the movie, the movie will get more money by showing TV movie channels than any hit movie. This film has been shown numerous times on movie channels and I think it still has been in public love and TV producers repeat the film. I personally watched the whole movie for more than 80 meters and still I love it ..... <br /> <br /> Like Amir Khan and love, Salman Khan has acted like love, but in particular I played Amir Khan as a smart guy on the street. Her conversations in the movie ... Hillaryos ... the story is simple and how it goes ......... <br /> <br /> <br /> A poor, lazy chap and a door Come to the poor family and mine Dad is a sailor Then both of them have heard that Millionaire's daughter from London is coming to India to find a suitable match ... Both immortal and love think that it is a great opportunity to become very rich ... so they both want to kiss Rabindra Tendon. (Millionaire's daughter) ...... They hated each other on their journey and each of them tried to fool Rabina to marry another ..... comedy scene so laughable that laughing laughs you need a glass of water to stop pain in your stomach ....... And then Raveness Uncle (Millionaire's face is a brother) Teja who takes revenge from the father of Reyvenes He wants to ... he is broken and Raven's father is a millionaire ... his plan is to kidnap Rabindranath to blackmail, for which he hired two kids. <br /> <b After that we know that there is a twist on the movie (see the film) ....... Then there is the power of Kapur Kapoor as the master Gogho who is incredibly furious blue ...... <br /> <br /> The thing that stood for me is the dialogue of the movie that has become a legend ... Aamir Khan used his "Ayla" brightly and used Salman to be like "Omim" ... and for Gogo "Job Tonight Yarn Haine mother says, "Shuj Nahi Goga a jaiga" ... ...... every scene is so funny ... <br /> <br /> I like especially, Amir Khan and Salman whole Ravenna has got a spunk and both of them have gone leaving a bag "Chilaar" in Liga. This scene is so funny .. <br /> <br /> I recommend someone who understands Hindi or Urdu for this movie ... ... this is a movie I recommend to have a DVD and you'll never be sorry No no ......
