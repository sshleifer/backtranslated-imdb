This is an elementary from the boys, but some people can not be satisfied with others. I found it to be somehow different than your average Stooge slapstick. Instead of seeing it in the eye, it was more fun than Jokes. See a sunny part when Larry takes Stethoscope from Mo and sings in it. Ladders give him a good smack That part cracked me well for ten minutes. Another hit for stooges.
