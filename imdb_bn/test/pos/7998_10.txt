This sequence proves that Tim Burton is always the best choice to handle the best Batman movie for all purposes and purposes. The story focuses on the dwarf with three enemies: The Penguin (amazingly played by Danny Davito) Catwhomman (Slynick Mitchell Pfeffer) and Max Shrek (Fantastic Christopher Walken). Perhaps the best entry series, it all has: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that really stand out. Caste is simply surprising but with a visible stand-out multi-layered penguin as Davito. Here is a man who is evil, sad, funny and perhaps most important, scary. The infamous scene with Shakek's picture consultants still sends my spine to the spine. In other words, Cast is the joy of watching and the first-rate performance becomes. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite favorite of all Butman (sorry, Dark Knight Fans). If you want a superhero film that offers a lot more than the effect of flashy and big scale action, watch this badly contained movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> If nothing else happens, at least the best film Tim Burton ever created.
