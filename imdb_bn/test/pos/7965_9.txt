I was very happy and at the same time non-Koreans were surprised to see other positive comments below. This movie is surprisingly heartwarming, and is ideal for the Korean people, which is very sad to look at 'sad but warm' towards life. I thought other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and would reduce this silent film as annoying, but I was wrong. The attraction of this movie can be difficult to escape from foreigners. (Even with subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I'd like to mention something else I missed. Of course, this movie depicts love between a man and a woman. However, too much of the theme is beyond that. Indeed, it's about time, worth remembering and about death. In this picture, there is no love relationship between two people. As something specific, they do not kiss, they hold hands, do not embrace each other. So love itself is not done (positive or negative) in the film. Rather, a jingwain (a leading actor) who is disappointed by his impending death She is spending time, she can not hold it, leaving her father a little behind and, of course, with Darim (a metamorphic). So the problem is how he can face death and leave something valuable in his younger life, not how he can love Darima. <br /> <br /> This theme is very familiar to us. There are lots of movies about patients with uncertain diseases like 'love story'. However, this film makes it unique, the jangwaan is the way of his death. She is a damn, but trying to do her best when she is alive, is a solid way. He will not tell anyone around him about his death. He hides something of his mind but without anger, hatred, without vengeance. She is just trying to work well when she is alive. This limited communication and loyalty to fate is the common sense of the Korean and most western people do not understand or believe in the best, misunderstood. <br /> <br /> This theme is published very effectively by the director of this movie. Amazing, his debut). Some people say Japan's director Ozu Yasuji is also influenced by him, he orders the Tokyo Store. Actually, I think in some papers I read that the director himself admitted that he was influenced by ozu. I do not know how to analyze his style compared to ozu, but some of them are not simple and there is nothing. Low angle and static cameras, especially reminds us of Ozu's style. But, again on the terms of the theme, this Korean director seems to be somewhat warm and optimistic. <br /> <br /> It was briefly published with Jangwang's last photo. Very good work and really impressive view, I think. In fact, the director assumed the idea of ​​this film first when he participated in the funeral of the famous Korean singer Guy, who killed the mysterious suicide youth. They said that he had seen the picture of the song in the funeral and thought of a movie on death and memory. (And perhaps I hope for the remnant ...) <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone that anyone of whom has a strong interest in Korean culture with anyone else. In my opinion, this image can be competing with other movies like the Tokyo story and like American beauty. Without language barriers it is great if it is. The DVD version is going out in the market in February, so it could be a little bit of help for foreign subtitles with foreign subtitles.
