It was a great anime. Actually animation is old but it is still valuable and there is a better plot than the manual scroll, that problem was long. <br /> <br /> Japanese film star Hiroki Sandha, who played Uji from the last samurai, was the main character Zero and it was directed by Rantor, who made the Galaxy Express 999 and metropolitan. <br /> <br /> Anime has some good animations for an old enamy, an interesting character like the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shozan and of course do not forget. Beautiful musical score in the picture. <br /> <br /> These movies are valuable for fans of anime, usually for animations, actions and samurai / ninja flicks. Despite the greed of film, the film is not a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this picture.
