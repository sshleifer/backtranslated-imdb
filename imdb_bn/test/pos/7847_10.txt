During the civil war an injured union soldier is hiding in an isolated Confederate female 'school; Where head teachers and school teachers decide to take care of him and keep him alone, until the problem starts between lonely and sexually-minded women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it comes at a price at the end of all. <br /> <br /> "Dear Harry (1971)" (which was created at the same time as "The Begead") can be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after watching it, I think it's a pair together 'Best to work. The very unreasonable, intelligent, and stylish car for Eastwood is always marked by a direction controlled by Don Siegel and a scary sound of Lalo Shiffin. Strongly firmly strong and tireless nature, which is sincerely planted in the film's psychological makeup, and manipullet in the sexual abuse is stagnant. It makes it more brooding and curdling the blood while it stays relentlessly and while holding it with random shock and gripping tension of the sticky intentions. Slim screenplay (taken from Thomas Kullinan's novel), John B. Sherry and Grimes Gray's alluring bold screen, is effective in Stark's tight and lyrical context. As Segel's strong side captures the South Victorian setting, with strangely rendered photography, and he creates images with a little strange wonder and is transparently restrained. <br /> <br /> The performance time is really pretty and high quality. As Clint Eastwood is smoothly subdued, sweet-talking blinds union soldier is very influential and delightfully assured. A deep prominent Geraldine page stole the image, such as the stern head mistress and elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a fine continuity of her innocent character. Mae Mercer is firmly selected as black maid and Joe Anne Harris is picking crops from young students with her seductively sly personality. <br /> <br /> The real Eastwood characteristic played the field for its selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions where anyone played (where the competition is going on between women) is not better than their guests. Overall sunny and satiric touch elements have a confusing dark sense. What has been shown here is more than just your basic little psychological shock, but one that is deeply laminated with the plot and a sense of reality which is difficult to reduce. That goes for his extremely eerie title and close lyrics. <br /> <br /> An effective cool, low-key item that is difficult to lure by its hospitality hospitality difficult.
