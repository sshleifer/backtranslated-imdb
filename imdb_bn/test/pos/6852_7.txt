Okay, Anatomy is not recollecting Hororormovie-Genre, but it's done well. Good actor (patent and fuhman in the beginning) and some nice ideas made me happy. Maybe I would not be so positive if this was not the German film, but who took care of it. It's good to see familiar faces in a good, thrilling story, and some good joke. You all complain about dubbing: I do not see a dubbed version (of course) but I believe that watching movies is not easy on your side. We (Germans) used to watch such movies, so this is not a big problem. But try to see in Germany with subtitles. Actors are really good!
