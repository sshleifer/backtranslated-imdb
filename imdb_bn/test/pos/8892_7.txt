College teacher Larry Denner (Billy Krystal) was a block writer who destroyed her former wife Margaret (Kate Maggri), stole her novel, which turned into a best seller. He did not hide his hatred towards Margarith, he bored his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Grist), who is an anthropologist of the same college. While giving a Creative Writing Class, he was arrested by student Wayne (Danny Davito), who wants to know his opinion about his crime story. Larry says that he does not like it, and explains that in each mysterious story, the murderous purpose is to disappear and to make Alibi, otherwise he will be caught. In addition, Larry has advised Owe to watch Whituck's films to understand the structure of a suspicious story. Oven, who wanted to kill his disgusting mother (Ana Ramsey), saw "strangers on the train" and misinterpreted Larry's advice, believing that his teacher wanted murder for reducing the motive. Oven travels to Hawaii and when on a ship, Margarith is extinct in the sea and is considered dead. However, Larry did not become an alibi and became the main suspect, when the insulted Owen pressured him to kill his mother as part of his supposed contract. <br /> <br /> "Throw the mommy from the train" 80's funny comedy and great respect for Alfred Hittko. Direct references are "train strangers" but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with spinning camera), "family plot" (with car without division) and other movies. The line is nice and there is an interesting point when Larry says that every great romance or mystery has a train. Anne Ramsey is amazing in the role of a nasty and insulting dominating mother and visitors must surely feel sad and understand the madness of Owen. Kim Greist is very nice and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Cristal performs an obsessed character much silly and illogical attitude but needs plot. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jog a mama da trem" ("Train from Tho Moma")
