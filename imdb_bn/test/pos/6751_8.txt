I found this little jewel as an added feature in Vampire-der Tram des Alan Gray's My DVD, and I did not expect much from it. It seems to be a little tricky, so I've turned it on. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad that I did. It was really incredible! Despite being made more than 70 years ago, the animation is better in my eyes than all the effects and experiences of today's computer. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple. The toy together with the new toy dog ​​is able to have an orange capacity not able to hear its owner's lant and goes on a quest to find one of her. In this process, it is in a toy underwear that does not show all the wild animals and toys other than the devil, who all want dog orange for themselves. <br /> <br /> This picture was already there, but does Mad Monster Party remind me a lot? (1969, Zeus Bus) - a movie that I've always enjoyed-and for some time, some animated works by Tim Burton- Nightmare (1993, Henry Cecil) and Corps Bride (2005, Tim Burton) before Christmas. Any actor in this movie, I'm sure, also love mascot. <br /> <br /> Overall, incredible small animations that are good to see.
