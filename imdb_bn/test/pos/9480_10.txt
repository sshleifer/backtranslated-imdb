For the first time I saw this DVD, because this band was for the first time for the first time in decades, because the DVD was very loud. Jimmy Page can not definitely live with cool music, I guess. During the concert of the Royal Albert Hall, they will also say, 'How many times' and 'Mickey Dick' have been for a long time. Other that, it was fine. All time my favorite songs are now on DVD Trampled under the legs. It is either that one or 'my time of death' That song, Jimmy really plays that stuff well. Play Randie Rhoads ever seen? Well, Jimmy is playing like him, his guitar is not low.
