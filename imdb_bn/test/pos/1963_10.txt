I just saw this movie a second time. I saw this as a Vanguard video selection in the mid-90s first. It has power. <br /> <br /> This is interesting from many aspects. One is based on a true story of it. The two are a launch pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crespen Glover. And three, her Dennis Hooper is one of the roles of his social social mix / psychological character. <br /> <br /> This film is a study that works in various settings. You have one-on-one, family, colleague group, school, general social setting, etc. The story works well to show how it works in each setting. <br /> <br /> Find out the actual murder details like comparing the movie I want. I saw a brief bit of instruction that happened in California and many school colleagues were taken to see the bodies. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice for rental videos on rainy night. Be ready to feel unsettled at the end.
