I went to see this picture because Joakim de Almeida was in it. Joachim had a fairly small part, so it was good that I liked my picture. Actually, I liked it a lot! <br /> <br /> The film is about two characters, Albert and Louis. Albert is not a shy, retired sort, and Louie ... well Louie. The story revolved around Albert's request to Louie to allow him to come to Albert's place for a short time. Louis just got out of prison. <br /> <br /> Albert and Louis have been known to each other since childhood, and of course, when they do something together, there is a problem and Albert will always fall. <br /> <br /> The film's performance is based on this event from the tour of Louis. On-run crazy-hat, zany, a chronic in situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and script writer, Joseph Minion (next hour), do not always accept you wherever you want to go. Add depth to this film that has twists and turns. Of course there are plenty of comedy, but there are many fine humor. <br /> <br /> Here are some low-level performances. Albert played the delightful by Michael Imperioli. He has long been known from the HBO series, The Sovereigns. <br /> <br /> Louise is featured in John Ventimiglia, who portrays his character with a loving, child-quality standard. (She'll love Louie whatever she is doing!) <br /> <br /> <br /> Both of these actors are excellent in their individual characters. With Imperioli, you'd embrace him and bring him home to Mother. Ventimiglia, well, you should make him slap or bring him home (and not the mother!). <P> <br /> <br /> There are also other stand-out performers. The character of Rita is played by Draina De Niro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience adored her. While talking to people who saw this movie it was interesting to discuss Albert or Louie's about whether they were their favorites. But everyone loves Rita <br /> <br /> Is this picture perfect? No, I can not say that. Many times I wanted to have a big budget to work with the director. There were scenes that cried for some more budget freedom. (Make a decent budget to work with this guy and I believe that you are going to see a movie that will stand up and give you a notice. <br /> <br /> The last budget was a bit of a victim of the budget. However, the budget or any budget, the last screen shot on my screen, the actor and director talent brought in a memorable, emotional effective scene. <br /> <br />
