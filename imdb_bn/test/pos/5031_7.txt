Although this movie is not particularly standing up to the movie crowd, even though it is very beautiful picture of your football! Perhaps you can catch one or two mistakes and cinematic is a little slipshod, the film is very enjoyable and has a nice environment. The music makes a lot of contribution to movie mood. <br /> <br /> The acting is less impressive (especially that dog!) with John Travolta's funny-boring-loving Michael's leadership. Other characters seem very genuine and act very well in the film. <br /> <br /> After working for a long time, enjoy the "Michael" stick in the evening with a few ice cream and a very good quality film. Own right :)
