The punishment is a pseudo-documentary made by Park Peter Watkins. Ancestral nation's opponents (Hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) became round and judged by the tribunal and then run prison's choice or punishment park courses. It follows the path of the American flag, police, the National Guard, and other authorities to follow through the desert through a 52-mile desert. The idea is that if you make it in the flag, you are free. The tribunal has a conservative group that condemns behaviors that are not of themselves, and there is no result except in the prison or any other trial except the "punishment park" option. There are so many things that seem to be true even today, which are quite boring in themselves. The people running the course are committed to the water at half-way point, which is not true, and the pursuing officials are mostly an audacious group that is out to practice some of the targets. This is not a very graphic film, but it is more disgusting than its ideas and themes. Awesome thing, it can happen. Not a very enthusiastic film but definitely see the price. Warning: This may make you angry. 10 out of 9
