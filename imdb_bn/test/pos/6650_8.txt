I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, not as much thinking as "English Patient" (a modern day classic). The first 20 minutes or more seems painful, but Inman (Jude Law) started his journey to Aava (Nikol Kidman), the film jumped and became confined and it became a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. . Apparently it's fashionable to hate Kidman right now, but I do not agree, and he works well here. I really think the romance has developed weakly in the inmens and in the script (they do not actually get a screen time together to build relationships), but the law and kidnap it satisfy them all. Ada's journey is the cruise of the film - she is a powerful woman who can tolerate almost anything. For the first time, as a geligger Ruby seems to be all wrong, but in the subsequent scenes, she grew up after all. The film has made beautiful photography and designs, but it sometimes does not capture the real feelings of time intervals. Jack White, in particular, has long hair and a pale rubber color that is perfectly styled with the setting. Cillian Murphy fans will soon enjoy watching partner Irish actors, and Natalie Portman actually proves that she might possibly act as the most attractive sequel to the film. It is very sad that he is so inadequate in "The All Bowl Girl".
