Yes, in fact, one of our winners - the best mobile-movie-winning movie! <br /> <br /> I chose to vote for this movie because it is really bad that it's actually fun. <br /> <br /> "Knight Hunter" was originally Jack Kapter, a vampire hunter (Vampire hunters have apparently been in his generation for centuries), and about his mission, he must kill the last remaining vampires <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is one of the most fascinating scenes in my life. The really bad gun shooting scene is not mentioned. When people shoot in this film, the blood spreads - thick as ketchup all over the place, this movie is so cheap and hairy that you lose interest. The constant vibration of the camera makes me most annoyed during the war-scene. I think it has been done to create a "action-effect", although in my opinion it does not have any effect. Its totally ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All stunts-scene is done very badly. Such a scene where the dead vampire-leader is throwing off a roof. When the body hits the ground, it bounces as a hobbied rubber-doll. A scene where Jack had softened the soil, received a visit, so the link laughs me violently. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < An error This is a good film that should be said that nuclear bombs are good for humans. Obviously you guys are saying that this is one of the best action-movies, many in your life have not been seen. <br /> <br /> This is basically a B-class vampire-action-movie that claims 0/10 but which I can give 10, smile to me only for its power (I've ever seen the most cruel action-movie) And because I can not live without it.
