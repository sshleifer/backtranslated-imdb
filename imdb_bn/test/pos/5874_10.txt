What can anyone say about a wilder film other than the most people and real stories about man and what handles them, bugs them, hunt them out Billy made a picture of painting that reflects human condition forever. He gave us good and bad images. She painted with love. I can not imagine that there is a list of the greatest films without a wilder movie on it. They are the truth because they will end. At the age of 60 I saw this movie on TV and when I was young I had to leave the house because tears in my eyes were ashamed and ashamed. Now I am an old man and I still feel tears well but do not leave the room. I knew these people and loved them and grew up around them. Billy has preserved them in this movie and has protected the human spiritual power, not on a 'greatest generation' path.
