I was fortunate enough to see this film of Seattle Film Festival screening, and it was blown away by how wonderful it was. It's one of the best music document I've ever seen without any doubt (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving aspect of music and true legendary life and time, music and relationships. Harry Nilsson Gershwin, Cole Porter, and other well-known songs of the 20th Century were present there with the likes of the authors. He was considered to be a Beatles' four-member colleague, all of whom call him the 5th Beetle and the same wavelength as himself. <br /> <br /> Refused to visit Harry, many people do not remember him today. , And who was born after his birthday, was not aware of who he was. It's tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to open up this wonderful talent. This picture is a step in the right direction, finally to give people its due. Unfortunately, the film still has a wide distribution, even a DVD, so look for it for the good luck. <br /> <br /> If you are someone with the power to combine the DVD distribution, contact the filmmakers. This film is needed to get. Hey VH-1, how does it screen in the air, then maybe it can enter the DVD? Harry Nilsson deserve nothing less.
