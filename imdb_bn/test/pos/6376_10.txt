Tin Devi is a great movie. It's a very entertaining entertainer and a very modern movie for the 1960s. Music and songs are horrific though there are some meaningless songs here. Dev Anand is an extraordinary star and naturally does great justice for his role. Imagine sexy and nand okay. Simi is okay. Virendra Gaur wrote most of the films of Mahendra, World, Warrant, Zali Note, Manzil etc. The image is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is about attracting three daughters of the goddess. - Normal imagery, Simi and Home Nand. Finally he likes Nanda. The story is okay but it has been described in a secret way and highlighted this film in dialogue and songs and great devotion. Of course, for all Dev Anand fans, the film must be seen.
