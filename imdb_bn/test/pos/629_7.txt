I enjoyed playing this movie. Without sister He reminds me of Johns on friends. I was fairly certain but did not believe it. <br /> <br /> My main problems with the movie were the wicked ending and death scenes with sisters and in-laws. The explosive car coming out of the man? Perhaps the swelling of the arm might have moved in silently for help, and he kissed him to the hospital, maybe I could have gone to the end. I think someone will die in execution. Mainly brother mother in law She was a pain such as the donkey though. Or maybe sister must kill a stranger, who saved silence. Even I could have killed heroes even in my brother, and eventually two sisters were kept in snack films. <br /> <br /> Repeated and as I always say, being a writer rather than a writer is much easier.
