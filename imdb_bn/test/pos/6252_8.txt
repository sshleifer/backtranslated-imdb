Do you hate slashhers that just do not seem to get them started? Sometimes it takes a full hour of red hair on their hair before some real action takes place. "Tourist Trap" is not such! It usually wants you to get cool ... if you want to get it! It's abundant and continuously ending from the beginning! This movie is probably the biggest opening sequence in the horror movie of 80, when a teenager wanders around the engine, gets trapped in a solitary room, and attacks with a vague collection of wax statues. The other four lambs to the murderers reach home and from Leatherface ("Texas Chess Genocide") and in the old wax-museum movies, which are some of the crazy idiots in the mix of crazy sculptures. "Tourist Trap" Excitingly awful entertainment, some genuine suspense, scary images, extreme curiosity, Morbid humor and awesome make-up effects. The plot twists are always original and played quite lousy but, seriously, who care? This "Tourist Trap" has earned a place among my 5 favorite slashers due to Fast Pacing and Govie Killer-Icon. An amazing surprise, though the total lack of nudity. Very bad, because all girls look awesome and after just 10 minutes, the compulsory line "Who needs bathing?" It is said.
