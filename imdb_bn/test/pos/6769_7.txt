Send them to the freezer. After discovering the popularity of selling human bodies, it finds two slaughterhouses. This is an incredible story with humor and possible metaphors that makes it much more than a horror movie. Complex characters deny the dual classification and makes the story playful and fit - if you can decide it. Of course a dark film but a bit redemptive.
