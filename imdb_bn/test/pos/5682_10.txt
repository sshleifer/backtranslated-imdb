I've read many vague comments about this movie, and all I've seen is common: "boring" and "unreal". <br /> <br /> First, they used the actual freqin cracks! Can you get more realistic? No CGI, no animatronics, no miniatures. Just a croc and a piece of meat. Have fun, guys! <br /> <br /> There is no question that this image is starting slowly. Character development, whatever they were, however, takes a little time, and I think it's essentially where this movie lacks. However, when the film goes on, I lifted the step dramatically. I do not want to say there are many actions. If there is anything, cracks can not be seen anymore, and people are just waiting. However, we know that there will be no relief, and the anger can save only her time. It was similar to other bitter feelings in other movies that earned them horror through non-action as on-water (such as another movie criticized by other viewers as "boring"). Personally, I think the viewers have not been able to find themselves in the absence of doubt, their attention has been removed from the surgery, but this is mine. Finally, the characters seem realistic and the situation is such that it can happen to anyone in a really correct situation. In addition, death is completely real, and sometimes, it is a little difficult to see. <br /> <br /> Everyone, this one winner.
