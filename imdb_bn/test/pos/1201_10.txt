I'm not a big musical fan, but I really love this one this one. Unlike many other songs as "sound off music", which of the songs is not a void. Every song acumen on social commentary, war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality, and freedom. Especially the amazing songs are "hard to be difficult", "Ackerses Age," "Hair," "Flush Failure / 3-5-0-0," "Walking in Space", and "Hare Krishna". Completely revolutionary and wonderful. I can not wait a day!
