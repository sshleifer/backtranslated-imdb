I think of seeing this on TV TV in the early 90s. The international opportunity of production is exciting and seeing how the letters develop for it within five hours is great. The scenes shown in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest and as a spectator you will see the role of culture and building of this country at the end of this war. Fazal and Helen's characters have been well-developed throughout the series, and The Soprans in this region and the rival of modern shows under six feet below. In the UK, VHS is about £ 6 and the DVD is about £ 10 - a quality contract. I thought the Soderbergh version was very great - but clearly this best composition carries a huge debt.
