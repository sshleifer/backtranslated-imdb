This picture brought me to tears. I want to say if I do not have a beautiful husband in my house, then I will ask this lovely piece to marry me. Aaron Carter gives an eloquent performance as a confused young pop star, Timothy Burton wrote quick and malicious dialogue that only Carter's performance talent is more. Kyle was gay, but her performance was nothing less than spectacular. She is very nice and cute. I'm thinking about giving him a date and giving him a very sweet good night's gift. <br /> <br /> If you would like to discuss this picture in the future, please contact me. <br /> <br /> Voices Class in 2012, Nick Burrell, Malibu, California, Malibah West 310 924 0126
