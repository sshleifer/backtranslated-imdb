I saw it on HBO because it won Oscar a week ago. It compares favorably with plays in the fantasy courtroom. <br /> <br /> This story was established for the trial of 15-year-old black kids in Jacksonville, FL, on the basis of almost complete identification of an elderly white woman. Confessions of the victim's husband and defense suppressor were convincing. <br /> <br /> About half the footage is in trial; This is the footage of defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing the witnesses and visiting the location. It is edited with the minimum essential repetition, and logically placed the order. The camera work is quite difficult. And there is a gentle surprising epilogue.
