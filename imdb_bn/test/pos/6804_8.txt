I was from kindergarten at high school in a 13-year-old school, only one day my class went to class. I went to school, you went to school from 8:30 to 3:30 and the booked trips were not taken. But, for a while I could not remember at this age, we went to see a movie - National Velvet. I do not think of the movie, so, on the eve of my 57th year, I decided to reconsider it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that no longer exists. A time when people believe in others and do not lock their houses. A time when people are given the benefit of doubt. It was a time when family was the most important thing. This film shows all that. It shows love and faith and care and well-being to humans. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> It was Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney's best performance before her best, Madonna, Ronaldo, Angel Lansbury, Marad, She Writing, and Donald Crisp, who had played for nearly 60 years. <BR> <br /> No movie!
