Mani Sir naturally raises another wonderful story with Kannathil Muthamital. Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought to a beautiful fashion. Money Sir naturally does not naturally shoot very outside without much special effects. (Actually the only movie where he went out of India ...) was not too much monk. Moni Class has been written in all the movies ... it is to add ARR music ... which is just amazing ... Bhalai Piyekal is one of my most favored songs ... Madi, she is the film industry that she has influenced so much. From Alaipayut, Kannathil to Authu Ijuthu till the Guru .. Mani Ratnam has shown the world what a versatile actor Maddy. Simran has been very good. He has shown that he can work in non-glamorous and role of character. All an amazing movie. Sorry the Tamil people did not appreciate this GR8 movie and it was a box office attack ....
