Like social satire, the idiosity is just as well as the office space, but with a wide range of opportunities. I think that due to Patmi humor it is very hungry to criticize the film. There are certainly fart jokes, but they do not want to be funny to the audience - they exist to define the "culture" state in 2500, which was visited by Joe, as the background of the wicked state which he awakens. The real humor of the film is among the many visions and attitudes present in this future society, which is only shadowed by what we see in our daily lives, and which should serve as a warning. Illustration of my personal favorite Fox News. The fine fineness of the film actually excites the average "Josef" like people and degrees. Remember that when Joe and Rita are almost unconscious in the film, they meet with fools around them, and you realize that Idris is not created specifically to choose a group, but generally it is on the culture of the idol. I do not know what to say about Fox's "conspiracy theory" behavior in publishing this film, but claim it if it is not playing in your local theater. We all have to see this film, if not for social commentary, at least crazy jokes ...
