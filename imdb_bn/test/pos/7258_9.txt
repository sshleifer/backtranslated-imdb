I do not want to write too much about the film, but it is basically an action / comedy that is thrown out of romantic little people, who combine with unforeseen situations and together become highway men. Excellent performance involving Robert Carlysle and everyone else. A brilliant 'Baddy' who really makes him hate. Some great ridiculous lines - actually loud smiles, amazing actions and a great plot. All the gorgeous choices of music and ambiance, originally brilliantly guided and written in brilliants. I recommend this movie that if a good British film or career likes something good, I do not know why this movie has never been stopped, I think it is not as much recognizable as it recognizes it. If not anything else, watch this movie for the greatest end of all time. Do not give anything away, but this one really gets pushed to the heart!
