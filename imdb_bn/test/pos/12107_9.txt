Istanbul - and its musicians - this movie offers you an interesting trip through today's most exotic cities. Do not expect Turkish folklore or some set like that. Alexander Hack, a German musician and member of the culture band "Insturjente Newbuten", traveled to Istanbul to know the music scene. He is a guide line through his film over the voice of his feelings. But mainly German-Turkish director Fit Akin gives the opportunity to speak to various artists of Istanbul - and of course their music. <br /> <br /> You meet different personality, big stars and street musicians, young people and old people, people play different musical styles. But this movie does not introduce you to the words of Istanbul. It has painted an impressive picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has made fraud in the last decade. The film depicts its playwright with fine humor, but never reverets it. All of them share a passion for music and belief in its power. <br /> <br /> When Akin goes back to different musical scenes, he shows his talent for diversity in diversity. His award winning movie "Jigen die wand" (Head On) fatha Akin "Bridge Crossing" proves that he is equally able to touch, entertain and guide a documentary. If you have never been to Istanbul, then you want to go there after watching the movie.
