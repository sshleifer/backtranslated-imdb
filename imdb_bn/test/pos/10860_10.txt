I have nothing but praise for this mini series. It's only one and a half years old but I've seen it twice; The second time with the greatest pleasure first. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's almost in a small series in its own league. <br /> <br /> Another commenter commented on the problem of living as a lesbian in Britain in the 1890s. Especially that there is nothing difficult about; It was only male homosexuality as civilian Oscar Wilde experienced its great cost and a great loss for the literary world. However, I digress. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is essential television. This is probably one of the greatest tragic romantic plays from Romeo and Juliet, though not in the usual sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
