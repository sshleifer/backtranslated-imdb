Francois has a dull moment in Ozone's "Robe d'Ete". It's amazing how it is packed in this short film. When reclining on a secluded beach after a nude swimming, a young lesbian is contacted by a girl who would like a light for her cigarette. She invited him to love in a wooden area near the beach. Coming back to the beach That they have stolen all his clothes. He lend him a summer dress to cover his nudity and pleaded that he would return it the next day. He rides his bike back in the holiday cabin dressed as a girl. Her gay companion is excited sexually. The next morning, the young man returns to the sea and returns to the end of the girl's holidays. He advised to hold the dress as a reminder of their summer romance. This is a light hearty movie that contains the spirit of the summer holidays of the sea, but it is probably for people who are not nudged by nudity or homosexual issues.
