Shortly before, I bought a random DVD of small pictures when I saw the first one. This DVD is only short, but I do not like it. I like it ... if you spend time with me then you will see it. It's beautiful, easy and enthusiastic, no bells, no stairs - it's a sharp (but do not make me wrong, animation is elegant and insightful) - this person has definitely spent a lot of time with cats - but it's just black and white) and then writing And there's music ... it's just pretty. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink alcohol and watch over again ... <br /> <br /> Nothing else, I'm waiting for Pedro Serajina to bring something else.
