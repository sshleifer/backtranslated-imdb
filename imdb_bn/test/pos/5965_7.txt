Many animation buffs have forgotten that Wallacel Starvich has forgotten a special branch of art, puppet animation, which he had almost invented alone. . . And, it happened, almost accidentally. Young people were more interested in antomolegia than Streivich's film, but due to the failure of the two cat's Beatles film futures, there was unexpected success in filmmaking, when he realized that he could imitate movement by manipulating beetle glasses and photographing it in a frame. A time This discovery was raised in the production of the classic classic short film The Cameraman Revenz, which was made in Russia in 1921, when the motion picture animation was the childhood of all types <br /> <br /> <br /> < > Stereovic was transferred to Paris against the Russian Revolution, where one of its first production - incidentally? - A dark political satire that is known as "frugland" or "the king of kings wang wang wang". Strives of black comedy are found in almost all Streivics films, but here it is really dark, which is more focused on encouraging children, who can appreciate the extravagant aspects of children, who might find Claymes boring. (I was middle-class and it was quite uncomfortable, myself.) And in fact, print titles of films made for the English speakers of the 1920's were given heading cards filled with legs and quips to help sharpen the sting. The last word <br /> <br /> Our story is located at the bottom of the Commonwealth of Frigland, where citizens disagree with their government and what a special session they can do to improve the issues. They decide to pray on Thursday for a King. The crowds are animated vigorously in this opening sequence - many violet dolls were not so easy to see living together, then on Wednesday, in its part, the white-colored white man looks like he'd rather take a persecution. When Thursday they sent a god like a tree, who deeply respected them, the frogs decided that it was not a development and demanded a different king. Germs send them annoying. <br /> <br /> This new king of this horrible face, who is delighted with the tower on them, frogs officially welcomed them with a representative delegation. When will the Mayor move forward to record a newspaper camera near the Kailawala? For everyone's horror, Stark immediately ate the mayor and then carried out a delightful assault, consolidating the citizens' random condition. A title card reads dryly: "The King's hunger strike spread throughout the state." When now-terrible frogs once deviate Thursday for help, he loses his temper and gives rain to the community by the power of explosions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was frustrated by the Russian intimation at the height of the civil war in the country, it would be easy to see as an example of events. While making "Fragland", the Russian cyclone may or may not have been considered by the Sturwyz, but its choice of film poses as a warning to the public, regardless of its application. The "frugland" can be in the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s, or any country of any age, and guarded by oppression. This is an impressive film, even a fun way even a charming, but no joke in its message.
