At first I would say that this movie is less provocative than the Vinchi Code. Sure, you have science versus science problem but it does not make a big statement about it. Its essentially a scenic thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. Particularly one scene (that involved the fire) I found extremely good work. <br /> <br /> Second, change from film to film. While I was following the development of the film, I changed some letters and complained about the complete removal of others, I admitted that I was wrong. It is refreshing that the book was followed in the same way as was done in Dan Vindy. If you book a purist if some of them may be upsetting you though. But do not worry so there's still Big Twist. Finally I'm happy that they have removed some silly sub-plots and even tried to indicate the possibility of having Langdon and Basauria together. <br /> <br /> Performance is really good, but there is nothing common. It's okay for a film like this. <br /> <br /> I want to give it a 9/10, mainly because it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment
