I love this kind of movie. Blood, revenge, many things, very dark, chessy and more. But this one is not giving style that you can expect. When I saw Kite birds and Aichi killer, I made fun of them but why not? Dead or living: Final is a decent anime and it is not hardcore and does not expect nudity in this movie. Add more steps to entertain the viewers at least. Even the drama that was not good. Well, I do not want to ruin movies or plots. But I think dead or alive: the final few silent. So, what to do without. I do not recommend this movie for everyone but I recommend for those people who love good and well-directed anime. <br /> <br /> Jacques Collardou, Paris Dowin University and Paris University 1 Pantion Sovereign
