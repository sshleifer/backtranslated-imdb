If you go to Twin Effect you will be disappointed with the experience of the pure Hong Kong film. It does not look bad, but it is not a traditional Hong Kong action film, it is running similarly on Shawlin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's stupid and stupid, so if you want a good bit of organizational Hong Kong action, see John Won or Yuan and Ping. The film has got a lot of gaps for the fascination and I think the first thing you need to do is explain what you are going to do, because it disappoints many nutritionists. <br /> <br /> Although non-purists and those with a more forgiving taste, Twin effect is a delightful silly Kung Fu trick. I've liked it a lot for several reasons, or at least it's wonderful women leaders spark off sparkle in each other's fantastic entertainment comedy double act. I believe that this was the first movie they had, but they would smile, kicks and fly like warm professors. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous plot is managed by care and attention. , And the movie is quite well known, lots of movies smile out loud. The comedy really is the most important thing here, and it's a delicate, gentle comedy, as a la Stefan Chao flying on the word as invisible objects. Well, slopstick is very funny. A total classic with ordering disco-dancing vampires. <br /> <br /> This action is really a combination of two series. It comes in the style of the 'dark drama' cable and the fight of the war (which comes in the end too) and the style of Jackie Chan's comedy war, which comes out with a mix, though sometimes it is always exciting to see some derivative and occasionally some real innovative confrontation conflicts. <br /> <br /> This is all awesome, and the movie is the funest fun. Despite this, it has a few sticking points. For example, the Twin Effect has been heavily windyized, which is used much more in the west than the Kung Fu fan, resulting in the inevitable comparison of the blade series as an example, although the Twin Effect is sometimes much better than the resultant blade. Fight action Personally, it was a bit of a shame to be surprised by Anthony Wang (John Woo's classic hard high), but this target of the young audience can not be noticed or actually hard bubble or <br /> <br /> If you look at it with an open mind, But you'll probably enjoy a lot like it, but you must be sure that it's not a comedy, wall Kung-Fu movie wall. Remember and you will be fine.
