I do not believe an actor can be an excellent actor. It's the reality and delicate acting which makes it look real. It has been the best comedy ever made and I love Seinfeld and everyone loves Ramand. It's just fabulous and it seems like everyone in my family agreed. I have no different opinion thats The whole world seems to talk about various events and they try to reconcile them. Crew off my hat There is an actor who makes some shows full show. This plot kills one of them in comedy (8). What makes it so amazing. Some people pray for health, wealth or fame. I pray that the prayer does not end. Sicerely John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
