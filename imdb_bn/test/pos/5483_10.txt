"The Line of Fire" is one of the best thrillers I've seen, it creates and creates a large climax. This picture is really shoot you in your heart and you are breathing from the action. Cast strongly responds, especially Clint Eastwood and John Malkovic. This image is managed by the expertise mystery master Wolfgang Petersen. The thrillers are not so good at it, do not miss it.
