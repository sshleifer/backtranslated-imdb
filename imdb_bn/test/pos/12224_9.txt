I am constantly surprised at the US network. What is the matter with them? Yet, after only 15 episodes, another very optimistic series was removed and we all have no idea what is going to happen. I really enjoyed this show completely and it is so annoying that we never find the characters and the 'monsters' from the deep to happen. This show was everything. Ridiculous, mystery, action What could you do more? Oh why not pull this plug? It just does not make sense. Buffy went for 7 series, as they were charmed and enjoyable as well as Surface, and the dead like me were better. Because a show does not get too much ratings, it means it is not garbage and if they give it a bit more then perhaps more people can catch it and they will end up with a big hit in their hands. It does not take much time to catch it in one season and is interested in dragging the network plug They should be taught that they take time to mature like fine wine and cheeses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
