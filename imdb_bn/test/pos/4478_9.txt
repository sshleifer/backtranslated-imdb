Most of my opinions do not flow with most of the cases. I tend to paint artsy, fantastic, and different directions. This film was a reminiscent of Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion", in which a fictional situation has been created that is designed to show the beauty of a magnificent creature, which is not readily available for this peak. Unlike the genres of that nature, this offer uses the best movie making techniques, which makes art the most sensual super star (cat) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy illustrates the development of a love relationship between a French soldier (she is very nice) in the Egyptian desert and she faces a female leopard while facing a abandoned Egyptian temple. I sincerely bought it in. If you are open for at least fantasy and appreciate the sense of girl, beauty, energy and cats, you have to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The only error in my book was the end. It was a perfect setup for Romeo and Juliet Finals - which would take me to the top. <br /> <br />
