I can not even begin to imagine why I hate this picture so much. It smiles me a lot and laughs ("I believe you sleep well?" "Actually, we had several nights." "Ah, the danger of adultery.") <br /> <br /> <br /> Confessions, The finishing little plane, but still has its moments (Booger flew into the ocean as the clear mesh spalsh of the ball, "beach house paradiso"). <br /> <br /> Personally, I think this is the most fun movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
