If we can have a "separate table", why is it "separate liar"? <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a bit involved. Housewife's husband died while driving while riding a bike. For the criminal woman she turns out to be cleans. The latter had a relationship with a friend and when the accident occurred it was driving the car with lover. To make things even more complicated, the domestic worker once used to work for the man's parents and was imprisoned for stealing him. Therefore, people would hesitate to believe that this was their car which was the accident. It seems he wants revenge. <br /> <br /> All of these are gradually turned. When the owner of our home was driving the car, he discovered that the officer working in his office, he remembers his testimony for despair. <br /> <br /> If it is not enough, after a few months, our lover (Rupert Everett) finally gets sick and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> Despite the never ending here, the acting is quite good. Like "PETA Place" theme Tom Wilkinson is a solicitor who tries to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The picture is good, but we could do it in addition to terminal illness. Hey good, the wedding ended anyway.
