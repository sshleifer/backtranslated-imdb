Yes, it looks very interesting ... Half of the people involved are now dead ... <br /> <br /> However, for a long time I've seen something related to Muppets, but it's stuff pure gold. I'm a great fan of puns, and this movie has put them quite well, but it's a pacing in a wonderful direction: it's really high-speed children's pacing where filmmakers slam the character of the decision to move stories aside, wherever they want to go Similar movements with letters <br /> <br /> The Frog Chemite is an unusual character. His voice and mouth are fantastic in his expression. But above all, he mentioned why he became popular - "He can sing and joke!" - But why is he so much respected - he inspires everyone to search for dreams without any effort. Meanwhile, he has to deal with himself, which is a wonderful theme for family films. <br /> <br /> It has mostly groups of comedians to play here and there, some great effects, a little less to others (I think Mail Brook's part was a little over, right?). Some parts of the movie are weird. But it is very fantastic and takes itself very different from the same destination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
