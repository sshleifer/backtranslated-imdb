Some companies will make this photo a good (good +) DVD! ??? In addition to the wonderful movie about relationships and friendship, "The Four Friends" is the only movie I have ever seen - and I, literally, see the * Year * of my life! - which takes the essence of 60's experience (and I was there!): Idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayal and ultimately his offensive but rebellious condemnation. And this is done without a story about the rise of all the ages, although many have touched as part of the tapestry. But the story mainly consists of letters and their friendships for about 10 ~ 15 years ... and despite those decades of tragedy of those fears and depths. Of course there must be a joy and of course ... even if no old hippie !!!
