The first feature length is Muppate Movie, and possibly Mppet, except for Christmas Carroll, the filmmakers of the film are still looking for guides. Disney has provided unequal service to Muppets and this film again proves over. A classic but original plot, featuring classic comedian and guest star Kayomes, classic Muppets Lemm Jokes, Paul Williams Genius of the song, and the filmmaker Madame Madagy, and comes with an extraordinary movie, especially when you realize that the main castle dolls Hensen's talents just came with Kraft dolls around. The funny half is playing today that the actress / actress is still alive ???? I can only expect Frank Oz and Dave Goelje, and the rest of the living muppatias, in any way Disney can rescue and revive Kimit and Company from a deadly perception.
