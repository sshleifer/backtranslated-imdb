Most Christmas movies have a "release" theme, but most of the similarity is the diversity of the plot. This movie is spoiled and has an unusual plot. You might have to hang out there for the first episode that might seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as real life as it is - Delbert's creator Scott Adams says he never made anything in his cartoons - they all told him his real life story Based on). The second half begins to fit the plot together. I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> BTW, a reviewer thinks that the idea of ​​not receiving cash is not credible on ATM's day, but if you lose your wallet - it carries ATM cards at any other time, but it is a completely trustworthy business. Work on
