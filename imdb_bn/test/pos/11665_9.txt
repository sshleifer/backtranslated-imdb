"Dead Man Walking" is a part of making incredible films. All performances are authentic and realistic, and both scripts examine the issue of death penalty and both pay homage. Above all, it is a deeply moving story, death with pride and degradation of arrogance. Any film that is brave and matrimonial with this incredibly difficult subject to be rated 10/10 Thanks, Team Robins!
