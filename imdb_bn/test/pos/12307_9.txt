The NFTA saw this movie in London where it was shown as part of the BFI's John Houston Season. I was not really sure what I could expect, and the first few minutes of the movie were very far away. The rest of the picture is a little bit away! No real plot, no action, no mystery, very few plays and very few parts, except for a small part, no scenes. <br /> <br /> Due to the lack of these features, a wonderful film. I do not fully understand why, but I think that its lesser image is almost completely perfected. Acting, scripts and most importantly, casting was everywhere and I do not think I'm moving away from the feeling of cinema, but I still can not work. I know I'll be getting DVDs (this is one of the movies, I'm sure, just as good as a movie experience on a small screen, but you can stay calm to see it!) And I'll see it again soon. I have to be interested in what my family and friends think about it. I'm sure it will not be everyone's choice, but I'm convinced that my number will agree with a large number of my opinions. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
