Joe (Wes) and Jim (Adam) are reunited with us in beauty, isolation (psychological and physical) and "the most murder" in Newhaw Southwest. Characterizations, Creating Constants and Creatives Constantly ... Sometimes the personal Asides leave our "more" missing. With some interesting alternative choices "who did it?" Flashbacks (eg Peter Fonda .. are good to see him) provide the formula but they do not go where you can think. Comic acids (eg preachers) are light and fit. Where "skinwalkers" and "quiet wetts" drag. "The thief" touches the next angle and is involved with four wheels, never sure what to do. James Cheyi, "slow down" for Pathoulos, disagreed with Joe Lepheran's human comments. Wrong ... There's no bucket in the plot, just follow track. Next episode! Great Photography (as always), interesting characters and more exploration!
