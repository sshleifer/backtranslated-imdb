If I see it hard enough, errors can be found in this movie with the script. I'm completely convinced of the Wolf character. However, those who only "complain" me. Since this movie only started only, then I was only recording it and going to see it later. However, since the beginning, music music and Cameron Diaz went out of the 60-second dance, I became a fake. I never got up until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scenes are beautiful There were, girls were beautiful, and music was hunting and very touching. The story was quite unique and at the time there was an surreal quality. In the 60's and 70's, the condition of the youth in mind, especially in the United States, is well liked by the audience. Most of the scenes have largely succeeded in showing something of the era which is difficult to pin It was more complicated than the simple statement that they wanted to change the world and ended the confusion, although it could be the most obvious aspect. Like the progress of the movie, Phoeb can learn more on this topic. <br /> <br /> An example that can not be mentioned by another critics is that the two girls may go through life. After their father died. Both of them enjoyed him, and his presence was a stable cause in their life and probably he loved them. We soon read so much about their parents who lose their father very soon, lose their way. This photo has lost father's father, then big sister Fayeth, after which her younger sister has a harmful effect on her father. Their mother seems insufficient to try to be both parents. Dynamic is not covered in any other such film, especially in different levels of plot and theorem. Foeb's reality vs. the opposite struggles of reality are gradually torn like an onion layer. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the plot, this movie should be more than that. I look forward to some great conspiracy about the death of faith. How can it surprise itself, even if others can guess soon enough. <br /> <br /> Not everyone, but I can see this movie many times.
