Not just for his time, but one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. Today's consistent statistics made without a very thin budget CGI. Stanley Kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he usually has. Stanley Kubrick is no doubt the greatest director in history so far. <br /> <br /> This image was spent five hours to two hours and twenty minutes, and the industry side was great. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kubrick and the great Aurthur C. Clark collaborate to write less classic at this time. <br /> <br /> People have a special message on the earth at the beginning of the human race and one of the moons that is found in modern humans. <br /> Finally, the well-known computer with the guy set up Jupiter with the biggest computer and found the next glorious message that becomes a gateway. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to read a film and / or wants to be part of the film industry or enjoy great movies to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not like it, then you are involved in Bollywood or your asylum album.
