I have a strong feeling that what you think about this movie will definitely depend on your reference frame. If you have never seen a Miyazaki movie before, perhaps it will confuse the hack from you. If you have seen a Miyazaki movie before, it will probably distract you from hacks .... but you do not really care! Because I saw that for the first time I watched her animated movie, I tried to understand what was going on and very hard - and it influenced the joy of my film. Now I've seen almost every Miazaki film, I saw the oddity and brought it all - I enjoy its beauty. In many ways, these movies (at least to the Western viewers) are like narcotics - a lot of strange and beautiful images that do not always start primarily, but it definitely looks good !! Among all Miyazaki films, this may be the most unusual and unknown story line - even more than the debut and Princess Monoco or my closest friend. But, like this and other studio Goby films, if you just sit and see that you are rewarded with a fabulous story. But, because it is very difficult to describe (and others have already done so), I will not go there too. <br /> <br /> For artwork, it is one of the Japanese movies. There was a significant change. There was a lot of use of what was like the colorful pencils for the background. This was not a bad thing at all - the lovely pastel-like look was very delightful and unique. In some ways, it turns a small bit of Bill Plainton's art style into a common Miyazaki film. A high frame-rate, exceptional character animation (which draws them with personality traces) and a great "wave-factor", it's an exceptional film for all ages. Although clearly designed for young viewers (especially TOTORO fans), it is a bit scary here and there (during the explosion parts), there are plenty of things for adults. As an adult (at least in the course of time), I like the cool things and appreciate the film's other faithfulness. <br /> <br /> Miazaki's Seatam Best Movie I can not give it a 10 because I'm afraid to do that work - plus I like some other pictures of the studio a little more (especially TOTORO). But this does not mean that you do not rush now and you will not see it - do it and do yourself good.
