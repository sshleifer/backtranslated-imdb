Well, the people of Aparnozi and his love, people here believe that there is a lot more ideas to be released and the film is a great way to do this. Well all the great actors have nothing to say about acting or instruction together but the film gave us a great message. It has a pretty predictable prediction of the person's mindset with the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own views and we want to solve all the problems accordingly. That is why all the slave servants from the professor tried their own way. So when Jodepe was discussing his wife, she said, she is looking for something she will never find, and the wife will answer, 'are not we all?' So this is a great comment that the film then gave me a big question, 'Are we all sick?'
