OK. In most cases, good, entertaining and accurate era-feeling. Variations of personality sufficient to cover the real people around those days without exception to the distractions of the story. The credits show pirate from Mar Vista, California. From the mountains of Venice and south of Malibu. I was at Heart Break Hotel, Pre-BeachVice, Vashtew Avenue, where the surfer child was beside Bob Cooper, where the gullies were used to burn surfboards that did not work. Used in old skky skeletivel plywood cutouts to pour thin waves waves. Fifty years of cooling innocence, the warmth of the climate of the Sun's climate and the warming of the power of the cultural warmth, and then the strange innovation, and the extraordinary seventeen years of innovation evolve into evolutionary madness. The film gives you a piece of magic moment of that time. In a place where imaginary waves were real .. culturally significant impact sources. And BTW, there is another film that has the same American street radioactivity and it is the same true uniqueness that is unique with the real reality that helps to refine the supernatural eternal feelings of peace. "Two Lane Blackpot" (One of the best examples is freesouldoit attitude in West Coast California history .. Dennis Wilson). Thanks one after the other with Monte Helman, SP, to stay there with this one. GWR
