One comment said it is not a comedy ... wrong! It was a playful comedy in history that does not lend this genre easily. Very busy ... and active film from start to finish. Often the train, or the shot out of the car window, was just beautiful. An enjoyable way to spend a few hours in a theater. All French historical figures such as Charles de Gaulle and Petine, and some people involved in the French resistance were included in the script, which could send to strangers who could send France with the fall of France under German attack. Characters were engaging and acting in their acting was nice. Recommendation, 10 out 9
