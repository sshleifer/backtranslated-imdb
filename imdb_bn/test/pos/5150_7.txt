I enjoy national anthem. I enjoy the national anthem, if nothing else happens, just before midnight news, I imagine I'm playing symphonies in the band. Not as easy as you can think! One or two three four; One or two three four; But then what? So I have sympathized with Ray Anderson Anderson's Buzz drum player, who works in patience, waiting patiently waiting for his couture 70's cassette player. <br /> <br /> The 70-second motif seems to be rolling around, some classic, suite furniture. Moreover, each scene has an inferior wizard, which emphasizes the subtlest minutes of acting. <br /> <br /> that brought me the extraordinary purple boots of Jessica Lundberg. Boots that would otherwise inspire a silk cotton advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> But then the hard bit. Someone asked me what it was. Well there is a scene where "I do not have that length of green" opening line as the brilliant. Straight from a Gary Larson carton. <br /> <br /> I can not say it. See yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Swedish sounds <br /> <br /> (see April 15, 2013)
