This is used to be pornographic, it is a true classic. I mean, this is an X-rated musical based on a real book! Is this a real plot and how many x-rated films can boast these days? It's behind Debbie Desses Dallas, Deep Throat and Green Door, in the exclusive short list of true pornographic movie classics. I think the problem with "pornography" is not about "pornography" and "movies" nowadays. Alice in Wonderland has sex graphic imagery, but it's actually a story telling at the same time. "Oh, Mr. Police Man, do not write me a ticket" is not one of the plots, it takes another step, and it creates a musical instrument! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of "good" porn, it's the best one.
