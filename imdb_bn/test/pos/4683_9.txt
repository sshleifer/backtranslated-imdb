I've enjoyed the movie too. Italian work is everything easy. A man with a explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel man and a gun using a gun 35 million stolen a spectacular plan. Although it has no central idea, this picture is entertaining. It is a non-stop film with many works. All stunt work superb. Because of the three mini coopers involved in the busy streets of Los Angeles and even a helicopter initially from Venice's Speedboat Chase. The best pride I've ever seen is Chase. I like mini coopers Expert Thief Gateway used Mini Cooper for cars Mini Coopers and motor bike are amazing behind. They are pursuing underground. I can not say there was not a moment I was annoyed. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Crocher), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridges), Donald Sutherland (John Bridgewater), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Moses Def (left ears) and Edwin Norton (Steve) . I liked this photo actor. I've seen a lot of movie, but the Italian job is my favorite. A great Hollywood worker movie without a drop. After all, I love this kind of movie.
