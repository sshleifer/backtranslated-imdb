Paul Magarsky's Tempest - Interesting, Curious and Strange Movies about the Middle Ages. Decided to drop out as a world-renowned architect in the remote Greek island with NYC and John Cosvettes. With her daughter (Molly Ringwald) and a lounge singer (Susan Sarandan) The beautiful transition of this 25-year-old movie to DVD- but without any addition the theater trailer The beautiful scenery and razor-sharp dialogue make this two and half hour trip to the movie attractive. Raul Julia and Guyana Rowlands have a strong cast out A good drama comedy and tension and mix nearby madness. Price of this recent DVD release is worth the price. B ++
