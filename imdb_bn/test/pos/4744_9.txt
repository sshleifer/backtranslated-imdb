Seven compromises have been compared to Bullet for the Chelsea scene, but bullet matching does not come near anywhere. There's a start that builds Bullitt's builds. When McQueen goes to the perfect hotel, he goes into the castle, which is parked below Embarcadero Freeway (now broken) and the charger notices around, you know that you are going to see some spectaculars. From that moment on, when McQueen starts that car, sometimes the best car starts charging chase sequence. It's an awesome Lalo Schriffin to add if I properly remember the sound track. It actually goes for a long time before you actually hear the tire squealing first. McQueen's Mustang shock suddenly appears in the mirror behind Beck Hickman's scene and is uncompromising for the visible impact. Hikmun's surprise and double appearance really adds to the effect. Then of course, San Francisco Racing is unmatched for setting up cars around hills and bends. Also, Bullet is being painted in the 60's, when the "Hot" (Mustang GT and DZ Charger) was made for a good set in the car in the early 1970s, then two annoying, smoke-mounted Pontiacs devices were created. Bill Hickman was a bad guy driver in both movies. I saw the Universal Lot once again doing movie reviews for a paper when I saw him sitting in an internal movie preview. Although they tried to save themselves in the Chase scene, they tried well. There were a few "jumps" on the seven mountains upstairs, (Yawn) but of course they were not in San Francisco Hills. The seven compromise chases, where they are going fast, longer according to the faster order of the bullet. But the view of a shotgun explosion is exacerbated close to Rhy Schieders Pontiac's Hood, height of ignorance. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except it was portrayed in New York.
