"All my 5 dollars and my wedding ring ..." was the scene of riots. I also forgot the scene of the bar where Hende had torn the fist and took the bird to the Japanese and said "Pearl Harbor Friend". I think my IQ is more than 115, but I'm not sure because I can not count that height. <br /> <br /> Interesting thing, these 10 lines are needed. It looks like they will bother you to make your comments too long, not too small. I hope I can not make 1000 words before line 10 <br /> <br /> I still have two lines short. When I think and drink, drink and think, forgive me. It depends on whether my hand is quick to my mind. Well, I think I've made it 10 line limits. Thanks for reading!
