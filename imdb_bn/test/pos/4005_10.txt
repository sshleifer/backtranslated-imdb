First of all I want to say that Lee Lee has done a very good job! I saw it yesterday and I was currently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people will say, "These people can not fly!" I can tell them it's a fiction and that's it. It will not be taken as a movie about reality, which you can say it is a "fairy". And Asian fairytale clock is a very nice one. The images can actually blow your mind. Because the artist has been filmed, Ang Lee has a huge talent (you can say it unclear). The war scene is very calm and nicely brought to the viewers. But it is tragic but it does not realize that this image should be achieved. But Ang Lee, fortunately, gets his attention with his blockbuster. So for those who are not interested in stories, the pictures are quite entertaining!
