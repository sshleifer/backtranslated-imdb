Fellow's drama about a couple's marriage, which is threatened by a third party, in the interest of the wife of the house (Watson). Wilkinson plays a very good role as a troubled husband who can not control the fraud of his wife and related to the problem. He liked Rupert Ivertt in his role in the William Bulle, Watson is related to him. Although I think Emily Watson was a great actress, she had a little problem in writing her character, she did not make her very favorite (I know a deceiver does not seem like a favorite, but she had some work and things she had no argument behind them). The playline was perhaps the weak part of this play, although the order of the fellows was good and performance was also good. This image is better than an unbeliever, but by no means is a great composition. --- IMDb Rating: 6.7, My Ratings: 8/10
