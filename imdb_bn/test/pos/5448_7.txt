Now, I'm a little favorable, because I'm a big fan of late night television. I have been a loyal fan of Jay Leni for about 6 or 7 years, and think he is one of the most fun, most talented comedians. And David Letterman is also a hell of a comedian, even though I only see his show (until the winner is repeat) or he has a better guest than he wins in advertising. Both Danielle Rokok and John Michael Higgins were fine actors and they were similar to J and Dave, but did they disappear? No The voiceless voice and expression of Raiqaka are rarely like nails, a higher pitch at Mumbai, a castrati sound like Marlon Brando. Higgins took the words of David's face down (for example, his trademark squirm) but he did not spoil Dave's voice. Those late night TV stars are not big fans, they may be much less favorable. There are some comedians who can copy the dead body of the deceased. Why can not they choose one of them for the part? And the same goes along with Dave. I'd rather play the soft McDonald part. Naturally, Dave does not look like much dirty, but he had a great camouflage in SNL. "Hey ... you have no gum?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, "The Tonight Show" was not seen before being hosted by Jay Leno, so I finally did not know about Johnny Carson's struggle to replace and numerous compromises, which eventually ensured the transfer of Dave to CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and made the movie very light. And Kathy Betts gives a knockout performance as a foul-mouthed ex-executive producer of "Tonight Show". He originally stole the film. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (in 10) <br /> <br />
