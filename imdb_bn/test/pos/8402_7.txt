I'm huge with the fan of the wind, and it's like a minir before I read "Scarlet" and I like it. This is such a series. You like that "Do not give me a great, dear Franklin," like it did not expect. Timothy Dalton was as good as Rite, although none would change Clarke Gayle. On the other hand, Joan Haley-Kilmer Vivienne Leake can run for his money (although I even feel apologetic about it). His attitude and appearance in the film fits the character, loves you and hates him, how he feels about Mrs. Lag's script at the same time. The film is moving slowly, because it follows the book so closely and a feature is not released as a movie. Part of the producer is an excellent choice. I think this film has some recognition for a great story, for about 50 years to revive the characters and something that Margaret Mitchell himself can be proud of.
