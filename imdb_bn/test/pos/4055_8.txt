It's not real chatter, but this movie is a great job to make a great cast of letters and works a great way to get you to know their hopes and wishes, although they still manage both fun and bitspot. A very sweet movie. Fun, Vincent D'Anniefio and Mary-Louise Parker will soon be seen in their careers.
