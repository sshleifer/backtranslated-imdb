I just saw the DVD and liked it. In particular, I thought the director and did a wonderful job with Jude and Nicole Inman and kiss in between, just before Inman. This is a romantic kiss that I have ever seen in a movie. I thought the tone was important for the rest of the movie; It makes it credible that Inman and Ginger do not roam each other for each other respectively. I thought the film managed to carry out this important plot point more important than this book. I'm sure many of you will get quick kiss other kiss, which is the best, but this is for me! Jude and Nichol showed incredible chemistry in their eyes with very few scenes.
