A new and exciting program that uses amazing visual graphics to display live dinosaurs walking with DinoSaurus. The information presented here is stunning. Moods in the series change to get your attention, when things break as dramatic music. There is clear evidence for a cracking documentary here! The author, director and producer did not forget my maximum, and other people involved. If you stop this video from the stores, I will not buy it for graphics, but the series will be offered for extreme efforts and productive work. 10/10
