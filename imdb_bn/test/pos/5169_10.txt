This movie is my family's favorite Christmas movie because it is actually a beautiful picture of everything from Christmas. These days I live in a big city that I hate, I love watching movies about the dreams I have seen. The movie that has been set up in this city is true, for my dream is the true and true feeling of life which has gone missing in today's society. I do not really feel the real spirit of Christmas but help to find out the feeling that this movie will see again. My family has taped this movie long before the TV and now our copy is filtered so I want to buy some copies in my family and the DVD for me, if someone can buy me a few copies, please only post the information here and I will be kept in check . Thank you.
