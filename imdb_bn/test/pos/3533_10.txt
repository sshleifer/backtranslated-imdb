Jeff Lieberman's "Just Litter Dawn" is one of the most horrific horror films ever made. Although the film is influenced by "Delivery" and "Texas Chain So Genocide", it is extremely vague and memorable. Come and the atmosphere is really stupid. Cast Nice, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose Leading Ladies Wonderful. Undivided couples are really horrific and ruthless killers. This image was shot nicely - it was actually located in the silver fruit state. Oregon Park Very small, but one killer, when Vernal is stabbed in green, quite nasty and unpleasant. Must be seen for a slashher fans 10. What is 10
