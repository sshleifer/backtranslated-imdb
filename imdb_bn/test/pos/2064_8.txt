In a small town school teacher (Gina Davis) gradually understands that he has hunger and used to be a truly secretive killer! Soon after, there are men after and after the little private detective (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> This is special effects and really funny one-liner (especially from Jackson)). Although there may be a little folly at the time of action, who carries? After all, is the movie not meant to be good time? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is funny as a ruthless villain. There was a good time around the movie itself. Just do not worry too much about it, because, if you take it very seriously, the film will not be fun but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth being called stupid or any other bad name.
