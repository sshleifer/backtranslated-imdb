Before I said earlier, some programs have 'light entertainment'. So I became somewhat frustrated when commentators are hoping for a program that will reveal the meaning of life, you will not get it from 2525 in Cleopatra and it is not proposed to be proposed. What you get is a girl who is frozen and after about 500 years her life returns and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. He does not live permanently within 10 minutes with courage to travel at other times and is not equivalent to James Bond, he is ready for all commerce. Cleopatra is reflected in its new surroundings and is scared by some of the exhibitions. Most of us will be However, it is a light entertainment, the stories have ended in a middle and quick period, and they have some surprisingly good moments of their acting. This episode is going on especially when Cleopatra is twofold and Jennifer Sky, I think one of the best actors to die for a long time, and as a movie and television buff, I know what I mean. Finally, to prove my sincerity, I bought four without the episode and I was fully satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I did not have a complete set was because I bought another episode before I realized it was a complete box set. Victoria Pratt and Zina Torres, for the three fully accomplished and light entertainment, Cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.
