While it may not be the best work of Cassavetes, Minnie and Mo≈°ovitt are almost perfect in all their efforts. The plot is scary and captivating, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotional - much drama than comedy, reverse the profile of IMDB. Yes, the story is scary, but not deliberate; It succeeded as credible, even though a tad forced - which I would have returned. All artistic aspects include true cachevate forms: cinematography and camera-work are lovely, and soundtracks - just there - complimentary. Plus I believe that I have noticed something about Goda and such as editing - as I have in a few other films of Causewate (such as a casual cut in a scene), which is interesting <br /> <br /> I think the plot is nicely made, the first half is particularly enjoyable. Semur's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothee Kerry) of Mymensingh, for example, sets the voice of astonishingly interesting and interesting, and a philosophical commentary made throughout the film. This philosopher - a tradition in the movies of Cassavetes - which made the film for me. His first impressions, like Hippie Simp's, funny and deep concentrations of Camur will immediately remove the first impressions - though his character is oddly identical to his In Faces (1968). It gives me the opinion (in the second view) that it stands against Cassavetes's best work. I have found affection for this photo which was lacking in my first sight. <br /> <br /> <br /> I find the plot unsupported. As I said earlier, it creates nicely, but it is typically separated here and a bit apart. Cassavetes which allows spontaneous style, and especially to improve its actor with independence, the distinctive style, its product quality can easily go any other way. In this case it is inappropriate. I've been highly impressed by this image, and it's the most beautiful assessment that. But one or two scenes unfortunately, just does not work. In particular, Simura's view of the collaboration with the work of mini-work outside of her home. While being exposed to the most intense scene of the film, Cassivis allowed his actors to be free through dialogue - thinks that some were planned earlier. This, I believe, was a mistake. Nobody knows what the Castle will do, because he gets the impression, because he repeatedly fumbles in his speech, often not knowledge, and overacts; This is harmful to all visible and character development. I understand that a fool of seminary wanted to be stupid, but the castle's efforts here have gone wrong. Why did he cut off his wipe? As a result of these flaws: the lack of part of the cassavetes; A lack of understanding and forethought on Cassel's part; Rehearsal and lack of preparation; Etc. Obviously, the Casavets could not learn from his mistake, because he did the same thing in his next picture, A Woman Under the Influence (1974) - the scene and event of the event. <br /> <br /> The errors I mention are not small, but they do not destroy the film. They only waste film flow and compromise its potential, some scenes are cringe-worthy and unrealistic. However, I have mentioned that despite the defect, I love very much Cassivates and all its actors, especially Castle. This is a very enjoyable movie, although it proves uncertainty in Cassavetes' style.
