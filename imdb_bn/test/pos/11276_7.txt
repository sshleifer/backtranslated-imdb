Not really sure what made this movie. Very curious, very artsy. You do not see any kind of movie because it has an attractive plot or character. More than the movie that you can not stop due to the awful things happening on the screen. Although, for the first time my wife saw this, she could not become very annoying for her! A bit long run, but nevertheless a suitable viewing for those who are interested in very dark movies.
