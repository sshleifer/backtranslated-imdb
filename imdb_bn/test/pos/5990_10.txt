Like the Pretty Umman, this movie came about at the same time. Although the common theme is similar: the rich person meets and learns to love a poor working class woman, Romuald and Juliette's characters are more beloved and worthy than them. I have never forgotten them and think of beautiful women in many ways than film. Juliet will help you with an extraordinary woman and her problem in clever ways will help her overcome her boss. The final scene contains some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy. The romied attempts to win the love of Juliet crossed the beautiful woman more than a hundred times. Watch this movie, it will warm your heart.
