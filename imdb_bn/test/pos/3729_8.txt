I thought that Beans' image was directed to work without how many films they were able to work with; The true human emotions capture. The main character's struggle, win, set back, hopes and desires are all honestly shown that if you are acting then you will be surprised. The film is in a low budget, and without the exception of glitzy and glamor, most of it is produced in addition to providing Hollywood productions, but it is a concise, which allows this movie to cross stereotypical cy-fay labeling and make a real drama. However, this film will only take away a drama from the amazing post-apocalyptic plot. Actually this type of movie has already been done, but I think the pleasure and sorrow of this kind of world is probably better than any other person.
