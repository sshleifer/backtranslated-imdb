... there was "Broadcast News," and it was a good thing. This stands just plain and after two years it sounds like her barbarian yawp. <br /> <br /> There are at the moment - especially with respect to cutesy scores - this film is very eighth, or a bit too "laziness in Seattle." Fortunately, they are less and far away. <br /> <br /> One-third of the social satirical, one-third romantic comedy, one-third drama, three defective but respectful people at its core, it's smart and moving and almost impossible to have fun. Especially Holly Hunter can not be more fun to see in a comedic role. (And yes, I'm with "Arizona Raise", her star from her star associated with this assessment). <br /> <br /> A valid classic
