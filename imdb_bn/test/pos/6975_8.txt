I have a letter from Mrs Knight who went to college to my elder sister. In this, he said about the trouble of making this movie. He himself was pregnant - an interesting combination of the film's plot - and the young director was uncertain, almost green, and there was a big problem with all decisions, supplies, etc. They were always running and it was a very hard shoot. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is effective and influenced by James Kane's strong debut. This is a great showcase for the genius that Miss Knight has done in her entire career - on television, in movies and on stage, where she won the "Kennedy Kids" for Tony. <br /> <br /> This image has a good old age.
