This film provides an example of a strictly adult type comedy horror movie, but Trauma is different with movies (with which it shares some attributes). Humor is rough and ready but fast and furious. If you are not worried about the disgusting dolls with evil power, then reach for six packs of beer and still enjoy the best "Chaki" movie.
