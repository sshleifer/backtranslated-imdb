If you are interested in learning more about this type of thing in modern civilization, then there is a great book called "Outlawus lead" or "The Outlaw Saga" and describes how it is happening in the story. High seaworthiness is a reality for many reasons. First, it is impossible to apply international law if many suspicious registrations of global freight (nationality) and ship owners do not have offices in the real country. Two, many ships line employees from third world dirty poor. Workers are often forced to comply with the threat (like illegal migrant workers) and suspicious or illegal practices. Three, often a language barrier, between officers and crew, but among crew members themselves. The crew is rewarded for their willingness and their silence. Four, once illegal work, the ships are able to conceal in a little more detail than a new coat of plainness. Anyway, it's interesting to read. <br /> <br /> Awesome story, excellent movie. Does anyone think that HBO can create the best and most important movie? In Hollywood, there are issues with the release of enough Oscars in a particular year, so that the top five competitors come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = quality movie finishes. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance of completely evil by Sean Pertwee. I like Omar Apps, as usual.
