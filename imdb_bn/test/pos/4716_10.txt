I have seen around 20 times outside Rangpur, it was good. At first, when I saw it, I saw the story of Laura Bowman, but later, after listening to multiple, I realized that it was also a parallel documentary. It seemed to me that women's struggles in Aung San Suu Kyi's struggle for women's struggle, uncertainty, danger and sorrow were strong. After watching more I will put history and politics on the list, since I learned a lot about Burma's past and present, and could only guess in its future. Not only this movie, but also the one you want to see, it is the one you want to be a copy owner. This is a film that is easily seen throughout the family, although not for children under the age of thirteen. However, educational benefits of this movie, and should not be separated.
