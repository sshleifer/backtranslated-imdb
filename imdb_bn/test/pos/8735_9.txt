Everyone told me to see "Cactus Flower" and I finally did it. What a wonderful movie - perfect pick-me-up for Sunday night / Monday morning is awesome Matthew and Haun were good, but Ingrid Bergman really made this movie - after all, it was actually about him. Truly great actors can do anything, and Miss Bergman proves it. He shows us - in one film - a range shows some of them in their entire career. The dance club scene was sensitive. Even after reaching the clear conclusion of the film, I was delighted for Miss Dickinson as if she was like a Boston Red Sox. Thankfully, he out (no pun intended) is much better. ;)
