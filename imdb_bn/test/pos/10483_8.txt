Stephen Audron The heroine of this nicely researched study of a small Danish community at the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musical gifted sisters leave their possibilities of happiness and marriage to care for their elderly. One day, a French lady Babbet came to work for them. After several years, he won the lottery and was determined to do something for the sisters. Her solution is to prepare a fine and glorious banquet, which changes the life of everyone who is invited. It is a film about human and cultural interaction, which is reflected in the changed language of dialogue in French to French and especially Protestant North America's charity confidence and Catholic south sensitivity. This is how warmth and generosity can be expressed and stimulated by the needs of people and the cultivation of senses. A deeply uplifting film.
