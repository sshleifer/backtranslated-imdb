A good story, unexpected character twists played as well. Deadly assassin gangster Brian Brown is teaching his son Mricram. Although it is successful as an action drama where you expect good people (lasers) and his Gilfrey to succeed, there are some ridiculous black humor in it. Bank robbers who are the "winners" of the radio competition and their reactions, revenge of Busker.
