I did not read the book "Scarlett" and when I saw this mini series I enjoyed it and thought it did not need to compare it to GWTW. The story can be different from the book, but those who care about a movie. Even based on the credit book, it's not a book. The film is clearly praised with reviews of other people, but the names of the original characters can not be made. <br /> <br /> I was pretty impressed by Scarlett's performance. Joan Hollley and Timothy Dalton were nice. They took the letters and gave them touch. As far as other people go, they compare them with the great Vivian Leigh and Clark Gabelle. They obviously acted nicely, but the film's leadership is totally different people, who have their own acting methods and should not pressure people to say what. If you want some actors to work well then you must direct the film, I am sure that they will not bring these roles to other actors as well as chemistry and cleverness. The supporter cast stood with greatness, and Jean Smart steals scenes cashed in with her comedy talent. <br /> <br /> The pictures were very beautiful and Scarlett was very happy to see everyone go. She is that problem and other things because she places in the film. The scene of Scarlett talking to his father's grave was also very dramatic and I had always thought that two wonderful actresses who came to Scarlett and brought her life. Not only Vivian Lei, but Juan Haley is not. <br /> <br /> The picture and book may be different, but you must never remember that this is not one of the best movies, but otherwise you will think that this will be like being with the wind and you do not like this film. But this is a low quality classic, which is in contrast to GWTW, its own movie. Also remember that "tomorrow is another day" ...
