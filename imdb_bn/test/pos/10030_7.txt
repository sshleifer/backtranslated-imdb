I blame myself "the birth of a nation" - could be a bigger example than to start the long-running tradition of Hollywood prostitution in history. As well as getting the name of the cast and his 7th cavity, Crazy Horse and Sieux and President Grant correctly spelled, the geography is accurate and true that the cast and his men were actually wiped out with a man, the rest are just hyperbolts and innovators. Ridiculous limits Throw in some cruel hackneyed scenes of the pure exposure (try to learn about "Gold Rush" to Castro and his wife for excuse the attack of the Siuster region; to request the return of the Red Cross of the witness to the front of Congress and to return to the post of the President's office at the top), really What is it, most of these scenes are their joke? It's almost funny ... ... and yet, and yet it's still the greatest actor of all time, such as Davyllland, as ever before, as the scene of the crowd of young Celeb Crazy Horse and director Walsh and as an increasingly crowded scene of the crowd scene. Started like the best rainy season of all time. Ford taught us "Liberty Valencia" to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we are close to legendary legends but hey, it's just a movie and a rolling, amazingly enjoyable classic Hollywood movie at that!
