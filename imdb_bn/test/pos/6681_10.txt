If you enjoy Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko or Mechanics, you will also enjoy K-Pax. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and finally felt sadness. SPICE distributes a great performance. Also, do not forget the look of Saul Williams in the film, I'm a big fan. After watching this, I've recommended this movie to many of my friends, and everyone is pretty fly away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But still, it is very, partly due to lack of action and explosion. I'm sorry, this is not a film about blowing up these things, it's not about people's behavior and how people live in the world. Go to <br /> <br /> and enjoy.
