Comedy Rule is not the best plot in the world. The class grader is amazing in this film. Another interesting person is Rob Schneider who played Bachman with Cakes Hodson Campbell. Lorraine is probably L. Cast more serious characters like Lake. Bruce Darn is a great actor in this film, perhaps playing the most serious character in the film. Actor I liked Tobi Hussein most, all his characters took to the cinema, the sunny. <br /> <br /> The plot is a little unusual, lt. Commander Tom Dodge, who has wanted his own sub-command for years. Finally when he gets the opportunity, he gets a deadly WWII diesel bay in Stariya, instead of the new brand of brand. His crew did no good, the US Navy misfits. Then he kept a series of War games series, which shows how an old diesel engine can manage itself against the current nuclear navy. The women who actually see how women's subscriptions work, their dive officers actually find a female officer but they are not even better. He wants to get the position of the commander, he must win the war games, and have to blow a dummy ship. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Theater When I was silent and at Bakoman Fort, I had a love and smile on the smile. <br /> <br /> Overall, 9 out of 10, this movie is very fun to watch, like this is a movie, I hate movies which try to be 100% serious.
