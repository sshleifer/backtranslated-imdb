A proud Japanese baseball player of Japan was forced to continue his career, he contrasts with a culture that is witchcraft, apparently funny manager, a striking Japanese woman and his own professional and social insecurity. There is a certain fine charm that flows through Tom Selleck's performance. There are humor, sometimes like this movie, rarely different, sometimes "people!" As slapstick, but always seems to involve some high purpose. Throw in the spontaneous people who struggle to solve their personal problems while fasting to "do the right thing" and you finish both fun and thinking with a movie. Casts fit together like a championship team, and even if their plays do not win the prize for the film's effort, they will leave the audience (and perhaps the best results later). You want to watch this movie more than once, and every time, Mr. Baseball runs home run.
