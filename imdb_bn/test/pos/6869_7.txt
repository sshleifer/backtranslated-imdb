There is not much of a plot in this movie. The owner of a wealthy baseball team who has died and whose wife is going to file a suit for laxity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even if you do not crack the smile up, you have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mattha Charlie has played, whose wife has recently died, and who finds herself in the hospital for the desire of several women. He is delighted to have everything available to him in the menu. Then he met Annek Atkinson (Glenda Jackson), who was initially a patient in the hospital (their first scene was very fun together) and then they were seen again in a television show, where they disagreed with almost every issue. Discussed. <br /> <br /> Charlie starts from Ani and from the opposite side, except that she stubbornly stalks her man (her husband was a deceiver) and they decided to give a shot - two faithfulness weeks. <br /> <br /> I would not be able to give anything else, but I would like to mention the screen on Mattah and Jackson's screen. He is not the first person to think about romantic, middle-aged comedy, but his touch with the comedy is very light and agree. He matched each step of the way by Matthau, who is more charming than ever before. To get the girl, she does not have to play Mr Sascian or Mr. Machhi, she will have to be herself. <br /> <br /> <br /> Art Karen himself has rioted as a good doctor. The baseball team's owner's Ashes house burial in the plate is unlimited. He had a very interesting scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard does not have much to do in this film, and Carney and Mattau are not just straight men; The role did not tax her significant talent, but she had a good time making this comedy. <br /> <br /> Many recommendations ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. FYI - Mtaus presented Jackson with her debut best actress Oscar, and Jackson was the best actor in the film Art Cornie to star in the film 'Harry and Tonto'.
