Sometimes, I have been affected by this film as this little part of four groups, that is facing a crisis, or many. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People like their good and their bad aspects, their weaknesses And shows their strength, with many plays and smiles. <br /> <br /> The closest equivalent to the US movie, I can remember, which is weak, in every case, Royal Tenenbaums. <br /> <br /> Brown's four films, the English title, is a forced hotelier and his wife and his old parents (who are traveling magicians); About the receptionist at an animal crematory and his family misadventures; About a fun cooking course (who mostly talks about their sad life) and fourthly a funeral trouter for jockeys, those who cross the grave and play the family and attend the 3D during the funeral, high-tech equipment Spends fate (the family gets taken, even the famous horses are not given to the family) <br /> <br /> This picture contains warmth and sympathy, which is filled with sadness and smile, I have never experienced before. Most actors were new to me without Robert Gastfussen and one or two, but they all got the big slam extravaganza (= Swedish "Oscar" awards) held in Swedish Gulbargag a week ago! <br /> <br /> Men, Female and Male Supporters Actor Award went to this film, for a few more boots! <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, go and see it - float very fast!
