On a scale of 1-10, "suicidal sweetheart" shows me 11 and from others. The pictures were incredibly fun. I told my wife, "It is clear that this man walks in the water but with a bed of fire, it is a little more." From Mel Brook's 'Young Frankenstein' I have seen that this is one of the best mix of comedy, satire and usability. I can not believe that this image was not taken by a big studio. <br /> <br /> This "Film Festival" was sophisticated and they were able to choose the visual, spoken or spoken trend of each comedy. The characters were real and a great script combination and a great casting was clear. Reality and Grace are the real people with real problems that are dealt with regardless of excuse for success. It laughs with a ridiculous and cheerful situation and laughs with this laughing smile with this extraordinary humor. <br /> <br /> To add it, it will be a "must see" pictures.
