For this rough follow-up film Brown returned to his role from the previous year ("Butcher"). Basically, by removing a large population organization in Mexico, he took revenge for the murder of his parents. Here, he is followed by a money launderer illustrated by McMahon (revenge against). When the first assassination attempt fails, then Brown again became active again, while trying to protect Hendry, his new girlfriend, gangster everywhere bursts. The original film was a good and more coherent film overall, it distributes all the exploitation aspects at a very critical level, which makes the section more fun to the fans. This movie is running very fast due to the cruise and cruel driving under street street in the night street. Each one minute or so appears to be one or more of the following: drug use, sex, nudity, gunfight, murder or any other action. Brown, with his usual reliable, friendly self, helps his amazing physical presence, which focuses on any power in his performance. McMahon is a riot! By splitting with the colorful glasses and middle of his hair (!), He is fulfilling his gang bang order and overheard making his fur-clad bimbo enthusiastic love. This is a reverse thrill to see Johnny Carson's sidekick in a role like this. Stroud creates an impression as an intense, ethnically enormous injured person, when adding the level of class as a direct police detective initiating Peter Brown's help. Sadly, Brown's original sidekicks have no mention of Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown is now a friendly choice (Hendry), but the lack of voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams makes a deadly turn as a cat, who can apparently choose a girl from a bar and make an immediate member of her harem. Cinematography and the overall aspect are less polished than the first film, but it has a drive and a danger beyond the root cause. The film spends a lot of time in the sewage of organized crime, medicine, prostitution, and other weaknesses, but it maintains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the lack of political reforms. A peculiar note: A key supporter of the first movie was shot in death, but played a different role here.
