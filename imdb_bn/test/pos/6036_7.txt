My first 'Colombo'. Rather enjoy it. The Great Format, and the character of Peter Falk, is very good ...... Fantasticly, he can take place alongside Pirot, Miss Maple, alongside Marlow and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series is such a following. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician I want to say a few things. Above all, a conductor who produces these pedestrian performance of the most basic examples of Repartoar (Eine Klein Nachtumusic, Strauss Waltz, Beethoven ...), there is no home or similar car or fame, it is very rare to call a talent. And acting as the actor is so bad that ridiculous. Any orchestra will take him seriously. <br /> <br /> There are many small things, such as Eine Klein Nachtusik's rehearsal (why did they just do it for TV?) any orchestral musician can play it in him or her anyway ...). His instructions to the group are undoubtedly unknown, and when Columbo asks Blyth Danar, 'Quantity Fantasia' means what he says 'Latin'. It's a huge majority of Italian, such as musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, no two great musicians ever interchange the following: "Play something." "What should I play?" "Chopin". Music works and emotions, they know it well. Some specific questions will be asked, and given! <br /> <br /> I know. I'll get more ...
