For the first time in the summer of 2005, her teaser Surface was a tossup. On the one hand, it seems to work so much better as a motion picture (or various) by it's passerby that it is so high idea and powered by the plot. Plus, it felt like NBC's attempts at "lost killer". On the other hand, someone may realize that the story was very expensive to say in the movie, and fans of Lost thought were curious. So, one (and possibly only) NBC, the event can break indefinitely, which it can fill in a gap in the Vault, Science file, or in the summer of 2007 or later in NBC lineups after or after 2007. His rating network (which is not saying anything) was better than that, but the show was taken away without any real formal announcement of the future. <br /> <br /> So, is it appropriate? Yes <br /> <br /> Surface follows a floating story based on a plot near a filler episode. Almost everything is important for the plot when the event happens, as a motion picture. Any filler episodes, which you miss in a part, are painful for you. Yet, the dual edge of the show has been made for him; The big things seem to be happening in every episode, but it seems like a movie that you've finished the feeling of each episode and you're asking for more! The show shows that, although it shows how great it is. Throwing hard; Three main sources, including beautiful lake belts, such as Laura Doteri, have a strong performance in each episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding / studying the animals. Ian Anthony Dell meets the short performance cast of Rad Serbajeira, along with and supporting cast. The story is slow (I'm sad about it at the beginning; it does not really choose between 3-4 episodes of the little 15-episode season), but the next half of the season is made for it. Visual effects are stunning (if you see an overhead view on an animal attack, your jaw will decrease), <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Complete the first episode and do not have to wait a week (or three) to see the next episode. <br /> <br /> If you missed the first season and you are interested then go back and see it. It is no twin peaks on the terms of quirkiness, but it holds the league with a concept for the high concept idea that is lost, and other similar shows, actions and adventure. Enjoy
