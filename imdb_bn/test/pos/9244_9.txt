I found it to be an entertaining account of challenges that an independent filmmaker might face (some I did not even think). The film managed to keep my interest in full time and I actually laughed once more! I'm not a filmmaker, so I do not know anything about technology, but it was well edited and the story was flowing simply. As a waiver, I contributed to this effort after supplying music for soundtracks but I was not involved in the creation of this movie and I could not tell you anything about the repo man, but it seemed as if I was thinking of coming back. I'm not really a science fief). I enjoyed making punk rock music comparing the film making punk rock files. My wife went with me to see the film and she did not know anything about it before hand and we had a great time.
