So years and years later I tracked this image! I was dead to see how my memories lived up to. I have emptied the ghost boy's shots, thinking that the pieces of wood were broken into the Mainhft, just looking through a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most cold shot of my childhood, I feel cold running down my spine. Now seeing this, it is probably not near the scary, but it is strange to see the same image again very unconsciously. If someone wants a copy, make me private message <br /> <br /> The story itself is the perfect quality of the BCFF staff. Even though this strange thing has been almost unclear at this time - there is no real moral (except '' Scratch is here to help us '' or 'do not bias against ghosts!') Even there was no greed / capitalist angle to gain from mine want to do. However, a major act of irresponsibility to the captain encourages two children to follow vague influences in a ghost, but in a new pit hole which is completely dangerous. Captain then encourages children to dig through huge stairs, because they think ghosts want them too. It is a bit odd that the boy likes to help the adults stuck to the ghosts, and not just directly help the adults stuck. Well good
