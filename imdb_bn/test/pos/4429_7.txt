I think the title of the movie is well described. If you are looking for a documentary about Louise Kahn and his work, you will see elsewhere. Although some of it is covered in this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm eating a lot of food, and I do not know most of the family history that I can travel around in this field. So I believe what I said about Nathaniel and his father <br /> <br /> <br /> What was this movie for, I thought it was good. For a little more slowly and attention, I hope Nathaniel gave some more attention than the drama of his family (though history was quite interesting, but Luis was a player). <br /> <br /> This is a journey through someone's life, and I was happy to tag along with experience. A learning experience for me, and so it looks like, for filmmakers too. <br /> <br /> Oh, and some footage of the ear work * Stunning *
