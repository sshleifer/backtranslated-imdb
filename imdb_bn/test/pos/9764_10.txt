This movie is sleeping - I have seen any mini-television on television, several times, and this is the best. Acting nicely, played nicely, and the characters are well developed. Helen Mor completely fits the part of the jinn palsel - suppressive, controlled, sharp, and a bit rebellious. He likes Joe Herman, Cowboy / Techtune / "OK All right" guy's sort. I'm sorry that the movie was not confined to the book, it did not have romantic interest in Neil Strun and Jean Patgate. For those who do not know, about three years of Malaysia women have been taken from the real story about Japanese women, who did not know what to do with them. They have very little survival. Neville Shut spoke to one of them, and this is his story. This film deserves the collection of everyone who loves stories from WWII.
