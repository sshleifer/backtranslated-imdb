This short nomination was nominated for the Academy Awards, which lost to Anna and Bela. Dr. Strangelov's nuclear war was not so pleasant! Condie takes a situation and turns it on her ear and then gives it a spin for good measurement. The visual gags are huge in Condie's work and I always see something I miss this time I see. In the world's seratam animation, this is good value for many more shorts. Recommended.
