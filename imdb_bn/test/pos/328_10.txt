Kannathil Muthamital is definitely a great movie. I work a great command and AR For Gem Ratnam it will be paid. Rahman for great songs. The camera work is just fine and like Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I would be surprised if this movie does not win the Oscars for the best foreign film or even the best camera work.
