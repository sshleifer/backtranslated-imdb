When I first sat for the Greeks, I was not expecting an event with complex character, plotting plot lines and illogical writing ... but exactly what I got. <br /> <br /> Several college students from the Greek system of Cyprus Rhodes University Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Polsy as a polymer, who wants to be in a bond. Her elder sister, KC (the most prestigious sister-in-law of the campus, the center of the show and the Zeta Beta Jeter can soon be the president), is not fully supportive of her plans.
