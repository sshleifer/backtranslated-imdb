I saw the movie a few years ago and completely and completely influenced but had her sensuality. It is one of the most sensitive films I have ever seen, although it may appear a little satirical and artificial - very nice, if you will. However, one thing surely - Cameron Man has done a great job - each image is eligible to cut the film and be shown as relatively different peace with the pictures of Chikiko or Bernard Buffet. <br /> <br /> The music plays a perfect background for the story, especially played in the first and second novels of a beach beach scene in U2. For casting - I do not like Sophie Marshau and Gene Renu very much and can not add more to others' complimentary comments. <br /> <br /> Many people (critics and those who sophisticated the cinema) criticized the movie and saw me with a more complex look for the second time. No doubt, the setting is superb and welding ripping. But thus is not enough to make a comprehensive and united film. The second novel (when Sophie Marsoo is not talking too much about the inspiration of the person involved in the story of Malkovich near her uncle's story - but just what did the nude marsau or the beautiful and sensual love story with?). Apparently, it does not add anything to the idea of ​​film, and even the Malkovitch sculpture is unable to link to the original plot. <br /> <br /> Other stories have been more rational and really nicely shot, which encompasses most of the logical confusion among them. The scene when Gene Renae sees the city through a large window of his apartment on top of the building, it is absolutely incredible. Feeling humid air and fine blurred, which may have appeared in the first "myth" scene, can be felt through a literal screen. No doubt, Antonioni is a great master of shadows and semi-shades. My favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic, deep and meaningful - I guess it's an image like the most Antonio in the whole movie - almost an example. Most likely, the overall positive impression of the movie is largely due to the end of the show, with one shot somewhere in a small Ghotic Italian town, with its inferior narrow streets and crooked pavements, l'au drinkable and fountain with memorial cathedrals ... it was lean but really touched. <br /> I hope that my impression and comment on the film, but they will proudly encourage anyone to see it in the evening (it works better with home theater as you look at the movie theater). Enjoy <br /> <br /> I am apologizing for the unexpected English and any possible mispronunciation
