Another "old but delicious" "Cactus Flower" like "Out of the Townars" is accompanied by a great cast: Gouldi Haun, the appearance of his first film (pre-faculty), Ingrid Bergman in his next, and the ever-funny Walter Matthau. The story is a story of a dentist who pretends to be married to give an excuse to not marry his girlfriend, to bring an imaginary wife to prove. He took his role as the Spinner Receptionist (Bergman) for the role, which led to many comic disasters and a wonderful romantic twist. This is the same vein as the Doris Day / Rock Hunter comedy. Their supporters - like I - will like this movie; If not, do not bother.
