Kiefer Sutherland Another brilliant illustration, who killed Mikey Hayden, a police that works on the mental aspect of the victim's murder. I love movies related to the state of mind, and I was not frustrated by the "killer's eyes" (AKA after Elise). I just wish the movie was released in the movie theater.
