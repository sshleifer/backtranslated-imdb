... and I'm very frustrated because I can not buy a DVD or VHS anywhere. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of mix, Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is a poor teenager. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy of it, or knows where I get it Can ... please give me a message - it will be very appreciated.
