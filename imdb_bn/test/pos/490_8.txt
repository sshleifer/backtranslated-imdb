All right, sure, this movie is a bit next to the hockey. It's hard to take comic book characters and keep them in movies with no credibility (anyone like Dolf Lundgren the Punisher?), But it's very hard to try. I have never read the original humorous book, but it does not really matter, I think. I mainly judged a film of its merit, whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (If it does not have a movie based on the real story, but at least try to correct and accuracy.) Then why would I give this film a fairly high rating? Because it tries. It is very hard to try. In my book, it makes a fair effort in an entertaining film. <br /> <br /> The main focus is on making many movie vampires. It seems like everyone is in Vampire's people, cruises, silver, garlic, sunburn, whatever. Some ideas are included here. The storyline is familiar ... A group of vampires plot to capture the world, a person (mainly) standing in their way. Blades (Wesley Snipes) live the sole purpose of vandalizing the public, who gradually migrate to the world and share it with mankind. In most cases, the human race is blind to the existence of existing animals around them. Vampires even as familars, who are ambitious to be vampires and do the dirty work of vampires for them, they eventually "turned." <br /> <br /> Now I think that this film has many elements similar to the story of Ruddy Piper, they live online. A secret enemy, a hidden group of scheming people against them, fighting to save mankind ... all are present in blade. <br /> <br /> acting is not the best here. Snipes, its other role is only slightly better than some good; N'Yosh Wright, a relative young, not very bad; Chris Crisford has forgotten as a blade for the side of the blade (he has identified the chip as a punisher). Stephen Doroff has done the best of the whole cast here, like "the head" vampire you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> I do not know, but I liked the special effects of this movie. Bloody vampire-style Rave, all the way to inevitable war at the end of the film, special effects are not half bad. Of course, you need to go near blood and cattle, but after all, it's a vampire movie, is not it? The use of various types of surgery and blades is fairly unique, and is generally not used in contemporary action films. Snipes say a machine gun, there is more mood with a decked out sword with him. Plus, there are many thoughts that fight with a fungus to blow someone. (If not, of course, you are Indiana Jones.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not the best action film ever made, but it's not half bad. As a bonus, musical scores and soundtracks are very cool, too. Tell me, in other movies, you can listen to super drum's or source direct or photocard? <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
