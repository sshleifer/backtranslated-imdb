To understand the film as something other than a documentary about skeboarding, fails to recognize many important aspects of Dogton. Parlata (a well-known skewboarding figure herself) created a movie that is not related to the birth of what we know today as skrobboarding, but also appears in the social-cultural and economic conditions, and this is a great appeal. In addition, his film is a work of both the social investigators and the participants involved in the initial cooperation of this cultural phenomenon rather than personal. In this introduction, he combine an impressive "participant-observer", and the integral partners of this movement, and those who were deeply influenced by the emergence of skeboarding as a competitive sport and sub-culture gathered together. The film is a unique style film and sound editing, and the narrative (with Shan Pens) and interviews take a genuine, undetermined form, just like the anarchic, unselfish attitude of surfing the plain path. The film displays the activity of a lasting sport, music, video, time, space, and situations are seriously tempered with the sensitivity of the archaeologist.
