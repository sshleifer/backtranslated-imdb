After unstable instability for a decade, American films started switching gears and turning their cameras into a more intimate world of warfare, political corruption, and social turmoil to family disadvantages. Husband's baby boomers started toll in American families when they grew up and their own kids felt themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the first functions of "Crumar v. Krummer". Family dramas that were so popular in the 1980s, and it's the best. It now gets a left rip instead, because it is known as the 1979 Best Picture beat the "Apocalypto Now" for the Academy Award, but compared to these two films is the comparison of bananas with a chilly chicken chest: they are not the same distance, but we Can not both of them enjoy? Director / writer Robert Benton does not try to play with his film; Particularly in Dustin Hoffman and Merrill Strip, this act is in his power, the divorced couple are fighting children and selfishly on the kids. The scene of the court that they submerge it to protect, and in which everybody is forced to hit others in a terrible way, it is destructive, and seems authentic. Humane's strong father does not present the movie as a stranger stranger mother villain as a hero. They are not as good or bad as humans - they are just bad in marriage. <br /> <br /> The movie is tears in the last phase, but not in an impressive way. It has the right to elicit sobs. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
