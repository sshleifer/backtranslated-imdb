On the other day on-demand and thought, I saw it, "It's a movie that can play with Alex Guyini and Glennies Johns, if it was made in the late 50's". English tradition is a Fars. Alfred Molina and Brenda Bluthin are very sweet and sincere in their pictures. Naomi Watts simply sizzles the way in a ditzy Jayne Mansfield-Ish (if she can act). The rest of the cast has some great turn and bits. Welsh landscape is pleasing. An incredible premise, indeed and not at all credible, but that does not get the way to the pleasure. Not a great movie, mind you, but a really fun watch. And Walken is well in his patch. See a joy!
