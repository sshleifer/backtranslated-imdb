ABC version of late Pope's life: They put it slightly ahead of the CBS version and may suffer it, but the program was nice. To cover the long life of this great man, it has been quickly moved from just two hours (with commercial time), but Thomas Creschmann has been commensurally challenged. He has done outstanding work in expressing passion and confrontation in the public. He played against CBS biopic - from youth to old age and considered "realistic" at both ends of the scale. His credibility never wavered. It has a nice range and depth. It's embarrassing that the program may not be long and more detail, but they work in the time frame, it seems they did a great job to bring on a small screen.
