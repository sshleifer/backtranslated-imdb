The first fully synchronized sound cartoon, Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse made his screen debut with an amazing cartoon short essay "Steamboat Willie". Under the supervision of Captain Peg leg leg, Mickey will be an employee in a Steamboat (or later called Pete). Mickey runs her longtime partner Minni Mouse on the train, as they are curious when Mikey Mini tries to influence her. This short was wildly fun and positive recreational. Animeiter Woe Wewers, Rudolf Ising, and Hugh Hermann helped Walt to briefly. "Stamboble Wiley" originally started the success of Walt Disney Company.
