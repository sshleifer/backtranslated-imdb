This is my 8th image, compared to other feature-length films since 1930. According to the film quality produced a few years later, this film can only achieve 6 or 7 scores - in most cases the sound quality was very poor. It is now possible that the movie has improved and the Fox movie channel has shown a drop-down print (it has many lines and scratch in DID), but I think the word problem is always a problem. Because the term in the 1930s was still a novelty, and most of the 1930s Hollywood films seem to be terrible - background letters often sink, huddled together to ensure the characters are sorted by microphones or continuous quality (e.g. Bishop Murder Case , Hell's Angels and other movies of the day). These big trials got worse because most of the movies were shot outside - at that time they did not hear anything. Something that is completely an innovation but that stretches the talent of sound technicians! So, when the movie was hard to hear, I realized that they have to start somewhere, so I can forgive it - especially the outside scenes are exciting - a new invention for the 1930s. <br /> <br /> This plot is similar to Simran - a Western that came out next year and captured Oscar for the best picture. Unfortunately, Simron is not such a big movie and I really like a big trial due to the scope of the movie. Some big trials may slow down at a running speed, but I have seen a great history lesson on the West Trains in terms of the hardships of the West Tourists. Plus, the whole thing looked so beautiful, because director Raou Walsh took important issues in the film for the position and the Big Trill looked almost like a film version of the Ansal Adams prints. <br /> <br /> For acting, it was pretty good. It was a big break for young Wayne - his previous screen appearances, the best, the small, and the strangers. Here, he led and did a painful job - though he was apparently young and a little less "John Wayne-Ish", later he was in the film because his screen personality was not firmly established yet. Another interesting part is played by Tern Power II (father of Tyrone Power). He did not see anything like his very handsome son and poppy cartoon often seen like a bluuto! He made very few sound films - this movie died just a year later - so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear once a famous actor. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole film is a little overly long. This was a tremendous success for the 1930s - the more famous and award-winning Simron made the following year. For most of the reasons, the big trailer did not win the Oscars, probably because all the quarters of the West Front came in the same year and it is one of the really great films.
