A group of friends breaks somewhere in the middle (one was a flat tire, others zip would not begin mysteriously). One of them takes the tire to the run down service station and the last one sees him. When the remaining four go in search of their friend, then they Come to the slusene, who helps to fix the zip and offers shelter from cold drinks and temperatures, the Harmmate-House, which is occupied by very realistic looking mannequins. To work in the car, he went with a man and released 3 girls in the house. He warns not to leave them and go home behind his chains; He warns them about "Davey", his brother who is hiding and is not there. Of course, one of them decided to go out in search of a phone call and never met. Is it sluice? Is it Davy? Mancuisance ?? There is a tremendous dire need for tourism trap (Jagannath is a big girl, a lovely two shoes girl, curiosity is getting better and never working!), But it has become isolated at the end of the late 70's. I started to feel sorry for Slusen (Chuck Concerts is a terrific, obscure, high-performance) at a point in the film, and you almost look similar to the character of Dolly. It is a gem you can find it; When I was young, then I stopped it, and walking through a used video store, I saw a VHS copy that was not quite high, but it was good. Tania Roberts supporters will not be disappointed. The best part of the film for me was the view of soup (and crackers !!) <br /> <br /> I had given it a 7 because there were some movies and still difficult to explain.
