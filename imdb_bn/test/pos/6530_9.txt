This is a really cute movie. I had a huge sleepover (girls 10-11) and they absolutely loved this movie. They saw twice! Do not let the rating fool you To rate the movie in IMDb, you will have to be 13 years old or older, which eliminates the target audience of the film. If you have a girl (or boy) between 7 and 13 years, I'm sure they will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> A sex-sorting "Notting Hill" flip in the High Court. Aaron Carter is a famous pop star who failed in his personal educated class. Her mother sent her "regular" high school with ultimatum, "High School does not pass the summer tour." Taking the advice of her manager (former pop star David Cassidy), she shares the most intelligent girl in the school with the scheme of cheating on the school (Alana Austin). Look for the ridiculous and insightful Janitor (another former pop star Lief Garrett).
