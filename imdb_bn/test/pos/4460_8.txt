Do not torture a DUCKLING (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). <br /> <br /> Certainly, a major candidate for the most insane movie titles, has achieved tremendous success in Gayello. Originally, the film's title was even more illogical, the word "Donald Dock Torture Donald Dock" literally translates from the Italian title A small Donald duck image featured for a short time as a toy, but it was enough enough to give headlines like this, but apparently, it was changed to Disney's fear of legal restrictions. I was quite angry with Fussi's previous lizard against a woman skin (1971), but here it has all the right ingredients. An amazingly effective mystery, a good cast and shot imaginable against an unusual rural setting. Just click on everything. I think it is just as one of the most successful accomplices of the director. <br /> <br /> This story is against the retreat of a small hill town of Sicily, where some people are killing teenagers. Among the suspects, one of the most obvious women, Masariara (Florida Baklan), a self-proclaimed magician who doubtfully discovers a skeleton of a baby and tears the pins out of stone. Guiseppe, the village's ass is also in doubt, because he has made a poor effort to profit from the disappearance of the boys and has gone right into their trap. When a fast-disrupted Newshound (Thomas Million) arrives from Milan to Milan, he immediately starts asking questions about the idea of ​​the authorities, when he meets two potential suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest (Mark Porl) , And Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a disgruntled young girl from the city with an annoying past of city crime, the city Also fancies sexual relations with young boys. Talk about your major red herring. <br /> <br /> Flussa beautifully contrasts modernity and heritage with the newly built highway through the Sicilian hills, the old city of the past where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. The North American vs. The South can be debated about the political outlook of the film, or the portrayals of small towns - generally speaking as a commentary on society's conventions - which are often dangerously close to moral isolation, chaos and finally spontaneously closure - justice by population justice The film has often been lambasted due to its anti-Catholic tone, but there is obviously no important element for plots-related, which would be too much off. It is actually relatively less than a movie from Joel Seria's Do not Deliver UVL (1971). Possibly, instead of the city's Sicilian-priced filming, there may be some offenses in Sicily due to the filming of the movie (when a second boy is killed, the local population is depicted as unarmed lynch-view), but Italy considers problematic relations with Sicily's rest - for other Italians too Problems, I think. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While there is a lack of eye-footage, the film has two very graphic views. In the gross-out finale, the killer causes a steep mountain collapse, destroying his face along the stone alongside the fatal results (though not realistic). And in the graveyard, the chain-chipping sequence with Florida Baklan shows for the tragic falsity and, generally, he is not seeing graphically that most filmmakers simply indicate. Of course, Fulci's reporter is one of the most awesome scenes. Finally, it is a small, well-written, functional small mystery, nicely shaped by flowers, repeatedly boutiques, Mark Pourle (not regularly believing as priest)), Thomas Million and Florida Bakan (city witch) As the face crazy). <br /> <br /> Camera Asphuara --- 8/10
