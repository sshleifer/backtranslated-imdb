Tim Burton was the second round of 1992's "Batman Returns" as director, and yet again, in 1989, he again hit his film again in a dark and gloomy way. Gotham City is again dark place and evicted from every corner of the road with crime and accidents. How Burton used politics as a mistress who was in business business corruption with business tycoon Max Shrek (Christopher Walken) corruption and Gotham's "Penguin" (Danny Davito) plan to build mayor! However, Keaton once again came back as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne, and he gave another starred performance like a strange and shattered man who could not find love in the normal world, but when he meets Selina Kyle's other solo soul, she is challenged. Kyle's own dark secret is mysterious which is very shrinking and she's just a stubborn vamp as the sexy and mysterious still dangerous "Catwoman" (Michele Pfeiffer). To destroy Gotham, both of them create a plan in Villain and both want to get rid of their own bats. In fact, although this movie is fierce and somewhat obnoxious with a lot of Penguin scenes, but it is obviously an exciting adventure journey, you never find a dull moment and stopped for the team again to explore your character and made it split, the film is even more interesting. Since none of the "Catwoman" could eat well and Davito "Penguin" was perfect to fit the character of her body frame, since its performance was just as perfect as Michelle Pfeiffer was just perfect to fit the character. "Batman Returns" is an entertaining thriller journey that you can not close your eyes as a spectator. You will enjoy it, it is exciting and explosive on many occasions.
