Much more pronunciation than this has been described in this photo's most spectacular acting, welding and styling. It seems that the only negative review core focuses on perceived imbalances in core moral questions (euthanasia). <br /> <br /> This image, by casting the final scene, insists on Raman's belief that he created some grand points but only for him, the development of dignity is a life which is not worthless. We, as a spectator, see great respect in his life - we see family and friends and culture and live a life entirely for his physical limitations. The central to the tragedy of this movie is that the only person who thinks Ramon's life is not alive - and that is. <br /> <br /> To see this image and say that the only counter argument comes from a bumbling priest's visit to a meaningless. The direct attack on the simplicity of the Spanish Catholic Church's response to the holiness and discipline of the priest. However, the words of the priest's sister's division suddenly suppress the whole film and express strong 'pro-life' emotions. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and beauty of life living with love. After the film's progress, we can slowly encourage Raman's logic, but we will never meet with his decision. <br /> <br /> I do not remember a movie that inspires me and made me so excited.
