In the decade of the decade, in the decade of the decade, there was a time of "miniature age" from the television miniseries, which was a time of long, wide epic with high production costs and lots of star cayos. This is great for most of the time, though I personally like less soap operas as story material and overall feeling of history. <br /> <br /> James Reid and Patrick Swayz have provided excellent performance - especially read, whose George Hazard often works as a mental anchor in the middle of the melodramatic story. The series includes the topmost work of Carsti Eli, Wandi Kilbourne, Hall Hall, Lewis Smith, Jenny Francis, George Stonford Brown and others. Clothing, screenplay, set and music are all the first rates as well. <br /> <br /> Do not accept it as a history lesson, but accept it for - a well-established, broad epic from a past era. The second book is also excellent after one year, but I would recommend giving viewers to exclude Book 3, which came 28 years after the book and it was not as good as the first two parts. Although books 1 and 2 are classic, even with their soap ingredients, and they are valuable to look at.
