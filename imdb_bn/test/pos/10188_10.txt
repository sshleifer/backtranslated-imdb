I'm not a Disney fan, but I'm in Orlando for a friend's wedding. So my travel partner and I went to Disney for a few days. I have not seen a good 3-D effect, good .. So I usually try to stay away from this presentation. This 3-D effect was so good. I was an old man aged 38, even I wanted to try and reach and touch. That's good! Word of advice At the end, look behind the wall theater. Keep it like this ... for the first time, the effect is not working. So I said to my friend, "If it was good ..." my friend said, "That's exactly what happens, it does not work for any reason." This is a terrific show. You do not have to be frustrated !!!
