I absolutely adored this movie. For me, the best reason to see it is "Boston Legal" or "Alley Macbill" or even "El Law." This is how it reverses the legal dramas like. It is the reality. The law is not BS, in some of the last arguments or some harmful defense you came out of your butt, like "Chevabacha Defense" in the South Park.) It is the real worrying incident of justice, the legal system has become a terrible mistake and works by good lawyers - shyster stereotype No, those who use it all right in their skill. It will do more to restore your faith to humanity than to a Frank Caper film or to kill the killing cat. And most importantly, I started crying. At the time of the movie, the DVD includes featurette time at the end - it's amazing. Wonderful movie; Amazingly made Thanks God made it God.
