If 10+ prizes are possible then .... this is what I would like to see is this picture. <br /> <br /> I could capture this image on TV many years ago - and luckily enough video is it. Now my video copy is outdated, video technology is outdated and I'm starting to think that I can not enjoy the pleasure of this movie much more. <br /> <br /> It's superb as wildlife film. As a movie about the relationship between humans and nature, it's beyond screening before or after it. How can the film industry go such a classic unnoticed and forget? If this thing like the lobby / pressure group pushes to reproduce this movie, then count me and send me a detailed description. <br /> <br /> I guess someone who created a piece can reproduce this in today's market.
