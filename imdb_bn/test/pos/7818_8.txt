Especially a charming movie developed by the musical and voice background during the competition. My burden is that there was never a soundtrack, but through your sources, I could get information about the singer and advise me about the possibility of getting a copy that I can sing. Your help will be appreciated. The song really touched me and my wife and we want to protect a copy wherever possible, so that we can play our family and friends as background music for our "Italian Nights". If you are able to get this information from us, we will be eternally grateful. Even if you can suggest contact with the studio, we can go directly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
