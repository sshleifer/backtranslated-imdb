War is not fought for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from prison and used prisoners as shock troops. This is a kind of battalion story. Little hunks, political prisoners, armies kicked off other units, along with the White Army's gray-haired fighters as well as some dangerous criminals. <br /> <br /> They are thrown into battle, illogical and facing danger if they show signs of ugliness or failure, but NKVD's special effects are elementary and basic one-dimensional characters, but the overall story is very human and Writing <br /> <br /> I did not see a version with subtitles or dubbing. In order to see the show, the use of Russian speakers in the interval of breaks and liberal use of explanations is liberal.
