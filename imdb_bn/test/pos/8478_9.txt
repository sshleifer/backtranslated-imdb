Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Fox) is a very talented pianist and singer. Ray is a smart person as well. In the late 1940s Roy started his career before finding his own style. Ray is certainly popular at the night club with her music. Things changed, when he met an aspiring music producer (Curtis Armstrong). Who knows what Ra plays as a strong actor and he meets a woman (Kerry Washington), she loves and also marries as well. Ray's album hits when he mixes soul music and gospel together. Which made the judgment controversial people in the 1960's decade of 1960s. Roy has love for all kinds of music including country. But it seems that judgment is not always a perfect man. As she was married, there was a lot of incomplete relationships with another woman. But he had to fight racism, who doubled him, his music was ideal and, of course, his drug addiction. As a result, Ray's life became very difficult for him as well as to fight against his childhood tragedy. No judgment is always responsible for itself. <br /> <br /> Directed by Oscar-winning: Taylor Hackford (Agost Aust Odds, Devil's Advocate, Dolores Claibern) Late "Always the Story of Stunning Stories of Charles." Fox won the Oscars for the sensible performance of late entertainers. Foxx brings heart and spirit as well as film and comedy. However, the top actors in this movie are: Regina King, Clifton Powell, Boekem Woodbyn, Anjun Ellis, Warwick Davis, Terrence Howard and Sharon Warren Rey's mother. Perhaps it is probably the best film of his career at Hackford. The film also has many songs from Charles's best music. <br /> <br /> The DVD's sharp pan and scan (1.33: 1) transfer and a nice Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. There is an informative commentary by the director of Disk 1 and the DVD has the original theatrical cut and an extended version. But instead you see the theatrical version better, because the bonus footage is sometimes bad and if you want to see these deleted scenes you have to click the logo. Disk 2 has deleted features with optional commentary by the director (which can be seen in an extended version), features and more. But featurettes are frustrating short for this DVD. As the movie is great good. This film was nominated for four costumes, including Best Costume Design, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Picture. This is a wonderful real life story, but of course, Charles's life was also more controversial and harmful than the final film. Still, it's pretty cool off. Screenplay by James L. White From a story by White and Director: Hackford Oscar winner for best sound. Do not miss it. (**** Â½ / *****).
