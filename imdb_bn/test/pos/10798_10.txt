When you think 'Oliver Stone' films will be his biggest and controversial topic like Pluto, JFK, born June 4th or natural birth killers. Talk Radio is not usually. This is actually a beautiful little movie. More than half of the films talk to her microphone at her radio station with Barry Champline. But believe me, it is one of Oliver Stone's greatest films and it should not be missed. <br /> <br /> It's a character study above all things. Barry Shamplen is an illogical, self-destructive, risk-talking radio radio show host who speaks many things and begins to suffer with his boss, his boyfriend (s), his fans, and even some Nazis. He does not like his listeners and callers, and many of them do not like him (Ihtera or like him, but no idea why). But, in the end, he said to his mourning: "I guess we're stuck with each other. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the Oliver Stone film then watch the talk radio. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
