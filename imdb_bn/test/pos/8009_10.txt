I like the whole house and step in the same house step. I'm not just a favorite episode like a certain episode. But I do not like some scenes, but I was frustrated to say the reason for seeing this show because it was Susan Summers. And my most favorite character was wings. And Karen may sometimes have a snob, but she was good character. I just like to see family events instead of trash, which has many drugs and violence. This show is like other family groups, where parents and parents always have curfew and dates. Step-by-step, my other favorite shows are the whole house, Sabrina Kishore witch, Gomar Pile USMC, Andy Griffith Show, and Hazard Duchess.
