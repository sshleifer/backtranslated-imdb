I could not help but was able to make the whole seat of Brian happy because it explains the reason for a madman becoming crazy, people have been killed in past movies. Past activities such as cooking food or drinking water on microwaves also create some terrible slaughter from a movie in the past. Director Phooli is playing himself, he is pointing to the gehtha of Sodom (?) And can not deprive his mental health from constant killing. He seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses the work of the Phoenician as a way of executing innocent people, hypnotizing the director that he is probably responsible for. <br /> <br /> It is probably a movie fun poking fun in the film of Phossea, such a profession that causes so much death and destruction, which makes them very rarely discovers, can make it a form of succession and shape. The film depicts most wrap-around stories surrounding non-stop graphic violence, including the possible way to kill a woman who is quite nude publishing. This could kill a shower directly from Hitchcock, or perhaps could not. The film's barbarity is the mental state of Phulasi Phalke (.. I know) during the running period. Reality and cinematic fiction have got fused and Fulci can find no escape. The last (.. old clich√© explanation: "it's only a movie") It could not work better than here. Parcelon (.. nice touch) of Fossil's boat and he has moved .. I just want this his final film because it was a perfect intimate if ever there was. David El Thompson's planned psychological plan to kill his adulterous wife. Jeffrey Kennedy A policeman, Phulaki, was scared that his family was assassinated. <br /> <br /> This photo has a lot of unique ways to get out of the head, such as chest door, a chainsaw, and a hatchet. The most cruel violence is arising from the brutal chain activity of a corpse. It has been broken into a piece (.. how does a gardener's circle work nicely in a night oscillation order) .. a little boy when the youngest son is decapitated! The opening scene with doll puppies in puppet dolls is the case of Hello. The split scenes in the film, which is scary Fulci watching, is obvious, but I can not help but can enjoy this anyway.
