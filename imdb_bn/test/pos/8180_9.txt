Another time for Chen Kiez ... (She can not remember the modern film) <br /> <br /> Good characterization with a common story of faith and broken promises. Fighters of H.K., or none of Hollywood's heroes, but because of this it's good. The characters are strong, I really felt for them. <br /> <br /> Mandrine burden clearly gives English subtitle edges. The film is about 3 hours, but it does not feel like it.
