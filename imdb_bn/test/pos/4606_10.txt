This is the final, and I mentioned, the festive classic means! The plot is bad vs bad. Illustrations of gray areas for the responsibility of true real cases of evil in the real world and there are not enough films on the basic needs of the temple, there are always plenty of films. Only recently the filmmakers have even made a weird attempt. Black and white in more than half of the real life in real life, but this is a fraction of the film. This movie is a classic example of a back and white color. It is best seen in black and white. The hero is in the worst condition. He is in the area of ​​such people that he wants to kill him, and in various enemies. The film feels that she is frustrated and can not depend on help. His enemy (count), has lots of resources. Counting wife was forced to marry him, and he knows from his past history that he will kill all his wives sooner or later. He and his friend fall in friendship and fall into a friend who can win the observer (unless the person just wants to be reverse brutal). Anyone who helps them is killed. They have no escape. The situation is frustrating. So will they survive to the end? You will not guess until you fall spoilers. There is also a lot of good environment, courage and conspiracy in the film, Lone Chaney as a bad guy and Boris played his best role as one of Karol's best people. Usually cast as a bad guy, Karl was his best when presented in such a complicated role at this time. Chaney was rarely given a complex role, although he stuttered his staff in several films called "Mais and Mans". This is a little more than a camie for her. Still, the tension will never stop. There are mysteries and dangers throughout life. Completely written, fully cast, and perfectly guided. It should be a movie-pure turn, pure courage.
