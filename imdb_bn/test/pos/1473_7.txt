It must be said that this film must be one of "Beginn Bin" movies. I owe £ 15 for it if I feel a little cheated, but at around $ 1.50, I felt that I definitely got more than my monies price. <br /> <br /> The film does not make much of a decision whether it wants to "Mac Max" with a person called "Mad Max" or Clint Eastwood's "Spaghetti Westerns", and in this way the clichés are stacked from both. There are also manic loners who have quarreled with "Mad Max"'s bad guys. <br /> <br /> The man of "Blade Runner" has a good billing system, though he is just the beginning and the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Dear Bit - Punch-up on the oil refinery for me - if you look closely, you "seven post-apolipickic" misses seven bells out of each other like two leaders. <br /> <br /> Get some logos in some pizzas and sit back and finally enjoy the light and recreational drill.
