The story of the King Emperor's aspiring plan to unify all the kingdoms of China is mostly produced by the director. Some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. However, the ability of the actor (which was good I enjoyed Marcus most) or was not flown by the film in terms of its appearance (although the reliance of the soldiers was very impressive, if it were real people, many extra!) <br /> <br /> I In other movies, Lee Gong has seen and he is always very cool. I think it's a good piece of time, but it's not about real historical accuracy to judge. Good movies and 2 1/2 hour hours are not a problem. <br /> <br /> 10 rating 7.
