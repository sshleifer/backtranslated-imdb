This was odd film. Although it seems to be targeting children I liked it in adventure. (Speaker Ayod) maliciously, the main character killed a federal officer. Then he runs on a mad. Later they blew up the house and then finally committed suicide. Looks like they've made it a movie for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly. <br /> <br /> It was in the strange movie.
