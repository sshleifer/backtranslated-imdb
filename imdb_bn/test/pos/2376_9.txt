The third part of Miike's dead or living triangle is not related to each other, less or less as the first two parts. Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi return again for the main role, but this time the movie gives us 300 years or future forward future ... Apocalypse post. <br /> <br /> Ricky plays a drifter who hooks up with a bunch of police, for an Enforcer Corrupt city's ultimate police policy, and show dude to a bunch of oppressed rebels. The film was certainly shot in Hong Kong, because the rest were the Cantonese speakers, among which the most recognizable faces were Terrence Yin and Josy Ho. There are also HK Stunts crew for the sequence of movie performances, which is very cool in the hack -her-mic style. <br /> <br /> This can be a terrific low-budget B-movie sheets, but in the hands of Miike it certainly becomes more interesting. This is a very slow, thought-provoking movie that does not try to do anything down the audience. Characters will be round and interesting and plot stories on an interesting but fairly loose framework. <br /> <br /> All action scenes are a fairly less effort, which indicates Mike's growing power and choreographing very nice action. It is really fun to watch the rugs made with the show and rookie on the wire rags - you can say that they have a great time. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is trying to combine with three dead or living movies, The reason for self is very unnecessary. Miike's explanation is very interesting, and the series closes pretty nicely. <br /> <br /> Do not be as deep or advanced as DOA 2, is not unreasonable and intense as the DOA 1 ... though still another good movie.
