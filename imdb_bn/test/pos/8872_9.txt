I thought the interplay between Crystal and Davito was great. The movie is rather close to the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. Rumsey is unclear as "moma" and above, but very funny and effective. Why is the idea of ​​killing the mother of her character so dangerous for others? Now the wife of the Crystal - he is a "whore," whom everyone wants to receive his grace, thus its role, although small, although effective, because it will justify the ridiculous case of the "writer block" Crystal. Surely, the movie is not frustrating during the dark moments and, the playwright thinks that the novelists think that they also release the virtues. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is one of the most fun movies I remember, one that I do not remember watching several times.
