It was the second film of 1985, the other was 'Wedding Singer'. 'Wedding Singer' portrayed in the 80's Pop Park, 'Rock Star' all metals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> And Jennifer Aniston playing her girlfriend. When his stints reward him, his whole life changes in a day. <br /> <br /> The story is not very dramatic and it only scratches the life of a rock star. Sex and medicine are very limited in this movie, but it is full of rolling roll! Music is fantastic and the concert is brilliantly instructed! Completely concerted feelings are considered very well, because they do not use the actual audience (here no CGI). <br /> <br /> Great guide and amazing performance of Marquis Mark, who works like a real metal dude! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is all fun and if you have something to do with the old metal scene, you are going to like this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
