I've never seen Britain's most fun movie, "The Supergrass", the story of sex, drug, cream tea and sea-kill. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edson), Average Mornon, printed his so-called girlfriend Andrea (Don French) because he thinks he is the law-keeper. So, to accompany him for his romantic departure, he came up with a project that would probably affect him and persuade him to spend some time with him. The problem is, Dennis's lie is that he has been involved in the international narcotics ring in any way, and some policemen became increasingly proud of him while telling him. And so started this wicked movie, full of lusty comedy and strange humorous. Dennis is plagued by local calls and does not seem to be seen as much about the arrest of the arresting officers (all of Andr√©'s previous attempts were considered lie, "Stand Man Your Man" two officers'). Then comes the commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He made an agreement with Denis that if he helped catch the drug trafficker, he would be free and would be allowed to do whatever. Dennis agreed, and joined Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson), and Leslie Reynolds (Jennifer Sanders). The rest adds an immersive rib-ticking experience, adding ridiculous color to the film on the sergeant tray with Robi Coleton. His move with a druck dock against "Frankie Goss to Two Hollywood to Tribes" is fantastic and probably the best view of the film's history. Calling Dennis, two officers Michael Elphic and Patrick Darkin and Alexey Cale have performed wildly because the motorcycle police crying! If you want to see something on Saturday night, then I suggest you to rent it. You will not forget it!
