This is the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! I just love them !! I see it every day! I have episode on the internet! Here the 6th episode of Romania is being broadcasted! I'm happy that I have seen the show from the beginning and I'm glad that I can see 7 seasons through the internet. So far, season 5 is my favorite one: D I like it because logan is displayed and where they jump is my favorite. I also liked Dean, but Logan is good. I want to be with Lorelai Christopher, because he's beautiful. This show is good for all ages and is worth visiting. I really want a DVD but I think romania will never be seen here, because I think they do not even know their fans here. But, no matter what, I would see it. Goodbye !!
