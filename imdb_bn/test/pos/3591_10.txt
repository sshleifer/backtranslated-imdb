As a scuba diver, I can admire incredible body strains to get cameraman shots under water. This series is that much, though. The description is perfect, unlimited boundaries and topic enthralling issues. We quarreled with everyday struggles to live from the perspective of the locals. This DVD set is open to another planet on the right side of the Earth. I request everyone to see this series.
