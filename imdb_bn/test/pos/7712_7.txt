This is one of the paranormal stories spoken by animatics that does not relate to the fight of closing a glorious plot of direct movies, but it is displayed trinity by Kerry. It is a private detective that has been rented for big money to look for a hacker named Trinity. We look at his search which shows other PIs, only to fill it, who is crazy about his own experience trying to track Trinity. Eventually he contacted the Trinity, who has certainly described it as a man - in the story and something that firmly puts in our own perspective, even though we do not already know - a hacker in the chat room and solves a puzzle that forces him Catch a train early. He forgot his hat, but his loyal cat pushed him to a hilarious moment, so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> She meets with the train but the agents only attack; The agents tried to get him Trinity and try to free the PI which Trinity sent after, which he certainly does not know, and it is not explicitly mentioned in the animation, which is something common for the film Noa headlines. Most interesting back-stories, subplots, bikas etc. often indicate, but you do not even show the main story and the limited point to create extra air of mystery and conspiracy. <br /> <br /> In this short, almost everything is black and white, the music is silent and the memorable music of the offabat, the old fashionable yet the perfect detective title of a film Nir, the perfect hero. The quarterly section of this title in IMDB helps the title of Helpline with some title, it also lends a considerable amount of credit to a few, a mystery section for detective intelligence, gangster etc. Those who make challenging disputes easily and often. Animated studio operated by 4 Degrees Celsius and Shinchiro Vitanabe, it's a compelling version of the usual Matrix story.
