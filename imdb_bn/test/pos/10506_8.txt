This film will definitely not work well with anyone, because most of the fears are psychic. But it has a little something for almost everyone, including some of the really unexpected scenes with Alien. The film uses extramarital extortion extensively in mythological mythology, showing some intelligence about some aspects of abductional myths which you expect more than a movie. What did Jillian McQueetter have a great performance?
