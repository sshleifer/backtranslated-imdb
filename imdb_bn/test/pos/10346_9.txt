A sensational movie about a gifted woman who struggles with society and is a love that deliberately undermines her. Things are clearly restrained and timeless, because today in the Dutch society there are problems illustrated between men and women. This movie is a tribute to all modern women without living on feminism. The story is not well said, acting and scenes are also good.
