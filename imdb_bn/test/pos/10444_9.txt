I have said in another comment that this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal choices. To me, this movie is the best film of all time. Second breakfast club only. The last American virgin is probably the most honest teen movie all the time. It's intrinsic, and many people are an unknown movie. It comes to TBS once a year, but sometimes long. The first half of this movie is a sex comedy with some decent scenes. Then the second half is authentic honest, and the most serious time. With only a few comic scenes In my opinion it is always the best soundtrack. I never heard this great song in a movie before. There are 4 love songs in this movie which I think some songs of the best love in history. The movie is a pizza boy named Girl, who is a virgin. High friends who have a couple of high friends. Her two friends are teens sarved sexually. The first half of the movie is quite a lot of sexual misadventures. That's so funny. Gerry's new girl is the head of love. He later found out that his best friend was going with him. She cheats as well. You can feel a lot for this girl of love girl. You can think even more in the second half. Gary's friend turns out to be a creep. But his other friend is quite calm. The movie shows how humans can be. You can relate a lot to this movie The plot sounds like your typical teen sex comedy. But it's a lot more than that. This is a very honest movie. It's very 80ish which I love. If you have grown in the 80's or 80's, rent this movie. But there may be some people who do not like the 80 but still like this movie. I think I first saw this movie in 1987. It's very entertaining, and very fun. It combines very touching moments with very funny moments. It's an underlying gem! I have movies. I love it I'm the last American virgin *** *** 1/2 out ****
