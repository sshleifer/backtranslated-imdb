This movie does not remind me of 'eternal mind' eternal sunshine and 'Garden State' because of the content, because it is not about a movie other than a cellphone, or you've read it behind on DVD in the video store and "why not". Not saying that I was glad (like previous films) how good it was and how much I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The little knowledge of the movie is well-viewed and guided you only to monitor. If you know better than anyone else or someone else who has seen it - you want to talk about it !! This is a beautiful movie that you look forward to after seeing it with you. This is an intelligent watch that requires little effort to find some part for you. <br /> <br /> Just enjoy :)
