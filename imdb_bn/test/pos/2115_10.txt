This kind of movie I grew up. It's great family fun, love kids and parents too. I wanted more films like this. This is a wonderful story about a little boy who raises a finger to his mother and sister and shows all the way up to the national grand championship, where he wins! Then she is afraid that someone is going to Barbecue for her calf, so she snatches her home with her kidnapping. I was really excited when I saw this movie in the theater and was surprised to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this short film. The music was great in the name of a huge country like Vili Nelson and Dixie Chicks. Whoever does not enjoy this movie, has no children, or has never had a child.
