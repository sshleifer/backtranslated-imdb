This movie is a very popular and fun movie that I have watched for a long time. I think it's sympathetic as a housewife ("homemaker") and a fan (form). Dirk's anger blasts misinterpreth someone that is wrong in it. Kathy Bates is not really an actress I know but she is perfect, perfect for their role of throwing a whole. Julie Andrews kept me stitched After reading Rupert's auto-geography, I saw it, so his entry was even more fun. This is mostly going on. I'm not really a fan of the film's music, but you drag in romance and think you're singing for the day. This movie is more suitable to be available more widely. Our favorite scene is Dirk and a gun and its trouser, see it and see!
