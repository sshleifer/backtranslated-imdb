This movie is trustworthy to the Bruce's view, where it is wonderful; Where it exits from Burroughs, it's fantastic. This is a story of a family seeking a father by real and emotional orphanage. The most difficult lines in Lambert's films are called "He was my father!" The most foolish critics of the eyes are enough to bring tears. Not a perfect motion picture - The notorious over-dubbing of McDowell's voice of Glenn Close is very distraught and very understandable in terms of British error - but it's great to have great talent and Sir Ralph Richardson's extraordinary farewell.
