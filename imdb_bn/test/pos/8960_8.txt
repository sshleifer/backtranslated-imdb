Yes, there are many gay characters in this picture. It has direct letters, letters that are not sure about their sexuality, are searching for some truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie about sexual adaptation. It is the experience of loneliness and human difficulties often connecting with each other. Filically, the Denys Arcand cleverly balance the different dimensions of the relationship and the opposite, the continuous transfer relationship. The serial killer material is a little less successful (it seems to be the way of theatimally heavily-handed way, in contrast to wrapping multiple plot points and in contrast to other movies). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson came to the center of the film; It is a cool performance but handsome, arrogant outgoing behind, she is slowly afraid to take a fearful spirit showing love from people around her or taking it. Supporting Cast is strong, especially as friend of Mia Kishenner Gibson, a Dom-Rental with Progressive Energy. His role is more metaphorically than a literal obscurity --- At the same time weird innocent and unused, he represents the light and dark sex consciousness of characters. <br /> <br /> The image is involved and it is often amazed by the development of its character. The effect - like the Robert Oatman - suddenly strikes the impact of the David Mammt script --- does not shrink from some initial moments as well as some observational observations. Often, searching for our love and searching for a common "relationship", we ignore the love around us --- our friends, the families, who are able to see us like us. Archdott and author, Brad Fraser, has some visual observations in different ways by avoiding people and denying their loneliness in various ways and refusing to let us down in unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> A reward experience. This may not be for adults, who can not overcome the sexuality of some of the letters of the characters, can hopefully see the hope and hopeful message. Loneliness is a universal experience. Such a movie, which dares to explore the dark side of our life with a clever and revealing eye, worthy of Taj Mahal and an open psychoanalytic approach.
