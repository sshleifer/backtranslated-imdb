Interesting The best time to watch this movie is unhappy or sad. It's all just cute, all the white sari loves the queen secretly and ends up, even two young actresses from Gurda and Kaii get credit. This music is very beautiful. Both of us will always combine with the sad piano tones, giving some very sensitive results in some places, and if you see both parts together, they will see that Snow Quinn is not so bad. He simply tries to surround himself with love in the wrong way. In the evening this movie was (the first part) I just saw it, because I was bored, but later I loved a lot and was very angry when they did not show the next part due to the funeral of the Pope. Yes, it was very sad for me. But when they said it would be next week, I was very happy, I recorded it and now I'm glad to do it.
