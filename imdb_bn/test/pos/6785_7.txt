A wicked old girl gets her dream horse and ex-jockey-trained to participate in London's Grand National Stiplechase. A fine adaptation of classic children's books, with the performance started by Taylor as a nice, initial but humble young man. Rooney is right as her coach, though she has some overly melodramatic moments. Crisp and pretty good as Ravi Taylor's loving parents. Pictured in Technicolor, it looks beautiful. There are some elements that are in trouble, very interesting things will not happen, and it becomes very big. The race can be exciting but so much more.
