Willing to do what you want to do in the moment of despair. I liked how I used Maple Leves to be based on Bobby and Tessera. The acting is far more accurate than the hogwash of film industry. <br /> <br /> Great editing! At the end I felt that it was a bit incomplete but life is the hall and this movie and the art of Waltz was the best artwork of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two scenes that I must mention are: bath tub and sofa view. <br /> <br /> The couch scene for Tessa is a defined moment and 360 people's status In my childhood I saw him as barbaric, but now we see his true reality. His mind spoke before his heart. I would say more about the bath tub scene.
