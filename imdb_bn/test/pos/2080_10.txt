I've seen different Hamlets, and I've learned to play. As I look at Jacobi, I think he is like everybody like Hamlet, he is alive for his attention to the intelligence of this character. Each puzzle related to Hamlet's character, he is deeper than Salve. He illuminates the line after the line, the word after sound, shining the light in this fantastic mind. At the same time, we feel Hamlet's tremendous Hamlet treachery - much more than any other actor - because Jacob feels pain more than others. And we envy Hamlet's betrayal, because Jackberry is not afraid of fear of unemployment that can reduce Hamlet. In short, Jackberry provides Hamlet to us completely, and Hamlet is the greatest character in the whole literature. That's why I'm pleased that Jackby Hamlet is one of the best actors I've seen by an actor.
