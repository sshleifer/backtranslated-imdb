This is a nice movie, but Momento (big budget movie of Nolaan) is very good. I would suggest people to see Momento and then if they like it then check out this movie. This image was shot in black and white, which I was a little nervous at first, but once you realize that black and white are the best way to see the film. It is very handy and easy to understand, but it is very shiny. I think the elements of the storyline are a little cool, but the film must be second to the philosophy. The film's shiny fascinating plot, shiny twists and turns, keeping up with a very good acting and movie budget, is not to say that it's pretty cool.
