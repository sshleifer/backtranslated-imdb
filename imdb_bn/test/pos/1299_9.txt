I was ready to like this movie, and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing for my fear. It starts with high school gang off squaring against each other including bad Kung-Fu. A scenario found in countless other Korean movies. Ho-hum gun The story was written by the same person who wrote "Hugh Voss Will" (which was rarely portable) and, well, I thought I was for 2 hours aesthetics. <br /> <br /> Do not give up so soon! "A romance of the year" was conducted by T-gyon Kim, who was "Willing Hi" (which I thought was a fun load). However, "their own romance" soon takes a turn for the very best. High school girl, just moved to Seoul, she finds herself in the middle of the attention from two possible suitors. Every person has his own qualifications, and it is not clear what (if any) is the right choice. <br /> <br /> Your normal teen love does not follow the triangle. Emotions are complex, and when you do not agree with certain choices or activities like movie development, you must understand why the characters make them. <br /> <br /> The movie asks the characters and audience questions. Who chooses one? Is any point even forced to make a choice (and is it one unfair if it seems to be being strung together?)? When you (or your heart) have a choice, how do you respond (and how to react)? When new information comes, is there a new light on the situation? There is a scene in the end, it is very subtle but perfectly holds that I think it will be a real-life response rather than the leading "movie response". Subtlety is a character in the scene background. Recent incidents and verses have misled him and impelled him emotionally. Basically, he did not know to make things. Instead of doing some "work" of them, or look at all the Gap-muthed demos, they are unable to respond or say anything at certain points. It's just like someone pulled her plug in. His response was true to me and I praised the scene. <br /> <br /> Like most Korean movies, there is a mix of action, brevador, slapstick and melodram. Korean films often turn out to be astonishing (see, "Ling Zero" for a great example), which may be astonishingly unpredictable. Go ahead and start yourself with this one. Like it, love or hate, I think most visitors will be able to relate to the response and feedback of the characters and be able to appreciate.
