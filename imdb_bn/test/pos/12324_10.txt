A stylish adaptation of the whole movie, "The Durbinars" of Joaus, is held on January 6 (Epiphany), the night of 1906. Most of the films are three spinsters (the annual party given by two sisters and their nephews), where a group of high-class Dublin teams gather in music, text and dinner. If there are very small plots per second, the interaction between the groups and the dialogue reveals about Dublin in the early 20th century when the independence movement begins. Actor, all genius Irish stage actors Angela Houston is universally surprising, except for the exception, and one actually thinks that she has herself tamed. The furious final scene between Miss Haston and the amazing Donald McCann reveals a lot about character marriage. There is mixed with humor and insight, and those who like quiet, thoughtful movies, "dead" for them are highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we make an occasion to watch this wonderful movie every six January. After many visions it fails to move me, and every time I collect something that I missed before.
