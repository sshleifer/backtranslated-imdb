I have hoped to see normal British stiff upper lip stereotypes and were surprised by the wonderful natural dialogue and black humor. We go to the sea more than the eastenders, which we serve. Expedition time and attack scenes are a battle ship image and stuff up in the company of the ship and Benter is significantly realistic. (Based on my service at least in the 1970's). Some throwing lines are very malicious ("I am not just joining the hand band for a little more comfortable fish freer!). My only complaint is that they did not show what happened to Irish Coxsawane and his bride, or tattoo Poe and his" I love Amella "tattoo!
