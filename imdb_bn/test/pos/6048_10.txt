DD may seem a little hockey by today's standard. The Lee Emir version is more accurate. In 1964, I graduated boot camp in Paris Island, SC. Jim Moore was close to the original thing to be kept on screen in 1957. I can not comment on this plot, but I think the last time for the MCRDT was unreal. PVT Oven is like many people who face a lot of difficult situations for them. He joined Marine Corps for many reasons. My drill instructors were more like TSGT Jim Moore, like GSST Hartman. More DI more Korean era and full metal jacket more Vietnam era Today's movie permits that sort of thing on the screen. I have my collection de di. I recently found it in DVD.
