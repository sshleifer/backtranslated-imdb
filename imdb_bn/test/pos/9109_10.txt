Calling all the disciple! Hold your friends, hit the theater and see the hell out of this movie. After the credit from the surplus sequence you will smile at your self. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wild journey through D history, and what they did is not just a list of calves but their chronic power generation. I'm a huge fan of angry cage (Kyle Gass) and Jebel (Jack Black), so naturally I like the movie. <br /> <br /> This helps them know about their shows and their first CD, but it's not funny but it's fun. Smiling and abusive, rock rhyme, smoking in plenty of smoking, and chemistry, down from the whole madness of the story line, it is a similar film for de-syllops and newcomers. <br /> <br /> Most of their songs have been referenced, such as two princesses, festivals, and Kimbalbas, they have many audio tracks such as Coke Push-compromise, every fan of the audience says that I remember as well as the new story saying, "It's a sunny! " I highly recommend this movie to any body that rocked ever since. This movie is certainly in high competition to be the "Spinner Tap". The best one ever.
