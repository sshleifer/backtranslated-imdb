In front of the greatest tragedy man, he is often able to divine, he settles for inactivity. This fact appears to be such a great tragedy. Venice Death is one of only a few films, with the patience and courage to deal with this fact. It is confronted by the individual denial of human eyes as the most spontaneous human and the beauty and inspiration of the corrosion. It is undoubtedly the greatest film to have any intelligent impact in mainstream movies. Its firmly refurbished appearance, the echoey word, the mix of unsubtitled language, and impossible to copy the highly challenging theme: An accident as its extraordinary production as its director's vision. Central performances, once harsh, stimulating and weaknesses in expression and frustration, is not bogard as the best British actor of his generation, but of course the most courageous. Despite his constant close-ups and mahler, his wishes enabled him to make his eyes even more attractive, and Friday night is not the only one with your girlfriend, but if you want to restrict human spiritual limitations, of course it is fine.
