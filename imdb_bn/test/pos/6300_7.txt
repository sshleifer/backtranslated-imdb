The movie has really been made a good, which is awesome and guided and encouraged. You can think on each shot and think perfection is executed. This is especially a great watch for lovers of the movie and they should especially be able to appreciate its beauty and the passion of the movie in it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> < It's not really a drama, it's not really an adventurer and it's not really a comedy. Instead of a movie with its own style, that thing makes its own way. It certainly does not comply with the rules of the movies, and it gives the characteristics of different elements of different elements in different ways. <br /> <br /> But the film is a bit slow and annoying as the main character. The artistic style of instruction tries to conceal that it is really quite easy and the film is entirely dependent on the entire atmosphere created by the film. It does not make the movie awesome or nothing, but it only prevents one from being truly real-looking. In some parts the film seems like it is trying to be very poetic and the images try to talk too much for themselves. It only feels a bit overdone in parts, though it still works nicely for most parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> It has some great camera-work and some unique stories that are a great movie to watch as it's a real one. <br /> <br /> 7/10
