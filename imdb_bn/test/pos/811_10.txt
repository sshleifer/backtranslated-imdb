I first saw this movie in the early 90's and immediately fell in love with it. Richard Benjamin and his wife Paul made the film "Saturday 14th" in 1983, before filming it in 1983. I think they work quite well. Together This movie has given me a smile several times. It is also a young Molly Ringwald, who will later go to the movies like pink and solo candles in the late 1980's. It's fun to see her youngest. Many people have not seen. I have never heard of the average movie fan of this movie. But when I first met I was happy. I gave this picture 10 stars out of 10, and it seems like it's a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. Especially I do not want to make it available on DVD, so I picked up a VHS copy in eBay, so if you are interested, you probably will see it there. My $ 20- $ 30 dollar range but my mind was for $ 12. I hope they finally release it in DVD.
