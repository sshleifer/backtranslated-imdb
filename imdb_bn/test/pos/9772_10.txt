I have never sat for six hours directly from Minionia, but Chang has changed it. I'm not going to lie, I know some Australian fleets may be unfortunate and annoying (actually, I like most of the Aussie flicks but maybe I favor) but Changi is completely different. Though not historically correct, but reminding us constantly, the show adds a nice script and humor to the delightful and emotional perception of life in WWII's POW camp. <br /> <br /> Remember that the show was not supposed to be a documentary, so a real error would not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> This series reveals the publication of creative writing like John Doyle (Ur Rai Slewen), who is better known for his comedic elsewhere, and a wonderful director and actor to completely move this creativity together. If you want to see how hard you work in this series, go to the official website, it is really interesting and you will learn a lot about Changi's true account. <br /> <br /> If you do not see Pranjali yet, make sure you are not doing anything for the whole day because you want to see the series completely.
