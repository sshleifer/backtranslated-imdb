Style on the substance. But it's what a style is "The Cell" is the internal version of the most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story apparently supports visuals. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist Catherine Dain (Je-Lo) artificially helps her patients to dream and help them with their swelling and emotions. A new patient who falls into its coma, the FBI brings her attention. She is a serial killer who drowns her female victims then poses her body in diverse situations like mannequins. To find out and save his latest victim, Den's murderer will have to enter the mind and navigate through his ill-concepts. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsham Singh has this extraordinary aspect and pieces of this product have pieces. Each dream sequence is a nightmare-like painting motion, from costume to clothing. <br /> <br /> But this plot suffers due to lack of plot history. Sturger is the only person with a thorough background and the last person you want to take care of. Apart from him, you are basically a movie that comes at the present moment, which is so visually stunning and truly scary as shameful to the movie. Lopez is lost, but no matter what the actress she is, though she is as fantastic as before. And Vince Von? I do not even know why he was elected. This is not his force and he overtes the boots. He tried very hard to become his character and showed it. Comedy takes, Vince! Yet, this movie is so scary, I still see this film with lights and can not sleep later.
