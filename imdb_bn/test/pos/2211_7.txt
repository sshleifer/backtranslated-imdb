We have a character named Evil. Evey just wants to be a good person. She is excellent, friendly, often laughing, but curiously brutally honest. EVA also has a secret. His stupid intelligent sister is reading the original poem, which encourages the community to write the sister. Unfortunately, it's Evey's poem When their mother begins to be happy again and the boy later shows her interest in Ivy, Ivy just wants to do what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What should you remember when watching this movie? The EV is really. For such a cruel person who does not respect the Ivy League type, he does not think that it would be impossible to say that he would lie. For someone so happy and happy, when certain issues come to him he is quite emotional. Those who do not have the character's flaws, they develop the plot, and their meaning is far more than that. <br /> <br /> It's mostly like a melodrama: a character is false, the exposure to other character's personality is rooted in the relationship as they grow through the drama. But on condition of writing it is very fresh and bold. Acting helps to write very well (perhaps a fool's intelligent sister might have played better), and a real pleasure to see it <br /> <br /> Instructions and cinematography are not quite good. They are acceptable, and the earth of Evie becomes clean in color and light, which creates some very beautiful images, but it is not very consistent. This is not really flawed due to low production costs, but there is genuine care for some actual stories and characters in the same quality. So although it's not a perfect movie, it's certainly an enjoyable one. <br /> <br /> - Pollis DIB
