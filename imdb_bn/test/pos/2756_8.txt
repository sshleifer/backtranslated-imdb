This is a "revised" rewandance presentation, which was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. In the middle of the '90's ("Reversion" and "The Lord of Dons") three Irish "dance" songs that I saw, I liked it best. <br /> <br /> I It was better than the original held in Dublin in Ireland, because it has added much more parts better, it has a more diverse and colorful setting and it has separated from two not good at the beginning. This is a very difficult show with just a few weak spots. To be sure, there are some songs / dances which are just "fair" but none is poor, which is considered to be 20 numbers, all of which are amazing. <br /> <br /> Replacement as the first reversal of Colin Dunne featured as the main exception to Michael Flatley's dancer. Both are extremely talented. There can be a slight difference with Dane, a black-haired flute clean-up blonde blonde. Flatley's ego is so big because she liked Dunne she repeatedly gets annoying. Ladies Leader, Jean Butler, thanks, is still great and great to see: what a beautiful beauty and talent! Butlar and the rest of the women have the biggest legs seen on dancers. I am Maria Paeses, Spanish Flamenco performance, and two of Daniel B. Watten and Ivan Thomas enjoyed the dance. Number one - Dunne and two other dancers who are called "trading tap" with two pairing off against and awesome to watch, probably the highlight of the whole show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And praising the audience not getting into the audience's way by playing the role of "Lord of the Dance" with Chitker.
