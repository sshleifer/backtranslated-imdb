Delight could not possibly be the first black exploit, but it is certainly one of the best. It is an important film in the case of black explosion, in which it is a dramatic move among filmmakers. This was not necessarily a harmful film on black culture, and it was not a fight to overcome important issues or more important things like racism, but it was a "foggy" fu! It was a guilty pleasure, great fun and best to see it with friends. (10 out of 10)
