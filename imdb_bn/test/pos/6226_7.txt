Tourist Trap (1979) An entertaining horror movie from the late 70's, this film is about a bunch of young friends who are traded in an old desert museum in an old desert. The museum owner of <br /> <br /> looks like a strange but ruthless old man, but what happens when the group of young members are responsible for the murder, is it the old man sluice or is it the collection of frustrating people? Looks alive and hungry for blood !!!! This picture was a good thing, it was quick, it was very good from the actress / actresses (Tania Roberts was very sexy) and the film was never boring and I said it had some vague scenes, so be prepared to hide under cover! Of course the horror movie / ghost story fans recommend! I am a very reputable 7.2 out of 10 of this image.
