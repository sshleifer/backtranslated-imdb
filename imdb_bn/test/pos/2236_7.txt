This was a pretty good movie which was fairly good. The idea about Mercy (not to be robbed) was original. I think Angelina has done a good job as one of her first movies. Some of the things I jumped over were some strong battle scenes (not both will spoil). I liked the first movie and I liked this one as well. 7/10
