Murali K. Thalaluri's strong debut film, which explores the life-story of a group of high school students, each of them together or in any other crisis. The film begins with the advent of the body of the students, then marks the life of the group for the last hours, keeping the list hidden until the last minute as the identity of the dead. The main character is facing each major stress which we can see as a precipitating suicide. Unknown throwing power and passion to provide full performance. Beautifully completed, especially the author / director of the 19-year-old writer / young man when he wrote the script.
