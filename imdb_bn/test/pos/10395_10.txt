I was surprised by this picture. Nonetheless, I did not want to see a movie for a long time - it would be so annoying to compare any other film. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Anthonyone may be the worst for many - a very slow, current story line, microscopic examination of human emotions and interaction - and the worst Wenders-verbose, confusionism. It is made up of the Lesser Unique Powers related to Weeders's general missile hero's stream of sensation, so it does not create a temporary confusion of aspiring cinema. <br /> <br /> The worst for fans is the sketching of a single poetic image stretched across the best and disheveled story line film. Wenders and Antononii created a lecture in their segment of people who finds the heart of things. <br /> <br />
