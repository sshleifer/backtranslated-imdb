A dramatic producer of a domestic house, his secretary, and playwright blinds stuck in a way to hear a new sport in their way home. They put their way to a nearby home, ending only at the fianc√©'s fiancee house. If you can not guess that killing and greatness are happening then you are not paying attention. <br /> <br /> This is a good entry to the old dark house. It does not just have a good mystery, you have some very interesting one liners to float through it. Cast is excellent across the board and they are more than willing to get a good time with the good material. <br /> <br /> I want to say it was one of the best quality, it should have been, but something happened to me that dropped me down from ten to seven. I can not tell you it, whatever for specific Perhaps in the sense that I knew it was going from the very beginning, or maybe it was something else, I'm not sure, but there was something I could not shake which made me like this movie even if I wanted to love it. . It just does not want to be great and fall short in any way. <br /> <br /> That said I recommend you see it. After a very bad movie, it is completely entertaining, despite its completely destroyed.
