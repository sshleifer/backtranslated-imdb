If you like the drive-in choice in the early 70's, you just love it. How can you make mistakes with less budget films about bloodshed in a harmful place? You can not! Crazy folks and sharp objects are always a recreational combination <br /> <br /> It seems that some of them were shot for 320.65 dollars inside the house. The only fun to see such things for me is advertising. Compared to other than such a cow, it is enough to keep a little lighter, but bloody sick (like yourself) to keep happy. Some horror films can pull in parts and wait for some to happen. This is not the case here. To make the characters absolutely enjoyable, there is enough entertainment to entertain. A dull moment starting from the beginning never ends. The smell of mind which ends is incredible. I liked it so much that after the last achievement I saw it a second time. It will look for a horrible drive inside a selfish drive. <br /> <br /> 9 .5 / 10 Drive-in-Freak-o-meter ... Need to see ... <br /> <br /> Yes, I love you ... I love you ... now Take your Thorigin and return your clothes ... please ... 8)
