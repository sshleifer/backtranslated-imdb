If you are a science fiction fan, and you only watched this movie once, please go and treat yourself for your second visit. I did it, and I was thinking how good I loved the film, when I first saw it three years ago. I was impressed with this film for the first time by astronomers, but in most cases I do not fully think about this movie. It was an alien rip off, and I thought the description of the monsters is an incident of really bad science. There was something found particularly ridiculous in the light allergies they had. Based on my first observation, I recently rated this movie 5 ratings. However, now the Cryikics of Redirect is going on, and for that the movie poster looks amazing, I thought I would brush on the pitch black once more, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I'm so happy i I think so much so that I remembered the first philosophy which was a strange mistake. I think most of the characters have died in the movie very soon. This was not so. I'm going to die Claudia Black's character first. This was not so. I thought that Readic was the only survivor. This was not so. <br /> <br /> I can see now that the movie is * very * good. There is an excessive, tedious focus on the monsters. This is a human drama much more. Able to play original characters and some strong ones. And the pitch black universe has very small and definite descriptions of the universe, such as the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet and the asteroids have eaten everything on the planet and they are on each other. <br /> <br /> And I have to mention the astronomical vistas again. I mean, we start to see the spaceship passing through the tail of a comet, with the spacedust zapping bit through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three sunshine. Shipwrecked people think they are getting dark, a blue sun rises in the opposite horizon and everything moves in blue light. While moving forward to the realm of land, we saw huge, neighboring, lengthy gases across the sky and in the final scene of the film, we saw the ship surrounded by one side of this color. This scene has been created with beauty, surprise and detail ideas and I do not think I saw any other SF movie which really made a point that included these things. I hope we can see more of this series. <br /> <br /> Peach Black now receives 9 out of 10 ratings from me. A genius classic? You bet !!
