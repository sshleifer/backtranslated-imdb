"Step-by-step," my opinion, hit a pure ABC! I can not remember every episode, but I still enjoy it. It is hard to say that any episode was my favorite. However, it was always funny when I happened to have an accident at school. I always smile that. Actually, I think J. (Brandon Call) and Cody's (Sasha Mitchell) line were funny. It was nice if Penny (Patrika Darbo) had a show across her entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope this does not stop syndication airings.
