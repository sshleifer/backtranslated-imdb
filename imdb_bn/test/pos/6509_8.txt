- The whole soundtrack in this movie is quite beautiful. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and grab it in the house. Director Doug Prayer is never seen in this documentary, or I do not think he even heard, but he focused very closely in the life and history of "the mixer". He divided his film into about eight chapters and the motley group of his enthusiastic interviews will be spiced on the basis of what he is saying. I have never been big at "scratching", but the film's experts who do know a little, do a great job to do basic work in the film for basic development. Mix Master Mike is from the Boston Boys, but after this film I could not name many heavy heaters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Que-Burts, etc.). The extreme charm for turntables by these talented and quirky DJs is clear in their interpretation of their music means their meaning. The film also provided some delightful shades of light to classify these boys (and a woman) as musicians. Prayer does not disable its film and it is rarely reinforced by closing music sometime when a slow scene is present. If nothing else, this film will increase your slang's vocabulary. I'll get back to "dig", so I'll finish this review. See it, it will be of interest. Good things people Good thing
