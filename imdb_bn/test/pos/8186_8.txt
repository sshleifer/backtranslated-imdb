Without the flaws and deficiencies mentioned by other viewers, I must say that it seems to be about me a movie of power, which I think is the most touching delusion. I saw an emperor and man's drama. It seems to me that the director wanted to ask questions about what the country would gain and what the value of "happiness" was for. For the sake of forced support and support for "happiness"? How much can be slaughtered for security and peaceful existence of the country? Do the power of the empire mean that thousands of people have to pay the price of the grief and murder? It seems to me that the Emperor himself does not know the answer and learn to learn it during filming. He was severely disconnected in these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true source. He hates his father and his people to give up his father and his love, half of the people want to love as a good emperor. His actions are disputed and the passions are not confused. It seems that the movie is a success like another film presented in the human power issue on other people.
