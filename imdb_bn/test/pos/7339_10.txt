Everyone working in this movie did an Amazing job. This is one of the best lesbian movies I have seen in the long run. Acting, writing, cinematography, music, visual, everything was top notch. As a bright fan of the genre (both lesbian movies and gymnastics), I was so incredibly pleased with this movie. It really gave me a lot more than expected across the board. It was very good to hear the question and answer with the cast and crew, the lead actress had so much positive power and so gentle and kind, it is a satisfying thing, that can be talented and does not really show what is important. And the author did a job of a hell, as well as the direction and execution was extraordinary. Many thanks for making a great film! Thanks for the line, 'If you are going to put a label on yourself, then it will be bisexual.' I've been so tired of movies where letters related to both sexes are gay or closed directly, recognizing both as part of homosexuality and being part of the gay community is wonderful, and the labels were not good and even all of this photo was needed. What is the end! Only when I could not give it to me more, it did. Nice work and all my applauds. I'll spread the word, this certainly will not miss a film!
