Rigoletto is excited to cast for this production. Edita Groubova sings the guild nicely and emotionally. Luciano Pavarotti also sings fantastic Magdalen Fine Salargar! Fedora Barbery is a famous old singer who sings Govvana. Wiki is singing Marulo; Wixel both Rigoletto and Monterone songs. As Riglette, Wixel is perhaps the most convincing actor of this hard-to-beat pair of eloquent singers. Kathleen Kuhlman in Contaea. All the principals are well-known and world famous. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting Rigoletto apparently musically as well as musically. <br /> <br /> I have it both laser disc and DVD. You should have it too!
