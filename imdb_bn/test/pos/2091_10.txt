When there was a bomb, a parent, a horse, and a crazy biker, with several other forms of social scams, they had enough sleep **, they looked for a rats spot and holes. 9 Escaping from the group of souls, taking their heads for new found freedom and civilization. What is soon followed is not surprising. Full empathy and terror follow them awake. It seems that there are some incomplete businesses for everyone to care for. <br/> <br/> Based on the Great Account, 9 SOULs are among the top five best films of this year. About 9 hours running 9 hours in SOULS will provide a story so powerful that it literally will give you breath. The use of beautiful, yet subtle, rotating countries, adds the expected reality to this story. The view of director Toshakii Tioda (Blue Spring, Paras Star) seems completely appealing because he has felt compassion towards the characters. As soon as each character grasps their dreams, it's as fast as it torn from them. Now, all the responsibilities of the success of this film do not fall on the shoulders, but the actors must act. This picture was full of excellent acting from top to bottom. Raihi Matsuda (son of Audiocion Miyuki Matsuda) provides a wonderful performance and some of her mother brings a screen on her screen. <br /> <br /> I have to do props in artgagic DVD. I saw them now this 6th film, and they seem to get good and good for each DVD. Sound quality is perfect and pictures; Clean and crisp This is a very annoying movie scene that moves very dark, so Theres cat disks are beautiful. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on 9 people in 2005; It's really amazing film to see.
