Our best actor Peter O'Brien is superb as a preserved school master dedicated to a young school teacher. She met a show girl and fell in love. One of the stories is love and devotion. Petula Clark notifies an extraordinary voice, adding to the spirit and sensitivity. The end may not be happy, but you will enjoy this movie. I enjoyed it.
