I highly enjoyed this picture. I'm really into films where women can make a lot of butt, so I had some hope for some of this film's entertainment. My hopes were fulfilled and the film had to exceed 20 minutes. Action, Humor, and Wisdom This photo is easily made into one of my favorite movies. Sam Jackson and his expected screen were in attendance, as I have never seen before, wanting your respect and I can not accept it if I want to. Samanta Kain, who is hungry to remember something about her past, but realizes that as soon as possible, the more she wants to forget, and until the end Samantha is so much and Charlie wants to know as much as she is. But now, Charlie and Sam, two completely different women, could probably be in the same body? We have characters that are played outside and outside of the film, along with Sam / Charlie, Sam Jackson and Craig Bearer as well as each side. Craig Timothy is also a great, no infamous sexy bad guy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is fully described and played perfectly, above and amazingly entertaining. And when you see it happen impossible to appreciate it. So value your time. See it, you will not be sorry.
