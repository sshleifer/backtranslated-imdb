While on holiday in North Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodrario) and her younger sister Lee (Mayv Dermady) decided to take a tour of Blackwater Barry to swim for fishing. Their guide Jim (Ben Oxenballold) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourists along the river in a distant place. When they stopped, they were attacked by a huge crocodile that cut their boat and killed Jim immediately. Three survive a tree climbing and when they realize that help will never come to their rescue, they decide to try to find their place of refuge. However, in the dirty waters, their boat exploded and the crocodile gave the triangle a wings under three people. <br /> <br /> "Black Water" is based on a mythical, realistic and dramatic low-budget movie and with a careful start, a true story. The famous Diana Glen, Mew Darmdie and Andy Rodorida give the credibility of this awesome but scary story. There are many similarities between this movie and "Priy", but in different environments. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo Profundo" ("Deep Fear")
