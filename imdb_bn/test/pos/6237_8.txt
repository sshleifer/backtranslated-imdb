Some movies have spread far, but the tourism trappers prevented the timing exams and preferred them as well as the creators. Although not entirely original - it has a lot of money in Texas Chess genocide, it's a humorous, genuine unclear moment, a great score from Pinocchio Donig√≠jo and its own with Chuck Connors and Cast's fun performances. Do not let the PG rating keep you away, this film proves that unwanted pregnancies and nudity are not needed in every scary movie. These elements are usually used to cover a film thriller. Here, scares are merited and effective. Plus, only Chuck Cones can carry a scene where she has to share the soup with a manneine! Actually a classic scene.
