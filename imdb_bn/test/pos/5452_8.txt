TV movies generally do not get recognition or credits like big movies - and this is usually good reasons, but the 1996 HBO film The Light Shift is one of the best TV movies. Based on Bill Carter's publisher book, The Lett Ship is operating at NBC's last night talk show Hosts David Letterman and J Leno, when it comes to meeting Carson's single zero today's seat. We can see what happened in front of the camera - writer Bill Carter, director Batty Thomas, and HBO shows us what happened when the camera stopped. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately we can not really confirm what we know when it came time to replace Karlson Karter with Letterman or Leno - but The Lett shift gives us an interesting potential reality. Just as a very well made movie, The Lett ShipTitte also works well for portraying both sides equally - even if you think that the film looks like Letterman and Leno's son are very nice; Especially Lenno, who feels a little more satisfied. <br /> <br /> performance is very good. In the performance of the very best Golden Globe wins, Kathy Bethes starred Lenny's highly motivated director Helen Kushnik, according to Carter and book / film, there was a real problem for studio and Leni (the actual fancier is actually favorable to Bill Carter for the rebellion on this photo!). John Michael Higgins gets a small quirky comedy part and breaks out his usual gigs and gives an excellent performance as David Letterman - Letterman offers a nice impression but created a dimensional and relatable character. Daniel Robeck has performed well like Leno, but it does not measure in other movie titles - perhaps the best anyone can do in a robe, it only shows Hammy when someone tries to make a leheno or screenplay. . Bob Balaban (Warren Littlefield in a collision), Treat Williams (a magician-like Michael Owitz), and Ed Begolly Jr. (a great Rod Perth) also gave a memorable supporting role. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies I have ever seen is the one made for TV. I think nobody looks at David Letterman or J Lenny, but late shifts might not be for them, but it's an interesting movie to reach the politics of the night - which has recently revived its ugly head with 2009 - 10 Canaan / Leno / NBC repression .
