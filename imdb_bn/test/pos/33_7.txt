A play through and through Lackawanna Blues. It gives details about the life of a powerful woman named Rachel Crossbie (S.Epatha Markerson). Rachel is referred to as Nani by the person who knows him, but he can easily become known as the Wonder Woman. He epitomized power, power, confidence and solutions. He was a home-holder who lived for the people he rejected in the society. His tenants consisted of a homosexual, a psychiatrist war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other hosts, which are common to home miles away from the ordinary. Each series of events took Rachel stride and managed to shamelessly. He was not a dictator without compassion, but in fact he was quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film did not even deviate from Rachel. Of course there were dramatic moments but they were expected. There was no other kind of shock or deeper than Rachel.
