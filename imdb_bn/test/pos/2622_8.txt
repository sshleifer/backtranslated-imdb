I have seen this episode many times because Pru did not die. That was. Pru, Piper, and Phoebe are innocent of them, try and save a doctor, because Shack wants to kill him. When Piper and Piper saved their innocent, they went upstairs to see Shadows' book on the foam. Foeb is still looking up, so Shakes throw a power ball to the doctor, but Pru pushes him from the road and Pru hit his chest and hit the wall like a piper. So the phoebe comes downwards and is spelled, because it said only phoebe and the strength of the three shack was not only injured. Fessbos tells Leo to cure piper and prue. So Leo is cured of them. Probe and Piper were looking for shadows on the road. While shaker and pipe used his power to see Piper and Pru, while a new reporter got it taped. So new about three powerful hiloywell sisters, Phoebe does not know anything, because he is still under-under. Halliwell has all the repoters and people in the house. Then came a smoker home and said, "Can I be part of your Coven?" And Pru says, "No, it's coming out of our house!" And using his power to throw out his pru. The man who came out of the house crying crying, "Mitt Witch's there". The crazy shoots so crazy that he shoots right piper through the stomach. Pru will go to the hospital and enter the tray, but people will not give up, so Pru uses his power to take people out of the way, to kill people more. They went to the hospital but Piper did not make it. Meanwhile, there are underworlds in the phoebe. It is known that Phoeb has come out, so Phoebe asked to ask if he can reverse the time. He said, if he promised to stay in the underworld, he would only give the opposite time, so Cole told Phoeb what the source told him. Phoebe said, "Will he think I'll make such a deal?" And then Cole said, "So you can save your sisters' lives." Leo seems to be dead as well as being in the hospital, so he told Phobbe that he is true. Then the phoebo agreed to stay only if the co-publisher and Piper's death went back to private. Pru reaches the SHATs back to the hospital, but before the time, the second time came back again after observing the doctor, but this time Phoebe was not there to call on Leo to help Pru and Piper, so the doctor got to throw a wall. The doctor died and Pru did so. But I did not even get to throw Piper wall, but Pru dies? Why did not they show Leo and try to cure Piper and Leo Prue? If you know the answer, please email me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS I miss Prue, but I like the poodle and I am glad that the show continued
