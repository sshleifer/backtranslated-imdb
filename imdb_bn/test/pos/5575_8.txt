Remember to ignore the TV series for the first time because of his 'appearance' with Jim Hensen Muppets. However, recently a friend let me borrow his Farsi DVD, and I now realize that this is a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> There are episodes that are enlightened with any TV series and those who do not. I travel around Adrenaline and mental races during the great episode and enjoys among the needy. However, regardless of the context relating to all episodes regardless of the original story, regardless of it. What I'm talking about is the main characters and increasing their love for each other. Let me warn you, this is something that is completely inevitable to look. I can not remember any other TV series (Babylon 5, Bappy, Angel etc.) that smart and smartly combined such a hearty (occasionally) and suspicious ride. <br /> <br /> I think that at the end of the fourth season, things are finally becoming increasingly attentive and I'm surprised by the decision to cancel the series. I wait anxiously for the release of miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem.
