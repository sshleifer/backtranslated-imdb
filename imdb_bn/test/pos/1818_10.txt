20 years later and this movie still has floating echoes around its floating. Never a movie Valley Girl exclaimed incredible soundtracks. This film has a perfect degree of 80 that it can be realized many years later. Nicholas Cage is his best. A movie that has so many characters in it, helps you to understand how sad Hollywood has (as much as it does). The special edition DVD is loaded in excess quantities and it will be supplied with plenty of material to you as it is desirable to purchase it. To make sure.
