For a long time I have seen one of the best movies, specific in his view, and its looks are beautiful and very fantastic. I can not say much without it, and I do not really recommend reading this much before watching this movie - just look at it. <br /> <br /> But Ah, the text line for a review written in ten IMDBs. Puzzles. what can I do? Tell me about the film? No It can not do I think I enjoyed this movie because it was not seen without any idea. <br /> <br /> I said, this can be done: acting is wonderful and different, and what I love for foreign movies is that films are not about movies, nor bigger ones.
