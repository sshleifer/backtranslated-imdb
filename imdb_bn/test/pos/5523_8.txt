Oh, what a small movie! Wayne Crowford strikes again, or was it his first big strike, the mental power of Manik Church masquerading as a psychoactive little ball a psycho killer film It's a mockery of a ** brighter ** flyover country post-Hippie American culture, though the film was originally portrayed in Miami independently. This is the kind of studio-based convention or plot device I can think of, which I can remember: A little bit of Antartha Dadaamful Things may not be a technically elitist film, but it is a wonderful little piece of American that is cheap, ambitious, fantastic And the ball was made out of steel. It was frustrating, nervous and impressive to create this film, which is amazingly timed. This movie is fresh, vital, alive, unforgettable, and ridiculously weird, since it is enough to recommend someone with the sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I dug in the last year when I was fascinated by "star" Wayne Crowford (here's nicknamed Bill under Lawrence Lawrence), which is the only regional film production, commonly known as B grade varieties . He is a writer, producer, director, and actor, probably known for the best of the 80's evil mysterious favorite night. Here he is actually a homosexual spree killer on Lam after opening some old lady in Baltimore for his jewelry, really wearing a few incredible characters wearing pants, Stanley's game. Unsung screen legend Abe Zwick is completely convinced that Stanley's Anne Martha, as Stanley's Aunt Martha, who thought she was afraid of Stanley, was falsely assassinated to ensure her honesty. Martha, as the singer of Pakyikik's South African women's coconut bikini, looks like a woman like the top sailors, but some do not think - do they? - She thinks that she has no visible way of earning her income, to spend all day annoying about where Stanley is, and to carry a Butcher's knife seems to be scurries around in her bathrobe. Only in the United States ... <br /> <br /> After opening the film, only two of them arrived in Florida and set home as a home-made and designed television home like Word Clive's old home. To be surreal as fabulous. During a memorable scene, Martha and the guest of the unexpected home sit in the bedroom's couch, conversation and drinking cans, which I have never seen outside of John Waters' film, is one of the most tragic, confusing common sequences. Then Stanley is always facing the problem because he has made the leading hippie with an STP patch on his bag with Hippies, who runs a satellary painted van which is fine like a batmobile, drinks his milk directly from the drive, blonde bombard snops drugs with bibbons, and a quick snack Hoards of old cigar boxes donuts <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, the uncertainly outcome that hurt him out After tearing the bodies, a dirty junky blackmail, using their home as their flop, becomes Stanley's birthday cake squad, and all reach the local pizza store shop before leaving the property behind the Hookah Hash Party. Girls dance in their undergarments. When one of the neighbors exits while being very sticky with mortar, they naturally invite themselves to chat very well when naturally people like to keep hammer in length. And it is such a woman who not only carry a slaughter knife but a load .38 on her slip. Ultimately, weird people are not stuck with their bodies, a child, and a place to go and end up taking shelter in a abandoned movie studio, where there is no doubt that tech crew lends equipment used to make film. I hope they humbly ask for permission first and will be cleaned after themselves. <br /> <br /> Of course there must be a word about Stanley and Martha / Paul's relationship, because at least two of the two gay couples are advised to miss the plot primarily. We never call them two closer and, in fact, Stanley in a scene called "call", their relationship is more symbolic than sex. It is certainly not a "gay" film, which is a wind of plenty of female nudity and misogyny of 70 which can not be denied. Stanley and Paul never end their underlying sex on screen, although the movie was certainly important but the movie could certainly have done it. Not that, the story is not about their sex, it's about the ties of their relationship and how strange it is They are not gay, but they are their distinct personalities, who create strange movies to live on my TV set. <br /> <br /> This image is unique. It was made for a few kilo dollars for a loan set studio set, occasionally for location work and for a public place, when someone was not watching it, it led to a camera crew kiss. The dialog is completely weird, vivid and delightfully confidential. This is a movie that will surprise you, not everyone will like it, but for the low budget, the horrifying / adventurous taste of those who scraped like night God, help me! I do not have to play hungry, blood and tail and with the body of the dead, you got yourself a winner here. 8/10: Normally I would say something like "restoring the power to get a DVD" but the way I think this work will destroy the movie's enormous environment. And Owen Crowford, you, sir, rule.
