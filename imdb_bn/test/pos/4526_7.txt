"Murder Over New York" is a recreational entry for the Charlie Chan series of movies, but if you pay attention, many of the plot holes reveal themselves in the surveillance. While traveling to New York City for annual Police Convention, Chan (Sydney Tollar) met Scotland's Yar investigator Hugh Drake (Frederick Werlock) on the same flight. Now employed by military intelligence, Drake Paul is tracking Nervo and his Hindu slaves, suspected of damage to the world. Hell believes that he can not pin any of the Master Criminal area by contacting the malicious wife of Norva. <br /> <br /> Charlie, according to him, was killed by the name of a recently discovered poisonous gas "Titosine", which was operated through a glass palette. Which breaks down the poison. His dinner party called Kari to bring guests together, Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) were present, who asked in their presence, because one of them might be a killer. Among them, one of Drake's Oxford student Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), actress June Prieston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake, but in his presence, requested in his presence, Robert Percy (Key Richmond), Chief Designer of Keibir Air Company, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sullen ), Kibir Stock Broker. Kirby Butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) also suspects, especially the number # 2 son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) after him, to cheat him for opening the cablegang, which is the subject of the bogus itself. <br /> <br /> There are some side-by-side additionally other cute-driven characters. Mrs. Nervo has been raised as Patricia West (Marjorie Waiver), and unlike Drake's suspicion that she can take her to Norway, she actually escapes from her former husband and a devastating marriage. He is involved with the head of a chemical research firm, David Eliot (Robert Loyari), and then suspected of tetozin angle. <br /> <br /> With many Chan films, racist comments must be done with the performances. This one offers two glaring ones. When Kiba's black slave was asked to question, he said that he did not know anything about Drake's assassination, he was completely "in the dark" Chan's reaction: "The situation seems contagious". After this, Jimmy Chan commented on his arrival after observing Vince's order surrounding all the Hindus in New York, "They all started looking at me the same way." In fact, this scene provides an element of comic relief material in the film, such as Sheung Howard, the Hindu spiritual "The Great Rashid", is in disguise, but in fact police call him acting artist, Sherat McClo. Before the end of the movie, two more intelligent Nervo - his associate Ramlah and the pilot Kiri himself fell. In order to discover the concert killer, Chan with Eliot, an experimental flight was arranged on a new improved TR4 bomb after the discovery of a toxic capsule planted by mechanics in the previous day. Before it was released its deadly poison, Britt Fenton caught the capsule falling in the middle air, revealing that he knew about the plant. Arrested for arrest and interrogation, Chan claims that Fenton is not Norovo. Real Narvo expresses himself when he offers a poisoned water to nervous Fenton, concerns for maintaining Narvo's secret. But Chan was quite clever enough to try so much and revealed the real killer - no longer after the buzz of stock broker Jeffrey, after a car accident, after a reconstructive surgery. <br /> <br /> Now the hole for the plot. While investigating the murder of Hugh Drake for the first time, it was maintained by the police that the fingerprint found in the library does not match any dinner attendant. However, Jeffrey Norvo was present at the dinner party. It was already established that Drake's library was a non-party inspector, chemist Eliot If the fingerprint was not really involved in Norovor, then one of them was stupid. <br /> <br /> Also, at the end of the film, when Nervus supplies poisonous water to Panton, how does he feel that he is going away as a witness to everyone there? But even better, it is not just nonsense, as a world traveler like Sabotov in Norfolk will find time and instant time for establishing yourself as a New York City stockbroker. <br /> <br /> Some more points are mentioned for fans of Quarterly. In the film, # 2 Sona Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry, because she came with "pops" support to solve the case. In the East Chan film - "Charlie Chan at Max Museum" - Jimmy was the law enforcer. <br /> <br /> Toxic gas sources will be reviewed in the next channel, this time the role of Rolland Winters Chan in the monogram "New Orleans Docks". In this story, the toxic gas is released in a similar way from the detached radio tube, in its demand.
