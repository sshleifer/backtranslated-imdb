Touching the Bollywood epic Molldrama, she finds a 10-year-old girl, who she has accepted and determined to find her mother's birth. The main success of the movie is the performance of PS. Kirtan, who is playing the girl. The first half of the film is very good. There are some really good songs, too, especially the numbers that introduce the drama. Unfortunately, the second half of the war-torn series in Sri Lanka seems like a completely different and frustrating movie. Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels pushing grenades, running away from the fire, and stunts by stars and blasting explosives and special effects. All movies can offer insights such as cheap platitudas, "some days surely will come peace" and "perhaps children will find a way". The final sequence, where the mother and the mother are repeating together, well, but the music and a fad feel like that is so top with a good time-down surge. I know, I know, it's Bollywood style. But this is a story where big moments only refrain from the simple, powerful central stories. Bollywood certainly can use little restraint from time to time.
