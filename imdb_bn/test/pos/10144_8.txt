Unfortunately, at a slow start, I can not say it's one of the best hit movies. It's a nice little guy. Filmmaker Jimmy Stewart and Doris Dake, parents who were caught in political killings and tried to get back their abducted son. They both certainly give wonderful performance to the wonderful. Actually, however, I was most impressed with Hitco's amazing use of the music. Claymax in Opera House was fantastic, and at the same time there was pure genius using a live orchestra to create music and mystery. Absolutely fantastic mystery that came from the scene. Also, the use of Doris Day songs was "Nice, Best", the song was nice. Especially when it is transferred to the scene at the end of the movie. So, to me, this film is Hitako, the best use of music ever seen. Unfortunately it was a slow start, or I could recommend a little more to this film. Even then, it's still a good look. 10 out 8
