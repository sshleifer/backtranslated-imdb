I really enjoyed it both times saw it. And both times, I went away thinking about it, and "the morality of the story" is a great deal. I agree with other critics that this film does not focus on science-fees aspects that you can expect from a foreign-based movie, but rather about human condition. The mental hospital's characters provide a great insight into them and how they hope to be hopeless. This movie touches the extreme sadness of despair "he or she is not" That final question was handled well, and although some might argue that what you will not know until the end and the question is inappropriate, I think it has been done in more detail such as Ronin (Robert De Niro) where you are in the box Never find what you find and feel very disappointed with it. I highly recommend k-pack. 8/10
