Kazuo Komizu hit again with "A Beautiful Lady's Entrails", the series of "A Virgin Entrails". Around this story, it is located near a psychologist (Megumi Ojwa), who decides to take Yakuza one day to take revenge for the raped and raped patient's suicide in order to travel around his house. When he goes over his head and Yakuza takes her, he learns their masked plates to dodging girls and selling their slaves. It is apparently ending badly when he overdoses from cocaine. But will he soon be settled to be combined with another body ?? dum, dum, dum ?? "Super Slim Harmafrodytic Jord"! Is this he made saline meat from = yakuza and save the day ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most movies (in 67 minutes) mostly involve rape and sex with sex Relate and be natural-stuff. Almost until we finally got our cow's gravel with some cool hierarchy (like an alien-inspired sex-monster with a Pete scene and a Gobin acidification), but it still suffers because of the feeling of a very low budget which makes it fun but it is Z grade soft -No higher than rent.
