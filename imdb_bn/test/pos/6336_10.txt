Buffy This episode is one of my personal favorites. As well as three of Joes's personal choices are three. This episode shows very little dialogue and Amy's good people decide that it has got a nomination. Unfortunately it does not win. It was about 6 million viewers in the first premiere of Hewes, which was the highest ratings point of season four. That would tell you something. Even though very little was said, it also led people to plot enough to protect people. The characters of the gentleman (who played my mines) were the creatures of the show (or I saw that a network TV show). He wept at his weeping weeping and crying. I think the actors did a fantastic job despite the lack of dialogue.
