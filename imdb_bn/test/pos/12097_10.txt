I hear Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed: At first a decent wind and the leaves of the trees flow softly; Outside, away, water carriers bells unceasingly; I'm listening to Istanbul, my intention is to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, purpose, my eyes closed! Then suddenly the birds fly, the birds flock, the height, the crying and crying, the fishing head is painted on the head and a woman's feet start doubling in the water. I'm Istanbul in Istanbul, my intention is to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> I hear in Istanbul, the purpose, my eyes closed The grand market is quiet and cool, an objection to the market hub, the yard of mosques is full of doves. Spring wind sweat the scent when the hammer clang at the lips and docks; I'm listening to Istanbul, my intention is to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, purpose, my eyes closed! Still shaken from the past torture, an seaside palace with dingy boathouses is quick to sleep. In the South Air Dean and the drone, reposed, I'm hearing Istanbul, the purpose, close my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, purpose, my eyes closed. A beautiful girl walks on the gates: four letter words, whistles and songs, rude comments; Something is out of his hand, it's a rose, I guess. I'm listening to Istanbul, my intention is to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> I hear in Istanbul, the purpose, my eyes closed A bird flutters your skirt round; There is sweat on your forehead? Or not? I know. Is your lips wet? Or not? I know. A silver moon enhances beyond the pine tree: I can understand it all in your heart's quarrel. I hear Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> For you <br /> <br /> For you, my colleagues, everything is for you, for you for the night, for the day; Sunlight is for you, the light of the moon is for you; On the leaves of the moon, wonders and leaves in the light of the moon, green leafy vegetables in the diary, yellow for you and the pink. Feeling of palm skin, its warmth, its softness, lying; You have all the wishes and shelters in the port; The name of the day, the name of the month, the new color in the robots, the mailman's feet for you, the potter's hand pressed on the forehead, the bullet fired at the battlefield; For your graves and cemeteries, prison and hammer and death sentences everything is for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . I remember the first scene of the earth, I was open with a musical shell: the greenest water and the minimal sky and the lukewarm-frosting snow ... My blood still flows sweet, where the irregular my skin is thrown. What was the crazy speed in the high ocean of hostest foam! Foam is no disrespect to men, beats like lips, there is no disrespect for adultery with the lips like <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, about this movie, I have all the praise. A very beautiful and balanced role in a city and its music that once connected Asia, Europe and Africa.
