In 1962, Hong Kong created beautiful films such as a male (Mrs. Chau) and a woman (Mrs. Chan), when they became close friends with doubts related to their husbands and wives. Artistic, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses body parts (feet, hands, waist) with very slow speed and close-up. The film itself offers a reticence and tendency that suggests its duration. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-wai also does not allow viewers to see the appearance of spouses, Mr Chaw and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking is also made to look elegant with smoking curl up close. Really a beautiful picture. Just prepare yourself for the end. <br /> <br />
