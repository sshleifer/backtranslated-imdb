This is the first time I saw it in the first year of joining the festival - blown me up. <br /> <br /> It went very fast, and I never found it again. I figured it appears to be a compilation somewhere, but still no joy. The detailed discoloration of my memory - I am just surprised, again and at the end of my seat. <br /> <br /> Is there any lead in reading this? Online, DVD, Bit-Up VHS Copy - I will try to value it ... <br /> <br /> For years, I've probably seen more than 200 small films (lived near Aspen where they found an incredible April Shorts Festival). This is definitely the place in my darling, and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot with Leeds about how to see it :)
