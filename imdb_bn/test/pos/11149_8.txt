Recently purchased Universal's Marlin Diarych DVD collection, I was somewhat reluctant to "Golden Earrings". The 40-something Marlin Dietrich idea as a gypsy in a wartime romance, is unusual, and feels impossible. I do not have to be worried. The professional talents that went out of these old movies really are difficult to miss. There was a joy to watch movies; This is a classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the picture is the diyich, who completely pulls the gypsy role. Makeup, lighting, photography, and all of its performance really add up to create a striking and memorable character. I have never seen a "good woman" before the diet - but she is here! He starred in the great Sternberg films with a lot of heartwarming vamp, so it refreshes him to look at many other worlds, spontaneous roles, playing an exotic but very human character. <br /> <br /> Overall excellent romance. Love story is credible, optimistic, and happy ending extremely satisfying.
