These days, you rarely come up with a kids show which is 1) a print / tin pop star who likes to see the paint dry. 2) Every time a different person / girl includes a plot to find the perfect date 3) Reluctant yelling and unintelligible Humor rolling around. About 95% of Disney, Nichollodondon and Cartoon Networks fit the listed criteria. Keeping on simple terms, lack of good acting, fundamentality and good stories for all of them. For example, producers and authors think that the characters are not smart enough for the children to develop and understand the plot. They may not be more aware. Sure kids enjoy good smiles and uncertainty (if they are done with a conservative level and are done properly), but they want to enjoy a story, watch dramas and see people's challenges. They do not want to see people living in an improper world where they get what they want. They do not know all the fun and games in this world, they do not know it's perfect. Everyone has problems, and we all have to learn to work around them. Rolling around these show stuff types. Alex Mc is an average teenage girl who seems to be going for her gifted sister, Anne. Her mother works in some offices but sometimes her parents stay at home. Her father, George, the leading scientist of the plant, is a chemical corporation she lives in most cities, Paradise Valley. Alex is vague and picked by most of his colleagues. Her only friend Ray (but she gets more friends as soon as the series goes away). On the first day of junior hierai, Alex is not very happy about the school, but a truck from the plant disrupts any other chemical substance to avoid running a truck on it, which is a strange chemical dumping known as GC--161. Chemical mixes with water, in which Alex covers it. Soon after that he began to develop strange power, such as inserting an arcade, shooting lasers from his hands and moving things in his mind. Continuously glows when he is nervous (though we do not see that much later). Along with his sister Annie and friend Ray, Alex decided to keep these powers secret from everyone, even his parents fear the abduction of the plant, whose corrupt owner Daniel Eaton is head of his security department, Vince, GC 161 child for mysterious search. Then learn to live with each episode with his peculiar power, with the help of Alex trying to live a normal life as a child at the same time. The series might seem like a girls show, but it's not. As a boy, I have seen this show due to his extraordinary influence and drama. The producer successfully adds some element of science fiction with teenage drama material. Actually, some episodes were fierce and a bit furious. The ruthless plant manager has created good rivals for the series of Atron and Vince, because the authors really set them as threats and they get that awesome feeling every time on the screen. Also, the smartphone connects David, G.C. -161 The driver of the broken truck, you can finally love him as a left-wing assistant of Vince on the basis of comic impact. Taking a little Alex trying to live like a normal goat, it was interesting to struggle to determine his power. Occasionally, you have forgotten that these kids are fighting a giant adult running organization, because you dragged into the story. This exhibition shows Alex a good job related to the child that he may have super support, but he must still be a kid, and be cautious. Even in some episodes you will find yourself distraught at Alex's catastrophe. My favorite episode where Alex greeted is that he was never born, he actually showed most of these elements. As I said, the producers never hesitated to join a lane or a strange habit of George or to laugh about whether David is trying to be a nice man. You have really nothing with series plots, which are certainly corny moments and come across a full episode, but what's the good series? All the great shows are all. 9/10
