It's not as good as the movie, it's a cute kids show. OK so emperor came back to the slide and once more becomes a selfish spoiled brat, take it and enjoy some cartoons as entertaining. It's a lot of fun for parents and still have kids attention. It also has two of the original voice actors from the film. Earth kit who is in many movies but I'm sure many are known as Katwani. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I make a mistake) who has appeared in many films and TV series, but in most cases it is known as Tik. It's really a rare and wonderful combination. For any other reason if I could see at least one episode to enjoy the dynamic pair of comic book fans. To enrich, to laugh at children with laughter, with lots of enthusiasm to entertain the children. This is not your show if you are looking for your educational value. This is a great Saturday morning picking you just looking for something funny!
