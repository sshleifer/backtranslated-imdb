In this movie an Arab leader (Aamir) wanders and wants to live. So a Dr. Lloyd Trenton is being paid for the replacement of "Amir Brain" of the participant "Wish". But in the basement of the doctors, his dwarf assistant Doro (Angelo Rossito) destroys the blood of young girls for doctors. Meanwhile, Doctor Lloyd paid a man (who was Reed Hadley, Grant Williams and several unknown bodyguards) to kill the people with the help of Amir. Grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road. Although this incident happened, the doctors were sent to send another assistant Gore to the body of Ameer and Dr. Meanwhile, Grant Amir's "girlfriend" Regina finds Carol and tells her story. Grant showed him that he closed the road and Derrone killed him. Then he failed to find a body. L. Lord Amish has placed the brain in the body of a body of a ghost. Then go to Grant and Regina doctors lab <br /> <br /> ------------------------ Speaker ------- --- --------------- Find out his secret. Soon Amir (Gore) is persuading people to kill people and I think of breaking it. Leonard has a brain ray that threatens Amir. Dollo Lloyd wants a country where all scientists can work without legislation. Then Regina dies. And ultimately the new body of Amir (I think) it seems to be a new country. <br /> <br /> I did not finish yet but overall it was a very enjoyable piece of aromatic cheese. The film released Grant Williams in the final round of his second film. I recommend if you like a fan of Al Adams or a brain.
