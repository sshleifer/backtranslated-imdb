Death Camp Opera: Right here, right now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, I read that a very special film about our community's polarization has been conducted. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. Is his picture some non-professional artist, citizen like you and played by me? And others. Violence in the atmosphere has been described as very realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Really two <br /> <br /> Over the years, I realized how difficult it was. Maybe I, by coincidence? However, it's still an old story. I saw it a little earlier. Completely Imprinted. My very favorite peace of art: The name of the punishment park. I love this "Doco-Fiction", this "real story", this "faux reality", never ever After all the shock movies I saw, I reach the best with this strong and intense cinematography 'experience. I found a masterpiece. There is enough to know a lot about the movie. It is also possible to buy DVD with additional stuff. The word I want to add is my own experience with this movie. I am only sincere and dependent on people and artwork for people who work, work or watch directly. Is an industry that is simply a real human experience in an art adventure ?? Or the opposite. <br /> <br /> So, I'm not talking about all the 'Max' that I can not see on TV, especially 'real exhibition', the idea of ​​playing them interesting, but it is used in a stupid and opposite way . In the park of punishment, we can actually see some real people living in. We only follow a few lines, put them in a very specific context, and let us do what we want them to be. It is a way of 'separation' for a type of therapy, those inside the movie and the active audience in front of the screen. Then, finally, the director's touch edits a small and sweet apocalyptic film, a great scream, a 'Death Camp Opera', where some people are executed after extreme trial. Penalty park for those who want to increase. See this image and have the opportunity to choose your own ethics. Grow up and resemble yourself! If you can feel it! If you can see it !! In my case, the Park in the Park is stuck in me forever, all my love, consciousness and desire.
