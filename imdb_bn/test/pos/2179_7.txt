Well, I just saw the first actor of Buster Keaton's film, The Butcher Boy, in Fatty Arbaq, and although it does not seem strange for almost any logical reason, I got a lot of laugh at it. When the boy's boy from Booster comes to remove fatty busters, Buster says that he is in the bucket in the bucket, fatty dump is melted in the sack's hat and he takes the money, the booster is able to pull the cap on his foot and prevent it from melting while melting. After trying, Booster's feet are now trapped on the floor. It was probably not funny, but it was fun on the screen, as if there were more crystals with the throwing of the flour, and it was followed by the fact that the Facty Girlfriend pulled the fact that in the boarding school, and later dragged the fate of the fate to Foster. As I said, many scenes do not practice senses, but especially the adventures associated with Arakkal and Keaton laugh like disappointment today. Recommended for Keaton completists recommended.
