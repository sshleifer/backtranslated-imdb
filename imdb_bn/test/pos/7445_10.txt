Do not play the game? Do not disturb. It beat the game for Final Fantasy VII fans and would not appreciate this rare jewel of any other movie. Want to see it and love it? Buy the game, beat it and then watch it. When did you watch a nice movie based on video games? Well, this is <br /> <br /> This story took place two years after playing and no short summary is given to refresh your memory (although I doubt that many will forget), and within forty to forty One minute adventure. <br /> <br /> has your favorite favorite characters, even Kite Sith. The Japanese version of voice acting is fantastic, each character is completely cast. Cloud hard and listen to the sound of the Broadway, Tefa seems even more powerful ... Erris is perfect, she seems right. Kat Seth is a less tricky sound than I imagine, but works very well. <br /> <br /> The character model is spectacular, great textures and light. The environment is exciting and warriors are choreographed in a manner to blur the matrix. Surprising camera work comes through cycling, for example, where your eyes only shout with satisfaction and your lungs breathe heavily without consent. <br /> <br /> The music is generally Umatu quality, its top notch. Known tunes are rebuilt with the arrival of children's graphical lamps, which combine with very visible aspects. You have to laugh to make sure there is an internal joke for fans involved in the song. <br /> <br /> I did not see it in a semi-Japanese language, so I can not say that the subtitles are a good one. In Japan, however, the dialogue is very good and every word sounds like it is coming from the real living, not just the actor. Impressive I'll see today's difference with subtitles because I've played both Japan and American for the release of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, then buy this movie day or it is pre-order. If you do not play the game, then try to watch this movie very badly, but do not waste your time: Buy the game, beat it, and then come back for this DVD. I do not see you do it, but play games will not say. This will make the experience even better and will not let you off the dust of your head. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends - while doing adventure with your brave comrades again!
