I can not see how a movie of this quality from IMDB voters only gets average 5.7. It is a classic Australian production that is loved and loved by other cartridges, sugar factories, effective course language, Russian dol, Sample guy, United States secret life, El Spagnolla, Strange Planet, Fresh Air, Dust of Wings, Paties, Sylhet etc. The same student (Newton, probably his best role, at least with adjusting with Changji) is blanketed, very dense Miya gets the shock of her life when she decided to register for the same course - and another well before the film thinking, here are some of the original substance. Of course, this is a straightforward view of general and art students, especially life (but then they are not philosopher-Mumbai-jambo?), And perhaps the study of Syenad Kusak's character is somewhat confused, but the film is bright, funny, and some important messages. Policy cast is awesome: Cusack and Newton are wonderful, and Rose Byron (see also in 1967's godliness) is so slow that it is not funny. He is a beautiful, fresh, confident actor who he receives each accolade. I gave my Mount Frank 8/10.
