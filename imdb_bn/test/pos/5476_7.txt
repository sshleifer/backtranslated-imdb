I saw Wolfgang Petersen's film quite well. He knows how to act, create mysteries and are interested. Eastwood has to be great sometimes to be excellent. This goes for both his acting and his instruction. They both work hard here. The idea is not bad, and the game of cat and mouse works well. Malkovich has played a rather good role, and he and Eastwood join together in one another's movies. I think it will not present something new, actually ... but it does not really demand it and it does not even need it. It has two great actors, each fundamental role that they have proved in their careers in other things that they can handle unusually and handle helm as a great director. Really, it's entertaining, well done, and it's just plain distributed. Edit and cinematography are good. Acting and writing characters as well. The film directs to be suspicious and intense, and if you do it yourself, then perhaps there will be entertainment and involvement, even if there are higher movies. Panning is quite spot-on. I recommend it to the main actor, director and / or any fan of this type of movie. 7/10
