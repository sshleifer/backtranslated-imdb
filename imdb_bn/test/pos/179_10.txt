Golshaw: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure A great TV movie for all ages. This film focuses on "Fiji" (Alisa Milano), who wants to travel in Alaska for gold. His employer is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What's an adventure she does not forget to come next. This TV movie was just great. Acting # 1 (especially Bruce Campbell and Alice Milano) and I also learned some information about gold ush. I recommend all this TV movie without hesitation. This is based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
