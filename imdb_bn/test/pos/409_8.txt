Red Skelton (his first acting role) plays Wali Benton who plays a radio show 'The Fox'. He wrote the mystery of the killings and 'Fox' resolved them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to try to conduct a perfect murder of someone. He kidnapped Benton, his girlfriend (Anne Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Gray). He is telling Benton to write the perfect killer ... or his girlfriend drink it ... <br /> <br /> Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast moving (it's just 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really keeps this in full. Skelton's very first acting role is very good - very funny, quick, handsome and intelligent. Veidt is as nice as the evil Jones. Much fun as Rutherford and Gray Scranton's girlfriend Their three games play off completely to each other - highlighting this photo of their verbal sparring. It's fun to see Eve Aden play a small role. <br /> <br /> Your time is good.
