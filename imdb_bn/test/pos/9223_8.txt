When I was very young I first saw this movie. I was born in 1985, so the age of 80 was almost when the cartoon was big. My mother thought that I could like it. I did not even hear about the Rainbow Bright TV show before I got to know the movie. When I saw it (one of the old beta tapes ...) I like it. I became addicted to it. There are people who are badly written and all of them, but it's not more important to a children's film, and to some children like this. I liked the story, and especially like the songs and all female characters. Of course I claimed to have them, and the scene where Rainbow first met Crayes and they were withdrawn, they had to work with the opposite sex, I could have been quite concerned. The story is a good versus bad evil that children enjoy, and there was a happy moment to adjust to the scary things. The world is a fantastic place that will stimulate the imagination of any children. I was very happy when I was young when I had a chance to see this movie. It creates a big impact and it shows the happy memories of childhood now. I would recommend to any parent any parent to break this film. It will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment. You only have one child once, so do not miss this one!
