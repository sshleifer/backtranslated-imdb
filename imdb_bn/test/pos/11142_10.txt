I'm sorry enough that this photo is not even popular in Hong Kong. However, for all the hard die of Chau's death, it would be a masterpiece that shud-out out. Its peak at "Le Le Tou" (a comedy style based on the pioneering unreal and ridiculous plot by Chow). The plot is completely more ridiculous than 1000km which you can imagine. The dialog is awesome <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While helping a small married woman, acting with a junior magistrate (of course a corrupt), with the thief, Who killed him on the charge of killing him with the first murder, which the evil minister whose plot was actually the real culprit Chau escapes from the jail and escapes as refugee. He wanted to see the emperor and go to the capital for firmness report. On her way, she managed 2 lovely women, one from the circus, and another person to choose prostitution, and in the middle of the extreme mama-san (who could be her law). Finally, he forced the emperor to reconsider it by a black girl, who met Emperor with him. The emperor made him the highest level judge to judge the case with the Supreme Minister. He managed to establish some brilliant but ridiculous plot to make the criminal guilty of crime when he was imprisoned by the evil minister. <br /> <br /> Plot is really ridiculous and ridiculously brilliant. Chao and Mama-san have some terrific bad facial quarrels that inspire Chau to woo quarrels between Maya-Sun and Thali Mama-San, and Chao and the last near evil naughty Lee. In addition, the scenes are somewhat brilliant. <br /> <br /> One thing to mention is that to really understand the film and correctly capture 100% of all the components, it must be master of Cantonese really good. The reason why the small couch movie can only get the middle reaction of the Asian world. However, when Chau film started to influence its world, hard-hearted fans like me have seen that his film is not as funny as the old times.
