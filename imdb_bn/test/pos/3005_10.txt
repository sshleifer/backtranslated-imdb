This exhibition was not only a great human drama, but also rendered racism in this country as raw, which was true for living. When a show can be so wonderful and entertaining and absolutely ruthless and educational, this is its highest form of television. The acting was extraordinary. The writing was exceptional. The show only depicts the caste relationship between a non-dishonorous ethnic relationship, but shows how it is visually present at the beginning of the twentieth century, with the ability to portray this as the existence of the 1960s. We changed the way, and sadly, we have many more ways.
