A wealthy person Richard Tornith died and his relatives joined his funeral. The funeral party included Fergana's youngest sister Kora Galaccio. At least 20 years no one has seen the family in Koro, they all agreed that the quota was always different. So when Kora says something about the murder of Abimeethi, most of them laugh like the warmth of Kora. But someone is probably taken seriously seriously. The next day, Kora was found dead in his bed with his body while he was dead. Is there a connection between two deaths? It's a killer to find Harcull Poirot. <br /> <br /> After the last good of one of the best episodes together in the next Poirot series. I am always a fan of this special Agatha Christian book and I remember that this movie is like a Piroto installment that is credited as a source of crystals. Lots of mysteries of signals, suspects, and lots of red herrings are top notch. And as I wrote earlier, I always enjoy the story of a Christie where everyone gathered in the drawing room for the final publication of the Hercules Piret. It can be old fashion, but the way I like it. Crossing the plot, technically and artistic funnels are later won. Set, edit, direct, and cinematography will get you as one of these movies as well. Acting is equally impressive. I came to expect an enjoyable performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he's not disappointed here. The rest of the cast is as strong as giving Monica Dallan a particularly significant performance. Characters were introduced without a small chin with a quick fire way, I got no real complaints. It's a good show almost all the way.
