Based on a true story about Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Dalton Lee (Pen) and based on their involvement in selling American secret government documents to the Sovieters in the 1970s. Boyce works for the government, and his job is to guard these specific documents, which eventually dissillusions him about the issues and practices of his country. Then he was his drug dealer friend, Dalton Lee, who wanted to be a courier for sensitive documents, who became a wanted man. Lee enters the Russian embassy in Mexico, and contacts Alex (Suchet), and they start playing both spies. <br /> <br /> Lee's interest is only for money, when he is involved in the system he is working against angry anger. Alex American government believed to be internally inside American. The unexpected behavior of Lee's drug addict and courier location, Alex and things begin to be arrayed while offset both. Lee becomes more paranoid, and the primary espionage game becomes more deadly and fruitful for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is a true spy thriller without a perfect verb. The character and practicality of real life issues are sympathetic but very good writing, and the film fiercely interferes with real-life events with intrinsic political themes about human lethal behavior. Where a large nation uses their political power to control the small state. Well guided, and intense in part, especially where the dramatic spy games become too much on their heads. Timothy Hutton and Shan Pen have given amazing performance in a picture that question authority and still there is no direct answer to the political message or complexity of that system. The plight of the playwright became the underlying message of 'Falcon and the Snowman', and it created a clever political thriller with fierce elements about society, human relations and American systems. Great Film! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 *****!
