To date, I think, there are three people including me, who wrote the Best Works of Heaven's Gate (1980) and probably the last great Western (since 1970), Little Big Man (1970), Jerome Johnson (1972), The Outl Josie Wells (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). <br /> <br /> I was surprised and amazed that IMDB's 22.5% of the vote was 10, as I did. A recent book, the worst movie of all time, includes the Gates of Heaven. It was not distorted as a film from Cleopatra about 20 years ago through its production and liberation war. At one time it was considered as the most expensive super-budget movie ever, even clippetra crossed. It was responsible for the collapse of the studio, until the United Artists finally all the studio collapsed. Mirror Simino was bitter to the hero haters of her hare and her successes and the making of the film, but apparently, it was her worst little jealousy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Exposition of American Experience. Do not miss this picture but serious students of American film making.
