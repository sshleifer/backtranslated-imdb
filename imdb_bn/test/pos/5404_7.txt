This photo does not have amazing scenes offered by American Beauty or Ice Storm, and it can not be marked as original as the movies that were created later: The music sounds brilliantly, much like American beauty. <br /> <br /> This story is especially compatible with Ice Storm (like Sigarie Weaver). Perhaps in addition to the intention, this film tries to revive the success of two previous films. Sometimes, the story is a bit bigger than the larger, more successful "brother" than it gets older, or does not provide the most effective dialogue. Here, the text can not be measured with American beauty. But it can be made about any movie, even the best and still can choose a lot: music scores and (expected, provided paid) performance performances. Note that after a few years of Emil Hersh, the title of "In the Wild" will be enlightened. <br /> <br /> If you like subtitling plays, then I can recommend this movie, but this is not the first in a list. Must be seen, which will be topped: 1 American beauty 2 Ice Storm 3 Little Children. <br /> <br /> You've seen and liked it, see it once.
