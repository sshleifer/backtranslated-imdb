Cant believes it .... After all these years it finally tracked down. It was known at the production stage as 'Great Pritir'. I used to live in Ozzy and was taking care of the location of the photo through a friend ... This guy showed me while speaking in Scottish language and at this moment I realized that Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to follow me, leaving the OZ in the next month after the party was removed and was not sure whether it went to the screen. At that time, Russell Crowe was no longer acting actor and I do not think it was the previous comment until I thought of filming on that day ... amazing ... really delighted with me! !!
