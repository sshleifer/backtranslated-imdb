This is a movie which is very partially Again I'm voting for an underlying movie. This movie is a good story line, probably a bit remote but it can happen. San Sistine (one of my favorite actors) again shows us a good performance. The guy acting is not a great act but gets recognized for his role. She did well to goonies. Not just him but Louis Gusset Jr. Works a swell. I thought maybe more money would be made in the movie theater but would take care of the money in any way. A good movie around it, which will keep you on the edge of your seat and the plot will run the movie itself. I enjoyed this movie and hope you will be as good as the rest.
