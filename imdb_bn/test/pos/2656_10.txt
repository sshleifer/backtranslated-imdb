Spaulards ahead. <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is the most challenging and successful film of late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a movie that you watch for entertainment or entertainment. Instead it provides you with a meal for thought, images are prolonged in their eyes after the end of their own. This is a movie that you can meditate on. <br /> <br /> The image deliberately provides more questions to us, but it can answer, it makes a puzzle and a secret, but with the fear and respect of the audience, it leaves the viewer in spite of it. (Which allowed him to be involved in the process of watching, the audience needs some effort to enjoy this movie) The questions that it creates are big and evil, about human origin and destiny, it is a cosmic design and existence or some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe The final position of the lack. <br /> <br /> The first of four quadrilaterals gives us a unique view of our past species. We saw our remote ancestors, half of the half-people in a nearby earthquake. Climate has destroyed most plant life and vegetarians are near hungry animals. An extra triangular object, perfectly smooth and angular black consolidation is displayed and the animals are simultaneously inspired by the creation of tools and the presence of violence. They turn overnight into the Carnival, and when two tribes face each other near a source of water, the tribe that creates the ability to make tools, as well as deafness, completely destroy the neighboring group. The new chief of the victorious tribe, empowered by the first province of technology, he threw the bone used as weapon in the air. We see bone transformed into a floating satellite containing temporary weapons. We soon learn that the world is isolated by a nuclear warhead. The features inspired by the memorial monument once helped us to survive, which now threatens our existence. <br /> <br /> Again humanity will help humanity, invisible presence representing black unity again, again humanity will help humanity. The next step in the development of The search for the moon has been discovered in a similar way as we have seen. The world government, generally enemy enemies, came together to discuss privacy. A mission is arranged. This memoir is a bit connected with Jupiter in radio communications. Some men will travel to the transmission destination. Most of them, most of the time, will remain in suspended animation. Aerospace pilot HL is a super computer that has been programmed to imitate all the features of mankind. <br /> <br /> There are many extraordinary clauses in this picture. Kubrick is outstanding for using classical music as usual. The most memorable "Blue Dwarf" and "Also Speak Jarathastra" (especially the film theme to suit common sense). The filmmaking for the rest of the final 30 minutes of the film is especially nice as the fantastic. Your life <br /> <br /> HL's character is the most important of the film's central thesis point of view. He also received negative characteristics in imitation of all the characteristics of humans. He developed the Paranitia which often led to the destruction of the missions, a perfect mirror of the parrones, which allowed the world's political situation to reach a level of frustration. The film suggests that if these evolutions are to advance to the next stage of our evolution, we must be behind. <br /> <br /> The film's architecture is also meaningful. Many of the spacecraft designs refer to the reproductive organs and the film's central motif, the process of birth and rebirth. The end of 2001 is depicted in the most spectacular and winning films. <br /> <br /> This film highlights a similar aspect of life presented by William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finanagan Way. It is a pattern of history and human evolution that is circular, yet repeats the same phenomena in progressive, greater hearts, yet it has a pattern of development as a person's wishes for the larger purpose of mankind. Although we never learn this purpose, the film assures us that the human race is not for failure, without the ability to imagine its fate, the grand. It makes me amazed that in spite of this picture many people misguided Kubrick. <br /> <br /> This is not a religious movie, in the traditional sense of a certain religion, but because of it it is called the wonder paranoid astonishing existence and it is related to the deepest and most important question of purpose and truth. <br /> <br /> It may be a little too much in the hands of any other director. Hollywood's view of life is very bad, usually involving the greatness and intensity of such a philosophy. But Kubrick was a dreamer, he completely ordered self-confidence, he could not manage such material only, but he was the only way to do this. The process of creating this image has used all its creative resources. Partnering with Arthur C. Clarke is the most fruitful in film history. To discover the special effects used in the wonderful mountaineering of the movie, Kubera had to discover something. The resources did not exist then to bring his views in life, so he came up with their existence. <br /> <br /> 2001 is a completely unique film experience. Those who miss it, they damage their own intellectual and imaginative power.
