I really fell in love with characters. They were very down on earth but each of them had a secret dark side. A mystery sort of. David Grace Mark, myself, was an acquaintance. The secret fears and the secret that she was just in common. His whole part was that he did not know anything about other characters and the audience became surprising or arrogant. There was always a part of this man that he would hide, but he would share a bit of himself. He was the leader of strong men's leadership and I appreciate that kind of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who can work with any part of the part! She is an extraordinary talent and a good man. Her fans love, respect and support her. <br /> <br /> She has gone to many other projects from this show and her performance ability has been quite a bit better. To perform this excellent work, he and all other actors from this show! I wish them all the best. I want to continue the series! It's not so shameful!
