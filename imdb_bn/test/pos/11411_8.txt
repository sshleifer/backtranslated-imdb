This movie is about a girl who is not alone because of her childhood on that night. That's nothing weird about, right? Until ... phone rings. Until ... ring the phone again And again ... and again. Those are some stupid fantastic calls. This is for real. If you want to see the reaction of the girl, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere filled with horrible words. Very well performed by young actress Camila Belle. I see her some great potential to become a good actress. It's more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why it's so intrinsic. However, in my opinion this movie deserves more than 4/10 only. 24% voters rated the movie 1. Be serious, man. You could not get a good thriller for a title like this.
