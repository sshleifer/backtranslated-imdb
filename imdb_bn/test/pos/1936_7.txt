From the day the production code and the Hayes office, this enjoyment is not only great, but also entertaining. It was a huge hit based on Rogers and Hearts songs at that time, the story revolves around Barbara Stanwick, the daughter of Dance Hall, who is romanticized by wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was exceptionally handsome), but Whose heart belongs to his booky neighbor Monroe Oasley. She and Ousle marry, but keep it secret, when she dismisses the Cortez, who still expects. He helped to get the company's job, but married happily became hungry because Ousley develops a taste for high life and takes a step towards a college's sweetheart and gambling in a high-level bridge (yes, I know it's funny ..). Finally, he embezzled $ 5,000 from the cottage, and going to Lam, when his devoted wife goes to Coatage ... and I will not publish anything, though the end is definitely surprised. <br /> <br /> Stanwick is the best thing about this movie; Her first role is that she is quite accomplished. Owsley is the weak point; He is obscure and sniveling, while Cortez is wonderful, suave and sexy, his performance is sincere but unmarkmarkable. <br /> <br /> Although apparently a drama, it is laughing, in many films some elements are as old as many abusive weak. But there are many good-spirited lines; At one point Stanwick said to Cortez, "My brain is on my legs, when you are in it ...." For 1931 it is very disciplined! In the last days of clearing the code before and after closing it, this torque contains many stupid and suggestive elements. A wonderful antique, a reminder of how far we can not come in the 70 years .... This story can be easily changed in 2003, but with the original completion, it can keep the original plot.
