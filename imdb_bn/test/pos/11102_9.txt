This film is a wonderful opportunity for us to start with the dark tunnel through intelligence. The effect of the film has deepened with the realization based on the real story. Timothy Hutton gives us a quality, low performance, and Shane Pen shows why he is the best living actor in America. As "Midnight Express", this film should be doubled about doing something that we should not do in a foreign country.
