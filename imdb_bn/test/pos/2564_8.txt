Black Snake Moon is shocking. It is very flowing, rich, deceptively arranged, weird and complex, unique and dreamy. In the success of the Hostel and Flow, Brauer portrays the South American portrait as a mythological land, which would look forward to seeing the epic of the Fantasie or Ancient Greece. And yet hover his movie over us, they are still rooted; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Half of Radiator's half-naked white girl works hard to discipline, while emphasizing very impressive and metaphorical as the same characters as the few characters in the Pleasantville color fairy tale, the film is metaphorically strong. But Brawer did not start his film with "Once upon a Time"; In this film and in Hostel and Flow, Br√ºn presented us through a different fairy tale; A dark, gothic sex, prostitution, and finally, released. These themes are running like blood-like shadows and become bloody and rush into the dark, bruding setting. <br /> <br /> But despite this extreme extreme, Brawer practiced his characters like humans and carried out very well, the dimensional characteristic of Lazarus and Rae, especially Pharmacy, Angela, and Roy's mother Lazerus's friends with their relationship Emphasize on. <br /> <br /> acting, almost all, perfect. Christina Richie and Samuel L. Both Jackson seems to have been born to play this role. Their characterization is so intense and so serious; It's a challenge for the actors to keep their heads and relax the realist characters even more. And they are pretty successful. Samuel L. Jackson has specially disappeared in his character, which acts as the reverse pole opposite most of the characters previously played. With films like Paul Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shafts and others, he made himself a "very bad-ass" type cast. Black Snake Moyen Jackson has played an old, broken, defeated and starred character, which is different from what he has done before. And to be honest, it's just pretty. Most of the time it is astonishing, Justin Timberlake's casting, and more specifically, that he comes across as quite tolerable. Sure that his screen is not much, but what did Brawer do with Ludicas on the whistle and the floor, then he actually got timberlakes to do the job and did what he wants to do, and does not come as absolutely uncertain and annoying. <Br /> <br /> But the film is about to create a wonderful atmosphere for the Brian. The location of rural southern works with its advantage in creating a dark, dirty, sticky, crusty, rugged type of film for the whole film, which is not compatible with the theoretical and metaphorical aspects of the film. And for Rai, Rai has played an undermined myth, setting the rural south, while Rai makes his radioactivity or lightning thunderstorm, while using Rai's thunderstorm and rising sound like fierce storms, Brauer really manages to create a fantasy. . And it works so brilliantly to attract Bruuer's unique attention. <br /> <br /> No one can talk about Craig Brover's film without mentioning the song. In the Hostels and Flow, he used sound-down-and-dirty, street-like hip-hop music soundtracks to emphasize the atmosphere and outlook. In this film, the music works better by polishing and fully representing the unique atmosphere. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, rawest, grittiest blues you've ever heard. And it just seems absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is an old, broken, lonely, God-based black blues singer, a simple story to release a little white girl. Was there. As a child has been sexually abused and now enjoys nymphomania, there may not have been much to write about the house. But this movie is not about plot, not even about characters, as well as they are clear in the film. No, what does this picture look like? And what a unique vision it is! It's about the atmosphere, myths, setting. It's anger, fear, release, and most importantly, about blues. And it is all wrapped in a unique, entertaining, stylized and irrational ribbon. Brawer has confirmed a spot in the most promising up-coming director list and through this strong follow-up in the first scene of a great debut on the Hustle and Floor, he will definitely be on my radar for future projects. <Br /> <br /> It must be mentioned that the film still has the most beautiful and unique title which I have just heard.
