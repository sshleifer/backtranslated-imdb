One of the best movies I've ever seen - a classic "Matrix" movie. For many years, I have tried to get VHS or DVD - no benefit. German film / tv industry still likes to contribute valuable cultural contributions (and after all, fasibinders!) Instead of removing it and collecting some archive dust instead of distributing it commercially (and if it is enormous, earn lots of money with it) instead of being creative Thoughts of preaching). Although the WDR once said to me that if I pay for the DM 200.00 for copying (non-refundable) checks and then duplicate rupees 8 per minute and for the platform, they would consider making a copy (single!). Me Some ways to sell something! Our other TV series have similar problems with "So weit die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder" and others. Excellent TV series - do not listen again Germany, wake up! Update from March 2007: Last year, I can get DVD copies from WWT "Mittschnittservice" for almost 50+ euros. Great!
