This movie is fun in multiple ways. It has action. It's ridiculous. It has attitude. All girls in Dlommite army Kung-Fu Huss! And that's what the movie offers as a film just fine. It also played a bit worse, Mike made several cameo appearances and missed by some "punched" feet. But when you make a movie, who gets the attention of the "details"? Stone this movie. Rent it tonight, if you can find it ... I had to buy it when I see it, but I'm sorry!
