In the last 5 years, I have seen it as the best film. Of course, it will be in the same line with Plato, Apocalypse Nieu, The Doors, The Dog Heart (Russian Film), with such best-known compositions. Really, the boy and his parents play so well that you can not even say "play". No, they are also living as they happen. The goal of smiling on the face when the main hero refuses to go for a walk with them. One piece hatred and love And the final scene! <br /> <br /> Really, I'm still under the impression of that movie. It's very hard to combine humor and tragedy even impossible, but if you succeed (and physics) the effect will be twice stronger. <br /> <br /> I compared "a flower over the dog's vest". I like this picture (and the novel is also very good, but after Frederickson's film it seems easy. (I saw the same difference after watching the movie "American History X" and "Rumpe Stomper" - next is deeper). I mean Mills Forman is only concerned about the problem Showed the material. You see it, then you say yes, this is a good movie, I like him, I like him And this is it, but "Angels" leaves you with a huge base, there is no bad or good boy in the film, because everyone has the right to behave because the patient loves a girlfriend, of course she is young and pregnant and her husband is in the clinic. One problem, but his lover's feelings and emotional experience are stronger (the result is his suicide). Why did he ask him Do not you ask yourself? Why do not you support him, help him, understand? Finally, they talk to each other, they are even funny, they say talent. I want to say a lot about this film, but I'm in English Not so good. But I'm sure you understand those who saw the movie. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
