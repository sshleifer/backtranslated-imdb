The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very nice. I like movies. How can anyone tell me how to catch music from this movie? Even the soundtrack has to be done. If this is not possible, at least they can get the name of the song with their respective singers? I tried to search amazon.com but did not have it. I have not tried CD Baby, either. I've browsed through Google for some details but there was no one. I would appreciate it if someone could answer me my question. I know that these songs are indigenous and are music by a country artist. I just need the title name along with the singer. I would suggest any country song of this movie or rather loving person.
