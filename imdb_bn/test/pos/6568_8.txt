It is very true that the film denies the convention, not making the plot for the audience. Although someone may find it difficult to find it for themselves, I hug the "ujumaki" for his unpleasantness. There is a plot, it can not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. This is a film that invites many interpretations, as all great art works - however, this film is very entertaining, it creates a rare film experience. It is exciting and fun together.
