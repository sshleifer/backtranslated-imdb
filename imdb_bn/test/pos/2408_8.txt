I've seen this movie more than once and it's valuable. For those of you who prefer martial arts and cross the internal conflict, it is an appropriate choice. After watching this movie, I wanted to be a more productive member of society because I could relate to the spontaneity of a girl and the need to follow. Of course, Mr. Miyagi always advises his sage. 2 thumbs up!
