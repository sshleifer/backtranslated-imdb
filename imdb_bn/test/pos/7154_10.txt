Wow, just catch this movie from Blockbuster and I love to find gems like this. Although it was certainly shot in a budget and missed some of the accidental edits for accidental effort (for example, accident, hospital scene, second-timer scenes), I gave these 10 stars! I absolutely like the thought-provoking concepts and if you are open to ideas from a free thinker and box, I highly recommend this movie. I think director and writer J Floyd should be given some attention and opportunity in the film industry. Based on his credits, he could be another Quantin Tarantino.
