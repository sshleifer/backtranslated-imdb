This is not a story. It's a bunch of emotional needles to reach for your subconscious. You will be annoyed if you wait for a story. But if you are putting yourself on yourself, you will be within 10 minutes of its dream. A lonely landscape obscure but annoying images of pain and torture leave the room for your own imagination. Curious soundtrack that gives you feeling of isolation, visible ecosystem of Christ crucifixion, rash light and dark dark shades, they reach your subconscious to fill this mind-space. I am unable to shake myself and move in front of my television. It was like dreaming with eyes open. A weird nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience ... It touches me deep inside and marks me for live. It has liberated my mind and made me a donation of rare experiences of the loss of that personality, and got mixed with archeology. Little freedom for the soul. Anyway a violent freedom .... an excellent movie, but a very powerful and unforgettable one. Literally my text has no spoilers. The incredible intensity of this film for me was its incredible intensity, and it can be understood as a joke described. As soon as you know about this film, well.
