It would be absurd to judge any trial or documentary can be more authentic than others. Imagination forms in both formats and it is never the true reflection of the reality because the producers want to rebuild and narrate stories in their perspectives. Both formats generally leave some issues due to the 'subplots' and screen-time complications, it gives viewers the opportunity to open debates and create more real-time searching and real-life opportunities. To assess sources, viewer's disability (eg, compared to written history) and arguments behind the arguments can be opened for distortion through history descriptions and documentaries. <br /> <br /> To most people, the documentary can be more truthful, it usually involves actual participants' testimony and real-life footage. However, these visuals have been selected and edited so that such arrangements can be made in such a way that the producers allow viewers to present their reality versions. In The Real Body Holi Story, Paul McCartney remembered by family and friends, and established Body Holly on how the body influenced the influences of the music world. Memories can be distorted because memory can not be correct and the emotions are encouraged to create a legend from Buddy. Corrected the documentary film version and other events such as Critics' 3 members and when Buddy's music was actually heard outside the United States (she had to go on a world tour!). However, there was no discussion about what happened to Badie's wife after the death. Critics and / or negative discussions may be dropped from the documentary because the producers want to present a Buddy in the world which will be remembered by the world. Finally, we do not manage to build the whole truth because we have only limited our 'reality' to the past which the documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like a descriptive movie because it provides rich visual imagery that helps us reconnect with the collective memory of that era. It gives a more constructive structure to the viewer's story, and this story revolves around memory maintenance for the public audience. Flexibility is an element that allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and opinions on specific topics. In Body Holly Stories, ethnic issues have been highlighted and viewers may be concerned with these issues with current situations. <br /> <br /> Movie-gears constantly try to recite some emotions while watching a movie, and using these emotions, the audience wants to provide a filmmaker who can choose to have a personal connection with the application money. In most stories, people are more likely to choose ways, inspiration and ways to end the story. Through Body Holi Story, we think about the struggle of buddy and cricketer, how Maria was the source of encouragement, and on the day she died, Body Holly was a great performer.
