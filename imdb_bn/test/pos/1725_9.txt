I am a man of the next generation ... I have never seen the real doctor, but I have heard about the series which made a great fan base in the past and still has made it a mark in the 21st century; The new "doctor" started in 2005, but for the people living here in the state like me, we mostly see it as a new episode in scientist files or in BBC America; From season one we are introduced to a new cooler new doctor played by a new player Rose Tyler (Billy Piper) and Christopher Eccelson (sorry last name spelling). These two are moving forward to preserve the world in the amazing and highly dangerous missions ... every now and then, they are with Jacob Harcesses present from Rosa's ex-boyfriend Mickey ("Torchwood" can now be seen in the spin-off). The level of motion in one season is justified from the season ... The stories may be weird from the strange to the highest action packed drive driven, but it is a rollercoaster journey that is very interesting from the beginning of the theme song. <<br /> He is different and changed in the season and now the new doctor (David Tenant) is fighting to save the world with rose and at the moment there may be something which was not good for some seasons, but I would like to disagree, Participation in the way was tragic but it left the role of "companion" to the head (acting by the arrival of very sexy frames) Atike to continue to fight to save the season three now work helps ... / adventure stages and sometimes emotional, but as the first two seasons is more; Here the relationship between Dr. and Martha is appropriate but the attraction can be inserted occasionally and comes to play clear that he has not gained his company experience in the first two seasons and it may not be in the third season. It was a bit painful for me because you used roses and its way and now you see someone who does not sometimes ask a doctor at the psychological level but simultaneously makes the movement of the audience very exciting, which puts you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll give you a romantic journey from all these television shows but there are some flaws in this show because I have never Otherwise, I can not mention the reasons for it to be hard, but there is only one in the doctor and Martha's relationship spreads and you do not have the foundation; I've seen good shows on British TV but it's one of the coolest science-free events for the old and new generation experience, but it does not have to take my world for me ... adventure joining.
