It is an epic film about the unity of China's ancient kingdom in the 3rd century BC. What makes it interesting is that the King's tragic collapse and all palace conspiracies going around it. It reminds me of "King Lear" and some other Shakespeare plays. <br /> <br /> The king begins with a noble ambition to unite the kingdom under one ruler and to stop all quarrels so that people can be rich and have a better life. He and his childhood boyfriend, acted well by Lee Gong, told him to go to exile in the rival state for the assassination of a king to kill a murderer, in which he attempted to go to war. But when he is away, the king becomes evil in his desire for power and becomes victim of the killing. <br /> <br /> There are many side plots which are running the action. Marcis who pretends to be stupid and foppish but who is really clever and who wants to be king himself. He managed to keep the mother of the parents of two children and secret for many years. Still, the Prime Minister has a political rival, who is actually going to be his father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He will not want anything else with the killings, but in the end, Lee Gong (who will not be) he has won, when he sees how the king has become cruel and naughty. <br /> <br /> Some spectacular paintings, especially the scenes that take place on a grand scale of war - as they say, thousands of used, literally. Actually, nothing special. This story is interesting, although it limits it for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> must be seen.
