The dictator of the Republic of Tamilia, a poor child who is angry when he does not get what he wants ... and what he wants is not less than the world ... <br /> <br /> In the spectacular view of the Chaplin industry, The world runs in a ballet which he feels when he got it from his perception ... <br /> <br /> There are some bad words on Chaplin's war and war films. At the time of World War I In a scene at the beginning of the movie, Tommyan Messner crashed the plane and thinks ... he is dying ... In an impressive manner, he started to talk funny ... The only double-talk war film is getting brighter with all the heroic death scenes. <br /> <br /> In another scene when he escapes to the Jewish Gateo and guides the command to rebel among the old men To prevent the rebellion, he plans to kill the dictator ... The party must kill the ruthless winner of the Austrial ... anyone who is elected will die naturally, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will be as a star in Tannan's history. ... <br /> <br /> to determine the order in which he and cream of the cake containing four letter coins, br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No one else could have given it: Rage of history ...

Art ... <br /> <br /> Because of the fantastic continuity of a post-shooting accident, the dictator is misguided for the Jewish sailor of Hennessa, and on the contrary, "The Great Dictator" Chaplin's first conversation. At this time, 'Charles' and 'Charlie' did not want to say anything more through his movie and not with a comedy comedy, but at the end he used his famous 'Trapp Character'.
