"We are traveling together in this disgusting world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly unknown or perhaps incomplete, at the very end of the life that we can not understand." So Ted Pikul says in the picture. Life for some people and 'Exsthenge' is probably a movie about the existence. What is the real and what's outstanding and you tell the difference. Or not The last line of the film is very fuzzy. <br /> <br /> The image looks like a goat dog (actually it has a real mother-in-law dog) but it excites you to a striking attractive journey. Kruevenberg touches that lets you see surpluses, game pods, fish, thorns and bones in a new light. Some bits are pretty icky. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called 'gas station' and a Chinese restaurant is called 'Chinese Retortant'. This movie has a big budget science fiction movie from the league. Repay in the picture and see it again once again. <br /> <br /> The main actors Jude Law is those who are okay and Jennifer Jason Leigh is great. Some roles do not accept this highly talented actress, but when she has a good role, she is impossible. Suits her unusual beauty and impressive voice algorithm part. (Looks pretty cool on a very small black skirt.) There are other familiar actors but they do not have much to do. It looks good, sounds good and Howard Shore scores very well complements the film. Craniberg is perhaps the science-fire / horrible alfred hitchcock. He has no film no matter he is always worth watching.
