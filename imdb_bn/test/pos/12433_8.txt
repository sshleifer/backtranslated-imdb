From the beginning till the end of the movie, I could only catch the last half hour. Naturally I do not see any movie if I do not see it from the beginning, but it was a friend and once I started watching it I could not stop. <br /> <br /> I really wonder why this movie does not get a huge theatrical release. This is a very funny movie (often humorous), and in it the monster and giant trucks are quite annoying. The giant looks beautiful like the leatherfaces, and the giant truck is like a cross between the German armored car of the First World War and a giant coffin. <br /> <br /> A funky 25-year-old virgin, a long drive, loves to marry her. Along with her ex-best friend tag and constantly rags on her. They're menaced on the streets by listening to a vintage black and aforementioned giant trucks. They pick up a hit at a very sexy eyeball and play a game of Brooks. <br /> <br /> I watched the animated trailer with the director's comment, and the electronic press kit and I both felt interesting. The quality of the dialogue with the director and the two male stars is quite enjoyable, but I have many movies I've never seen before.
