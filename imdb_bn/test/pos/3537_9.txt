Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more awesome; More bloodshed and very graphic details (a little more for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially influenced by who was in the station and did not have any weak points). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best Thriller I've seen since years Although it was scheduled in three parts in the BBC, I saw a look at the video in Messiah. One point of the critics; Villain's motivation was not very believable.
