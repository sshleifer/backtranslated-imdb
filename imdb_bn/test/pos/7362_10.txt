How nice! My mother bought me this movie because it was really cheap in some stores in my town, and she knows that I love scary movies. At first I looked at the cover, and thought that it was a bit of a common B-movie to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the big mistake of watching it alone, my parents and my brothers were sleeping and it was really late. After watching the movie, I was scared. I was trembling ... I did not get scared and did not remove the videotaped VCR! I have slept with the lights ... <br /> <br /> These movies are about the story of some teenagers who travel on the road and tell the story of night filled with fears ... The first story is really scary, and if you're alone To embrace embrace embrace a pillow. The second story is very scary, but not the same way as the first one. The third story (my favorite) is really, really vague. It's me to fear all the stories. This is a guy that is driving across the country on a motorcycle. One night, when a storm broke out, he went to the house and ran to the door. Opened a girl, and he was silent. You do not want to say anything more, but when you see it will be cold. My heart rate may really be extraordinary when I saw it). The main story "Campfire Tales" is really interesting and surprising. I said something to suck it, but said, my boyfriend and my friends loved it, and we were afraid that there was a long time .. 10/10, by the way of Oh, it's not like urban legend at all, it is very is scarier.
