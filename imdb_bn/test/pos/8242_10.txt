When I grew up in Sydney in the 1950's, I could easily identify the contents of this fine movie. Each week I came to see Jeans Street Winner's Newsaryle, which is a sequence of scenes (and usually 3 stages). There is never a good mix of B / W and color in a film. A wrong forgotten movie experience never closes round production value.
