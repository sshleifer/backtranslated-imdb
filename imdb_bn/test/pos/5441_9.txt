Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. She really looks close to this one, as joke jokes left and right talk show comedian Tom Dobbs. From earlier it looked like a side-split ridiculous festival. And it was funny. But there were so many serious parts in the movie that I did not expect. I would describe it as a play / comedy. But it still worth the money to see, and I still hope it's almost everything. As well as famous Christopher Walken, Robin Williams is his best. They played a very good team in this movie and I really could work together to see how well. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light-hearted movie.
