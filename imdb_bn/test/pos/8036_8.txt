I will not comment on such stories. I agree with most people's comments that it is a good story action story and a good ankle action movie with good acting. <br /> <br /> This movie is 100% eligible for cinematography for its first sequence. The opening shot is stunning and I still have not figured how they do it. The movie is valuable only for that shot! Therefore, the DVD that is currently being released is not only given information for film and filmmaking. Hopefully somebody will come up with a special edition. <br /> <br /> And the best thing is that the sequence is over at the beginning and you're absolutely estimate! Great stuff. A classic movie moments must be for a collector.
