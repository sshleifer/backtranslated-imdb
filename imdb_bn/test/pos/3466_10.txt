I've got some free tickets through Times, I've seen this little Irish movie called Inside I Nachin ... I did not know anything about it, so I had no idea before I entered. <br /> <br> This film is about two people who are limited to their wheelchairs, and live in a house. Michael (Steven Robertson) is suffering from Syrabel Palsy and Rory (James McAay) from the muscular diarrhea. (Please forgive any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, because Rory is the only person who understands what Michael is saying. They finally leave home living in a living room in Curitome. They immediately employ an attractive girl (Romola Garai) to care for them. The two friends eventually fall in love with the same woman. The story says briefly, but there are lots of laughs and tears in the way ... In fact ... I was preparing such a way ... I saw tears flowing very often! Actually! I have cried so much to see the movie from The Elephant Man! This image is a huge drain on emotions ... both fun things and sad things. Actually the spot! James McAye is my tip for glory ... He is a great Irish actor and I think there is a great future in front of him. Michael Steven Robertson was very nice at playing ... and till date I could not find that he was not suffering from Siral Paulis and it was just some extraordinary performance! Brenda Freer is also in this movie and played a very good part of the Home Manager. Another great part should be Romolan Garai, she was amazingly interested in love, and I guess we will see more in the near future on her big screen! <br /> <br /> The thing that produces this film is not only in two leads, but the script ... that's exactly what it is #### surprisingly it's in flames! I still can not help repeating some lines of my head. <br /> <br /> Photography is good, though very slowly, but then it is assumed to be a specific type of area in Ireland. Music is also great in the film, the choice of songs ... Nine inch nail zoning cash cover using 'Hurt' track inspired !! <br /> <br /> If I could add this picture to one word ... it would be 'mental'. This photo is very funny ... and then a currency turn its too sad! I still can not believe that after two days of watching the film, I looked back and smiled and almost crying! This picture is amazing ... and I hope it's far away! Although I can not see it, its advertising budget is probably too small! <br /> <br /> So look! I request you ... do not regret it ...
