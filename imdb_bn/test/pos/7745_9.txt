I've hired this gem many times! It's a small, yet some great composition that takes viewers from Manhattan Glitches to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cosvettes is married to Gena Rowland's wife of his real life wife. She has jumped with Pallus Susan Sarandon, whom she found in Greece, when her daughter played the role of her first movie Ringwald, she read for the son of Greek shipping tycoon, who is traveling in a boat on her land. Neighboring waters. Meanwhile, highly gifted Raul Julia plays a goatherd living in a cave with his Sony Trinity. Until he encounters John Cosvettes, he has "hots" for Molly Ringwald's character. All at the end comes together at the end of a classic closing scene where all is reconciled. The round Julia, the girder, is seen in dance with his goats. This picture is full of mystery, beauty, youth and old love, humor, sex and more. See it!
