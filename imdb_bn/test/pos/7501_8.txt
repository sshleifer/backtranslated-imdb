This movie has some of the best conversations ever written. Really good lines were given to George C Scott, who knew what a person would do with a juicy part of the dialogue. I have seen this movie again, 20+ years for the first time, and the dialogue is just as good as before. Wonderful moving events in the hospital will make you curious. They often involve such incredible poetic justice as a near-stroke stroke. I love this movie !!
