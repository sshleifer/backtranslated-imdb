I saw this film at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, where screenwriter Jos√© Giovanni was honored. It's a great noor-crime-drama, extremely popular like the incredible performance of Belmonto and Leno Ventura. Paying attention to each character and detailed descriptions of complex psychological illustrations, loyalty, betrayal, love and hope are fantastic. It's a wonderful drama, an excellent thriller and an excellent movie. There was Melville with the best. ('Clash Toss Rice' in French, 'The Classes All Risks' in the title 'Classy Tourist', which is the word 'game' in the tourist class.
