** Spinner ** ** <br /> <br /> Reckon: Robbery witness by MacLean (Miller) Plunetate (Karl) that goes wrong. To get to Plunkett's partner shot (and kill) but until he is to consume a great ruby. Plankett and McClean then met in the graveyard when both tried to hold Ruby. Unfortunately they are captured as grave robbers and sent to jail, but Plunkett did not swallow Ruby until. Ruby's freedom is their key, and once they are free, they form a partnership between robbery. McClean has to pose as a gentleman and find out the value of who looted, and then only they loot him (and loot him in style). But MacLean is in love with their first victim, lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler) nephew (?). And a Mr Chance (ST) does not catch them out, and its methods are not very nice ... <br /> <br />: A good action is delicious by comedy and adventure. Karlil and Miller have formed a good team with friction and friendship. And then there is a relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The ball scene is very good, especially the use of music (acceleronistic) songs. In addition to these interesting characters, keeping them all the best in Cumming, Lord Rochester. In character and acting both starred and in the best of movies. Overall, the film works very well, a great balance between stories and special effects, action and comedy. Very entertaining <br /> <br /> 8/10
