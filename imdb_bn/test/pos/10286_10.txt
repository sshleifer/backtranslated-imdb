It has been written about so long ago, instead of adding noise, I want to say a few words to two female actors instead. <br /> <br /> <br /> As a star, in a sense, the spectacular Monica Baluchi v., but Roman Boehinger closed it on the exciting edge. Monica Baluchi is a picture where I love another girl? It is not supposed to happen. <br /> <br /> It has been said thousands of times, but Monica Baluchi hit the worst picture in modern cinema. I have not seen such endless sadness before. Lone Chanir's heart broke and he will not be out of place.
