This year's best French movie! I saw it twice and I found it great both times. I do not think it's annoying though it is very annoying (3 hours). I was seventeen years, so probably I could not survive in the events of 1968, which was marked by a very important counterpart in French history, but it does not really matter that I still enjoy the film. It's actually quite universal: people of my parents' age can identify the characters and so may my old people also be. Gerlele fully understands the young people, how they think and the burden of confusion about the complexity of love as well as the possibility of changing the world. Perhaps the role of Louis Garrell (his son) is played by Philip Garrell intended to represent himself. However, great movies, any step (to be honest in that point) but a strong feeling that you probably will not be indifferent to it. If you are looking for a fast-paced movie on Sunday-evening, do not waste your time in it, you'll be disappointed. But if you like the movie, you would like Les Ammante Reyres, a novel film made in Nouvelle's vague artists 50s and 60s.
