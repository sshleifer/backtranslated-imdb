If you have a strict historical perspective outside of it, this movie is actually quite entertaining. It is one of the premiere casting match-ups of era flin and Olivia de Havilland era in action, adventure and romance and its main roles. As clear on this board, the pictures do not pass the emphasis with purists who find one hundred percent accuracy in telling their stories. To get out of it, just remove the history book, and enjoy the story so that it is a fictional work. I know, I know, considering the last stand of the custodian in the Little Big Horn and it is difficult to work as a specialty in the history of civil war in America's history. So I think there is a conflict of interest in the picture, no matter how you see it. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things to do here for two hours plus to take pictures here. The arrival of a cast at Western Point is probably the first head scraper, as he is running throughout the military regime and siding. Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) The real joke of putting him in the headquarters at the funeral probably found both of them in pain. Ironically, most of these military films are like comedy, the first meeting with Libby Bacon like the cast, and the subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I did not notice it before in other movies, but McDaniel reminded me of one of Montrland's most beloved character actor for fifty years. In such a scenario, it might be a hamming in a dress in Morland. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Stuart is not afraid of anyone else except Olivia de Havilland, against the screenplay of Ronald Reagan's general cast for "Santa Fe Trill". In that film, the history of Reagan's history that showed the colonial and intensity did not remember history, although Flin's imagery is not clear here. But Richard Mulgin of the 1970's "Little Big Man" did not come near the army's hero. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He and his obedience to the man, he led the war during the war. Before the Little Big Horn roamed, there was a final conflict with Arki rival Sharpe, in which he announced that hell or glory were entirely dependent on one's eyes. Previously, a similar comment gave us the best insight into the character of the cast, when he said - "You gain glory with you during your time".
