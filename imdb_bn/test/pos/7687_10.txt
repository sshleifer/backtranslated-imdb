When I was 60, I saw this movie as a child. It took my breath away after it was young. I was covered with black and white TV in front of my seat. Cast I saw the best in my life. The musical one is one of the greatest ever written. In Gershwin and Goldwyn families, please release it from a video or DVD so that we can experience generation and future experiences so that we have seen how great the work we have seen in this art of art. Please do not consider this great man's work go invisible for more years. I pray and hope that the heart of this family will become soft and the world will again see this great movie.
