This image blew me away. I thought I knew a little bit about the Atika Jail Riot. After watching this, I did not know anything. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black prisoner. Both of these men's personal stories and public court drama writings were both writings. The flashback order in the prison was awesome. It is difficult to believe that it was not documentary footage so it was real. It was not just a great part of the drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roper. I give it two thumbs up.
