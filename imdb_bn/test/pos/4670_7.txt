Do not film to see if you want to be intelligent enthusiasts. If you want to have a lot of fun in the theater, this one is the one. Lots of graduate taunts (and really some cheesy banter, too). Very fun as Moses Deff and Seth Green Comic Relief. Exciting and Creative Heists and Chase Scenes Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are interesting keys. And Donald Soreland!
