This Norwegian film is apparently committing suicide, starting with a man jumping on the subway. But the next scene has reached him alone in the desert. He met a man, and started a mysterious city, where he started working as a suspect in a modern office as an accountant. Colleagues seem to be safe, if she is safe, soon she meets a girlfriend, but the city looks totally strange, because there is no taste of food, alcohol does not make you drunk, and there is no child around. Is it a dream, or a hell in hell? Occasionally, movies look like an elaborate episode of The Twilight Zone (even in the 90 minutes, the film seems a little too much), it is very excited. The best scenes are very small, when people participate in outstanding conversation about interior decoration and discuss deeper issues. I always believed that some of the inhuman capitalist societies were inhuman, the way they tried to suppress the basic desire of human nature. And this movie is the best when it criticized this life style devastatingly. Unfortunately, the film has grown a lot and the director does not seem to finish it, but most of the time in the running time is so valuable to look at it.
