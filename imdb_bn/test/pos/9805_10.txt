I rented the movie and bought it that I bought it. Eliass Wood (Mickey) and Joseph Majello (Bobby) are outstanding as two boys. Their new parents physically abuse Bobby. Abuse is done, most of the parts are not seen, and abused children help me roused many emotions Boys' imagination helps them find ways to deal with abuse, because the film has a magical quality. You have to try to understand the story from a child's perspective. I'm still thinking about the end. I have seen the movie 3 or 4 times and every time I think of potentially new money. I'm not sure what Richard Donner wanted to think about me, but it's a nice movie! You must hug your kids to Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood.
