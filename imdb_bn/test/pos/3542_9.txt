Can i say The BBC and Messiah are not only hopes for the greatest great drama. <br /> <br /> Messiah is a great thriller, a truly frustrating and vague story about a series killer that cuts the language of the hunters. And replace them with silver spoons. Before the police officer Red Metcalfe (Kain Stott) and his team lost more lives, there is a work to try to solve the mystery of visible random phenomena. <br /> <br /> Be careful - its rating is up to 15 (in the UK), Messiyah is a great movie suddenly. Some scenes of the killings are similar to SE7EN, and one or two may actually be stomach-hen. But if you can afford it, sit back and enjoy your chair ... although you'll probably be on the edge of it or hide behind it. <br /> <br /> '15' moderate violence and strong fearsome by BTFC.
