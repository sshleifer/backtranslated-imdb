I hate the vampire movie That said, this one was very interesting to me. I want to point out one thing. The word "Bakzegi" literally bats in Korea and we all know that in many classic vampire tales, you see that the Ducula or vampires are turned into a bat and fly or fly to Uweb. We also know that bats are mammals who can classify many as "exceptional" in this way. I saw the movie, I realized that the theme of the film is deeply embedded in this movie rather than creating a bat-vampire connection. <br /> <br /> Duality of human nature = If you ever read the story of Aesop, there is a feeling that mammals and birds are fighting, and the bat can not take only one direction, and it tries to play both sides with its advantage. Mammals and birds find out what this bat is doing, eliminating the bat from their land at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> The nature of the contradiction in human nature is constantly in the war throughout the film. sang-hyun's blind pastor friend, thirsty and his sexual desire, tae-ju, on both sides, his thrill of life, his thrill of finding vampire adventure vs. (you will not destroy too much, see the movie) and this theme is romance, Sex, jealousy, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, beautifully presented on the delicious plates of revenge, you name it! <br /> <br /> I feel like this movie is boring and very long, but this movie is very fresh and new, something that I have not seen yet in B4. I would not say it's the best work of the CW Park, but it's moss. Def Curious impressive yet intriguing!
