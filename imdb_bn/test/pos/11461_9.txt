I absolutely love this movie! There is nothing in this photo of Evil dead! The monster 2 and 3 nights total bore fest, but this one is classic. It's very good and it's okay, but what else can you expect from the horror movies of the 80s? Stooge is one of the best-liners to hit this one screen ever. (He's my favorite character) Many people talk about lipstick scenes in this movie, but my personal favorite ends, sadly there is nothing to do with the original characters, when the old man eats his left over Halloween apple. Pie, and its throat is mangled from inside. The sound track is awesome. With Angela's dancing, the scene is completely vague, especially after the straw lighter, and you can see the jump from one part of the floor to the other with the sound of the camera shutter and later on which the song is going on. The make-up effect of this movie is quite sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a kid. If you are a person who claims fulfillment from your filming experience, you can give it a pass. But, if you're like me, and you really need to digging the ghostly house with all Halloween, giant clich√©, this one must certainly own.
