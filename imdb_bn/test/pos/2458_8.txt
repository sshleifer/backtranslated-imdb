Under a, invisible jewel. Estevez makes an extraordinary job in the excitement between mad, heartfelt fashion, a boy that is in hell and back, and his father, who can not begin to understand the mental scarring left behind. It was not born on July 4th, after working in Vietnam, after working with the psychological and emotional breakdown of the soldiers, but also paid more attention to Vietnam's foreign policy (anti-war speeches, etc.), the police with this much personal issue: the family. After a life-changing experience, a man's struggle to return to normalcy, and his parents failed to see the change that had happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> Istavez offers usable looks like Jeremy Collier. You can understand the bubbles pain and frustration beneath the surface. Inches for an inch, his real life was his father, Martin Shane. This is a tour of each other to close each other, because you have found the idea that they are constantly trying to do one another. It's like to inspire each other to inspire their best work, and it's due to win their performance. <br /> <br /> Recommend that those who appreciate solid acting, writing and guides. And no Vietnam War buff. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
