Now here is a movie that does something that has not been done for a long time. It has ten or more different elements that we already know (vampires, martial arts, techno beats, top-of-the-line special effects etc), and make it something that's something new. Easily make the combination of "Martial Combat" and "Bufi: The Vampire Slayer," Wesley Snipes (no favorites from me and mostly because of "Passenger 57") can make it half-human / half bloody. He acknowledges internal conflicts, but does not do anything more than necessary. Michael Ketton created Batman to create a blood-like character. <br /> <br /> I would say that the only part of the movie that made me a little bit mixed was that the person always wanted to know the current horror movie hero who would stop the bad guy properly. On the other hand, you have to be like it in a movie, so it is easily beneficial. <br /> <br /> Well, snippets are good. And Steven Dorf, promoted in previews, snippets hero is worse than bad guys. To learn how to pull Al Pasino, there is enough control over its class, presence, and its little pinky. Any comic book movie will think that will be a launch pad for an actor? I sincerely hope this. Oh! Where did Chris Christopheros get acting talent? Do not make me wrong, but the brilliant actor did not do anything memorable from "Millennium" and how many of us have seen that this is the reason for the 'great video box? Well, here he is, people are very surprised, as a consultant and a father of blood. And good work, too. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film matches the choreography and the quality of special effects. By beat a Pulsing Tequila, the battle scene comes back and rapidly empties the memory of the Mortal Kombat. Hey! It was a script, too! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not feel sorry for paying a full price, a La ShuMaT "Batman," "Avengers," "MK: Annihilation," "Godzilla , "Or" Armageddon ". (Wow, how many have come this year? Ug) Also, I look at the inevitable sigela as the end of the movie. Let's hope they will work with it as well. <br /> <br />
