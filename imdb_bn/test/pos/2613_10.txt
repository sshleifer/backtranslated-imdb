It's a talk, happy trigger, alcoholic ass cop! I saw the first and second phase. Artwork and animations fit very well (facial expression notes, lol). The main character is a gun, wearing a badge, wearing a butt cheek, any person is considered offensive or "guilty". So far, Episodes have simple and follow-up plots that work very well with Asi's investigation. Don Sanchez, Asi's partner, A.A. of the assie of the sport. The antics and the slogan "I got a bunch" leads. Asi's lines are very interesting and clever, for example, "I have a bullet and got your email address in it, do not let me hit me" * bang * "Looks like there's something new in your inbox." Asi Maggi's headquarters Thinking is so far, consistent and in the queue. As the sound, it is perfect, sound effects and voice work is 9/10. Asi selevelaster sounds like Stalin, everyone is drowned, Don Sanchez, the mayor, the police chief, everyone has such a voice that the person's "fit" is very good. Anyone who wants to smile before I go to bed recommends this, because it airs adult swim on Sunday night. Very funny, fantasy, apparently different comedy. 10/10
