Although this film is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it is the highest maximum. I had a little smile about it and just had a good feeling almost all of it. It's very often we will see two old Geezers with a good time with fun and genuinely joke with their age. Walter and Jack together were such great chemistry friends / brothers in law. Just because these women were romantic to show their romantic and you rooted them all for them, we did not have to admit it, for their age, they still had to play! : D how old I can be and how old I can be. If you want, I would recommend this movie for a beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> 7/10
