"Tourist Trap" is actually a wonderful low-budget horror movie that will definitely satisfy the horror fans. It has a very strange atmosphere and there are several perfect moments of total fear and scary. For example, some scenes are seated to take dinner with Manquin, who is involved with the absolute seamless Chuck Conres living, and starts conversations with her before heading down. Very few cows, but violence for PG-rated horror films is quite strong. Menquines feel terrible and Climax is awesome. David Schmoeller returned to create several other films, including "Croplaces", "Puppet Master" and "Netherlands". Yet "Tourist Trap" is definitely his best horror film, so if you want to get scared, give this little wax a look. <br /> <br /> PG rates for short nudity, violence and profanity.
