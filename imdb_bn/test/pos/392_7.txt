Dylan and Bobby are friends of childhood and they sometimes love young boys that way. But Dylan has met a girl and those childish things are starting on one side. Bobby knows that he is not interested in girls and misses what Delan has lost. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture has come with a lot of memories and has hit me with a genuine genre, but I think the filmmaker has moved a bit and kept it in a happy note. Yes, we all love and lose, even in my childhood, but tomorrow is always there, especially when we are young.
