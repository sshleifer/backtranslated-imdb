Black Castle is one of those movies, which has found the way to the collection of Boris Karloff and is expected as a wrongly awaited movie. Although there are some awful elements in Nathan Gauer's film, it's really a piece of pieces that are produced and illustrated effectively. A small but important role in joining Karl is that of Richard Green, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr., Rita Corde, John White, and Michael Jute. It produced, uniquely, universal international images outdoors. This plot travels to Greene's English gentleman's terrible Count Von Bruno (McNally) Castle. He is investigating the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is related to the danger and surprise every time. <br /> <br /> This is something that fans of old dark houses / fortresses want. Genuine good and bad guys, dark works, devil trap, dark corners to finish the clock, and we even get a good swashbuckling bit in old fashion sense. Cast is all effective performance, especially green and nicely sneering MacNally. In the context of Jerry Steveham's lean and uninterrupted Filler, which often fools the same film. Carllepe's fans are not really that carloaf film, and perhaps more importantly, a highly recommended film by the horror fans who do not expect blood to order the day. A fine atmospheres with full horror ideas, The Black Castle, is a delicate viewing experience. 7/10
