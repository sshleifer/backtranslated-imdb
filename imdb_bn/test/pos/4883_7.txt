OK, why complain about this movie? Imagine it Deal with it. If you want to watch the biography, watch it watch. This is an original, fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. Those emotional, they will complain about it, because they make all other deviations of events. Even though sadness is true. I think why the Kid Holder was named in the film which had a great idea. I was not so good at it first, I would be honest. But that's just made it scarier. If you like the bump, ad gin or movie based on real events, I think it's a good movie. But if you are covered (like some other people) stay away from this movie and everyone else.
