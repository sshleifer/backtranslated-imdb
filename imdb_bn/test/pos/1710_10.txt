"Saturday afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's most known little things and for good reason. This is one of his fun and best movies. Plot - as it is - an old staple: a chicken husband tears away his husband and some of his daughters away for the night. This is a hard and well-known comedy plot, but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself. His slow, inefficient, rebellious, innocent character blurts his way in a marriage with a woman who thinks that all his people should be governed by iron fists, and he is only cheated on it because he can not tell the kiss Vernon Dent And the cute petals - "No" on the advice of the girl's sidewalk. <br /> <br /> This is a very adult problem for a helpless, child-like character. Harry does not want to cheat, but he can not do anything about it. Wonderful bits are wonderful bits, she can not bring herself to burst the kiss of new girlfriend: she punished it as she slowly pushed to push her kisses and shamefully wipes her hand off. This movie is a three-star comedy, more than ten minutes ahead of two relayers, Harry Langdon previously played Mac Senate without any plots. Perhaps it was designed to be even two relayers. It works nicely, since it gives him time to slow down the reaction and the wonderful shiny and half-verse where his comedy lives. <br /> <br /> She is the best of hers here, and the show is really the power of Harry Langdon's strange magic and almost nothing comedy spin. His little half-smile, seeing his face, he is hiding under the rage and, ultimately, a small effort to enter the war. I think his comedy acknowledges our fundamental innocence and misunderstanding that is much more for us than we think of the whole world, but at the same time, Harry does not allow to understand what he does (for example, true women encourage their friend to bring joy , Since he thinks that the date has been blown in fact is actually) he realized with some sadness Forced us to say that we are no longer innocent. His comedy is capable of hearing us as "owl", as it often laughs us, often at once. <br /> <br /> Here, Harry wants to deny his wife to cheat, she wants to tell his wife whose boss and some power comes back to her relationship, she ultimately wants to fight two violent men. The film, but he just can not influence that in its surroundings, and sometimes we all feel like that. <br /> <br /> The film is entirely directed by Harry Edwards, the Langdon director; Harry Langdon still produces time for the best effect of the reactionary comedy, and it moves quickly at the time of presentation and never stalls. The frequent frequencies of Langdon, Vernon Dent, became a comedy partner with a very successful pair with Harry. Gags are spread in a way that gives the greatest effect and Harry ends his own version of Lloyd or Keton's Style Stunt. Here is not one of the big reactions of the comedy Harry, who is sitting in two running cars, but in the slowness of it. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of a ridiculous film and comedy. A unique gifted humorous one I already know.
