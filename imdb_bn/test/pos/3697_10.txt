This movie is a wonderful, memorable emotion in Jade and Billy and the act was fantastic, so you are 16 years old and do not leave a young man together! It shows why a single mother does not give a young person a date to a teenage girl, because she thinks enough young to be Jessi's son. <br /> <br /> I had ten of ten, the acting was wonderful and the movement between the actors was correct. <br /> <br /> The difference between Jenny and Rob was very good, because they were the same in age. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie but I would see this movie due to sexual scenes of anyone under 13 years old.
