(Very quietly spoilerish) <br /> <br /> I must say that I was generally not influenced by science fiction, so pitch black (2000) was a wonderful surprise. It was tied with rhythm, intensity and visual explosions at the very beginning, which impressed me in my seat. I said, this movie was the best (okay, at least the best * one * best) science fiction piece which I saw long, long time. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, a cold blooded killer, Roddick (Vin Diesel, who plays a role in a very believable additional style) may seem to be the biggest problem in the group, but the crossing begins in the evening, the nightlife begins to awaken ... from the bloodstream hunters It's a great effort to escape, which we all can guess, it's a happy family picnic Who does not manage. <br /> <br /> It's not a plot that makes the film valuable - - After all, let's face it, if you put it in the bottom, it's * not * real - but what it says is that skill. The story flows forward, do not leave yawning at me (at least not much). The instructions were fabulous work. It was a very visual, even beautiful movie; The purple night scene was a real treat. Although, 'beautiful' can not be the right word to use; Yes, the images shown were candy in front of the eye, but they added indefinable diversities, generosity, even some touching blurring from the bottom of the surface. (Not to mention that the monsters were really good, they looked realistic, which seems rare nowadays [Maybe people can not be bothered to see it as real ...] <br /> I do not enjoy the visual side of the movie, but the story We enjoyed the mental visions. During the movie we can unknow the letters - some of them fall, some of them have grown - but I was fascinated by the character of Raidik, and I enjoyed watching changes in the movie. "To go even further, I used to enjoy the other thing with Riedic, it was incredibly good and basically the US (Friends Tension) fries, and" no " (What would I mean after you see it). [One chemistry could not deny. Even try Do not do or I'll find you and play chopsticks, you'll hear me until you * scream * fresh. * Radha Mitchell once said (a revised quote), "Pitch Black is really a sexy movie without any sex", which it Makes it more interesting. So, for summarizing, I recommend this movie - even if you do not really have a fan of "space story" The secret was kept to the very end and what was important, we (or at least I was) wanted more. You can not be bothered to think about psychology, theorem and such (as my bad habits), you will still find pitch black very entertaining. Just takes your shoes off and enjoy it.
