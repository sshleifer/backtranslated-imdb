I first saw this movie as a teenager (now I'm in my 40's), and long time considered it as my favorite movie. The story is running very fast, without feelings. Acting, especially by March and fusion, is dead. And for her role, Dana Andrews is too old to get away with the romance of her romance with Theresa Wright (I believe that the film is still the only living character). This may be the next postmodal melodyma, but the script and cast can happen only very well.
