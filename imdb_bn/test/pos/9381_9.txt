George Barry's "Death Bid: The Bid It Eats" is basically a dark fairy tale called through a horror-film structure. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s and it was a neutral criminal that was originally distributed without the knowledge of theft and Barry (people responsible for this theft should be fed to bed). If you search for grave or shocking steps, "Death Bid: The Bid It's It's" is not a surprise for you. "Death bed" is a gentler, weirder drive-photo; It's like a completely strange dream, half remembered. I propose to read Stephen Thrower's "Death Bid" tombs, which is "Nightmare USA" in the Faab Press book in Thaavarah (she's fully considered in the movie). Whether deliberately or not, I noticed the shadows of "Death Bid" from "magic" / slipstream fiction by the authors as a Kelly Link from "Mint Sovi"'s "Cemetery Man" of "Fantas" movies. Barry is a real and perfect world. I'm sure he followed "Death Bid", which is, along with several amazingly diverse movies.
