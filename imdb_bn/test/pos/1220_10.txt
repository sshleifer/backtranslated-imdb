I never heard of this movie as Katrina Movie, but I ran across it while searching for something to rent. I had high hopes for this movie based on Flax, while in the film. I have not seen him precious anything This movie is true for me distributing. I enjoyed the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. Sunny Tasha Smith, Essence Atkinson and Surely Tangi Miller I really liked this movie a lot. I could not give it five stars because it did not discuss anything that I think the film was in detail. The issue was resolved, but I appreciated the discussion of the solution of the issues. I liked the movie so much that I was already renting and after watching it the movie was purchased.
