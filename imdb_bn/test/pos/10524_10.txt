The movie was released 8 years before my birth, I can not think it is too bad for so long. Returning to January 98, I joined the second annual Quintin Tarantino Film Festival in Austin, Texas. The special theme of this night film was "Neglect of 70 criminal films" and the boy was entitled to it. "The Gravy Train (or Dean Brothers, it can be seen as this print)" was an absolute jewel. Wonderful performance, quirky characters, smart plots, comedic comedy, and just about a great time. You rarely see an entertaining and fresh criminal film. Margot Kidder is very sexy in one of her first film appearances. I hope some cable network gets a hold of this movie and it gives more to see it. Meanwhile, go to an indoor video store and hope they have it.
