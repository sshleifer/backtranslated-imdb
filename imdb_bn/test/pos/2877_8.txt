So WWE did it. They have entered the film; Their first viewing was No Evil, their own Kenny acted. I grabbed this movie and it was not expected as a great movie ... it just seems to be cliche and something new. My surprise was that it was actually half bad. It has been said on a visitor that it is a good b-horror movie fun, and the best way to describe it honestly. Now the question I was asking myself is why it may shake ... OK, say, he made a very bad ass from the character of 'Jakob Shuvratri'. She really sold a good role, and really look boring look. But what can you expect from somebody who is 7 feet taller than somebody and about 320 of difficult muscles? The performance was good, and the story was certainly not something new, but we all know. As well as cinematography along with instructions have been done very well and the hotel's backdrop is really sculpture and works well. It was indicated by a pornographic movie director, I was quite amazed. You would suggest this movie if you look vain and killed and looking for some overall fun. Think of this movie as a modern day after Friday 13th film. And save the room for the very end, cuz it's a good one. And after the credit stick ...
