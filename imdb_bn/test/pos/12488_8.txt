A wonderful, ridiculous mix of music hall (most of the first three cases) and the police systemic mystery begins to collapse various suspected stories. If you do not see closely, the final exposure of the murder can be astonishing. Time to look at a kitten in Paris. You can skip the final scene (Hollywood end). Louis Juevette is the best in police inspector, who seems to be going through only, but really the top.
