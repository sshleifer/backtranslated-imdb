My first VHS tape was with Maranan, America and Greece married. After all these years, I found this photo's tender memories. Hell, my film VHS is in good condition. <br /> <br /> Story: Mafia member Francis "Kakuro" de Marco (Alake Belvedin) was sent to spy crime superintendent Michael Doni (Matthew Modin) Mandela's wife Angela de Marco (Michel Pofifar). He later fell in love with her after he could understand all this innocent later. Angela will not only have to deal with the unwanted advances of public Tony "Tiger" Raso (Dean Stockwell), she must also deal with her jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Rougele). <br /> <br /> Married mob puts your interest in funny and still not trying to be funny. I understand the life of the mafia (skull mafia wife, public boss that it is not a chick magnet etc) and it takes little jabs that you like the letters of Angelo de Marco and Mike Downey. Jhanan Dame had the last stage of his tragic stage and he gave you gems like Philadelphia and the Silence of the Lambs (the best thriller of all time). If you are in comedy mode, married to the mob is a keeper. This is better than the comedy that has passed for nowadays (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Spartan, Disaster Movie etc).
