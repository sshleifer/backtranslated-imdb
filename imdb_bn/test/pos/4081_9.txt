As a former businessman, I was really interested in this movie: I was personally involved in searching for a person to go to Kingston Jamaica. Although we had regional boundaries we managed to get him shelter. I was at Stowwave on another ship and due to passport / nationality we could not take him anywhere. In fact, he was a member of the "honorable" crew for almost a year and worked for him. Africa is notorious for stowaway pickups Bulk carrier: There is a great view at the beginning of the movie when entering the African port: its size is all dwarf The crew pop shelters for a small communality and inertia. So natural. The drama started when the ship entered the ship of a huge ship. As a representative of his credit company, Jobs Acquan, as a captain with his sample sutteen, as the captain of the dressing problem. Stowaway's search was classic but we did not have guns. I question the use of these pictures guns. This ship seems to have a huge operation. In my experience, sea guns are restricted due to customs restrictions. Also, the dog on the board was odd; Anti-RAB laws prevent the animals from carrying heavily in Europe. However Pertwee is embittered as brilliant as Met. The horrors that are scared after the appearance of the victim are unbearable: ships have a metallic background and have a feeling that adds no space to the play. Some freight crew members are not involved in the killing and those who are involved in a gradual violence in a world that need no escape. The view of the engine room, especially through the ships, is "the edge of the seat": the feeling of extreme clustrophobia feeling. The feeling of metal pressure and death is getting away from a gun barrels. Image is brutal: My girlfriend was allowed to see it during shooting and during visible scenes. If you go to this suction, you will be unconscious after drunk three decks of comfort cabin comforted. This is an acute film, fragmentary in part, but the real message is that we all can scream in such violence. Slowly and surely. Imagine the train drivers who took the Jews to the Jews, who worked for that train. I always remember anyone visiting the Dacca Concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that a group of SS guards kept a bird table outside Sharma. This image is like this: The general people suddenly find themselves in a world of unrestricted violence!
