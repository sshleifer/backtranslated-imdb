During the American Civil War, in Northern Colorado, Cold Mountain, Reverend Monroe (Donald Switterland) arrives in a small town with health, due to her health, shy Ad Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Ada meets the lajuk inman (jude law), and they fall in love with each other. In the beginning of the war, Inman became a soldier, and his great support for survival was once again the desire to see Ada in Cold Mountain. Meanwhile, Ada Ruby Theus (Renee Gelweger), one of the war survivors, who helped him on the farm and became his best friend. The story alternates current and past situations, reveals a beautiful romance. I liked this film a lot. Philippe Symur Hoffman, Supporting Support for Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribici, Anthony Minghera has given a great direction and seven indications of the Oscars, the film is not frustrating. My comments are deleted in the story and there are some very important scenes presented to the DVD. At least one of them, Sara, her baby and the three dead body of her farm shows what happened, as it should not be removed. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'
