This wonderful movie captures a family comedy with fun, entertaining, sweet and memorable things, it is difficult to determine where to start. <br /> <br /> from the first number, "Rainbow Connection", Paul Williams is a wonderful kid. Frog sings with Gosto, which talks about the story of the priest about our whole adventure, it's a funny movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < On the way, our green heroes meet with a series of other aspiring actors, curious people, singers, and musicians, who coincide with the Kumkit-like Muppate. How does this muppet really start? "How did it happen," Kimit tells us. <br /> <br /> No, "this is a mad, indispensable, mad, mad world", and has been used successfully. Aspiring they face many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; Some just embrace the screen, but others have a very memorable Cayo. Steve Martin's amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best. Jim Henson of the doll urged his inspiration, Edgar Bergen is particularly touching. <br /> <br /> Anyone who saw Muppets TV shows will see all their favorite characters, they are all here. The doll works superb; Especially for Kemeritike biking (see how to date). Jokes and references in old films are everywhere, but the best one-liners themselves are reserved for kimrite. For example: When the mischievous terrorists kill Kemerit and Piggy, she tears her short, green and handsome bees, "I will not leave this evening together, do not I?" "Uhh, give me a proposal ...." I love him even in a gunshot in Koral's view: brightly stupid, impressive. <br /> <br /> Now, "Muvin" is right "short", but it should be summarized: a beautiful film of nature that anyone can enjoy regardless of the taste or taste of movies or movies during adolescence. Highly recommended.
