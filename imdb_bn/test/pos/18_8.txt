"The Dasharra" is probably the most refined of backstage films. The film's "energetic" character in Norman (Tom Courtesay) is mostly fascinating with wit and spirits for the role. Although her character is explicitly gay, she certainly attracts the attraction of her main actor (Albert Finne) that she does not live in the movie or do more than that. <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Yeats is an exhibition that works well in "Bullet" and gives the film a sense of reality and consistency. This is very much appreciated in a story that can easily get tired. In the end, "The Dreser" will fool many people, but it will be really happy for those who love real British movies. <br /> <br /> <br />
