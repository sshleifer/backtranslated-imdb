I originally released the theater, probably this image was seen almost a dozen times. Whoever calls this movie trash or horror does not understand or does not recognize well-known action films. Perhaps some incidents and results may appear to be so numerous, but in my opinion, print author Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) will be one of the best thought-provoking action events. This film keeps flowing like clock and action just coming up or not. I've never seen the final action sequence in any film. Cast this picture hard. Zenna Davis gave an amazing performance and it was not a shameful shame "LKG" series. Samuel L. Jackson is delighted down a down to help her find her lost past beneath her personal eye on her luck and make a few bucks as her lucky march. If someone does not like this movie then I am disturbed. It's so exciting and its fun pack. After 10 years I still laugh at the advertisement of this film. In my opinion, the first Matrix film and Long Kiss are the best and most of the main action flickr of the goodnight 90s. Eventually Shane Black created a fate when she sold this script. At the time it was the highest selling plaque and worth every money. It is very sad that the audience did not give this opportunity to the movie because they saw Ronnie Harleen's best film and Jane Davies, as you have never seen before. Long Live "Long Kiss Good Night" !!
