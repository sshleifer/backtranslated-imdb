This is a highly engaged series which portrays well and portrays a sensitive issue with great greatness. For the infiltration of a terrorist base under the leadership of Fire (Oder Feahr), we follow Michael Eli as the secret information Facebook agent Darwin. The series is very well written, and there are enough plot twists that await you to be seated on the edge of your seats, waiting for what will happen next. <br /> <br /> According to my definition, Michael Eli is one of my best actors to see a secret agent filming. Outside the cold cold, but still a good man trying to keep his head afloat on his higher mental roller-coaster street that had embarked on him a good man at the bottom. On the other hand, Oder Fehr has come from a man who can be very fit in a social scene. Large and powerful, but so able to disappear into gray masses if needed. Very official and extremely cute. The two communication methods on the screen are not spectacular. <br /> <br /> The story is developed and the details of the script offer are true, and the truth about life is true. Imagine that. This is the intensity that you are feeling insecure, not knowing what can happen next in real life. We read about terrorism every day, and here we are taught a good sticky one underworld which most of us know very little. <br /> <br /> This is a series that will definitely come back for you, sitting next to your seats and waiting for the next week's episode. This is a sure winner in my eyes, and I have no problem that this series is always on my best list.
