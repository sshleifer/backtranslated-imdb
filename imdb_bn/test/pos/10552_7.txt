This is estimated to ecliping French style in another case of Hollywood pride. Originally, Mono CE Heroes was one of the most charming movies of 1991, so naturally Hollywood accountants thought that they could rent Depardieu and others could call. But they took care of Francis Weber for writing in English. Although the version actually uses the original word for each. Depardieu brings his Gallic charm and shows all the promises that Catherine Heigl is paying off now. The matter is, when the French make a kind of lolita-light, they take it because the 'dirty French postcard' thought works for them; Here is the concept of lightweight subtle Hollywood, Depardieu (fully informed that her daughter is actually calling her lover), 'French some' plays a role in playing and singing, Girls. See the original.
