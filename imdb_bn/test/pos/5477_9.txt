I've reviewed some of these movies and enjoyed it. Although Clint Eastwood is its normal spirit, the overall story works well on Washington DC limits <br /> <br />: A murderer is monitoring the president, and only one person can save him. <br /> <br /> Creating a movie is not easy that the audience enjoys these days, enjoy this day. This film is successful in various levels. Eastwood wanted to save the President of the Kennedy era, his usual departed hero. He did this role well, as well as his foil, Renee Rousseau (an FBI agent), Malkovichi's overall performance and suspicion with the extra stars. 9/10
