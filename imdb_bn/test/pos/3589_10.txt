This is the most stunning and amazing documentary I've ever seen without any doubt! The picture that is shown is absolutely breathtaking and stunning. Above that, it's a wonderful learning experience. I'm not the only one for educational documentaries, but it keeps you up and does not let you go to the end. You will be so hooked and entranced by watching you so that you will forget to watch TV at home! This series is available to buy DVDs and I highly recommend picking this one! With all evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us evidence that life is beautiful and worth preserving and saving.
