During the film I smiled several times even though it gives an eye on the surveillance and you think it was something else. I present these gobsmackingly beautiful tableaux as the way of worshiping ways and ways to slowly burn in you. Anderson gives us something else here. Shows something that is not seen from our latest movie. He is exceptionally exceptional and the way of fixing the camera and allowing us to perform tasks in front of us, he opened the door of humanity and we will go to a place where our own life, our little life reflects. It's a strong element. This is the simplicity by which he lets events occur, which creates an opposite feeling of complexity. Everything is simple but nothing behind the camera. Anderson's attention is extraordinary for details. I believe most of the scenes, unless all are set to scratch, according to its design. I can not highly recommend this film. It took me to a place for me and I have come out here to see that the world is beautiful and beautiful, starred and painful, brutal and pretty. Once alien and known. This film is bright and affirming life. I know the sunny feeling is a surprise. It took him seven years to do this. If he only made this film, he would still be there with the great.
