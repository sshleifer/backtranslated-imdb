The main point of the movie, the IMO, is nothing but the whole life of the youngest. The movie secretly hides its gray root and hides the empty tissue box. The strange thing is that she is hiding from her hawk. If he can hide a lot of hidden things from his beloved, then he can keep something bigger from other people involved in his life. <br /> <br /> When Joanna accidentally leaned toward Correa, the police left the scene. When he was returning, the police and ambulance commented at his community, "What kind of child hit a child and then let him out?" Respecting to his community, he decides to remain silent about what he has done. But, he never realized how difficult it would be to face him ... <br /> <br /> Great movie - I saw it many times!
