"East side story" Stalinist has a musical comedy in Russia and later a documentary from Eastern European satellite comedies, which includes many clips from the living and commentary from the living. Although some Stalinist films seem ridiculously bad (as a significant exception to The Bright Road (?)), The films of the 30s are actually quite good. "My wife wants to sing," "White Mouse," and "Midnight Revolution" seem especially entertaining. The producer had to oppose the censors, which had the power to determine the political power was right, which led to some confusion, became ridiculous in the past, since the sensors are trying to enjoy the people, they are beginning to support filmmaking! Since the musical comedy was very rare behind Iron Carton - in forty years there was something like forty years - there was incomplete effects on their viewers, who made a big hit of some pictures. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the word for the sixties films was even better. Managers often had to work with old equipment and strict power regulation - they had to film less or less dangerous office officers in seven minutes. <br /> <br /> I noticed that "West Side Story" seems to have a strong influence on "hot summer". The next film can not measure up to "Singin" in the rain, "but they certainly look like they" beat bye birdy "to beat the hell.
