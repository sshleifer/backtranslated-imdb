I really love something great done by this great movie writer / director, Savage Steve Holland. Also see "Better of Dead" and "How Do I Go to College". Excellent! However this movie is really ridiculous and distributes some unexpected things. Where else can you see Demi Moore as a talent such as a talented singer and Bobcat Goltawat? I recommend to some old fashioned slopstick comedy (including Georgian Turtle Refift), not to mention some really written restrictions (christmas tree on the roof of the car). This movie throws you off unexpected things even if you have seen me like 100 times! Enjoy!
