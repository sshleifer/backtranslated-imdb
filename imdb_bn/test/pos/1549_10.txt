In the late 60's, in the unanimous study of the Joy era, Kenny was the star performer, who became one of the most famous and respected British filmmakers of all time. Then I knew very little about the fracture, politics or officials, and I was very impressed by the aesthetics of the film, its free style, its strong painter, and the monologues of winning in front of the camera. I was surprised to see Terrence Stamp (who became a celebrity, "Billy Bud", "The Collector", and "Modity Blaise") got so little screen time. The 20th Century Fox distributed "poor cows" in Panama, but the mainstream cinematic of Loch's film (which was rarely a picture) was not enough and I lost contact with his movies. I've just heard about his success, "Case", "Family Life", "Black Jack". Until I caught up in 80's. Songs of beautiful titles by Donovan, by the way, are found in his texts "Traudauur".
