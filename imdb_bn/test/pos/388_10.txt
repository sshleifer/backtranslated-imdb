Alfred Hitchcock has created many brilliant thrillers, and many of them congratulate like the greatest films of all time. This movie is a movie lost under the Verito and Cyco; A stranger is a train, the most compelling movie that Hitako ever made. The story follows Guy Haynes, a tennis player and can soon marry a Senator's daughter, if she can get a divorce from her current wife. One day, on his way to see his wife, he met mentally troubled Bruno Anthony on the train and soon entered the plot of the murder that he could not stop or stop; And ultimately he could spend his life. <br /> <br /> The conversation on the Bruno and Cure train is the greatest and most worrying of all time. If two people "change" the murder, then solve all doubt of the crime and make their purpose irrelevant? Could this really be the perfect kill? This movie makes it even more intriguing that the events that Guy chooses can be a normal daily person. Everyone is someone whom they want to get rid of, so if you kill a madman on a train for you and then force you to do his work? This possibility is unlikely, but it is the idea that anyone can be a murderer, which is the center of unknown messages on trains; And in this situation, someone could. <br /> <br /> Which actor of the world made the character of Bruno Ananthe better than Robert Walker? People are simply born for the part. He simply managed to catch the right mood for his character and gave every direct command of each scene. The character of Bruno is crazy, but he is not crazy; He makes a counting, conniving person and Robert Walker character credible. His performance is extremely rogue, and yet enough characters in character to keep the characters in reality reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died unexpectedly on a train just a year later, and I believe that this is a great loss for the film. None of the crows are as much as walking, but his cousin Farrell Granger is notable. Granger does not really affect that, but his performance is good enough and he is owned by Waqar. Notable about his performance is that he is portraying his character as a very normal person; And that's not how it should be done. Ruth must be the wife of the Roman Guy. She really does not have enough film to make a lasting impression, but she does what makes her well. Alfred Hetcock's daughter Patricia Guy's drunk sister, Barbara, played a key role in the four central roles. In this role he was lovely, lovely and he kept stealing those scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a shot especially, which is committed to reflecting a glasses at the beginning . It creates a brilliant shot and a great atmosphere for the scene. Much of Hitako's direction remains in Moody and much of the film follows the style of Nir. The last episode of the film is both spectacular and exciting, and I do not think anyone other than a hitchcock could pull the great effect of showing it in this movie. It is really overblown, and from the rest of the movie; But it works. Hitco is often referred to as the greatest director of all time, and because it is not just using the script to tell the story of the film, but using the camera to do so. One of the greatest thrillers ever made a train stranger is Her story is both stimulating and thought-provoking, and any fan in the movie is sure to be happy. A Best Composition
