Well, if this film was made much later in the history of the movie, it would not be particularly useful. However, in 1898, the films were in their childhood and they were almost neutral and they did not have any true story - instead of just showing normal daily activities showing everyday people. If it is seen today, almost all are frustrating and very few, very small - less than a minute! And so in this light, this small clip of a movie is quite swuff stuff and you can just laugh. Two guys, a miller and a chimney swim fall into each other as the garbage collapses on each other and cast coal dust. That's all - you know it before the end of the film.
