I like this movie. The next day after the Girl Openers, at the Toronto International Film Festival it has been seen in a packed house which has gone well. Director, Gordon Hood was considered to be present for today's screening, but his genes were born just a few hours ago, so he had to jet on the flight. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rendition refers to 'unusual transformation' - without the legal consent of parents of a word that can be sent to suspected terrorists in the United States. The United Nations will be imprisoned and detained in foreign countries. <br /> <br /> It's fairly predictable - innocent Egyptian-American people started traveling from South Africa to Washington DC on charges of being a wrongdoer. She is sent abroad, when the wife (Ridge Witherspoon) in the house struggles to find him and free him. But what makes this movie especially some wonderful choices in the storytelling: 1) a story of a local story where a suicide bomb blast happened; 2) Understand the humanity of the CIA agent and try to be honest with what is really going on; And 3) story-story chronology which makes it a tight, curiosity story that moves and blows right at the moment. Ah - relief! And fight for the end of a mix of emotion surrounding the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
