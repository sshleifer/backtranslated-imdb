I really liked this picture - there was not so much for the story (which was right, but it was a little slow in staining) but Moroso for incredible scenes of Greece and Greek islands! Susan Sarandan is fully involved in John Hoodish's helpless love interest - a man "at the end". But visible! Oh oh oh!
