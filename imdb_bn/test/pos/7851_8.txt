I was amazed about this early activity of Clint Eastwood. I decided to watch it on TV, when I did not read the essence of the film. Because of Mr. Eastwood, I do not expect some nice shooting and a deep story. I was pretty wrong. I have found some of the most explicitly addressed topics, and in the end, I can not raise my mind about who is good and who is bad. This movie is definitely not Eastwood generally, but certainly worth looking for.
