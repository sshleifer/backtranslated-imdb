Despite some adaptable adaptations of some of the main themes of the book, Quinn of the Dummed / Vimier did not think of the story of Anne Rice's story. If the deep layer that creates all the letters is not just a completely different identity, then only their surface is torn apart. The growing sequence of major events in the film seems distorted and disrespectful. <br /> <br /> However, for the availability of my rating 7, the movie was a few things. One was that the film was strongly influenced by Lestat (among other vampires) in public, especially young girls. This film has done a fairly good job by focusing on the importance of inheritance and history, which the vampires boast. Sex scenes were also atmospheric satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The role of Dammonde was moderate, if frustrating. Stewart Townsend and Aliya: There is a wonderful chemistry, though the performance shows (not often) at its best. The letter is nothing compared to the ones established in interview with a vampire. It lacks the mental intelligence of all the embarrassing feelings, which is shameful because Queen Rani's queen of Rice and she had more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The effect is dull and very frustrating. Many scenes require additional features, and the dialog is tedious. The settings for many scenes do not portray them in the book, and I think they have not been taken from too many stories. There are only a few areas of incoherence at the beginning of the film and in the middle, but it provides a complete story of the audience (if they do not read the book), they are quite clearly decorated. <br /> <br /> Something that needs the movie, I think, instead of mixing rock music, a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein) includes; Although I did not have some music problems Another thing that can make the movie better is good direction. The scenes were annoying and vague, which is most important in a storytelling tour. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The entire series of destructive stories was a frustrating but not surprisingly important post. With some simple changes, it may be a very successful part of the film. I would recommend this movie to people who have seen interviews or books, so that they can take their own opinion about adaptation.
