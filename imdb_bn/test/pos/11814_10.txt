When the movie "Treatment" starts, we can learn about a young man named Eric (Brad Renfro). Eric, a young boy living with his younger mother and a small boy named Dexter (Joseph Majello) living next to him. One day, Eric and Dester add to the supermarket, where the dictator gets the taste of his first Butterfunger. When Eric learns that Dexter has AIDS, he tries to make leaves and water for tea better. But when in front of the National Enquirer in Dhaka, a doctor from New Orleans has found AIDS remedies, nothing will stop nothing from going to New Orleans for the cure of both children. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "treatment" is sometimes one of the best friendship films made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his best friend, and his best friend. Everything is done so well, nothing needs to be changed. I just do not give it a 10/10 as a nice friendly movie, but it's a sad, but fun, and fun eda movie. And the sad ending with the dexter's compression of AIDS is enough to give me a tier. Have done very well.
