This movie was obviously an early attempt for a new director, but it is still real and entertaining, and in some moments it becomes anxious. However, I would like to say that the story did not come along with star performances as Paul Anthony as a pip. He has made good written parts very credible and influenced, and more vulnerable written portions are more portable. Also, I have mentioned performance by Alan Cumming. It was refreshing to see a part like her. He brings a weight in his role, which provides a very important element to the film. Paul Anthony: Who is this guy? Why did not I see him more? Please give him more role, please!
