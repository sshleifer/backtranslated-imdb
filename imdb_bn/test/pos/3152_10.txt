I have a little hobby to find a lot of beautiful pictures - and then let people know about them, to get the word this summer is at the top of my list. This indie film (and I really want to say Indie - Miramax, Fox Searchlight Indy) may be easy to look at the larger scale of celluloid, but if you want to do something completely different, you have to check it out. <br /> <br /> Basically, I thought it was totally great. I want to know from DVD cover front and back that this is going to be something completely different, but they all said that their staff is different to hook you up. Well this one is really completely different. It's in your mouth: nice and scary and unashamed you say awake War, peace, 9/11, poems, an old time "patriotic" song of a great video and set to a strange person in RV. I want to say more? Just see it.
