I grew up outside of Nine Germany (where they landed), every detail of the film is 100% authentic, power lines that they fly, helpless neighbors, grandparents say they are not seeing West German TV etc. This film has given a lot of good memories to Europeans, which is a great production from Disney ... The same German film uses Claus Loieich and the English version of Gunter Meiner to translate the English version into German ... They use dog birds in the German version, A bird that is telling you as a negative word in Germany that you are in Germany. I showed this step to my German relatives and they really liked this movie. They created a prototype balloon that they were released because the elements they used were very holesome and the other two balloons that they used to run. When the propylene cylinders rise up, the problem of burners is solved.)
