Maybe my rating should have been 9, but the movie surprised me while watching it for the first time and confirmed my initial belief of my last visit. Stylish Yes, scoped opinions with each scene have a perfect sound side with them, made awesome corners. <br /> <br /> Keep the top acting from Tony Servillo in particular, garner it with one of the most beautiful and charming women, Olivia Magnani, and a fine plot and you will end up watching this short masterpiece over the end. <br /> <br /> The next movie of the Paulo Sorrentinos "El Amico de Famiglia", which is this year's Cannes Festival competition, will be generously waiting.
