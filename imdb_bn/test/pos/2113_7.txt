We all enjoyed the movies. It is a very charming family film with many fun comes. Austin acted in the film, Charlie Robinson, Joe Ely and Robert Earle Kiine, and met with famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially attractive in the film, although all the children are good. Western Texas scenes are great as the perfect soundtrack of Texas artists. The last half seemed to me a little bit, however, my boys were interested in a movie that is not often with her. The story was drunk for some children. Showing the calf as a baby, I really loved the end. As long as you are not heifers it's really the way to work.
