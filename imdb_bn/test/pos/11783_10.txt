I have not seen "hardware war" in years, but I think it was one of the most joyful events of human experience, and it was very soon. Every aspect of this movie was colorful, and it was "better than Star Wars". I laughed I waved. After watching this, I asked a family member for a moment with three dollars, so I could take off the farewell (I'm kidding about the last word). Ham Salad's Sidekick / Co-Pilot Princess Anne Dodie's cinnamon tries to eat hair bows and Darf Nadir's character is just sunny! This film will be great for viewing back-to-back with "Thumb Wars" and I sincerely want to say "Hardware War, Episode 2: The Umpire Strike Out". (Was there?)
