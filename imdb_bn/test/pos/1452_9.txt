Otto Pringmmer's "The Man the Sonar Arms" is a reference to heroin addiction - something that was more than 50 years ago (rather than returning to film in 1955) (the movie still has problems with the drug content in the film!). </ br> <br /> The original role was originally given to Marlon Brando, then Brando was hijacked by Frank Sinatra before he was able to respond. Sinatra firmly depicts a pro card dealer and former heroin addiction, who only himself returns to town to fight himself with the demons of temptation. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite directors of Preming (his "anatomy of death", played by James Stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama). Most of Pramming's 50s - Help to change the face of the movie in the movie "Anatomy of a Mider" It was extremely controversial because of its plot and content (information related to rape, women "children's pants", temptations, etc.) And "The Mandane The Golden Arms" discusses an issue that is equally unstable. <br /> <br /> However, it turns off when a prolific becomes drying, "The Panic in India Park" (1971) Its predecessor and Ray Island actress, classic Billy Wildad, is like some analogies with the general design of the film "Last Weekend", especially these three films, probably in the 1980s. Babhasera to support the movie and still relevant.
