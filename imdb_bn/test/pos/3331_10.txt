Come on. Anyone who does not understand the glory of this cartoon should be kicked in the critics panel. They should not be allowed to listen to them, because they certainly have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyone who does not love it should stop the animated cartoons directed by Tex Everi on the chair and the "Huckleberry Hound" episodes will be seen live for 20 years! <br /> <br /> This cartoon takes wolf and takes twice as the most important past example of comedians, which are sometimes cited in movies. <br /> <br /> For this cartoon, Tex Avery will be given posthumous academy award. This is the best.
