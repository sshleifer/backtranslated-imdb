My family's main ground meat for more than 26 years! We saw this movie when it came first and has been seen dozens of times since then. Bill Murray is at his best time and the most sensitive of the scene, where he reached a lonely teenager age and made him friendly, when his CIT is heading towards a rogue scheme after one! Characters are custom fun and zany and you really come about them and they take care of relationships with each other. This is not another lazy, stupid, teen sex festival. It's fun and sweet and almost all fun. Anyone who enjoys seeing this will enjoy. It must be seen. Watch for Spaz - he's the best character! (Especially during camps - when it makes ham for the bill Murray camera - then spas behind him sees that the poor girl who loves to dance is dancing with her!), All my favorite comedy one time!
