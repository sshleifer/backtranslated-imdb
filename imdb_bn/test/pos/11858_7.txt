I surf this lot of channels, mainly due to the synopsis so sugar, so the "American Style of Love" sounds. However, it is very good, very well done. Two stand-out features are in the dialog and are played. Great Cast The compound is actually well executed and there are not many weak moments. I guess I was surprised how long I had thought that the cart's cart was going off, and instead, the cart turned only, so to speak, and the movie was flying. There are some nice sub-plots, especially the relationship between the carrier that played the role of East Sound Sidekick Andy Ritter. Also, it would like to mention accompanying music was good.
