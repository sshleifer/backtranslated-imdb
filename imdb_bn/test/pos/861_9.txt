On October 4th, at the Hollywood Film Festival, I saw the picture. Mark Robertson took a great opportunity to write a very difficult part for his first film, and it grew up in Casting with Kelly Weaverton. I came from the theater to have a strong feeling so I saw him here and ... Surprised, I'm fine. More Hollywood actors should follow his lead, leave expensive acting classes and come back to the theater because with such training you will be ready for such a journey. For all the great things I can say about movies and directors (and many), I can not just stop talking to people about the skillful performance of Kelly Turning. We will see more of his work, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly in a bold movie. Bring it out in the theater so that I want to see all the people asap!
