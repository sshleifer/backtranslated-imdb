This is one of my favorite movies ever! Along with the Casablanca and cannibal holocaust, near this perfect movie. Rex Allen simply narrates this wonderful story to a cougar who needs a little loving love. There are action, adventure, mystery, comedy, and riverbed disorder! Check out this movie if you want to do it !!! You will not find a good cat picture anywhere, "cat from outer space" is not so close as coming. Charlie's performance is fantastic Even animal cruelty and intense logging included! For all the moral failures, Disney will love!
