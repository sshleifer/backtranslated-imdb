This image is all about people. This picture was my best favorite short cartoon for years. <br /> <br /> Is not it the simplest thing that makes life more attractive ?! We humans are very soft, sympathetic, interesting, caring for each other - we discover the least and most amazing machines to kill at least as many humans as possible. In our short life, we have ruined our lives, trying to destroy us, to destroy our lives, our lives, and often our own lives rather than spend the rest of our lives. Sometimes, there is nothing left to fix! <br /> <br /> This image can help us understand, teach, and even help us in what is wrong in our lives! Life can be small and even small! The last road is very optimistic I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> I love Richard Condi's mind and what's happening! <br /> <br /> <br />
