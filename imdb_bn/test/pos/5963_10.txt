Valentina Starvic is a French-born animations in France who used to do incredible things using stop-motion. I have seen some of these films before and they show their favorite topics - insects, frogs and different creatures. They are extremely realistic and are great to see and even today - the quality is surprisingly easy. <br /> <br /> This is a huge and a lot of frogs. They appeal to give their king, Thursday, their king. Why they need a king, surprise Jupiter - their lives are now completely fine. So, teach them a ugly lesson, he makes an Egret king and one by one it starts eating his subject! Then again, the frogs appealed on Thursday, who are clear moral that you are the best to be happy! <br /> <br /> While the animation quality is incredible, it is a very fuzzy movie for kids. I think that they both would fear that the animals look as well as the story that is not for the heart's dissatisfaction!
