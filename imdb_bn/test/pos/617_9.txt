Start seeing an open mind in these movies. Someone knows that it's going silent, someone may not think or be scared for too much sensitivity. <br /> <br /> forget it, all right. The movie starts with a little black humor, and then begins. Since then you take a terrific ride through the dark center of Moscow. All right, it must be said: The unexpected turn is expected, and the silence is basically used as a plot tool or a creator of fear. But this movie does not let you go. <br /> <br /> It's like old gangster movies, but then without any glamor of Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this movie: it is located in Russia. This movie has a great effect on it, in my opinion it makes it even better. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is without stupidity. This may be a great possibility for more movies in the future, gangster movies about the Russian mafia. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful and awesome movie. It's awful, but you can not feel sympathy for a little silence. One last tip: If you want to sleep well then do not be too late in the evening.
