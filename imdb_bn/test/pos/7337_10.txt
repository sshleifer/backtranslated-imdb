This movie was beautiful and touchy. It touches a place deep inside me and I'm not sure why. I was a happy married woman and I did not have lesbian tendencies, but for me, this movie almost made me want something. Drama, storyline, dialogue ... was a work of the film industry. <br /> <br /> It can be said that a female gymnast is dissatisfied with his life and is looking for something, something. He is with a man who does not want children, but he does. She does not mean it, but she does not behave in the way she should treat her with a woman ... I guess she really does not appreciate her. All these years he has remained in shape and Jim decides to go back. She met another woman during her acrobatic training and unfolds a close and beautiful relationship. She had her other little friend throughout the film, who trained in her younger years, and she lived with close friends. <br /> <br /> That relationship is being published .. I do not know the word too much, but very burden, comfortable, intimate but sexy ... something that can exist between only two women. That kind of relationship can really come back to your life. Anyone makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, confused. <br /> <br /> The relationship with his close friend is likewise different in a different way. They have a close and close relationship His friend showed me really a true friend. Anyone is understanding, easy going, real, fun to do, whatever you are there for you. Someone is supporter, and you can huddle and tell with your deepest secret. Do not share your past but share your secret. <br /> <br /> This story was simple that it was not overdone, but it did not end in any way. It has many sensual images to capture its moment. Dancing and danceography was stunning. I could see over over. Artist is the way to capture the feelings and emotions of the main character. Dancing and imagery were very great and mesmerizing to watch the clock. What an amazing story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, rent it and see it!
