This version of Alice in Wonderland is really original. Equal parts, fairytale, and musical-comedy - this film is a strange bit of adult-film history. <br /> <br /> Alice is a sexist who "meets" with her "experienced" strangers like Mad Hatter (who likes to drag her fingers whenever possible), Hampton Dumpt (who breaks her venegger with her shell ), Tiveddalei and Tivaldolum (brother / sister sex) - Crashed Doo), and bi-sexual quinn - among others <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> K "referred to by sub-section) - this is actually quite funny and surprisingly respectable. This is something you show to your kids - if it's not a graphic sex. It feels a little "good thing" ... but in reality entertainment. Oh - and some musical numbers are relentless delightful. If you are a drinker - if you are a smoker then do a few - roll a couple and give it a shot. 8/10
