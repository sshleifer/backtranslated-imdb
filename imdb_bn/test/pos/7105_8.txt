The last cricketer who does not count Abbott and Costello is meeting Frankenstein, which is a bit of a bogey. This time, Count Dracula (John Kerinen) receives a center for healing for his blood pressure from a benevolent doc (Onslaw Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lone Chaney Jr.) also looks up a healing quest. He is successful in healing the good Larry wrewolfism, but Dracula Dock tricks and his blood is contaminated in the end and the good doc is a crazed lunatic.How and all this big Franky (Glenn Kinky) is on a table waiting for the fix of his electricity, so he May destroy the damage. It was like a small film, about 70 minutes and there were some changes, but the action was there and there was also great actor. Lionel became active as an inspector, has some quarters, Lennonil Frankenstein's son, Frankenstein's ghost, Frankenstein's wolf and Frankenstein's house. And then this one. If there was another in the series, they added the animal from black leggings to the line, I gave 8 out of 10 dracula rooms.
