When I was new, the film received many flakes from critics. Letterman and Leno had their own objections. Letterman told him the biggest waste (paraphrising) he saw, and Leno protested his own painting. But Letterman's father Michael Higgins was present as a guest on his show, so it seems he did not take anything personally. It may be interesting to reprint a DVD about opinions and opinions from the stakeholders, although I doubt in those days that the days of late night warfare have overtaken the country and the country has gone back and is not coming back soon. <br /> <br /> I like Letterman to lendo, but never could buy. They never got up on jokes, and I did not accept them just like the actors. To compare: Paul Sorvino, like Kissinger at Oliver Stone's "Nixon", thinks that it may seem ridiculous in the first few moments, but it seemed that it was abandoned after the first moment. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the show for me was the Treat Williams as Michael Vivits. William's speech was not as big as a letterman to Latterman, and it was not as memorable as the glenderer Glen Ross Black in the memory of Alex Beldwin's entrance (and quick departure). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . But in the context of how Dave and J and all the comedians respected Johnny, this picture will be given to the lack of a Gossip film. <br /> <br /> Guess, the book will be read ... <br /> <br /> I said, after watching this movie, what will be seen in the Letterman or Leno Show, <br /> <br /> I said, what I want to do is open my Johnny Carson DVD and see the real thing.
