I recently saw this broadcast on Channel 4. Here are some previous comments I think I would like to say at first that I am not in favor of the death penalty. In this way, I was hoping for great things in this movie, but it was not fully supplied. Walking Dead Man very clearly, with good performances all round, and a good script is done. Actually it is difficult to blame artistically. However, I felt that although it tried to face the issues surrounding the death penalty, it was separated by religious / moral (the main character is the unbelievable character). Although I am not a selfless person, I have not really expressed any feeling in the story. If you do not take religion seriously, you probably will not see much in this movie. I think that Peter Medak's permission was, it was a much more powerful and moving movie, and I firmly recommend it to see and look at it.
