Hopefully the summary line will not bother you so much (it's a little respect for Chapel Show / Charlie Morphy, but also to character Debler). But what I like about movies in one paragraph and I do not like anything in the other paragraphs, I will try to give them all, so it will be easy to read! <br /> <br /> Start with a good thing! The quote fits very well here "powerful bloody violence" (which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a film). This is not a movie for kids! Or for the hearty people! It has a blade as central character (Wesley Snipes is unprecedented) and a crazy enough thread to keep an eye on the action scene! The main idea is very compelling and intelligent. The scenes at work are also great here. <br /> <br /> Okay, I do not like it. The overall story is very thin. Just as I wrote above to hold scenes of scenes, but there could be more. And more like a blade (emo). Not the best ... it does not help with the use of the clinic. Some characters are underlined ... that !! Re)
