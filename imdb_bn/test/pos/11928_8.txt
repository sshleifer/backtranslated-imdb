I have not seen it in years, but when I was about six years ago I saw VHS and at least 10 times saw it. Now I said, I could break the plot so I could break the plot, but some Colombian terrorists think that the main terrorist ("Wisemmaster"), to get rid of the prison, takes a former school hostage with the parents' claim. Now I can check the plot at IMDB only but I am sure it is correct. However, a team of boys in school decides that they will not only roam around and wait to die, so they decide to fight again. This picture always stuck in my mind. There are so many pictures that I did not forget about Joey (I think?) Death scenes or terrorist sandwiches or a child (no idea of ​​his name) as a fake asthma attack. Just a great film. It can be a movie that has given me tolerance for film violence because if I think this film has a nice graphic right. Because the helicopter machine was gunned down, the Special Forces were flying by a grenade (although this is not certain about this in the end, it seems to be like something) and the most bloody main terrorist is the main terrorist head. Great action, great humor, good acting, wonderful film experience. See all these years again!
