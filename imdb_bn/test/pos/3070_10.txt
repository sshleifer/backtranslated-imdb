Spinner Ayad ------------------------- Mail has received it. The last credit from the opening credits is to have a direct smile on this movie. Dave Chapel showed why he is a ridiculous force. Curie Aues carries the film most of the time, but when the plot is pulled from the Rollin Hood, the assistant cast is strong. From the beginning, this movie declares that it will not be taken seriously. If you take a time machine and contemplate modern dayics characters you will find this movie. What does this movie say especially? You are walking around Blinken and Acuhu throughout the film, becoming a great friend of Robin Hood's sidekicks on each other. But, Blinken would never say that he is black, and does not understand that Blinken is "black" as a "black sheriff". That's a timeless scene. The most enthralling movie of our time is a simple one.
