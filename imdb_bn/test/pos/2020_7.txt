This was an interesting movie. I could work without bath scene and seduction scene - EWWWW! Even more, I like movie-horny music around this movie. Chris / Ezir's parents are very conscious! They fully support the interest of their boys and believe enough to support them - now that's awesome !! What was really surprised at the end of Chris's perception. This is not mostly "Hollywood" which ended on its street in self-discovery. The overall increase of the stardom and its collapse was a roller-coaster ride.
