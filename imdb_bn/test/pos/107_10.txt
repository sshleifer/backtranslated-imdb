Easily one of the best Indian movies Guessed, it's not saying a lot (I made this conclusion after watching a big 15 minutes after watching). But I can really say that I saw the fire that is one of the really beautiful and bright movies. <br /> <br /> Beautiful her imagery. I can give parallel examples of two female lead (radha and sita) in the Hindu mythology and the letters of the same name. For example, Sita is the wife of the honorable Lord Rama. According to legends, Rama forced his wife to prove her "purity" by walking through the fire. Sister, the reaction, recuniting with his mother (the earth), cry and leave. This story contains all kinds of crazy links to the stories of Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Ajmi). The word 'fire' has suddenly got many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, maternity, and perhaps some of them I do not think. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many people should be offended by watching this movie, actually the first thing to see is the fire (for example, my mother, who Actually liked it). Why? Because the fire is an attack on tradition, it is an attack on tradition. In other words, it is its strength, its weaknesses. Traditional conservative social peacocks (Indian or Canadian or American or whatever) are vain if they make you slaves. Gender roles and self-denial can both do it. <br /> <br /> Seeing the fire, what happened to me. Deepa Mehta Off Hat ??
