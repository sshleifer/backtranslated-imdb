OK. Overall, these three parts will bring up the most interested people with the last 300 years of documentary physics running around the world, and discovering our universe. If you read Stephen Hawking's revival book "Tie Brief History of Time" and you understand it, you can benefit from the visible descriptions of certain concepts, which I did in a certain amount. Green is bearable, but perhaps for the public, little patronage means to explain things the way. This is certainly deliberate and will be suitable for almost everyone who watches this series. <br /> <br /> Guest scientist was good. (Not a Hawking, but I think it has its own DVD) I was waiting for his appearance to appear but for the third part of the same tour ... (Very few Americans here are Bright and one antipodian) I'm the Nova 2 disk version (NTSC ) And there were some inclusions that are really frustrating with the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. At the beginning of each section "it has been brought by you." There was a necessary evil for the first part, but it was very common 2 times before it ended. <br /> <br /> 2. I can not feel, but at the beginning of 2 and 3 there are several overlaps that have reached me several times in the FFW button. <br /> <br /> 3 This disk set was straight from the TV. (Ie ads, the last show for those who missed it, and often "geto pbs.org for more ....") appear in the presentation. (Most BBC material that is dishonest for exceptional presentation. Planet, The Blue Planet etc.) is based on my 7/10 content alone. Nicole was there but I got over them. If you are working with this classic British-spoken presenter (you know it) it will set a perfect disk in my opinion. <br /> <br /> If you have seen it and want something more ... The book Hawking recommends the book "Times of Brief History" ... I want it to be a movie too. <br /> <br /> Happy viewing.
