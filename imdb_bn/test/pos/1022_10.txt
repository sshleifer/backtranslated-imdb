I was in school at the end of the decade of the decade and early seventeenth and how was my school playing this film. The leading actor to kiss school, where that happened in my school. A crazy gang, my school again when we run a cross country only we will smoke! 'Getting vaccine', some in my school broke through the light of the sky and broke the cane! After they were kept safely !!! And for certain inferior activities! What can I say .... In fact, the film came out in 1982, it seems that when I bought my house and the picture was shown at the same time. If you like British movies and movies about school, growing ups and pieces of time, then it's for you. Like another photo, 'Salak' came a few years ago and I want to see one, again like the case. Highly recommended. (But believe me, when it came out in 1982)
