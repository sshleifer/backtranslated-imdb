Let's just stop believing for a moment and tell "how it" or "should be" in the place, or can we not tell. Since the middle age map is compared to today's satellite maps, human knowledge is probably primitive in that region, so we really have no formula. 2 Considering that "BBC-TV Doku-Simulation" is just to consider, it gets much better than the much bigger budget Hollywood blockbuster and it is simply incredible. 3 Finally, it is a showable show that has been presented to the CGI in an extended and imagined account so far that we know the solar system till now. 4 Fictional and CGI- The only thing to do is to make it palatable to a large public. Ever seen clips from Real Space Mission and Real Space Probes? The quality is generally compared to the average of the poor and the comparisons x-ray (and what it says about the human body) and compared to the comparison of a CGI-ed cybercrime movie ... Which is the most entertaining? Yet X-ray in chest is real, when cybercrime flick is only CFX fiction 5 actors do a good job. Nobody will tell me about my grandfather, but it's very fair as the BBC's Doku-Simulation.
