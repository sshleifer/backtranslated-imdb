Recently I saw this movie again (25 years later). Basically, there is a view of an aircraft bathroom while landing between the characters of Jacqueline Bissett and Michael Brandon's character. The rental version was not at this scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I love this movie - it's just like friendship between friends and me and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together. Her husband thought it was also ours. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Joan
