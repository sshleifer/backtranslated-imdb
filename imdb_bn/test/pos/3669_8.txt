Ignore everyone else's comments for this movie and watch it or rent it on cable cable (as I've done). You owe yourself one. This is what the image is all about (supposed to be). Hard to be classified (and how God is inserted as a "high idea" of it!), But this is one for the angels. See it Do you have to lose?
