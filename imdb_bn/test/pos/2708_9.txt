Contrary to the former commentators, I was (and I) a bright fan of the carpenters. To face it, Christmas will not be Christmas without a Carpenters. Who said, I believe the film is an excellent, not nice, painting, reflecting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable for watching primetime TV, but the content was slightly reduced. I'm interested in finding the Carpenters good carpenters that you have shown in the 70's. You can not believe how awesome a drum karen is. Cynthia Karen did not capture the talent limit Also, Karen was beautiful but had bad itching. My choice for Karen's game Hillary Swing I would love to see a more real story, because only heard that Karen's eyes are far more than the eyes. There are lots of music in my established webmaster, and it's absolutely nice. (She died for the song in California's Dreamline).
