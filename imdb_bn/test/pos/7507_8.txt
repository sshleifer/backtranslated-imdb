Dr Buck teaches in the hospital and it's pretty good. The thing about him is that he is frustrated. Dr. Buck and his wife are separated, his children are terrible, he can not work in the bedroom, and he thinks he is not doing a great job in cure people. He became suicidal, but met Barbara, who changed his mind better. A group of protesters angry outside and a group of protesters around this story. <br /> <br /> The movie was well done and Beck has been played in the role. It's a little sad, some fun and somewhat dramatic. It was good to see some stories wrapped around the hospital, even if Dr. Buck did not have anything to do with what he was doing. Awesome movies.
