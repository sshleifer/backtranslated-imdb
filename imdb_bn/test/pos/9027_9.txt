I do not see why people dislike this picture. I found it very entertaining (of course it is a fantastic bonus to have a bonus!) When I first heard about it, I thought it was a role contrary to "wicked science" and, an amounts, this is true, but a kite which I see really coming No Watch the trailer in the DVD (which I did not see before watching the movie) I saw that "twist" is actually shown in the troll! <br /> <br /> <br /> The picture is less and less comparisons of "strange science" after the progress, and I think it is better than two films. Of course some scenes that do not work wonders, but these are made by the encouragement of young cast. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this is an excellent example of science -Feek chick flick, and I do not think I saw a lot of them!
