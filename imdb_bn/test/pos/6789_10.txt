I hope we will never be disrespectful to society to appreciate the beauty of this movie: look beautiful at the romantic English countryside and are nice in faith and loyalty messages. See it with your kids, especially your little girl - Velvet Brown is a wonderful role model for girls. This is one of my daughter's favorite movies. <br /> <br /> This story is based on Velvet, a girl from Inyide Baggold, whose entire life is based on a best selling book about her horse, Pi and her solo psychologist. His "impossible" dream to pursue. Again I will not say about the plot that I loot it for the first time in viewers. She lives with a large loving family in a small coastal village. <br /> <br /> This movie has made Elizabeth Taylor a star, and why it is understood to see this movie. She is a natural actress who develops an inner beauty with her inner beauty, which is trustworthy, enthusiastic, innocent - she is the emotional root of the movie. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney, MI, helps young people to reach their homes, stay in place, and get the Velvet. This is one of his best performances. Also the Academy Award winner has been named Anne Ravie as the mother of Velvet. His strong, loving and wise character can understand that if you do not follow your dreams, then the value of life is not much: "We are the same. I believe that everyone will have to break into pieces once a piece of folly." <br /> <br /> I recommend this very sweet, very inspirational classic in the Golden Age of Hollywood.
