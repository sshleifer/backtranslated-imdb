Bergmann's Scamman is one of the most realistic illustrations of the film in the film. This is not an action film in any way, although pencils are faster and most of the steps are in comparison to any other Bergman movie. It is not romanticization of war or patriotism, but against most war movies. In fact, deliberate obscurity of impressive reality and character loyalty is a very contemporary feeling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the effects are expressed indirectly, however, such scenes as the private decision-making of many scenes compete with the intensity of the huge budget film. Of course, Scammman's work is on a much smaller scale, but it is not very influential. <br /> <br /> As filmmaking style seems contemporary, the film setting seems timeless and stupid. In the war-torn countryside, even the intact provincial handle can be anywhere, any time. And this film is not related to specific historical events with specific names and dates, but the universal human response to disasters and chaos. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Most of the movies they viewers, as much as we Bergman has fought against them, and through them the audience, and their reaction may be a reaction to us. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend. 10/10
