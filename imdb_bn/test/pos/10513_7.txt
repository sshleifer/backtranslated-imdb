When you read about this film you want to cringe. I saw it countless times and yet I cringe myself! So what's the attraction here? I think it's for me, it's a romance offensive. I find super refreshing across this strange simultaneity between this NYC hostage-brained columnist and a down-on-the-fortune (healthier) barrina. You feel embarrassed for Paul Sorvino in his reluctant manner wooing this woman. Like people in the bar, can not take any hints. He's a little overweight (as a shooter for at least one ballerin. Hopefully that's not a harmless sound) and probably a baby too old for him. Excellent change at the speed of wooing super models from Greek God. Bill Conti score is a pretty good sign which has stuck on my head after all these years. But acting is just awesome. The character of Sourvino is a very mistress who is associated with a small Puerto Rican boy. But the first scene that will be warming up to the Caroline King of Dublin is to show you this story properly. Good luck finding it. You may think that life time, or even we will be restarted again, but I have not seen it for several years.
