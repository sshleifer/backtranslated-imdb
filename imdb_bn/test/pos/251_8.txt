A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth), who dreams of being in Broadway, which means she works with Danny (Jean Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers), who will have to leave the small dinner theater. Rusty is in love with Danny. These three good friends and every Friday night they go to the local bar where they are messy so that they can look for a pearl (they can not eat them). Story Line provides many opportunities for song and dance. There are two questions in the film that Rusti must answer: Does it achieve fame? And if you're happy if really low? The answer to this question makes the movie. The film does a good job of genius of three princesses. Not a blunt moment!
