The role of this western title is directed by Robert Walker, Jr. He is a young gun who has contracted with the Mexican General and separated from partner David Caranine. Carradine and Walker separate from eluding their pursuers. Waqar's law enforcer Robert Mitchell came to the camp, who liked Walker and made him a proto -cease and a recovery project. <br /> <br /> This is the first picture of two pictures with Robert Mitcheon's writer / director Burt Kennedy. . The second was a better ridiculous and good guy. <br /> <br /> Young Billy Young does not have her hilarious moment. But with the recovery of Walker, it was a quarterly story, seeking the evil of Mitchell who killed his son, and a romantic triangle involving Gemini, Angie Dickinson and the city's boss Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> This image is associated with Nepotism. David Carina is John's son. Dean Martyn's daughter Dena is like this, son of Water Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and Mitchell's son, Chris Michael's son plays some silent flashbacks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Annie Dickinson repeatedly played the role of Rio Bravo. Walker was a short career to play rebellious youth and do a good job at it. I often amazed what happened to him. She looks like her father's hunting. Maybe she did not want to come at the end of a sad end like her father. <br /> <br /> It was not enough, Mitchell fans began to hear old shiny eyes, and the movie started at the beginning of the title song.
