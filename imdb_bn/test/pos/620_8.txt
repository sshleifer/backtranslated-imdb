Well, this picture came on a business day at 230. The cute actress, who played Billy, initially attracted my attention and after the first 15 minutes, I was finally arrested on my television. It's on the edge of your seat, then drops into the most fanciful sequences of comedians in clever bits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, only a few fragments drag certain order. Still, it was still very entertaining, and the next day I suggested it to my colleagues.
