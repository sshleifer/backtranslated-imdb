I was able to catch it on community TV a few years ago and was delighted by how enjoyable it was in an enjoyable way. <br /> <br /> A little bit of a bit, thanks to a script that concocts an impressive plot, nicely works as the main task of being a mystery thriller; It guessed me lifetime and inspired the resolution. <br /> <br /> Cast is a star-studded one, in which there is a mix of them at the end of their career (actually Richard Long died in the same year), or who was at the edge of the hit TV series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley). They all work well, except for the CÃ©sar duo, who sleep with their role. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended.
