Rita as Rusty Parker hyaoyartha Journal du Cover Girl - Danny myakaguiyera he was one of the club's dancers, Danny (Gene Kelly), according to the most specialized and most of them come across her. For example, Vanity magazine Magazine John kaudera (Otto Kruger) rasti his grandmother maribele (phlyasabyakse heyarthera played by the) with met, whom his love during the brutal scream made her young again raised tried to himself and Maribelle Think of what went wrong in. He does not believe that Danny can give a heartfelt happiness, or he can give everything he deserves - even Danny herself believes in it. While attaining fame as Vanity's 'Cover Girl', Danny runs him in the arms and waiting arms of Noyle Wheaton (Lee Bowman). So when his sidekick Danny jeniuyasa (Phil silabharsa) comes back to town to town, only rasti discovered that wheat is married to? /> <br /> As a musical <br, cover garlalati beautiful score and won the Oscar nominated song "Far away and long ayago, including Jerome Kern and Ira garsauinera possibly (probably the most beautiful ballad written and neatly in one heioyartha And sings sweet as a song of Kelly), Marybell's number 'Sur Tha Thong' (more needy 'poor John' in Karne / Gershwin Not cooperate) and 'test me'. Dance, of course, the top is pure, because there was only one hand in the genre Kelly dance industry. It is in the best dance shows, for example, with hyaoyarthera nacati me, check me ', or fair "Make Way For Tomorrow Tom' number (Danny, Rusty and performed by trio jeniyasera) ... in which the genetic character of Rene singina Title number reacts to police police. Kelly scored a technical and artistic coup, especially with 'Alter-Ego' dance. Anchor Away in Paris and her successors in America (Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballot respectively), is an example of incredible inventions and creativity that Kelly brings with the music of modern film: The medium of the film wants to be used before CGI is not seen before a few years ago. Such a dance, Kelly insisted on dancing with a person who might have liked him Ibha and style could match. The number is at least five minutes long, but it (and Kelly's talent) can still breathe someone under 60 years of line. That's why I have seen Girlfriend, and if nothing else, this dance really is worth it. <br /> <br /> You can say that there was a huge amount of money on Cover Girl and Rita Hairstyles. She does not deserve it. When the scene is witnessed by Rusty Hit Broadway - all the different cover girls show a blaze on a wildly big stage for the big screen Rasti's entrance. Heaven is actually one of the most beautiful girls in the movie, and he dances with style and grace, which is almost worthy of Kelly. (Kelly's co-stars rarely have that respect.) In some scenes she is sunny, for example her drunken scene when John and Wheaton Joe came to get him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, its performance will still help the superb lack of greatness which help the moderate mediate overcome its common curse. The curse is raised only when Jean Kelly is on the screen (or not), or when Eve Evenen as longtime secretary 'Stonewall' is disconnected by other cutting remarks or clever observations. As long as the film is not for Heaven, Nor Kelly and Arden can not fully save it. This is saying that the film is bad - it's not. It is enjoyable, with great songs and cute numbers and plenty of beautiful girls to look around. But it's not just a classic. Although classic in dance - so meet the cover girl for her, and you will not regret it.
