There is a shortage of Berti Verdi's Macbeth's production line. When a vehicle hits the lead mysterically, Betty is pressed into the spotlight. A destructive success at the open night and Batty decided to leave the next party to celebrate privately with his boyfriend. But when the boy leaves the room, the Betti is behind the dark black-gloved, masked image. The unknown inventor connects the needles of the place in a column, his gogha and his eyes, which can break incredible damage and pain. The boyfriend comes back to the room and hangs up to see such a tragedy. When the killer holds him and tears the knife with his lower jaw, then he becomes more shocked, the knife tip is clearly seen in his face. And Betty was forced to see all of this. So Betie's terrible accident not only intended to hurt her with the assassination but also forced her to distort her friend to see her. <br /> <br /> Apara is classified as Gaelo, but I have several ways from this different model. Less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than the Argentinean table or The Bird with the Crystal Plumease. Black-gloved, masked killer can be universal, but there are usually missing sources and red fountain associated with good galallo. Instead, the opera is an unnatural killer's tension and the audience is uncomfortable. Focus is focused on deadly death scene, Betty's Fear, and Betty's Emotion with Betty. <br /> <br /> Some of the features of the Opera seem like some artistic death scenes in Argentina. When Baui leaves her boyfriend in the room, you're sure that it was Betty. But the audacious killer just wants to force her to clutter barbie on her neck ?? The knife is in his mouth. This is a good shot and designed scene. And eyes that needles ?? Bright Or, take the death of seamstress. First of all, his death seems like a common kill of the run of the match. But when Simestra accidentally consumes the murderer's pendant, then another girl starts her death scene, using a pair of scissors to keep the girl's throat open for her chains. Finally, there is the most famous death scene in the opera that I saw that I was surprised to see each time ?? Mira's eyes are shot while peering through a kihole. The scene that I like about Argentina is a lot. It got burn style. As soon as possible, it's creative, memorable, and an explosion to see. <br /> <br /> Argentina was certainly not the first Italian director to focus on the vigilance, but in Opera, he was terrified by the eye. A new level. Eyelashes needle, a bullet in the eye, and all parts of the Argentine's view on the glossy eyes of the eye (punitive purpose). And this is the effect on the scene that I believe is going for Argentina. For the first time, I saw those killings in the cane's eyes by the needle, I could not stop blinking. It actually had a physical effect on me. What can be said about their goals for abuse in Italian movies? To be fair (and not sound like a fanboy like this), I have problems with opera that keep me from rating as the best in Argentina. One of my problems is the ongoing ventilation system through Batty's apartment building. Although I do not doubt that the old apartment buildings have ventilation systems that connect apartments, the operas are bigger in the pipes. I'm not an expert, but I sincerely doubt that there was any building in this film, such as a huge wind tube. It does not seem to be real at all. And do not you think that someone had done something about them before leaving criminals and helpless neighbors from another apartment? It's convenient for the plot, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I think my main problem with the film is over. What's up with that last? It's completely out of place, tacked on, and like after a bad thought. I'm not sure what it's saying horribly another.
