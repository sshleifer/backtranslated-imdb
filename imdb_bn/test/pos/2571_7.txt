Writer-director Craig Briever expressed his disgust with so much inaccuracy in the "Black Snake Muyen" that my entire part felt disappointed with the dismay of the whole film - a spontaneous southern paradigm on some risky issues. The film has a heavy spiritual theorem where the image is being taken into the picture - again, it is consolidated without neutrality. After the bold opening scene, until the film closes with the artificial quality of the production stage (and I acknowledge, the last 15 minutes goes far too far in the "Happy Ending" area of ​​my choice). And this is not to mention the archive footage of the musician Sona House, love and death (and of course, which must be brought back for things to come). Yet, oddly, the abstracts of "Black Snake Muyan" features the character of the rise of Lazar (Samuel L. Jackson), recently his wife (for his brother, not less), who came near near death Nympho Rae (Christina Ricci, easily celluloid On the hottest screenplay of trailer trash); To bring the girl back to health, she chains her to defeat her enemies near her radiator, and hopes to free her fallen soul. There is a sure-to-hear appeal to get out of his scampy outfits, its performance is risky and mature - a trace of Adams is not found on Wednesday and he easily captures Jackson, who is "blues" a defective, god-fearing man. Portrait In a heavy hand, where Lashara is a scene in the midst of a lightning storm / blackout, it is interesting to watch a scene inside a jumping blues club where you want you to be there. The setting is strong, and a lawsuit can be made for literal symbolism (chains, radiators, peculiar deceitful people who hunt the rai's work), which deliberately increase the growth of superstition and spirituality. And this is the spirituality that plays this spirituality that "Black Snake Moon" pays most of its energy - the acclaimed performance of Jackson and Richie creates a movie that extends from the trip, good and stupid, please. Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a conspiracy that I could have done besides, whether Slaghammer can always keep it away from an impressive meditation film.
