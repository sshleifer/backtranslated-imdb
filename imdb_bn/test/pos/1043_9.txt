Although it is not "perfect", it is closed. Love can be repeatedly stanwik, SZ Sawal, Sydney Greenstone, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayen (superman's police chief), homeowner, waiter and judge of reference felix ...... I can go. This movie was a tradition of my family holiday because I was a young man and my kids grew up with him too! "The baby clock" was always my son's favorite line. <br /> <br /> Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns, decorating fun. J. Sakall stole the show along. Dennis Morgan also made some great songs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie and you are asking to drop the remake.
