<br /> <br /> I think in eighty years it was a victory, was greed? Remember that one? I have seen this movie 20 times, this is my real desert island movie, I'm watching because there are more to know about these flawed characters which I love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Crone are just awesome, Beverly D'Azaleo, Beau Bridges nearby Coming, this movie has a lot of amazing performance and it is written for me as it is written. You, a movie you want to watch and watch, I think TV show "Northen Exposure" and now "Earl" much more for this movie. But remember it is not Tom Cruise.
