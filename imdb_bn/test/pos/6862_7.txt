I got a pretty good film for what I expected. Although I'm tired, I fear injection needles, because they are coming when I hope sort of. So if you do not need the needles, blood, human body, and some good medical treatments, then revive this movie and rent it to others. As with the opinion of another user, I was pleased to have a slashher film at German attempts. I am an American who has come to Germany to stay with just one family and he looked at it. I love the psychological thriller, and I want to say this anywhere along the line. A character falls into the place and seems misconstrued. When trying to find out the truth and to find out some truth in the situation, things become a little sticky and others are not sure that they go the right way. So throughout the whole of the film you are kept about who's anatomy. You can catch a glimpse and rounding the next corner.
