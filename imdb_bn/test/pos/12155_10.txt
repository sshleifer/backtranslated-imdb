A German Freshman in Stagean Hit in Paris during the summer break, he read for a mysterious young woman in Paris scene. Then he followed him in the famous Aile of Ibiza, the Hippie era met with Ullf, Hitler-Ju≈ºendent, a person who throws knives, bars and hotels and placed the stables under his pillow with a dome. After trying to avoid Wolf, the couple entered the ropes and envy for Stefan Estel, who is the glove and the free spirit. Great photography and music, the plot is quite normal for the time but it is not a type of exploitation type, cold and dramatic. The moral strong (he was in search of the sun ...) but I would not say that it is a film against drugs, even it affects drug use.
