For the first time I saw this great movie and played Alicea, my star *, Frances Ela Feitz, was so great in this movie! It was so real and so small dogs were so tricky! At the age of 11 I saw it for the first time and I have never seen the best movie, and you know? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = Best of all times!
