Good thing from American pie "bakery". I see humor and plot as a more compelling audience than any of American pie movies. . Also, I think it is acceptable for a lot more audience than the previous American pie movies about the compatibility of the content. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie comes out first, I read a few negative reviews and in the end I'm not going to see it in the theater ... I'm sorry for the decision now. The film has exceeded my expectations in terms of plots, dialogs / scripting and overall quality. I give it two way thumbs up!
