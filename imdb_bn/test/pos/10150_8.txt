The less thriller than the colorful courage with suspicious elements, the person who knew a lot should not be compared with the true Hitachote Masterpiece as VERTIGO, Rear Window, or PSYCHO; It's more similar to such usable romps as Catch a Theme and Answer by Northwest. The picture is mostly married in Morocco and London, the story tells of the story of married couple (James Stewart and Doros Day), whose holidays prevented the arbitrary execution of a carnage plot - and when their little boy was abducted <br /> < br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are very effective in the role of the All-American couple, and the letters give an unusual twist Is Stuart, Midwest doctor, his outgoing personality but an "ugly American abroad," touch; Day, who has a popular stage and retiring actor on his wedding, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and backgrounds play very well in the story. <br /> <br /> There are a number of famous scenes that many people have seen; Both views of Stewart Drugs Day seem to be very strong, before talking about abducting him and the order of the very complex Albert Hall, which has hundreds of cuts. At least noticeable, although my mind is not equally satisfactory, but a more subtle scene, which adds to the bustle of hiccocus, with sensual humor, such as Stewart tries to find some of the best "taxpayers" in the tax payers' store and day belts, the best "(this movie Written for) at the Embassy's cocktail party in the most inappropriate way. <br /> <br /> Though the biggest work of Hitakoos This is an enjoyable film, and due to the lack of impact and one that compares very well with his work completely. It hitakoke light, but recommended. <br /> <br /> F. Gary. Taylor, ur gf, Amazon Review
