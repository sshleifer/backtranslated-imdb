After seeing this first since I did see it, I saw it again (in '97), and it makes me laugh loudly. It has been written efficiently, both Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are perfect in their role and if you can see Bob Neighret in this movie and you do not see chocolate, then you are a man than me. <br /> <br /> The thing that I think is where Kim Selel kisses Kevin Klein, where Kevin Kline "Ha Hoo to Be Man" hears the cassette and post- (almost) wedding scenes Wa / Joan Cusack has three funny scenes Movie <br /> <br /> Sure, the last scene is an excuse for a happy end, but ... few movies are perfect.
