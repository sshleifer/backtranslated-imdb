This film offers many fun and surprises. When Acil and Philipa beautifully sing a doodle from "Don Giovanni" which perfectly describes their situation in the film, you appreciate the fine level of this excellent movie. The story of 18th-century Jutland and the use of harrowing musical instruments in the instruments of time is another sensitive touch. You shared the extraordinary pleasure of General Lauvnehhelm in partnership with General Lauvnehhelm's Kilis N Sarkozh√©, although you are watching only a movie but you just want to choose a small sample. <br /> <br /> Babet is an artist whose medium is food. Probably does not allow any other artist to share his creativity so much directly. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this movie, the possibility of sharing food, can transform how people see each other and how they can see. In the world, many as the "Chololat" theme, but "Babette's Feast" did not hit you on the head with his message. Dude is not conservative puritans, but exaggeratedly oppressive. You come to understand and respect them and ultimately come to appreciate their humanity. Many problems have been raised to reflect on you: the nature of the industry, the way thinking and not taking path, the relationship between spiritual and physical, the effect of the environment of behavior, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I expect deep heartfelt observation, but I have some obscure mysterious got ramblings. The speech had such a small impact that I do not remember it at all. <br /> <br /> But this different image has a lasting impression. In contrast to its unstable backdrop it produces warmth. You have to go out of the theater and they will leave the dance under.
