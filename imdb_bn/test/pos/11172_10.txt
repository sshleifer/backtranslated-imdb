Michael Keho has achieved many achievements, especially his second start as writer, producer and director. Generally there is a lack of aspect and direction on the "first timer" when the main production frozen, but "Dominion" proves that Mr. Keho is going to Hollywood places! Set up with beautiful scenery, Dominion talks with a wide-eyed approach with outstanding cast members (especially Thomson and James) with extraordinary clarity. Some movies may mix slashes / awful patterns with feelings of genuine action / adventure, but Dominion completes it. This film must qualify as one of the top films of these categories. If you're looking for a faster step faster than the quick fix, see more. I look forward to the future projects of Keiho. Savash !!!
