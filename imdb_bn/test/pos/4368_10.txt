This British version of the stage is based on the AM A camera "Berlin Stories" of Christopher Ishrwoud. It is the source material for the famous musical cabaret. <br /> <br /> July, Harris, a major stage actress of her day, restored her winning role as the Sally Boulos of the 1951 Tony Award winner. He made much cry from the character of Liza Minarelli, but the original "Sally" movie is in spite of the code that prevents it from being portrayed in Hollywood. Harris is probably unclear but he is as good as Madcap and Sally maddening as well. His singing number is definitely dubbed (not less by Marlin Dietrich) though Harris definitely sings for himself at another moment. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Harvey (with very ugly hair) is playing Ishwarda with zero charm and even makes the character attractive. Shelley Winters does little to play the role of Natalia (Marian Winters has won Tony supporting the game), and is exactly as Anton Defrint Fr√©tt. Ron Randel Cadiz plays Clive but says loudly aloud. Lee Saddle as funny as drug. <br /> <br /> Yet despite the overall firmness and inexpensive looks, Harris takes the central stage and is amazing. This film was recently released in Eden in the year before, in which Harris played brilliantly as Abrar. Comparison of two performances gives Miss Harris the talent a good look. These two characters can not be more unalike. Harry's Sally loves to smile and smile with love. He also works around the annoying Harvey circles. <br /> <br /> Without music and a familiar storyline, many visitors are here to recommend this film, but this is a great opportunity to repeat the wonderful couple Harris. Probably there was a very threatening role in 1951.
