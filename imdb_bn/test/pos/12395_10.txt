First, I rate this image 10/10. To me, I only saw the best since my birth (I was 23, but I saw many movies). The story is cruel, but the reality is not it? It went deep into me and stirred my heart. I saw it around 5 or 6 years ago and it still blows me - and I still remember it! <br /> <br /> Second, there is no national choice (this expression is translated directly from French) in this movie. I do not want to say it because it's a French movie that I keep it so much: I saw it really. In addition, I'm not well-acquainted with Marcel Karne's film, so I do not know whether it's his best film, but I know it's not his most famous: Hotel Du Nord, the duo de Bruce and Les Encints du Paradis are the most famous. Third, the film is in B & W, but it is a contemporary problem like young people (not acne) in contemporary love, friends and research. It can even create frames-by-frames with real young actors, a Dolby sound (TM) and special effects (a car crash), it can still be a great movie! Problem: Probably it will be seen by an adult young adult (16 to 25 years old) - and of course, of course - to understand the message well ... Did I say it a great movie?
