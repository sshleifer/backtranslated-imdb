I recently bought this movie for three of the garage sales, and when I was happy I would not have to pay $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was amazed at the surprise and wondered how good the picture was. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible musical set up, divided into 5 stories, including the story of 'Connecting', of which four teenagers are involved, the car breaks a dark, lonely road in the middle of the night. Apparently, these kiddos are like horror stories, because they decided to do until morning - tell a wonderful story around a campfire. Each character takes time to tell their stories a story, after which their own story is covered with a nice little twist. <br /> <br /> The first story, "hook" time is lost, little smoke and dull. Thankfully, it is not one of the main stories and lasts only 5 minutes. It's easy to just ignore the unity of this piece and to ignore the fragmentation of the piece. <br /> <br /> The second story, "honeymooners", all right. About it - you've estimated it - two of them honeymoon! They're traveling around an RV led to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere for the night, but they quickly warn a mysterious stranger to leave the position or to risk the risk of attacking some dangerous, unknown creatures. This story has a beautiful setup, but just just a 'OK' delivery. Basically, until it is seen to be fairly entertaining and mysterious, it's only great iffy. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People Can Let Too" is my personal favorite. It involves a young girl, whose parents are going out for the night and the sissy of which age is submerged for her party. So, she's going to be alone - in an event she makes her known to an internet friend. Problems, internet friends? Not exactly a thirteen year old girl. The conclusion of this story is seen less than the climate which I have seen, but still quite good. <br /> <br /> The final story, "The Locket" is certainly packed with the most atmosphere. Set on a dark, rainy night in a strange palace, it is a young man (played by Glenn Quinn!), Walking around a motorcycle with the story of this story traveling around the motorcycle, when he is easily having problems with his bike. She met the silent girl living in the house, and fell in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, not everything is fair and violet - and there is something to do with the pendulum hanging around its neck ... <br /> <br /> After covering the stories, we present a twist, involving four teenagers in the car, a packing That was looking at the past, it must have been clear, but it is not really coming, and it's a pretty conclusive conclusion for the movie. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, a good movie. If you can rent it, unfortunately, I do not really think it has many re-watching values. But the next time you "dark stories" or something else, such as this movie and some popcorn occupation, in the same light, there is a vaguely scary Lite Flick's mood, stop all the lights and treat yourself to this amazingly amazing Nifty flick.
