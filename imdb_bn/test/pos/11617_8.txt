"Subconscious anger" will be one of the most annoying films I've ever seen. "Slough" and "Can not Holocaust" have not bothered me so much, but there is a strange mental element from "subconscious anger". This film attacks your subconscious mind with taboo tabooos, surrealist visual and most uncertain film scores and sound designs. Boring at times; Yes, however, the comparison of its visual flyer can be compared to the intelligent guard's managers like Antarcter Jodroski, Dario Argante, Dosanne Makovziev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and throw a graphic violence in Lucci Phulossea's movie, and be able to guess what you're doing. <br /> <br /> The picture is divided into 4 parts. The first part is the "ovary Eye" real summary. A descriptor tells us about the brain part and its function. Then a nude woman gets her stomach open and is drawn to an eyeball. The second part of the movie, "Human larva", is similar to the movie "Erezirhad", but with immorality. It deals with the sexual passion of a human with its pregnant sister. Where is it when it is needed? The third part is my favorite one. It reminds me of "Beginnon" and James Burton's 1972 little film "DreamWood". People in this segment have sex with the world. Men clot bloody holes on the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. Broken when the branch bleached. Fear the fear of a man facing a knife out of a woman's cell. These people are actually aware of nature contact. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is the most annoying and sometimes it's the borderline pornography borders. This part of the film reminds me of Zodoroski's "Holy Mountain", "Sweet Movie" and "Canble Holocaust". I was never more disturbed in my life by what I saw. A businessman was dragged by the fish in his secret. Yak and uch! Two women urinate on the character of Christ and canobolistically eat them like communal bread and absorb them with tree branches. Poor people The last part was so extreme that I would ever see the movie again, I would close my eyes or move on a little faster. Karim Hossain and Mitch Davies are obviously very gifted, they think they did this project at the beginning of the 20th. Hussein Tarkovsky is influencing "Ascension" (2002), which is a very good film and she co-wrote the script after the dark lady of Nacro Sirada "exempted". "Subconscious cruelty" is an impressive and unsettling journey; With the images that come from the unimaginable kingdom of everyday human mind Good kind
