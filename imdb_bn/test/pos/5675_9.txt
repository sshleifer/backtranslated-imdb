If you've ever seen open water, it's the same kind of radioactive, intense, indie-style film. I like the action, mystery. It's all slow building, I hope they will open without doing this work, which has open water with those signals. But anyway, the one thing I do not like was the annoying little sisters. I was rooting for the whole time croc .. Many beautiful starters like the film should start, packing up for a trip to kids, they are mysteriously 5 minutes left who hire a guide. Before they get there, I feel her assistant takes two sisters, and boyfriends out of the water, now remember that this is the second day of their adventure work. A crocodile farm .. so they are there and all are good for some time, then cool, crocodile time ... very intense, you know something in this movie, you can not see crocodile, a lot of heel, but when you do This is very scary, I love the graduation of corn and the eyes, and the enemy of wrath, which seems to stir the crew by raising the head on the water constantly. Very vague, but well, overall it's a great movie, you can get past the annoying little sister.
