I finally saw the real reason why Peter Beale became famous. Frank Barron's joke is not in "Young Frankenstein" or "Avarvady Loves Raymond". For young people who know him only from TV, try this movie, it lets Frank look like a saint. <br/> <br/> "Joe" Boole's best acting role and someone has mentioned, perhaps the most inspiration for "Archie Bunker" for "Archie in the Family". I think "Joe" has returned to play Boy Frank. (I say it because "Joe" and Frank Baron seem to be seeing the basics of both.) <br /> <br /> When I checked it in this library, I did not know anything in this movie, I only knew Boyle and Susan knew that Sarandon was featured . Yes, Susan looks great here and plays a very good role for a young actress. A young hippie who escapes and lives in her parents' home, the drug-induced hedge hippie, which she sells, ends up as much as she sells. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Runs his father's job. When the father gathers his things, his boyfriend comes home and two exchange words come to him, and then we get to hear him later that he wants to do with Hippies. <br /> <br /> Joe is close to talking about his hatred of a laundry list of different cultures / ethnicities, hippies and others. When he said, "I really want to kill one of them", Dad (trying to think he is kidding) said, "I have decided". Joe buys it almost but it feels as fun. <br /> <br /> Later, when the police are on the scene and the story is on paper, Joe realizes he is not kidding. Rather than dirty the rich man for money through blackmail, he actually did blackmail like him. Only him and his wife want to "know" him and his wife. The long story is painful at the bottom of the bottom, after their association is painful but after Sarandon gets winds working for his dad. <br /> <br /> How to play all these out of the game you will make for yourself. Although it has ended 35 years ago, this is something you would not expect. Until you've definitely seen the film before. Again, I do not recommend it for most people who do not see it. <br /> <br /> The 10-year-old boy can not be played against his nature only, but others will see that he was more than just a TV.
