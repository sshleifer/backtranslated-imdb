Green Kids (Undersea Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " By the way, Danish opponents Ruel and Delicateans are eating, but it offers more than smile or parody. <br /> <br /> This picture brings us two of the Chronic Pethed Bijne (Nicholas Lie Kass) and Chronic Pierver Sawand (Mades Mikelsen). Their ill-fated relatives, two friends agree to open their own slaughterhouse in the small Dutch city, but initially the business is slow and customers stay away. When an electric person is locked up and submits them in the locker lock, Sevond decides to turn the man's milky into fillets, immediately calling it "chic-wiki". This special dish has suddenly been coming to the city in their counters and Savend - in popularity, it is unable to prevent Laphi - acting with her serial killer as her reluctant partner. But soon, under the leadership of their former master, many people in the city start to wonder which two men are using certain elements. <br /> <br /> Except for the excellent performance of Cass and Miklessen, the film may not grow on the average black comedy level. On paper, the character of Savende may be a comedy, but Mades Micklelsen is a portrait of a sincere, insecure and deeply packed person, but Mikekelson has led her to go horribly funny and at the same time. Kaash actually plays his dual role, his comotose Twin brother Egil plays. While watching the film, I never realize that it is the same actor. Other performances are wonderful with every character in the city, just as surprisingly with some awesome wonderful vintet off-hooks. <br /> <br /> Content - Naturally - some brains and components can not be completely refreshing, considering several predecessors to manage the same type of components, but the director Jensen gives it a fresh twist, and with the twins of Seven and Beyond some real Directed to develop letters, two social disparities with these two amazing wondrous stories. <br /> <br /> Camera Asphuara --- 9/10
