I've been watching this show over the years have been there. I've been searching for someone who has seen or knows about them for years. I thought I made them. Most think the soldier and the death. I'll ask the movie fans if they have seen it, it mentions Jim Henson and people still do not know. This great story I was very young when I was not even 10, and it kept a lasting impression on my life and belief. I would suggest someone to see these, remember that they are 80, so they do not see today's movies. Just give them a shot. Jim Henson was ahead of his time and died early.
