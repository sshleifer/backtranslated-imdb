I first saw this movie 15 years ago, and since then I have excited it. This is an emotional experience, which I can happily see at any time of the year. Anyway, to me, this is the last Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> It's really irrelevant to B and W - though I often think it's like a color. You can just get the watermelon watching that warm, dazzling feeling Christmas events open. <br /> <br /> Stenwieck and Morgan are perfect together, and Greenestritt is competing with his usual character, a delightful delight to see the momentum. <br /> <br /> It is not light relief and certainly do not do the brain, but you saw it that you are glad page. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the DVD to be available in the UK. I must buy it, in front of somebody.
