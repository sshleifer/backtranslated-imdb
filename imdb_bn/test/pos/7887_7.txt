Blackmail is an awesome movie about a socially versed man. Peter Boyle screams loudly and loudly with his past and horror love of his future and worried about the present. The first half hour of this show is played by a young Susan Sternon, a poorly talented girl like Melissa Compton, who has quarreled with her lost lover, completely full of naked scenes. The weak spot of his boyfriend film, a poorly-narrated drug addict and a dealer who, after surrendering a lot of Sarandan, got involved with his death. We meet Boiler Joe again and again, as he expresses the precision of minority, crime, hippies and medicines, and is easy to see based on a clean version of Archie Bunker's next Norman Leir television character Joe. Comparing even the Joe's wife and the carries in personal life and pastimes. Joe himself considers Melinda's father as the life of the Bill Companion, and the two find Melissa, who escapes drug treatment and comes back to the drug addicts, he is a friend of friends. Joe searches them as "orgie" in their search, an open love festival open by drugs, many nudity and surprisingly, the rebel Bill Compattion and the Ultra Conservative Joe both join. They looted and ended it that foreshadows the taxi driver stark and cool end after six months of a fierce and killer. Joe is a sponsored film which is violent and anti-racist Yet, Joe, who is the main character of the film, has suddenly become worried that when he survives fear and becomes involved in illegal and extravagant sex, he is scared. So in this case, the film falls short of a strong message and surprises how you were really surprised about the final outcome.
