Although it goes a little bit away from the book, you can not help to love atmospheric music and settings. <br /> <br /> How bath scenes should be done is OK. Although you have seen it every time I have seen that the background is similar in every scene, but on the other hand, in the hot baths where I like the scene, but men and women really like bathing together? You could see all men perched around women leering out in the women. It was strange that all of them had hats, but perhaps this was the style. Ballroom scenes were very nice, dances and decorations looked beautiful. I especially like Catherine's dress in the first Bollywood scene. <br /> <br /> Northwestern Abbey looked fit, but I enjoyed Bath's scenes well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Catherine Morland I've been the best actor in the sense of Mrs. Allen. Peter <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She loved Catherine, but still the book never gave the impression. <br /> <br /> General Tilly has played Hardy well and has also performed better as Stuart Izbella. Iligid Lacey Ellin did not give good performance as Tilanye. As John Thorpe, he gives a great impression of a book and photo-pictured character, a seedy and lustful man, but I like it. <br /> <br /> I can handle the cut scene from a book adaptation, but it usually bothers me when new scenes and letters are added. Marcheis! I hate him He is not part of the story of Uttanga and his cartwheeling page is not a boy. <br /> <br /> Some scripts are awesome. When Catherine Elliner asks Tilany about the death of her mother, she asks, "I think you saw the body, how was it published?" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's cool reaction is too stupid. <br /> <br /> Please, please tell me if you disagree with me or disagree
