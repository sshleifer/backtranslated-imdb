"Walking Dead Man" is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. After watching the movie, it is difficult to believe that anyone can feel indifferent about the film or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his beliefs and beliefs on the audience, but on both sides of the death sentence, sympathetic to the creation of a movie - whether it is the right to kill a murderer. I always got to know where I stand on this question, even a child, and this movie - it can not really take any side - even in my conviction that I can never have the right to kill * <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even if I win the Pen Prize, I would have been happy. Susan Sarandan is also bright and she won Academy Award. And Tim Robbins Of course, I gave this movie the right to vote: 9/10!
