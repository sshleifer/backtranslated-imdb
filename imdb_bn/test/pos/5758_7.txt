I was looking for a long time before looking for this movie, when I was younger and I liked it, then I liked it and still I still loved it. <br /> <br /> A love / hate movie, if you like below, youths, comic strip, you will find this fun. If you do not like this kind of humor, do not bother. I love this movie and grew up with this comedy program, for me this film is just setting their comic genius on the big screen. It is not a winner of awards but if you just want a good favorite snapstick, it is <br /> <br /> The film is lacking in the quality of the TV series, and it is usually only for movies but it still has enough content for you, but you There are enough materials to laugh at, though many jokes are similar to their previous work. <br /> <br /> Yes, humor is a little child and not for everyone's taste, but sometimes you only need it in a movie.
