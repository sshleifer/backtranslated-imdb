Believe it or not, Mona Lisa was once stolen, and was absent for almost two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's La Geoconda (known as Mona Lisa) was received by Liv, a small thief (and former Lvov's staff), who complained that the world's most famous piece wanted to bring it back to Italy. After the theft, his work probably seems to sell painting for his personal gain. (Of course, there was no hope of finding any of his customers.) On the last day of 1913, Mona Lisa came back to Lauve, sometimes staying there after being out of debt. After the release of "Arsenal Lupine" (20 years after the theft) in 1923, most filmmakers thought that the 1911 crime, and their knowledge, gave some possibilities to this film. "Arsène Lupine" is quite enjoyable, with the usual high production standards of MGM and the usual dynamic skillful aspect of Jack Conway. This movie lacks for joy; <br/> <br/> John Barrymore's head is the main criminal. He has earned the skills of 'impossible' crime, which he made more difficult by making announcements in advance ... but of course, he always commits crimes and gendarmes are stupid. Tony Marshall has a good view as one of Barimore's victims. There is a wide range of lupine disguises, which enables Barrमी ('grade a' ham 'in the US to provide its own feelings for Tomfily). John's older brother Lionel Barrymore's guarachard, Jawart-like Surrett, swears to catch detective loopin. <br /> <br /> <br /> On the screen, he used to work-class across his political beliefs (such as his fine performance in 'Our Daily Bread') Among the roles was the most impressive. In "Arsenal Lupine", Marily's naturally dark hair is gradually slowly gearing up a horrible blonde voice. Finally <br /> <br /> Finally, Mona decides to steal Lisa from Lupine Love. She slits painting slits, canvas rolls from her frame, and then smuggles it into a flower basket. We duplicate John Barrymore's tight-rolled piece of cloth which is the biggest work of art in human history. I was smile at filmmakers error. In real life (but not in this movie), The Vansi Poplar grasped Mona Lisa on a wooden rug, so the thief would have difficulty in rolling it! <br /> <br /> Finally, Guarcard holds Lupine and beat him, le Calaboose off. John and Lennel Barrymore's scenes are very happy in the police car, because their real love for each other spreads their character in dialogue. I found this scene incredible with any other actor. As I can not imagine anyone to play this role of Barrym's brothers. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but just barely. Do not look for a good plot line here, but "Arsenal Lupine" is a delightful example of making old style films. I'll rate this image 8 points out of 10.
