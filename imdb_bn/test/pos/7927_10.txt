Tom Clancy uses "Alzandar Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". In the book, Nevsky displayed in Russia's entire theater in the context of the Soviet invasion of West Germany. I felt it was checking out. It was nice! Cinematography was extraordinary and the story was incredible. I'm sorry to see this movie and added to my collection.
