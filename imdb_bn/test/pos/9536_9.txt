The book "The Children of Children" was a book published in 1906, the first British socialist, who had a strong opinion about the importance of family values ​​for the rise of children, and the story that was told was probably supposed to be contemporary. . Somewhat surprisingly, after hundreds of years it seems to be an important appeal for today's kids. <br /> <br /> A movie adaptation of an Edwinian classic children's story about the main role of children, it does not seem very exciting this day and most of the film-goers age. But Jenny Agutter (who started her long and distinguished career career), played a major role in Rabindranath (Bobby), did a great job by script-writer and director Lionel Jeffrey and great photography. Arthur Ibbetson, it has created a movie that still can not be missed, and most of its viewers feel very memorable. It is remarkable that this book, set in 1905, was thrice five times (four for BBC television by the BBC) between 1951 and 2000, and these versions are still not widely acclaimed but highly respected (this database user's comments will be confirmed), although it is primarily the children It seems almost impossible for a nostalgic story designed to appeal to Maybe on. Since I have not seen four BBC TV editions, these comments are especially related to the 1970 film version produced for the film's release. Contrary to most children's books in the book, 'The Railway Children' may appeal to adults more than children. Family life structure has changed so much in the last century that most children may be completely lost by being portrayed in the film, but many older adults will find a tremendous appeal to it. Perhaps the compensation for this, the film featured children's lives and is full of vivid, although adult characters tend to tend to shuffts mostly 'stuff shuffts' even though good. The story is a mature one, which is related to love, support and encouragement, it is not only timeless but is suitable for all ages. It is fairly sensitive and can be described more than a few ideologies, but it is not like a Makkishi, and it is rarely justified adjective 'uplifting' it fits like a document. <br /> <br /> Spooler ahead. <BR> <br /> The movie begins celebrating its high middle-class Edwinian family in a comfortable and fairly spacious London home, when unexpected visitors call them away and call them a father (who is a senior government official). In the remote part of Yorkshire, the soil should be transferred to a very small cottage on the side of the rail, and the child gradually creates a new life that passes the railway and few trains. This life proved to be quite futile in a small way, and the elder daughter Bobby grew rapidly due to more responsibility from her mother. At one stage when he was in a train accident, his sharp eyes were clear that a landslide had created a natural risk. Father's story never matters, but he never forgets, and gradually becomes clear that he is imprisoned and suspected. Finally these doubts were cleared (how and why we did not), and he came back unexpectedly to join his family from the local station. <br /> <br /> This image was found in a home video format for many years in North America, but Anchor Betty created a DVD from it three years ago, so it is clear that this pretty simple film has not lost its appeal yet. . For anyone who has not already received this, I will strongly recommend copying this available DVD - if you are not completely embarrassed or do not have the minimum requirements for you, do not be disappointed in the film Blood and / or Strange Sex Scenes Includes buckets.
