I was the first 13th of this short series (and his successor North and South, second book). I am already inspired by the stories of personal interest around my American Civil War, which I would like to see in this TV-show program. <br /> <br /> I like it. And now I'm 29 years old and I love it more. It is full of history, beautiful dresses, and original characters in the original fantasy characters, in which you will take care deeply. Conspiracy, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, desire, war, victory, defeat and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Although I originally broadcast the entire set of episodes on tapes, I bought them a few years ago when I bought a complete set of both N and S and NOs from the Columbia House. Every few years I will go back all week and see all the installments back - I'm sorry after finishing the last episode, because I want to see myself living story of these characters. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend more in this mini series.
