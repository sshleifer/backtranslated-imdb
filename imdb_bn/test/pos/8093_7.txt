Most of this movie is a lively and brutal satire on Nazism and fascism, which is the height of the success of this movement. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that all the protests in the final moments of the film were abandoned by the industry (comedy is not mentioned) and the campaign completely switch. And not anti-Nazi campaign, but most drunk and stupid progressive "progressive" campaigns sometimes go out of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> We can also give him the ability to say what we have not seen (distributed, maliciously, including an annoying wildlife fanaticism); Such insignificance will not be allowed to interfere with the message.
