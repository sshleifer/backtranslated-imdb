At the time of my teenage, I saw this movie when I was on TV (and it was in a lot) because of its diverse, compelling teenage smile. Critics can not consider a 4-star visitor, but for that I like it - it's a funny comedy which means to please the audience. Teen actors are my generation (which is why I love this movie much), and it was like fantasy cast of all favorite TV shows in the early '90s - the flower house, family affairs, new prince - all shows were represented and probably the best movie of the 90's Was there. Although it may not be included in a high level of nudity and violence, many young film writers think that young democracies (or perhaps due to their absence) are important for success, but I recommend it to teens everywhere.
