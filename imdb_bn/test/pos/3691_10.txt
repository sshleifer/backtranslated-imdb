This movie was not a freedom fighter? (It's playing on the cable now.) I tune in on the basis of my high respect for adults and recently was rewarded by watching more movies than I paid for in theaters. I wanna be surprised So often movies are sold in the market as "offsets" but actually more than the old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different with hearty message bonuses. Jonathon Price is an angel-like song. Although he felt the need to plot some math-oriented emotional songs written, he does not feel them well. Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett played well and spanked, but the role of the daughter of Kathy Bates is a new comer. She stole each scene. Give this film a chance.
