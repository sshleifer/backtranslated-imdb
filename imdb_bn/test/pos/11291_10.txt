My first girlfriend heard of Beganton while taking it out of a "classical classics" section of my local video vendor. He knew that I liked unclear art films so I rented it home. It was sitting on my TV for a few days and then I put it in VCR before going to bed. I thought I could probably see what the first one would be, and then give more time to the next day. What followed was really waking me up. I'm sitting through the whole picture. After I went through the closed credits I saw it again. You get an idea of ​​who you are after just after seeing the credit off. You know that you can appreciate it again. The movie does not listen to people to cut it. It's not for everyone. If you are the one who does not like to read the subtitles more than this movie, you do not have (no subtitles, no conversations in it). If you are the one who actually owns Rush Hour 2, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This film is really original and inspirational. It has never been in another movie. It does not look like anything else and everything is more brave beyond it - from 1989 to the present date. You can say that everyone involved in this film can really love the art and how they can be considered as a movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to "entertain" the movie is not for you. However, this is some extreme way and pure escapism in the form of film. It's like someone connected to my head and taped one of my worst nightmares. But if you really sit and watch the pictures, then disconnect the actors and do not sit in your guitar silently to do the noodle but watch the watch. But much more in brinjal. When I say it's my favorite movie I'm not kidding. This is an important film, apparently stimulating, mechanically motivational and hypnotic. Although I read a review about it, the truth is, "anyone without mark should get through the eggplant."
