... but perhaps you saw it or else you will not be here. It is very unclear that you probably imposed on me like this because this little jewel does not face any face. <br /> <br /> Very soon you know how the story will be reduced but our innocent looks as a redhead nurse puzzle piece puts high quality entertainment together. Most horror films show a graphic display of graphic torture, but do not look at the basement, it is fine, which makes for the higher mystery. Note for horror filmmakers: Some of us are like subtlety! Lovely and domesticated nurse Charlotte takes a job in a sanatorium, but when she learns that the doctor who was her hired, suddenly she had an accident and now she is under a mysterious doctor, we all know that the doctor is not. Through the use of Charlotte, many people are helped to uncover the facts, but which of the patients can believe Charlotte? This is a jewel and my most beloved true horror movie. I love the re-animator and Evil Dead but they can play more for the crowd. <br /> <br /> Villains: $$$ (There is very little for the horrible criteria but there is a nice hole in the whole of the film. The opening scene is classic; no other horror film starts well and Gore also has a fair share of its end) . <br /> <br />: $$$$ (Love for Love) Betty Chandler spends half the time trying to persuade half of men in the band, while Betty Chandler is a fake out and I am surprised that this is his only film Credit). <br /> <br /> Story: $$ $$ (This story is handled well after acquiring a large number of mileage in Hollywood, which is a supper for the suspense creation and never fails to make Charlotte poor in an uncertain situation. br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$$ (Betty Chandler is the best employer here in Alison, who has taken dementia with a miraculously incomparable judge judge H. M before the verdict was fantastic to see the phenomena of weight. You will be remembered for his character as a genuine performance as Charlotte olotik as that.
