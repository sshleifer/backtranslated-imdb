Say it at least in a charming movie. The main character fund denies an old man who is in the living dead, by which he is surrounded. He and his associates go near the pretty pulling and getting into trouble all over the town. Meanwhile, what to do with her family's surgery. From there you see Fanda's relationship with the development of his wife, good friends and son. It eventually leads to one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie characters are rich and deep. They develop well through the film course. There are quite a range of movie moods. It goes from light and fun to serious and dark. Any slow parts for you in this movie will eventually be made. <br /> <br /> There is a similar message like other European movies in autumn spring - do not lose sight of small happiness in life If you enjoy Amelie, The Eighth Day or Life Beautiful (All the big movies of BTW), you probably liked this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
