*** Spoiler in the fifth paragraph *** This was a wonderful Frank (wah-hah, uh-hah) picture for 1955. Auto Promising and Carlyle Productions take an opportunity to create it, certify the Motion Picture Association of America in America. The picture shows a junky jabbing of a sergee full of heroin full of her arms. Frank Sinatra gave an opportunity to play an addicted musician and cause flats to fall on his face, more than twice as much as what he had played. These gambling have been closed, the film is a classic, although it is not perfect. Nelson Allgren's novel can be great, but it's going to be more comfortable to fit within two hours, "The Mandymen The Golden Arm" is 119 minutes long and often feels much more. However, in my opinion it is not just the Frankie machine (Sinatre) that the film produces, but other characters and their sub-plots, all associated with the franca. Finally, not only Frankie, who is addicted, everyone and everything seems to depend on him and he feels it deeply. When the pressure gets too high the drums start pounding over the soundtrack and Frankie steps across the street with her well-clad "friend" Louie. <br /> <br /> It was said that Frank Sinatra's music career was in an excessively sometimes doldrums, but in the early 50's he was limbo in his days traveling with the big band and the Las Vegas era. From 'Here to Honor', he established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer, but 'The Man With the Golden Arms' was still an important challenge, the entire show shrunk or swim with its performance. He closes it with such skill that I've forgotten Frank Sinatra for a few minutes, he must surely tell the junky musicians and exploit that knowledge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although Don Birnam ('The Lost Weekend's Ray Molland') is struggling to fight himself in most cases, Frankie Machine is surrounded by exterior forces and he takes refuge in sweat. Both methods are completely accurate or inaccurate, and in most cases it is impossible to explain fully, but it seems that this film can benefit from some more insights from Frankie's internal struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of my problems with this movie is the "Depletion of cold turkey". I understand that 'The Mandain The Golden Arms' probably determines the trend rather than following it, but it does not do any good. At the beginning of the film franchise kicked everyone's habit with the help of the doctor and his practice with the help of some kind of treatment. Naturally, he wants to backslide for the film's play, but I have found the American-American model that there must be a person here with his problems (or maybe with the help of a good woman) here. Cold ride in the sunset with Turkey and Kim Novak takes very unreal. The last weekend was the same, but in my opinion there was a little pink.
