I just called my brother Poli and said that he saw the hood and it was funny. So, I said, do not go against the family! The demand for more lines is OK because I mostly want to express my opinion. If something is made wrong then it is probably not for my eyesight and my brain. This gives me another chance to take a shot at "Departed". If someone knows what's going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge, it is usually not meaningless. All you need is a good director, the same person I believe is my favorite view movie, "GoodFello"), but totally different. And then throw Jack Jacky and you get yourself Oscar. Easy as pie To make sure that it was not good compared to "bone" gibbs, I need to see the hoods
