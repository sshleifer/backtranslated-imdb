I had a respect for this evening to see the screening of the film "This Girl" at Philadelphia Film Festival. I'm going to film, I knew very little about it and had a chance on it because the film's plot seemed to be attractive. So I entered the theater just a few hours ago, I was wondering if the final verdict stopped or stopped. <br /> <br /> "These girls" are the stories of three best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dowrens), who does not know what to do with her life after high school, but her father is pushing her to go to college, which she does not want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will go to a Christian school after summer. And finally, Gary (Amanda Walsh) who plans to spend his summer baby. But this summer is going to be special because they blackmail those old black blackmails to Keith Clark (David Bariyanz) that they are sitting for the kids. Fun bars and many smile ensue ?? <br /> <br /> I usually do not like movies like "these girls" but I really like about this movie. I think the quality that I liked most about it was actually realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sex, choose the violent people who blackmail them after those who have sexual intercourse with them. It's about a great story, friendship and sexual relationship, but even though it looks pretty, I see most of this movie happening in the real life. <br /> <br /> This thing is probably the main reason. The film does not get a mainstream release in the United States. All girls in this film are considered to be under 18, if I think only 17 of them and 16 are aged. Now, in the United States, though there is less sexual intercourse every day, many manufacturing and financial institutions will not finance it. Because the sexual content is like this film. This information was originally confirmed by post-production director John Hedgehott. The thing I find is that the sex scenes in this movie are not graphic and nudity is small. Not to mention that all actresses of this film are more than 18 years of age in real life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What makes this image the best, it gives many ridiculous and very strong characters. I like all the characters in this movie and each character seems to have the "now and then" attribute to them. The jokes were fun because they were not cleverly written because they were dirty or were at the top. Everything seemed comedy and drama flowing together nicely. The script was very powerful. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good in most cases. I was all three girls great. Carolyn Davresas, who had played the most underground television series of all time, "Wanderers" was just great; Along with Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh both worked well. David Borivius did a good job and he looked like he was fun while shooting in most scenes. The man played a pot head, so he was fun to play the role. <br /> <br /> I was glad to meet John Hazlet today, who looked like a very nice person and was very grateful about his comments. Movies. I am not going to go anywhere in this movie. I think with a little marketing behind it, it may be closed. Sadly, it is going to be one of the direct DVD movies which will rarely be enjoy watching. I think what Hajjlet had to do with the little budget, the film has got better and I think he did a good job to point out this little jewel. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hates sexually curiosity, I really enjoyed this image. The development of character and malicious scripture allow me to sit and enjoy for one and a half hours. This is a great comedy because it has heart and spunk. I know, when I come to the DVD on May 16, 2006, I'll be sure to buy this movie. If you are a fan of coming to age, teen sex, or romantic comedy, then check this movie because it's a <br /> <br /> <br /> "The Girl's" final of Movimen Menzel Ratings 8/10
