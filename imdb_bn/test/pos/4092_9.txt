I recently bought Lost Horizon in Ibiz, there are some memorable memories that I will miss from my childhood (I am an old 29). I recently finished the novel, based on which I was very pleasantly surprised so I found out a real hidden treasure. An amazing cast comes with a beautiful, easy and disciplined story such as warmth and depth, which has been updated mainly from the original film (and is now more intuitive by James Hilton and a different entity in the thought provoking book). Especially Sally Kellman has a brilliant presence like Sally Hughes, a suicidal neurotic, who gradually engages in the characters of Shangri-La. Only Levi Woolman in his school structure in wood painting (a role that is more suitable than the type of Julie Andrews.) Finch, oleum, and smile are not important to dubbing everyone because it is almost impossible. In quality, the song is much better than the song, but it is still a vibrant and vibrant film that truly deserves the right DVD release and much more recognition.
