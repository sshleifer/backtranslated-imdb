A genuine masterpiece of Soviet cinematography. It is embarrassing for the Soviet Union that Samoslavwa was never allowed to play in Western movies - but again, she probably would not find herself there. "Letyat Zhuravli", he is unforgettable. It was a few movies where I was crying ... <br /> <br /> In addition to Samololova, Batlov and Murkuzhev, the top rate is a brilliant work of directors and operators who created this film as an all-time classic worldwide. Remember the memories of the heavy German bomb explosion or the scene of piano music and the death of Barish's death with the wind blowing on his head, and his last perspectives have faded into the sky. Very simple way - but the great strategy has been added to the mental weight ... 20 years ago, "The Star Wars", "Titanic", and remember the Soviet budget 20 years ago.
