You can not see this movie for history lessons. I heard about Barker Saga first, but I can almost immediately say that the event has been closed. And in a little internet research I realized I was right. Mother Barber is sure that he is not a picture of hell, not a picture, the counting woman portrays him, and apparently all bank robbery plans, cudgery and murder that his criminal sons drive. <br /> <br /> Do not expect a brilliant crime drama. The scripts and the performances are enough, the gunmen have an excessive and mostly unrealistic, and a very ridiculous motion motion death scene. So why did I make 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> <br /> It was very modest. Fun to watch gunfights but there are some innovative themes among them. This movie has a strong idea of ​​pride in the alpha male cast, each with its own agenda. And I appreciate the short use of the oath for time. Set pieces are fantastic, reproduction of a breakthrough era of 1930s. <br /> <br /> So watch this film as a movie film like you, and excessive bloodshedness and cruelty should be followed by extreme comments from the FBI people. Whoever wants to take Barker at any time. Inotherwords, do it very seriously, just have fun with it. And if you like it, you love serial mom.
