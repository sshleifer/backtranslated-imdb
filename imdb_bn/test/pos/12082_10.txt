Who will love my children, my heart has changed, it cries me all the way, when I had to say goodbye to the child, I shouted with most of the time, I shouted with him the most, and every time the child was received, I was crying to tell their mothers goodbye. I felt sad to lose their mother, I felt sorry for the hungry child, I was very happy. That he was adopted by the same family as his brother. The boy I thought was the one particular because he was going home. I think I'm special because I'm worldwide with Asperger syndrome and sometimes when I feel I sometimes like to cry. I really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10 True story, very good. Another movie that can bring tears in your eyes, I think Tuesday with Mori (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
