In a good civilization, this and David Suchet films will be released in many other theaters. Plots are fantastic (no, I did not have any sources who did it, but if I became more fantasy then all the sources were - the best kind of mystery), production values ​​are amazing, acting (from Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Least Anthony, Megan Dudes and Of course, as David Suepat's Circular Pirot) Only perfect, wonderful conversation, tension and tension of music and sensation O Wonderful things. <br /> <br /> One of the fun for this man is the Harikul Pirot film, how beautiful women star among them! Here were two - sexy backgrounds Megan Dudes and Stunning Leicester Anthony. <br /> <br /> You can not afford to renounce it - they're just wonderful - you can imagine the most wonderful company in the most wonderful restaurant of the most wonderful restaurant - your mind always works continuously because it remains everywhere and you struggle But by continuing to think about your mind, everything can continue - and the settings are fantastic. <br /> <br /> I can not think of this movie that stimulates more than the Horik Poirot / David Suchet movie. It is impossible to praise them - and I have never seen anyone a few months ago and did not read Agastya Christi.
