"The Falcon and the Snowman" Two young people, CIA staffers and a drug dealer, who became strangers with the United States foreign policy and sold state privacy to the Soviet Union. Films are based on real stories. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Shan Pen lead develops convincing and attractive characteristic parts. Supporting cast also performed well, especially with David Sueeta's performance in a David Soviet agent named Huecule Poetr. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> Two boys were caught in something they could not understand correctly. However, it seems to be too much and complex in the middle point. Finish, however, exciting, stunning and effective. Soundtracks contain some interesting rock songs, but unfortunately a spatial synthetic track that does not fit with a spy story. There are more spy films than "Falcon and the Snowman" which are relatively valuable, but this is not a decent film, which is less.
