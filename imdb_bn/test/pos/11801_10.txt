I'm not saying that I am very surprised at the production value of this movie. I was directed to show early and I should say that it is the best (if not only) the Christian film can hit the theater from Passion. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <p> This is a film that a Junior High Youth Group can see without annoyance (maximum) guardian, and the message is surprising. The best part is not a film for Christians, but it is a family movie without the feeling of Chess 7th heaven. <br /> <br /> There is a smile there, and many times everyone in the theater is laughing, bit humorous was natural and does not seem to be script or compulsory, and that's a serious film made for good pacing. Without all the characters in the film, religious and otherwise, both adults and young adults will be able to identify and I am surprised to see such problems in such films. The plot can not be expected in any way, and ultimately many will accept the hits near the house. Fortunately, Christians do not know all the great as "words", rather instead of trying to understand life only. People make mistakes and are not perfect, not even in this movie ... not by long shots. <br /> <br /> Top notch acting, writing spot, and head with all the evangelist Christian explanation you did not hurt. This is a great movie that can ask you, your thirteen people to think, talk, and possibly their own ethics (or lack of). If you want to watch a quality family movie in January, check your local listings for this movie and you can learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25 year old male that just want to see a free movie.
