Um ... Singapore is a serious film about annoying teenagers, I have no knowledge in a country, but there is a previous misconception that all children are highly regulated and controlled by their families and the government. Well, I guess I'm just as bad as any other city / country, they also have young people with their problems who manage drugs, fights, bad language, and ... a lot of wonderful rebel paths. Being a bad boy. The wonderful part of this film is not how it is running because of the suffering of these children themselves and others, but how does it lead to fine homosexuality hiding behind their so-called loyalty among them. The relationship between these "brothers" may very well arise from an unconscious gay tendency among these boys. Although str8 boys are not very unusual for a close friendship with each other, the film is closely watched, but it should enter into all kinds of gay festival festivals and I would not be surprised that this aspect can win itself as many awards!
