I'm not going to lie. Not saying that the movie is confusing, the sun is hot but not really. And if you have seen movies from the movie director Richard Kelly, "Donny Darko" and "Southland Tales", you know that it means something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. About an hour before the film, almost half of the audience had already gone. In the end, only 15 people wondered what they saw. I could have understood only 40% for one, even if it could only be explained. So why did I give this picture a generous seven stars? Because for one reason we got some spectacular performances (Mercedes desperate and Langley came back as a known obscure character), and two of the most important reasons are that it is completely original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the living directors, undoubtedly his creative attitude is daring to differentiate stories. To be honest, this is the only way - this story can be said only by Kelly's unique style. Ultimately, if you're not willing to spend some serious thoughts on any cute movie (and even then it can be all things), stay away from this one. But if you want to see a deep, rich, complex and thought provoking section of spiritualism, existentialism and human nature, see it. <br/> <br /> * Note: If you read this review, accepted my recommendation, actually watched the movie and still believe that you've lost 2 hours. Your life, I'm happy to share my thoughts about the film's full meaning and plot. Look, I liked it so much - it promoted the discussion! Although it is as difficult, I will try it briefly by quoting a poisonous quote from Langley character, which explains the importance of the simple box to an employee: "Your room is a box that you live in. The car has started to work on you, on wheels. When you return home from work, you will be sitting in front of a box with pictures, in the mind and soul of your body and on your body. The box can be damaged, stay tuned, eventually you will be placed at the bottom of the box ... the earth and the rest of the world. "
