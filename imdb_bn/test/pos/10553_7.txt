I have problems with the film Snobes, who think Americans are unwanted semi-educated, unable to grasp the more sophisticated Europeans, Les Francis, the illiteracy of Les Italiani ... Only anyone from Le Kongong is English, a foreign language. While the humor in "My Father's Hero" is different from "Monroe sar Haros", it's more fun than the American French experience, Not even better, not "more clever", just different. If you think that it can be "borrowed" from Hollywood's French movie, consider the French movie that has borrowed from the first place in Hollywood. Where else will Belmondo and Dellon Bogert? The trophy without a hitcoat? Jerry Lewis - Not known for his subtle and brain styles, Idol worship in France. GoGo figure ........ Monsieur Depardieu Bahamas together together 14 years old is a steady 14 year old girl as well as integral divorced parents together. Surprised by her, she presents her as her boyfriend to other hotel people so that she can make her own son more attractive. It is not surprising, complexity occurs. "Hommages" from "Green Card" and "Sarnon de Burgerac" are inserted amusingly and M.Depardieu goes along with it all very well. He impresses the good morris chevaler with "thanks to heaven for little girls", which is actually fun and rather tragic as his funny, who all believe him to be a 14-year-old girl boyfriend, leave up and leave - as he is fighting as two anti-war Glad to know about When he went round the rhythm at the end of the song, the expression convincing him to congratulate him on his face was invaluable. Without him the movie will actually be very average. The huge blurred image of screen dominance is a lot of fun. No peaks, no six packs - just having a real proper human-typing Formad!
