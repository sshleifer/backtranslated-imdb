I noticed that most people respond to Betty's response to working with Tasky. I think how they imagine that they would respond to the "normal" person. The thing is ... the belt is not a "normal" person due to the events of his childhood. The film has its problems even before it's even started ... and after the end of Opera ... my opinion ... she's completely unconditional. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- spoilers -------------------- You must remember that when he was a very small child, he had seen at least one cruel assassination of his mother's lover, when his grieving mother was going to see him. <br /> <br /> She was raised by a woman related to hacking, tearing, and leaning towards women through the sexual liberation war. That's not for a healthy home life. I think it is very easy that in such a way, her mother never stole on her and used to fix all kinds of mental stroke and negative reinforcement. In his remorseful age, perhaps Batty was deeply confused with what he saw. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " If Mummy likes it then it can not be bad, Mummy can not be bad? He can not tell the police to his mother or cooperate with this mysterious Hooded colleague. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For many years, he tried to stop the memory of his mother who had seen her ... but it Coming out as a terrible nightmare, Valve-cool magicians, reliance on entertainment strategies, and sexual quaternities are related to cruel violence / bloody death in sex at an unconscious level. There is an internal struggle in Betihe's part that confused the murder / sex, and its part, which believes these things are wrong. <br /> <br /> When he saw his boyfriend killed by the Hooded man ... he called the police, still unwilling to give her name. The person who thinks of killing is forced to call him, but the hesitant part does not allow him to accept personal involvement. Before he can go all the way his ambivalent part takes control. So he goes away from the rains from the rain ... and when he takes over by the director, he performs in astonishingly calm, naturally think that he can be "normal" person ... because of the part he has been from a child Trying to block horrible blocks of stuff blocking what its tried to do is the damnedest. <br /> <br /> The subject of his life contributes to an impasse in the status of state of Betty's psyche. Her singer has started to bear fruit ... she is going to be a great opera singer like her mother. But she will be like all mothers? In the dark way? Or he can make his own way? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Imagine how horrible it would be to lose your real mother and then see the woman who is near you nearest mother, she died in an eye pocket. <br /> <br /> I could go ... but I No The main point of what I am saying is that the character of Batiyi is much more complicated and most critics here are willing to give consent. <br /> <br /> Open is one of Argentina's best ... and not just for visuals (though they are really cool) and not only for inventive killings (though they). Here's a depth ... and pay attention.
