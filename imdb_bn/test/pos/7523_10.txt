Another Rackel Welch Classic! This film was played on 10 November 1969 by Michael Weilchke as Mitchell James Stacy and Luke Lus Asus as Joe Morris. Nikki is the way to meet with her daughter friend Michelle and Jackie. On the way to that, she goes to her ex-husband, who wants a second chance. Nicky moved away from him where he saw Michelle and Jackie. Alan again comes to her and Allan shoots him behind when he starts leaving. When Mickey and Jackie went to the police station, Nikki was taken to the hospital. Michelle goes to the hospital where he meets Jackie just to die for Nikki. Allan then went after Jackie, who he hit with a car and then tried to run Michel down. Jump Michelle into his car and head for Los Angeles. When he went there, he called Lloyd in Las Vegas to his boss and said that he was okay. Lloyd asked him to go to the club known as Closer to show Jerichi about his job. However, there is a problem! Barton has a drug problem and Allan knows it so Alan and Bartender have a little talk. Los Angeles Michelle did not get a job as a dancer with Jerry, but Jerry bouncer Joaqu has hooked up. Think of some of these pictures now! At the end of Rackel this picture was much better, and this one was nonstop action. Leak Askew Nicky did an exquisite job playing former husband. She was usually killed with the look that she goes with her. As the performance of Raquel Welch, the only sound that comes in the mine is fantastic. She was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood like ever before and shined. The outfit that he was wearing on the dancing stage was exciting. Actually, the stuff that he used in this movie was exciting. Of course, no matter what Rackel did, he did not look good or anything. I give 10 films for this movie 10 reasons. First and far Rachel Welch is the main actress and 10 stars eligible. The second reason is that the movie is from the beginning to the end of the Wall-to-Wall tension.
