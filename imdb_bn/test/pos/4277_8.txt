My husband and I saw this last night ... it was astonishing .... Once he had a wrong idea before finishing the wrong idea. It was very quick to move along and acting fantastic .. I would like to worship Tom Wilkinson anyway. As far as I'm concerned, he has never made a bad movie. Hitting the nail of the head above his acting ... the expression of the face is incredible. Even the photo scenes are awesome. We just saw all of the prime suspect series and I'm convinced that the British have the means to keep the audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get some hours of complete entertainment.
