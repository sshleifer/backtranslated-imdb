Viewers of the 60's Cleveland television can see an episode of the "Flash Gordon" episode as part of the Hollyi Show (11:30 Friday). This junior high was the mockfest material of any of the best someone we have ever seen. We get fun watching this element with a group of friends only we are regular "sleepovers" (even though we do not call them). Then next week we will quote our favorite Cornwall lines from the latest episode. <br /> <br /> This shows the same reaction today. But if you can laugh in dialogue, long animals, stupid dresses, and terrific spaceships are long enough, but there are some good things that I do not realize for the first time. The production designers have built some nice sets, both in the rooms and laboratory devices. Charles Middleton's "Ming the Merley" character was the best screen villain of all time, of course until then and better than anyone else. Gene Rogers is amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Again, do I know? I'm just a child.
