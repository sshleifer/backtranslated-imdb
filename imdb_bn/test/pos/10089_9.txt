Abundant as an Asian horror, "a daughter of two daughters" is actually a complex character-driven mental drama, which engulfs the viewers in an apparent normal family problem. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. Director G-Won decided to focus on Kim's decision rather than terrifying fear, he gave a correct explanation. <br /> <br /> "The story of two sisters" has drawn the story, because its name suggests two sisters Su-m and small Su-Yen, who spent a while in the house after returning home to their parents and now abusive stepmother home . Since then we have seen how the sisters deal with increasing aggression and uncertain behavior by their parents gradually. The whole experience will be looted to tell what will happen next. So I just leave it. <br /> <br /> This plot is written very tightly. With the letter nicely fleshed. A small cast focus on G-Win Kim gives a more detailed view of them and their relationships. In addition each of the four main casts has a different role and character type. Protective Su-mile, weak Su-Yen, firmly-selfish father to parents, and later for fatal behavior. There is a lot of mystery in the mystery, many plots have not been released till finally, and after that the film still leaves a great house to explain. Even after viewing it once, the viewer will be forced to see it at least once, so that he understands better. <br /> <br /> Actors fits their roles festively. It is particularly difficult to create strong, mental scenes in psychological films, but this is a great pleasure while creating it and this is a prime example of such a feat. The instructions of G-Woon Kim gradually slowly and steadily slowly and slowly. The number of moments in the number is strong and quite a bit horrible. Cinematography and scores are more helpful in setting up the atmosphere fitting of emotional film. <br /> <br /> "A demonstration of two children" is a demonstration that is a lot more than the awful genre. Easy thrill ride. With a strong focus on character and mystery, it is a complex film that can easily inspire you to show it again so that you can better understand it.
