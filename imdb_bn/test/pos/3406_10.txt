It was a movie about the CV War. My manist actually acted in this movie, Justin and Madeline were more than the wedding scene, and my uncle was extra on horseback. The script was genuine, and correct. The costumes were performed nicely, the void was gradual and even the pronunciation was good. I love in love with Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They had the best 2 choices, and it was even throwing a great supporter. The civil war is my favorite thing in American history, and I love the movie about it. I've seen several, and this movie and its successor took North and South Book 2 cakes. If you do not meet it, rent it. As soon as possible. It's pretty teaching.
