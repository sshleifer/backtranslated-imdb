2:37 What Australians think and do not say is that they are commendably successful. This is the story of real kids and I think we will be stupid to think otherwise. The only new thing 2:37 really comes from an Australian point view of us. We often see disturbing American children but are often unable to link the same problem to our own teens. Shiny and fluid operated by cinematography, but I found the lack of musical aspects of work (immediately after the frustrating final song was recognized). I appreciate the fabulous casting of this photo. These are regular looking Australian kids who invite lots of sympathy for this reason. Great performance is all round and you will not be able to keep Gary Sweet on top, this movie reminds me why sometimes the high school gets reflected and if you are not squumish, or if you want to leave warm and fiji, go and see 2:37.
