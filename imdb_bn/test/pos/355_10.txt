As long as I was able to remember I was a Mario fan, as a suggestion I have very happy memories playing Super Mario World, adding some of these memories were brought back while adding something new to this game. The latest installment of the Super Mario galaxy's amazing Mario franchise. While preserving Marie's greatest elements, before this, there is something very different from this game from any other Mario, the first spectacular difference is that this story happens at the place. <br /> <br /> The story begins much more like Mario was like a Mario game, Mario received a letter from the Princess Peach, whom the Mushroom Kingdom invited to celebrate in his palace. After reaching the pitch, Mario Bosseer and his son (Boyce Jr) attacked the fort with their airship. Bowser princess kidnapped the pitch and then lifted up in the space of her ocean. The middle of the Ocean being raised in the ocean in the ocean and the land on an unknown planet. A conversation star named Mario Lumer was found by him and was brought back to Lumer's house, a floating space station, Mario joins a lot of other Luma and Rosalina, a woman named to her leader. Rosalina Mario has said that Bowser has taken away the power station of the Astronaut Station and scattered them throughout the universe, it starts the adventure thus, on Mario to help Lumi find them and save the pitch. <br /> <br /> The way you play the game from Space Station to other galaxies, each galaxy has multiple planets that travel through alternate steps to recover the Mario Power Star. Mario can walk around the planet many times without losing gravity, some planets smaller and larger, much like the classic Mario environment. The best thing about games is control, jumping all the content and it's still the same, but Wiiote is used in many different ways in this game. You will perform Remote Marrow on an initial screen which is used as a primary attack on the game and it will enable shooting formulas. You can also point to the remote on the screen and you can use the pointer in the star or star bits in enemies or objects in the environment. Then there are graphics, these are up to the best graphics of the Wii, so hard to describe how great this game looks, you can probably see it as much as 360 games. <br /> <br /> My only minor assertions are the ongoing effects, some are used and the story is very weak. The worst part is that you lose all your life when you close the game, no matter how many resignations you resigned after resuming 4 life. Yet these minor problems are a great game for each other that is very entertaining and very challenging. In this kind of game we are waiting for the Wii. <br /> <br /> 10 of the 10 perfect!
