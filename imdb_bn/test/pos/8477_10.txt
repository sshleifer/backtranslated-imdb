Bright biography image ?????? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> biography movie. This movie came as a total surprise to me. I had to avoid this movie for very long time. Now that I'm not a fan of Jamie Fox. I'm still not his big fan, but I'm sure a fan is now. <br /> <br /> Every BIT of Oscars is eligible. One of the best performers I saw during his long-term performance. He really censorial! <br /> <br /> Good story, or story flow is brilliant for a biographical movie. I was a fan of a drama so I was not bored at all. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie so much that I can not see any flaw in the movie. I think there is no flaw in the movie. Maybe some events are faulty, but who care? <br /> <br /> The female performance of Rai's mother was also very good. And good Kerry Washington ?? He is so much more likely. If the right role is given then it can only be the next Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The story of their story was so exciting that I sneaked and squeezed ..? I've treated it very badly ??? <br /> <br /> If I was crazy or the movie did not cry to me? And it's a lot for me! <br /> <br /> In all supercar films ???? This is the best one of the century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
