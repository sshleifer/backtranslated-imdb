Start their love for the killing of three planetary stories (maybe even Indigo, O) children. Oh, and those who "hot" on their trill <br /> <br /> Bloody birthday, a beautiful medieval title for the film was a wonderful lil surprise. I did not expect a movie to deal with blood thirsty cyclopathic children. And I can say that this is also one of the best flights I've seen with kids as villains. After the movie was over, I wanted to die in these fashionable fashion. <br /> <br /> This is a really difficult flash of 80, but you can not think of anything like this child going away with this greatness and murder. Even the slightest bit of investigation will easily be unveiled as this lil shs ts murderers. But there are only a few police in the city, finally, until finally, and he was feeling a slow, so I think they could have been separated with it. Ha ha, yes, and I'm a Chinese jet pilot. However, this film delivered some modest kids, who were far more entertaining, more adult sex and large sidewalks. No kidneys! If you have less than the starred title then dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot. It's a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick.
