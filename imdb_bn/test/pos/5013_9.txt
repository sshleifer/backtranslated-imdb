By many accounts, Stu Agar was not a very nice guy. He spat on businessmen, the money he had given was a strong man, and he was verbally abusive. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers can choose to know people, make them some sports heroes who will win despite the hazard. But the high roller does not work that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the only real authorization she ever received was the death of herself. Very brave (because people will not get it) and very touch (when you do). "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Really? But there is virtually no violence. And Stuey Boyfriend gangster movie. Maybe people are not Stu and director Marty? And it really shows a low budget film and that's good! <br /> <br /> Finally, the linear flashback structure. Wow, that would get hammered. However, it does not work only, it works very well, even those who do not see the "Seventh Seal" connection. (Prof. SS In, Night plays chess with death: In HR In Stewey said, "We can play hand for the card", ... "Never say good at the cards". "Excellent last line." <br /> < br /> No trick effect or camera is run. No shaky camera Everything is trendy. Telling a tough, tight story <br /> <br /> Maybe it makes the movie very basic and makes some mistakes. But then again, so was the guy. And that makes it just about right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
