I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. Although this plot is a little unexpected, the film has created a beautiful junk for every one of the hilarious people making the film. Writing and comedy I hope is much more educated than coming. Better, they are distributed with all of them, doing a good job by unknown actors. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see this movie as the main reason was Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long "Ed" and new Apple computer ads. He was just coming into himself as an actor in "Ed" and he was nice here. He is a natural front camera. Louis Black is a social commenter who pulls no punches. He is at Comedy Central every two weeks at "The Daily Show", but he has really released HBO's "Red, White, and Screw". I regularly caught him on an XM radio censored comedy channel. Give an idea of ​​black and let him improve. No matter whether its rants and lines are scripts or improvised here. By giving her thoughts in the middle class she is invaluable. One thing about the delivery of Black, its hand gesture is not a comedian who is. Looks like he's talking to you, and I think he makes it more invaluable.
