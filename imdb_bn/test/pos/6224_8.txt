I think this is exactly when the first film will look at the film as it is formed in the way its impression is formed. <br /> <br /> I saw it as a child on TV in 1973, when it was "stranger" and I liked it. There was a time when the moon's space program was real, when the 12 shows in the world showed the child how their future looks like "search", "UFO", and "6M $ Man". Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You only see the show once and the network is broadcast on them. The only way you can slash your shows creates its own parody; They could not accept your show and join their own comments on it. <br /> <br /> I did not know what this idea of ​​pilots did. I have seen the movie and hope to return to Stryker's house; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, I do not remember it because I suspect it. I understand now Not to understand the real story, one must not see it from their point of view, but to see the characters from the film. <br /> <br /> If someone is looking as an American, it can be ridiculous about the lack. Security of a police state ... but if someone is a subject of that state, consent can be expected and security may be low. Things are estimated to be perfect, from a extreme degree to perfect, perfect anyone can not doubt, then things can not be asked immediately after the end. The mistress of <br /> <br /> is so interesting, as the old man remembers the times before but shows her words because she suspects that there is a whole secret. The police state gives some value to the knowledge of whether or not they control or control their brain power. <br /> <br /> Today, perhaps it is known of the condition of the film before it can be seen. , The mystery is so much, the wonder is lost. But in the beginning of the movie, the duo is a perfect exchange between the astronaut and his doctor if someone thinks that the film is made well in the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he crashed into the USSR. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Afterwards, any comments related to the USSR were relatively minor and later lost in the early part of the movie, May be considered. Formerly, these links are made by film, in the form of a theme change, directly with the permission at the beginning and then after the wards. <br /> <br /> To say to all, despite my favorite memories for the movie, it is not easy to see it as a series it will not be made. Every week, Stryker will make friends, Benedict will go back, Strikers will go away. Finally Benedict's society will release him. Anyone else has to be behind A cage will develop. A crew member from Stryker's mission might be a jab in something new, but it's probably not enough to continue the show. <br /> <br /> If someone goes through a knife, others have used slash in the movie, odds are they will slash as well. But if anyone thinks that it was created during the cold war and at that time the fears and assumptions of the other side were, what was the popular environment for the audience, then they could find some recreational and intellectual themes in it.
