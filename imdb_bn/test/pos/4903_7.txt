Although a "woman story," I still found this fairly attractive. It's extraordinary that the three real life sisters have playing the movie sisters! I mention Priscilla, Rosemary, and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Why were the critics of the movie critically acclaimed by the bad boy rebel John Garfield? In their hateful Liberal-dominated brain, all American characters are frustrating but chic life, here are the types of poor attitudes like Garfield that they can detect. Despite this, the film still has a full sense of love, so I like it. Some characters may make stupid things, but they are good hearts. Whose heart was bigger than "Anne" (Priscilla Lane)? I agree with the IMDB user comments critics that this picture of Priscilla is my favorite (not mine) like Garfield. <br /> <br /> As a director of Michael Cartridge, the director is better than anyone else. Cartridge ensures that any scenes, soap or any other side, has gone a long way. <br /> <br /> Along with Lane Bone and Garfield, our Cloud Renaissance (adding much needed humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (girls love interest), Cheekie Paige, Dick Foren, Frank McHug, and Ma Robson. Apparently, this film should be a hit because there were several spin-offs from him, but the content between them and the box office approaching this one in success.
