A great example of the quality plays produced by Channel 4 and BBC these years. Ted Danson gives a person's strenuous performance, which nobody will remember, and a society that believes that he is mad. This is an outstanding performance of a man most known for his role in Cheers' TV comedy sitcom. Supporting Castes are very well-selected, at least Mary Stainbergen, Danson's wife, who acts as part of Gillirov's wife. But in all things, this world has a ruthless, diverse and very subtle change in the world of Glover. The difference between the perspectives between the giant and the midgets, all played by the real actor is caught nicely. Cinematography and direction are a rare behavior.
