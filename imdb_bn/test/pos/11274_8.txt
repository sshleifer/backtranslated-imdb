Anyone who correctly identifies the opening images, since God kills himself after reading the last credit, certainly worthy of a free ticket for the rest of the transfiller. If I'm there, I would imagine "Twin Pick" as a favorite movie on the dark lodge on the movie night. I think a good title might be, "How much fun can you have with the death of neolithic technology only in the forest?" Answer, it seems, quite a bit. So, innocent "kill yourself in God," uber-pretentiousness (a proper phrase taken from a previous letter), more clearly "Elista Crowley - Hi, I Beast, deal with it!" More than Christian cosmicism (I can not believe that the Jews and the Christian Bible in other viewers will see a thick head) ... Despite all of them ... this is a brave, important task that most people do not see. I am both impressed and creeped that it is made.
