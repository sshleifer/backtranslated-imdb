For the first time, I saw Hemat 2 on BBC2 when I used to live in Art College and walked in with artists and musicians, hope for future success. So 'second home' - friendship to go out of the family home, to struggle for professional skills - firmly felt with my realism. I was captivated by all over the characters, story-story, songwriter-cameras and music. Of these, I could start German Electronic Music at 50 Electronic Stock Stations of Stockhauson, Craftwork, Can, New, Fawest of 70, John Katie's Sound Test, Walter Carlos, and British Electronic Cydadellia in White Knows. Soundtrack composer Nikos Mamangakis Carmine Burma-fame studied with Carl Arf, so I read the contemporary problem of Electronic Pop / Sound Effects World in its background. <br /> <br /> I did not see the Himat or the Himat 3 so I saw it before or after itself without completing myself completely. Someone else commented, it is both epic and lyricist - historical and artistic. Gesella Muller (Evelyn), Daniel Smith (Juan), Bach Marimba, Henry Arnold (Hermann) piano-game and Saloam Kammer (Claris) Sleo-Playing with a great voice, many favorite moments. <br /> <br /> I can write more but it has already been told here. Why can not such a master of British or American TV production? Wired's realism and politics, and the city's spaceship was David Lynch and Dennis Potter had a fantastic tropic on their serial TV, but it was mostly the cinematic and narrative industry houses and soap at its finest times. Although it should not be included in the critics' choices of the best films, it should be. I was still 17 years ago when I saw it as poetic and strong. I see them set in each autumn 3 box for 'gentle effectiveness'. Inspired and inspirational
