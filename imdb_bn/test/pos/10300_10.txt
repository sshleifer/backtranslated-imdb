Outside, this movie is even better because of Vincent D'aanfrio (Law and Order: Criminal Intent), but this movie is equally similar to the 1982 version. In some ways, the 1999 version is even better because it is more up to date (a decade more than 27 years ago), starring Terry Kinney (HMO's MacMonus), James Daly and Tony Salahb (United States monk) and Gary Sines (CSI) ). Obviously, the dialogue for contemporary audiences was changed, but most of the text was the same. In the 1982 version there was nothing that it would not play in the drama Comedy, but in the end, the film was so great within one of 1982. Character-based: Vicente d'Orfeiro Fil Filano also played an excellent, Paul Sorvino, a match between Stasi Keech and Terry Kinney, for James, I would appreciate Salahb and as Martin Shane and Sonsense Tom, I would say senior win.
