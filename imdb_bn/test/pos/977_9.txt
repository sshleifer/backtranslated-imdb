I just had to add my comments to raise this one mean. Paul Giamatti gives it a hanging and a huff of it all. He would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and will win something for it. We have got the DVD for many years and my kids (now the boys 4 4/2 and the girl 9) will look over over this, and the comedians are older enough to admit that I do not hear it in the background (and I really run the TV for the fun part). Simple moral message, several silly actions and slapstick, stupid acting to take off the edge of "bad" grownups makes less difficult language and short potty jokes make it difficult for a family to beat.
