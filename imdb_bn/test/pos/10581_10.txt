His real life story: Haggard: The Movie Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend who cheated him with the help of his two sons. 1. Who is the skate carrier, and 2. 2. Funny scientist operated by left margarine and brand DeCamillo (which does not really work). <br /> <br /> The picture Haggier the movie contains many letters from Jacques, etc. But for the sake of saying it left Margarrera and Co. This is a very weak attempt, I think it was written when it was bored, or they could not pay much attention to a project. The films also starred Jennifer Rivell, star of star Benn, starring Ryan, who originally cheated him, played Jennifer again, starred Steve Ur Halboy, who was portrayed by Rikeyon, He does not think of his character. Stay with the story, again bad acting, this character really originally created it, which does not have many lines in this film is very annoying. But worst of all, the character of Rab, the sound of a smoker, which is basically throat cancer, I think he might be better! Overall I think the character of this movie is not with the story, but in a scene, it is a particular character, a minute later, a different scene, on different characters. <br /> <br /> It is a movie, a documentary sort, it does not play by character as a documentary, acting that makes you think it's a cheap effort to make a film during your extra time. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, we start losing focus on the main character Ryan Dah, although there is a lot of attention on left and brand. <br /> <br /> This picture is okay, if you are funny that people are laughing at things, stupid stunts, terrible acting and sometimes nude scenes are not !, I think there's just no talk and just have a lot of music in the music! 7/10
