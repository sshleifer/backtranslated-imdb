His intention is strong and clear. It is not every person, Sun or not, the ideas of reality. I even suspect the idea of ​​my doubtful consideration.

And society labeled him as "schizophrenic". At the end, I got confused at first, but then you can understand that fate wanted to go with her courage and sincere faith where she wanted to go. Do not care about what to comment on the community for its investigation, looking for. And it seems like 'real' man - Anjali, psychologists, and judo - who could never reach anywhere. My family thinks that I try to feel like a movie, Schizophrenic, which is basically the other person in the world who really want to believe ...........?
