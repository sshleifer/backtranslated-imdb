One of the two best movies of the year A good shooting, well-written, well-kept film together with an outstanding cast. Lau Ching One and his friends (Dio Wang Chi Wei, Anthony Wang Chau Sun, Francis NJ Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheng Man Tate) show their chemistry and their friendships in their performance before the film. Theresa Lee played the role of her brain (though, like a female version of Michael Wang, her throat appears to surround foreign buffs with local jackets.), And I've been delighted with myself for innovative explosive scenes that I have not done since 1. Fan Boys alt.asian- cinema and 2. John Woo's take on Hardboiled. Of course the end was expected, but I feel good cheering for the police compared to a bunch of young gang members. Very enjoyable
