I'm not sure why I picked up a loan from Mom for "Nurse Betty". I think because I've heard a little bit of this movie. But i am happy i "Nurse Betty" is a real and cute movie which is a humorous and a dark side. <br /> <br /> This is Ren√©e's first big one before it hits Hollywood's head. I can see why she is an incredible actress. The scene where he finally understood and on his favorite soap opera set, you can see his face pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment. To enter this movie, he plays Betty. A shy and insecure woman standing by her disgraceful husband, she is a waitress, and a soap opera, especially in such a situation where a pretty intelligent doctor said. Dave Revel. When he was killed in the murder of his husband in separate room, the two murders he had said were: Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. He then left his mind after talking to the police and gave up the town and said that he had his former mother tongue. Dave Revelle has to find out. So, he said. Traveling to the country to find Revel and want to work as a nurse to work with Dave, he has seen this event many times, just as he is like a nurse to save a woman's brother. Everyone is telling him that he is confusing, he just looks at them as they are crazy. Dave Revel's acting actor George (his real name) thinks he is trying to listen to a crazy fan. He only saw him confused and believed that he and he were together. <br /> <br /> Ranane was very dangerous, she was so believable to lose her mind in the movie. She came so long way, and you do not want to acknowledge it, she is adorable and a great actress. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She was so impressive and laughable by Betty and while pursuing her around the country, she almost became almost cruel to Biti, where she almost fell in love with him. He and his son Wesley will have to find the berry when they knew that she had a murder scene there and they could give their identity. When Charlie sees Batie and finally holds him, he is frightened at first, but he is calm and knows that they have a real connection. It was a neatly played scene, my opinion gave Morgan a strong performance. He's just great. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock, son, Wesley is an amazingly efficient performance. He is so "gun" - if he started working hastily and took care of the business. I end up liking his humorous performance where he and the gang kept hostage by gun point only watching soap operas together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is a great movie that I would recommend for good laughter and just in a nice honest honest movie I think that anyone can enjoy. <br /> <br /> 9/10
