At first I do not think I like this movie, but as it progresses it becomes better and better. I love music and how well I was influenced by fraudulently playing Mandolin Playing Movement. My son was with me and loved the movie for the story and story of his movie and the story as it was published - how slowly the Correli women win the hearts. Both acting and story are well done and well-directed. At first Correlli was annoying, but soon she grew up on you. The twists of the plot were especially related to the Germans. I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. I'd like to buy soundtrack to listen to music again.
