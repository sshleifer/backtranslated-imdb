I see a lot of vampire movies. I know vampire movies. Hammer film has always been my favorite. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Vampire Effect is a fun movie from the beginning to the end. Dubbing is not very good, but I love Godzilla, so I badly used the movie on my mobile phone. However, I liked this movie too. SFX is great. Although Jackie Chance's part in this movie is nothing to do with the plot and the film seems to be being added to sell, but it's enjoyable. Fan work is excellent. The acting is not great, but this may do anything with bad dubbing. Perhaps if I understand it, the real language will be better with the movie. I'm sure the film seems to be bad in another language with Gone with the Bound. <br /> <br /> I own it in DVD and do not share it with. I have it sitting on my bookstore next to my Hammer Film DVD.
