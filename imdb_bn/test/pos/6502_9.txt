Wow - Most visitors of the audience shake their heads through this documentary in the worst wizards on the screen. <br /> <br /> As the New York-based black-American phenomenon moves from the beginning to the present, the current population is well-known as the sub-culture of ethnic diversity (and basically West Coast-based). <br /> <br /> The Inner Turntable does not consent to a traditional musical instrument, but it can be more versatile and technically complex. These DJs accept the skills needed for any other musical instruments - impartiality, rhythm and timing among others - and apply them to a new technology with a few other variables. <br /> <br /> Commenting on the DJ dealer that he should pronounce the word "music" like improved planets first and it works shamelessly at first, initially stupid, you go to these guys and make more intellectuals that are no single traditional Can not make the machine! Some critics have said that this film gives much attention to specific 'big' and disintegrates the opportunity to profile greater hip-hop culture. One time people in one movie!
