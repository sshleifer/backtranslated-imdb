I was fortunate to watch this movie in the pre-release of the night and although I was not expected, I actually enjoyed the movie in most cases. It was amazing to see the seizures and sea effects, and clearly provided the edge of the moment of the seat, perhaps more so that it could be done for the living. The weak parts of the film used to rotate most of the stereoical set scene. I'm not going to waste the movie, but it really follows just like an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a hazardous hazard. <br /> <br /> I said on this movie you can get past the clich√©s as long as check out the pretty good and worth.
