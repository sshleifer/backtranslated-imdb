I like the complete Savages! Why did they cancel it? They should have a second season and so ... God! They always cancel the show well ... and leave all the annoying stuff. Everything from Savages to TV has gone a lot. This show was a great idea. The only fire-fighting father with five crazy boys and a lazy dog ​​... all of them are crazy about their own house. Taj always goats ... always small ... Kyle stone! He touched everything! He's always stuck, he's always doing the wrong thing ... but still, he's so funny by what he does. Sam is the smart one. When girls come, she is always shy and stupid ... finally she ends up dating Angela. Chris is an athlete who does not do much at school to read, study, and do anything else. He is always funny And finally ... Jack! Show rock. Most ancient, macho guy, "rock star" ... but still, as everyone else is as crazy. Nick ... helpless with this boy. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... he's human! She is like a 30 year old child. She is like boys doing the same stupid thing that boys are like. I was always amazed how he became a firefighter ... and the dog was the picture of all the Saawaz family. The thing is ... everything in this show was something really big. It was everything, people! But, of course ... they rejected it ...
