A certain age group of such films will say, "I do not think they made such a movie". Walter Matthew gives her normal over-off-top performance, but instead of leaving the tooth marks all the scenes, leaving rugged Greece stains. As a great uncle, we all know that we still wear plaist polyester and feel embarrassed for everyone, but we still love anyway. <br /> <br /> The performance of Jack Lemon reminds us why he received Golden Globe nomination (22) than anyone else. He basically gave the true life-style of 'good, ordinary people', even a million in a jungle. <br /> <br /> This picture will probably appeal to people who prefer cute humor designed to face those who do not face appeasement or objectionable, but praised a wide range of acting with a direct face. <br /> <br /> Nice to cast the full support into their power to play this helpless character while maintaining the reality of each character. <br /> <br /> Brent Spinner gives a fantastic performance as a professional version of a lounge lease. Anyone who knows the professional host in real life will immediately recognize the type of game he is playing. He's perfectly type nails. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because the plot has been made thousands of times, it is not a date, but it is a timeless theme. <br /> <br /> The rest supporter shows that the professionals who are writing for them when instead of vying for role skills, spotlights. This photo even shines the second stage actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who want to see professional artists engaging in their crafts. The plot goes away and the actors shine.
