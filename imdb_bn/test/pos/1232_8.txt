This film has been successful, for what it is set. This is a short tragedy. Although my choice of film really translates the characters and their relationships, this film is meant to give you the taste of keeping only the "next thing" factor. After watching this, I'm really asking for more, much more about the characters in the characters, the impact of those people in them. I think manufacturers are interested in viewers. The acting is amazing. There are not many lines of film so their body language, facial expression, and overall presence must be strong enough to resist a scene. Franco and Tiny have both that element and it shows. To spend time on them (especially Franco), they probably believed in this movie and wanted to separate from it and for this, what I appreciate the film. I'm also happy that I own it so I can share with other people that it never existed.
