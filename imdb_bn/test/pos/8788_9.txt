Alfred Hetcock's Sabotou is not one of his best-known films; Made of two widely popular and critically acclaimed pictures, doubt and shadow of doubt, it is generally regarded as less effort. I agree that the next film is diminishing, for the first time in the mainstream of the American landscape hits Hitco, but Sabotu is at least as suspicious as it is; His main fault is less than the charismatic star player, Bob Comings and Priscilla Lane. <br /> <br /> We feel its way across America in Sabotur, literally, its main character travels in search from New York, California. A criminal was charged for his crime. Cummings are very young here, and quite compelling. His genital (but immunized) character completely does not appear to be appropriate for a suitable creator, and seems appropriate, although the director was in the process of mediating himself in the middle of the process, and an old, more established star may close the story. Precious Lane's Lively Heroine, which is not a common type of director, at that time there was a common type of American film; And he and Cummings need an exposure and a youth director at this time both his life and work. I can not imagine older, more difficult types - for example Cooper and Stanwick - as well as among them, carried them, well, work like a lot of baggage. <br /> <br /> In the film of Hitcoch, nothing is seen. Sabotu is different from his well-known films where the audience is initially given play. Though Cummings is an accused arsonist, we know that he is innocent. The fame soon became very clear; And the movie hinges more of its plot than its ironies. Do not have accessory pleasure, and here the master is not disappointed. An interesting, Todd Brownish comes in contact with some circus fricks, which helps to capture Cummings. In another scenario, James Vell's Frankenstein's Bride smithing, Comings spend some time in a blind man's hut, because it turns out, Lane's uncle. The director is probably reading the original American film of the last decade? However, whatever the misuse and different aspects of the film, it gives a playfulness and diversity, since someone adds a young leadership factor, the picture seems to be a young man, still learning his skills. <br /> <br /> The next scene in New York is much more suspicious and more ideal than the directors, because the picture gradually becomes more Hitkachian. In the end I find it a satisfactory job; And as an actor there are no dark side of the link nor the movie, there is also a movie. It is deliberately lightweight, and I suspect semi-experiments; An attempt by Hitcoch, if he has done so well in America, to see if he can drag it into a US setting. She is pretty successful. Next logical step: Shadow of a doubt, a movie that travels from the east to west, and with completely different values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
