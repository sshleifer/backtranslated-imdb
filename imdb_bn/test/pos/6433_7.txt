I rarely see small films because they seem to be present only on late night television and are not enough to inform me about the small films that are valuable. As the room extra features in The Heater DVD, it gives me an excellent opportunity to showcase the high quality shortage with Roger Howard. <br /> <br /> is artisticly shot in black and white, exploring the room, he expresses people's emotions and a documentary / interview style in a room passed in the first stage of the adult. The conversation is very poetic, usually a person who expresses his feelings for a woman, but it is related to sometimes lacking in ringing and intensity. This adds to the great reality and depth for the performance of Horoscope, who is mostly perfect as an intelligent person with his life behind. <br /> <br /> Piano music from the Hari (air) room keeps on continuing in the background and enhances the photo's sensitive environment and makes the feeling of depression intensified by air. <br /> <br /> This version of Horoscope shows more than its bad people in psychological Hollywood and its sensitive side perfectly. Meticulous Hartminech is suddenly useful in Flashback view as a Harry with a silent role. He sees how he is influenced by the music and his frustration when it goes away. <br /> <br /> The last is predictive and many features leave you in a much more reflective mood than the lengthy film. A very good effort.
