I saw the movie "Hoot" and then I decided to comment immediately. The truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant adjectives of this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do what they want to do, which is probably the same, but if they think of anything else in the future, they think about themselves that they will do something useful! This film is not just about children, this film shows us that children usually care more about it, then adults do it. At the age of twelve I saw some waterfall and I knew that they were protected by law and did not dare to touch them without fear of law, but feared that I could harm them. (I'm currently 15) So far, acting was great, 3 main characters are well explained and we all will learn from them. I hope you think about what you saw in this movie !!! And enjoy!
