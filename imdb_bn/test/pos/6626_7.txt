It was no surprise to me that it was a very sad and spoiled movie. Finally, it is about the impact of the war on civilians and it is "king of sadness", Ingmar Bergman. In other words, many of Bergman's work has penetrated deep into human suffering and anger, and this film does not seem so great from this director. <br /> <br /> The movie offers more insight into the lower depth of humanity. The reason is that, primarily, the main characters (Levi Olman and Max von Saido) try to overcome adversity and are generally decent (though somewhat stupid) people. However, as deprivation after deprivation, they (especially Von Saido) become less and less humane and more vivid - do something to survive. Have fun to see <br /> <br />, no disrespectful way! However, an interesting insight into human nature. <br /> <br /> PS - 1 I love this picture that it is to avoid a stupid film chiche. When the couple sat down to drink a glass of wine with the shopkeeper, they completely destroyed the alcohol! In most movies, they just touch or touch their drinks. It makes me crazy, because I do not drink $ 4 alcoholic beverages without drinking it until it is a horrible taste or it has a bug float! Say!
