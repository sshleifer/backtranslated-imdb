If you want your movies to draw your emotions from you, but if you like your movies with a person, then you can root it and if you like your movies black and white, you will see this movie! Start from the beginning, because you do not want to miss a beat. It's sometimes slow, and when something happens, it surprises you, when the plot starts publishing, you'll be on the edge of your seat! I know I was! My mother told me about this picture because this movie is happening in our family. We love Frankie, who will take the lead. Frank Sinatra is what you think, in the film, he is a leper and he does not sing, so keep an open mind. It was created for this era, it is a story that is being said all over the country and in the whole world. Please see, if you like the old movie, try this one.
