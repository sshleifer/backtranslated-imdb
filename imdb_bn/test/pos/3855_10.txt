This is one of my favorite Disney movies Among the things you can expect in Disney Animation include: cute creatures, great songs, a nasty villain and many adventurers. The story begins in Paris, where Aristochet Duchess and their three children live with a brain on their brains. The brain's intelligent Butler, Edgar, plans to leave his entire fate cats until life is enough for them. He realizes that if he gives chance to claim fate then the cats will come out of the way. A wonderful, often forgotten best-composition in the 1970s - a time when some animations were created in Disney Studio - which combines songs with titles such as "The Aristocats" and "EveArabi Wits to Be Bit", which will encourage viewers Young and old with its chronic jazziness
