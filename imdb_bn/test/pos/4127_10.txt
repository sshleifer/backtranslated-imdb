This is a movie where I just want to walk on my feet and dance around the house. This is a very positive and happy kind of music. Some sad parts of the movie but most music makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Bodie Holly. Bodie Holly even told her to go to her feathers even her parents, and producers of Nashville record. Body Holly did not give up what she liked. I saw this movie until I knew much about Body Holly. I went to the surf ballroom where he last played, but I did not pay much attention to this movie until I see it. It's an incredible movie about so much fun, so go to boogie and watch this movie.
