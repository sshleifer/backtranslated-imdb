When I came out of the theater, I saw this movie as a teenager, when I returned. After about 30 years it is again seen, how surprised it is. Gags are still funny, great work of interaction between characters, and Cameo comes off better than before. (Steve Martin should be the best.) <br /> <br /> All of my kids (9, 11, and 14) liked this, and the music is good enough to wash the tune many days later. <br /> <br /> I will recommend before filming, to see at least half a dozen episodes of Mup Pate show, to get the sense of story behind the characters, otherwise the movie has won 'all that much knowledge is done.
