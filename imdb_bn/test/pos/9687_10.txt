If you are a fan of Jacks, Viva La Left or CCY videos, you already know what you are doing. But it is one of the rare cases when a signal is better than the real! And people do not pack an average low blow in this movie. But I mean a better way. This is the same type of death-suicide, intimate emotions that we all know and love and left, Noxville and Co. Hope this time but even more smile than before! With Jonny Noxville's insane tolerance for the pain, you have a funny movie about jealousy of Left Margaret for his friends / family and to love Steve-Lee's take-out factor. Jackas crew stunts, squats and general mayam bars have been raised. Jackass 3? Suspicious, because it is almost impossible to improve perfection.
