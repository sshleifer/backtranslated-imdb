Kid is a staff image consultant, Ruins Duirz, who is a really good family movie about a lot of money, good work, nice house etc. The only problem is that he does not have any social life because he does not think he is always very beautiful, like him. Although one day his eight-year-old version of his museum is shown in the museum, there are some changes. These ribs give a second chance to correct things. Bruce Willis plays a key role here and he really gives a good performance. The child is a wonderful, heart-warming film for everyone.
