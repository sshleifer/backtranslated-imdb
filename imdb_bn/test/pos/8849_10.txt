A brilliant horror film Very awesome and very scary. The Thing John Carpenter is a re-establishment, but please, do not give up this movie. It's just brilliant. In the beginning of this movie, the explosion of Earth's people has hit the Alien space station several hundred years ago, which unveiled the title title of the title in the wonderful white and blue statement 'Thing'. Sometimes one of the best opening credit for a horror film. <br /> <br /> Baron people are a delight to see the performance of the actor who acted on the actor and the location for their station setting in Antartica, apparently on the widescreen overspace. It will be great in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All these actors are really good and create awesome scenes of pano and excitement that has infected the thing. My favorite scene of the whole movie, when Macrici examines all those still alive for the exam, it is fictional, scary, and finally spectacular. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> If he does not get an Oscar for the best visual effects at the time, he can stay well. It is also controversial about whether John Carpenter is the greatest film ... it is definitely a great strategy. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the refrigerator. Basu and The Thing Clock, the terrible masterpiece of the execution of the force, which is against the tower-shaped towers of Gore and Muricha. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
