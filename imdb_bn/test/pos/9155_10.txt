I like this event, but still he does not remember anything that started with "American Emilia". Sheriff, a city trying to steal town and try to move to Mexico, will love it. It is a tongue of cheeks that brand it as a product of a gift, just like he does. James runs the same character in many of his shows and movies, but it did not quite get it in any way. <br /> <br /> PSS. Again, killing the main character <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I think right, the "good" brother died and was replaced with the "evil" twin in an effort to increase ratings. Make each other more like the West on TV. I think this program was much more than its time and I still miss it. Something is missing in the TV without a Jimmy G. Show.
