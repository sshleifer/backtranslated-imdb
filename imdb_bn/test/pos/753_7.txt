Nurse Charlotte Bell (Lovely Rosie Holocaci√≥n) for a new job ready madness. Stephen's came to the clinic. Stefens is not found by any other supposed doctor at the location of Fayer's weapon "Judge" Oliver W. Cameron. (Any time he encounters a situation outside his control, his name is repeated). That doctor Geraldine Master (Annabelle Weenick) is not sure who Beale is suited for their establishment. After a long discussion about the position (which is a very painful scene, because of the two controversies about sending Stephen's letter to Bill, Clest's job often reminds him that he was no longer in charge). The master works at the nursing position, but the good doctor probably does not think he is ... <br /> <br /> The lunar repository includes Sam (Bill McGee), a straightforward child-man who was the last victim of Stephen's lobby, Jennifer (Harriet Warren). ) A woman who is required to comfort her for an adult, when she looks at the finger of the head like chicken, (Jesse Kbyby) is often annoyed with the annoying problems of harassing Harry Potter (Camila Carr), Alison (Betty Chandler), a sexy nymph who likes to choose and hop with any person and "Sergeant" Juffy (Hugh Phagin) In the ideals of the soldier you are not protected from the war madness. <BR> <br /> This picture shows the overwhelming methods of running the clinic by allowing patients to move to the clinic, and lock all the doors with the lock in the lock ... and not mention that Oliver is still with the dog. Stephens is allowed to roam despite spinning. And, exactly what happened Stephen's? Ah ha ha .. <br /> <br /> If you are a revolutionary brand in the movie, Taki 70's drive-trash is a lot of fun. I attracted to the annoying fix about the emotional rejection due to their unpredictable nature. You do not know what can happen, especially in this case where they often allow unexpected excursions. Some consider liability for low budget, but in the case of this film, I think it enhances the experience. Cheap photography and poor production prices (some horrific locations are being shot for peanut in a run-down house) It looks like crypier and I feel like a vigilant pinging in the madness through a camera lens on the outside.
