Astrix's second live action is rather much better than the combined elements of the ten different stories known as the first movie, rather than being fairly close to the comics. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Queen Cleopatra has made a bet with Caeser to build a palace in Egypt to show the Egyptians a great man. Royal Architect tried to help Estrichs, Obelix and Droid Gatphix to complete his work. Most laugh loudly, some jokes that only the French can get (35 hours a week) and others who are more universal. The special effects of the big budget are spectacular but overshadowed by the original quicker jokes. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier still work wildly as a wolf and Monica Baluchi is the perfect voter as Cleopatra. Also, for comic fans, the sunny pirates make a look for their absence on film 1.
