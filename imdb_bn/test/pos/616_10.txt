I'm just starting to explore the wondrous world until the continental ozone. I have seen only four movies so far, and at the end of the row it hit me that all of them were just about women and their actions. Not the only nonprofit female character among the 12, and all of them come with heavy influences around. <br /> <br /> This image is probably the only one (four out) where this effect is good. << br /> <br /> The gay theme is often the ideal part of the background for ozone movies, so it does not occupy accents (although the characters may also appear). Look for the feeling, not for their object. <br /> <br /> Very nice and fast, really like summer romance, and while reducing thoughts and minds, it gives some food for soul.
