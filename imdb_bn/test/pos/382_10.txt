I have used this film for over 10 years in my College Ethics course (also Woody Allen's "Crimes and Mismanans" - another awesome, multi-level moral study). <br /> <br /> Imagine it. I do not pay too much attention to the "strangers" unrealistic features because all the fictional movies are lying at the most level. I love this movie as a fun trick, instantly, with many curiosity twists and visual pleasures - even if it is "incredible." The story is so good that I'm not thinking of criticizing its legitimacy (although I must admit that the tennis match seems to be the weakest part of me - not too much Hollywood faf and not enough real tennis competition). <br /> <br /> Some of the problems presented in the film, which promise realistic moral education and moral discussion: <br /> <br /> 1. Moral passivity: Some weaknesses of Ga's character are aimed at Hitchcock. A basic moral insight into the film is the inability to express its moral position. Gaya is unable to effectively block Bruno's insane offers. An interesting question is why and how does the guy so brazen behavior, void? A possible answer is its depression due to its intense and complex divorce process. <br /> <br /> Another failure at the beginning of Guy: On the train, to get away fast, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all good. But Guy's literal meaning reversed its inflected, satirical meaning. Bruno Chris Cross takes literally money as an agreement for murder. Guy takes sarcastic money as a escape from any killing agreement. At some point, at the outset, Bruno partly says that an agreement has been hurt, gai can draw on the web more complexity. Manipulating Bruno Guy; Gain's linguistic confrontation gives Bruno the moral "stagnation" of the train to the train. The brune manipulating game can take another meaning. . . <br /> <br /> 3 Privacy: Some have been guessed about sex relationships between Guy and Bruno. It seems to be ridiculous first, especially in the case of Girl Mary and her relationship with Ana, apparently it seems to be herxoxial. However, remember that Guy is ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotypically - remember it in 1951), especially in Bruno's relationship, spirits. Guy, strong athlete, weak inside. Bruno (playing "playing against himself"), first appeared firmly and physically, but then there are some "fruitful" traits (Bruno's fashion and footwork); Gaya expresses her emotionally in various situations; She is eating a manicure from her mother, Bruno is kissing and clapping his mother's hand; More fine gay stereotype, which contains cryptic meaning from Hitako's perspective). I heard Hitakkake explain his purposes here. <br /> <br /> 4. Disorder and distrust: Happiness in the family and from Brunei to the police makes some vague errors hidden from the family. The Guy failed to fully understand that the confession of confession could be better than the quick cover-up or confession. Again, Gay is directed by passivity, insecurity, fear - and perhaps self-hatred that is close to Bruno's own self-hatred, we are closer to seeing or accepting it. Guy and Bruno both work their own instances of persecution. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of evidence: Guy feels a problem strengthening the evidence to eliminate himself. The faster the police will solve a huge problem, the Guy will trap himself with his own suspicion and insecurity: the absence of deliberate alivi; Alcohol professor testify in favor of Guy Guy; Political need of the presence of a prince; And the reasons for other personality may seem to be safe for Guy. As Bruno, he is ineffective - not just dangerous (yet one can blame Gai for the murder of Miriam). <br /> <br /> 6. Disease and mental disorder: Bruno is legally responsible for killing? More morally incapable of Bruno, like a sick pandemic, a more sinister guy can be a healthy person who fails to stand up and works to prevent crime morally. Guy's failure is like a man who fails to call the police if he is threatened by a sick friend and dies. Someone may agree that multiple crimes have been committed and Guy is an emotional colleague with emotion. <br /> <br /> This and many other features of this movie create a gem in the "Strangers of a Train" morality game. Diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.
