This game was seen in my husband's comfortably few years ago in Shoite and when the final note struck, I wanted to stop the sofa and sustain the production. As it was, I tear off a tear that it was a fine act and a bunch of songs. For my birthday, my kids bought me the VVS version as well as CDs playing with Leni Carrio in the role of Sune Tod. <br /> <br /> I have shared this game with many ... Some people are making this issue a bit sick, but there is nothing more than praise for the song. <br /> <br /> I always love to interact with songs with Angela Lansbury and George Henne as well as Horn and Edmond Lindek as Judge Turpin. <br /> <br /> I must have a DVD.
