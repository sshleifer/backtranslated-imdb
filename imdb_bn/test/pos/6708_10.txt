There is one by far the best science-film films. However, it took plural philosophy to understand the concept of the film and was able to appreciate the original plot of the film, not special effects. It is my own feeling that the film's film received such a bad reviews because no one took the time to see the time to see it. In some moments you want to rush and pass, but they are few and far away. Hooper, who operated TCM1 and 2, and took a remix from Mars to the Invaders, and the Fanhaus did his best work here. Great score, good acting, and great effect to make it a movie to add to your collection, if you see the WideScreen version on DVD, it is highly recommended that in the science finals.
