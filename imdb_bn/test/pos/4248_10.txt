I acknowledge that I have never heard of this movie. Yesterday I caught TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I smile so hard and love it till the end. When collaborating with Salvador's Dali and Malklin X, Marx will love Bhai's movie and then all except LSD <br /> <br /> <br /> On this day, both of the funny and impressive words are confirmed in this movie, Plus about 200 IQ's most comedy points today and boot surrealistic points. I saw it until 6:00 and up to 2:30. I'm asleep and missed my obligations Still worth it. I will not recommend it to rent, I would suggest ownership to it. It was that good. <br /> <br /> My only caution is that dates and dates of references may not be acquired by young people. Use it and your head. <br /> <br /> I will always keep it in my top comedies.
