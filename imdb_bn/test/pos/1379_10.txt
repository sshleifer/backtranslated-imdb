Why am I trying to work on this picture? It sure is why it is not spent !! Did I see a painted pistol in there? Perhaps Scotland's Visual Effects Houses do not have the same type of school? Or maybe they did not have any money? Definitely created very rival boys show a gang making a movie against discrimination. O of non-SM-fold! But what I really liked was the performance marks. Mike Mitchell and Patrick White 2 play lead parts like normal boys. There is no Hollywood historian here. <br /> OK, so the effect is not very good at work. Spaceships will not look as good as the FX World today, and I've seen many free stuff on YouTube. But they keep the film together very well after going to the plane. Was this portrayed by Scotland or just a Scottish crew? Or is it just a good effect to work? Did they edit the water? Finally I liked this picture and were frustrated when they all died.
