Really, this movie should be released in DVD. I think a studio movie that I think has received a copy of her copy and I was completely satisfied !!! It was in my own film because of the movie list only. My three people, Michael York, Olivia smile Both Romeo and Juliet, and John Gielghud have been. Sorry for the bad spellings, so I was alone there, I thought that the small amount I was spending was right. Boy i was right I'm not going to give this one away, however you already know the story, but if I can say that you can get yourself a copy in a format ... do it! @Don't be sorry National Press Club
