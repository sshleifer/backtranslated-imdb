Adapted from Sam Shepard's game, this film holds many game-like elements such as a relatively specific setting (a street side 50 in the southwest) and holding wide, confusing conversations. A female "May" is a person "Hung" by Eddie (played by Sam Shepard). He tried to hide him out of the motel, but he found him. The film searches for their relationship history, especially from their childhood, which has brought them to this stage. Feeling sympathetic to the characters and their current relationships of functioning are very easy as the result of past events beyond their control. We mainly fight their war, up, fight, put up and so on. A picture standing in my mind, Eddie is jumping on his shoulder and trembling, he does not want to go anywhere, <br/> <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is a perfect living environment with the voice. A less known artist "Sandy Rogers" He's the voice of the doll in this country that almost yodels some points on the album! This is a movie that is lodged in some parts of your brain / soul. In other words, go see it!
