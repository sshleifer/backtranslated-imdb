Honestly .. this program strengthened my heart, I saw it every day in the Fox family and now that the new season has started, I was more interesting than ever before. Characters are so advanced and their relationships are so real Will recommend this event to a woman or a mother and a girl .. Worst girls talking loudly to Lorelie, which will really inspire you and the show is violent and not very serious, but it is quite serious enough to be completely addicted. It is an hour long which is a major plus because you can not get enough of Gilmour! Even within an hour .. Emily and Richard Gilmour's KICS (Laurie's parents, Rory's grandparents) are your rich parents. Diary and Richard's Emily President is a well-known lawyer and Yale's alumni. Rory follows her grandfather's footprints and they can not make them happy anymore, of course Rory's mother is so proud of her, but her entire life has finally defying her parents. Rory does not help her for her journey, believe me, she gets closer to each episode;)
