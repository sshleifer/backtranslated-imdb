The plot started to be attractive, but in the end too much of the time dies, the thriller-mystery view of the story turns into a deaf. <br /> <br /> The only true highlight is Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who again had their excellent selves. Try with an improper ending last though not a good end.
