Many aspects are excellent movies Vicente Aranda was successfully successful with showing time (1830). The light, the place, the feeling, is fully felt from the beginning of the movie. And besides - opposite of what happened to "Mad gain" (Juna la Loca), rather a historical film - this beautiful photography / music / clothes all wrap up a liquid plaque that only possible climax reaches. <br /> <br /> <br /> Paj Wage like Karzen with actors are outstanding: liar, seductive, provocative, complete sex, so beautiful karmen. Saberlia firmly believes in the audience about her immediate crazy love for Kamman, but she is successful in expressing the true tragic mood of the whole movie. I recommend it to everyone: The Spanish movie of the year.
