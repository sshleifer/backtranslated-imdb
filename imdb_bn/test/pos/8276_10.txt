I was compared to most of the critics - not in the 80's. I was born on 14 May 1994. Despite this, my life was much more in the 80's style. When the other kids had Playstation, I was playing Jelda in my NES etc. Now, despite being 15 years old at the time of writing this film, this movie has a special place in my heart. I, 80 years of childhood childhood due to childhood, saw many TV shows and saw many movies that other kids did not see, and this movie is one of them, and the most one. <br /> <br /> This is Alvin Sevilla, Los Angeles, Simon Sevill, Theodore Sevilla and David Sevill. Chipmun's adoptive father is looking at Russia to arrive at David Airport, because he is going to European business. Her taxi is almost there and Chipmunks help her pack. When they are talking, Alvin Dave has come along with the world to see (although technically Dave is going to Europe only, so for Alvin, America and Europe have simply expressed the desire to qualify as 'world'). Under the supervision of Miss Miller, David Chipmun left, for the boys' displeasure. Soon Dave went to the airport and Chimmun with Miss Miller was kept at home. Later, playing "The World in 30 Days" against Chipmunce Chippets (Brittany, Janet, and Elanore) in a local cafe After losing the game to the UK from the air of the Hot Air balloon from the sky of the magazine, Alvin agreed with Brittany that there would really be a nation winning the world. Two diamond runners Clouse and Claudy Furstian, sitting in a nearby table, argue for them and the world needs a safe way of transmitting their diamonds, making them fool the children for their sake. They will create a nation around the world, where each team will keep their puppets (secretly filled with diamonds) in the drop-out all over the world and get a doll (confidentially diamond filled with payment) in the similarity of the opponent's team "There were diversities". . The winning team will then receive a 100,000 dollar prize. They do this because they believe that Jamal (an Interpol agent who had been hot on their heels for some time) would not be suspicious because they are just kids (but, it seems unexpected because because of their travels, the kids will not have any security checks Do not go and even the doll is not asked, I suspect that Claus or Claudia personally take a diamond No.) And so a great adventure is starting. This image is a classic and there is no reason why I do not like it. It plays great animations and top-powered voice, which can not mention kick-ass music (forgive my French: P). My favorite song is nothing but the holes of 'The Girl's and Boys of Rock and Roll'. This is an extraordinary rock music that can not be topped. It's my favorite moment in film. Other notable songs include "Loving Lucky" (the suggestion for a child's picture?) And "mother's mom" as well as "Old Bride" and "Seeing the World Off". The main theme of the movie was heard during the opening opening of the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with "mom" still brought a tissue to my eyes. I did not think of anything related to the song "Loving Lucky", but when I grew up and learned about life, it became clear that the song was somewhat light. The song, with the emphasis on the animator's chanting of children's pants, emphasizes the song. This is especially evident in Egypt's view, when chippites are followed by men of Arab prince, when Alan's hot wind sticks beside the balloon basket and his skirt completely denies gravity. Although it can not draw anything from the overall quality of the film, it does not seem to be one of the world's people that is walking on four-foot chips and speaking incredibly high-exclamatory voices and dealing with them. Just like they would be a human child. However, after a few scenes, the chips discovered the diamond diamond and agreed to find chips and go home. Directed by Jones Karman, this film and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr., know letters better than that. They also make voice of Chipmunus and Chippets. Alvin and Simon (and Dave) and Johnny's voice voices for all the chips and theodore for juice. While talking about male characters voiced by the female voice actress, Nancy Cartayt (Bert Simpson's voice) created a look in this movie. He is a very small but very important part of the Arab Prince. Finally, a happy one. The crooks have been caught, the last of the loose ends and children are driving when the children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving in the sunset, alleging that Alvin does not get her 100,000 dollar prize for the victory of the race, which eventually bothers until she bothers '' Alvin! '' And the screen is blackened <br /> <br /> Classic is ending. I hope you found my review useful for this movie, and if you did not see this flick, give it a watch, it's worth the money. This nostalgic classic gets 10 to 10 difficulties in the 80's. <br /> <br /> 'Headin' for the top, you do not know! We do not believe now '
