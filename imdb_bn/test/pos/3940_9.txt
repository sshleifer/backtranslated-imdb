Especially for coupe lovers, although Clint Eastwood is very strong, while unreasonable presence is a great resource for this very good documentary film. It is basically a biography of Gary Cooper based on his film, but more personal personal archives, which shows him as a child, as a young man, some friends of his family (Picasso, Hemingway etc). ), As an old man, finally, like a sick and close dead person. After "the end", I did not feel that I knew people better. But I spent a great moment, seeing the best moments in her movies; And my respect for very talented actors and great professionals was tenfold increase. The film shows, most interestingly, Cooper's career can be parallel with the evolution of American society before and after WW2. During the two great moments, Cooper answers to justice about the world of filmmaking; And when James Stewart (very good one) got a prize for Cooper one month before his death. I'm not a crate, but ... that was close! See it, if you can: It's very valuable. ... if you love Cooper, that's it. Or an old America ...
