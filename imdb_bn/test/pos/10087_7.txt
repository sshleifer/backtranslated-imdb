Another Asian horror movie packed with intense, and scary moments. Another Asian horror trademark plot complexity, which is also here. Chief Sporing Wiring! <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite simple - after having two sisters hanging their parents in a mental institution, they go to live with their parents and parents. Sisters feel very unfavorable to their mother - especially big - and they seem to ignore their father. Mother carefully pauses the younger sister long and the older sister tells her father. Then it hits you, "Your sister has died for so many years now" It turns out that the big sister has not been rescued from her mother's death and we do not know that the leaked garbage leaked has been killed by the small sisters. For the husband-head, he is proud of the older sister - when the real parents go inside, the father-in-law (actually the arrogant instead of the sister) is sitting in sack! I hope this has been cleared for confusing Asian awful fans. Finally - my favorite scene is the scene where parents invites inviting friends and a leakage of friends starts a panic attack. Very awesome 10 out of 7
