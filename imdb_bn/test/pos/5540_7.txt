Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally cast as a widowed widow in this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modin starred in a strange FBI agent who played with him. Dean Stockwell steals this exhibition which puts big shots which pestering Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruel is dynamic as her jealous wife. It's all very 80, but that's just fun added. A nice little flick, though not for every taste.
