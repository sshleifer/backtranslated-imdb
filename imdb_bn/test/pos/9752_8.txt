I found this movie to be educational, entertaining and very moving. During his time at Kosovo, I was very impressed by how much Justice Arber had contributed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> While the story line of this movie may not be completely realistic, I have had the desire to know more about the word about Arbaar. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I said, the film must "see".
