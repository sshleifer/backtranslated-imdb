The first half of the movie was afraid of hell from me and I was not afraid to be naturally, but the second half of this thriller did not work well, but still very scary! A good thriller, better than to use the easy way to make horror. Lowbudget, Russia set, unknown cast, and made in Europe. But still great fun, and yes some good smiles are thrown for good things!
