Over the years, I have seen many times watching this movie "HBO" and now I have a copy of my DVD. I must say that it is certainly interesting and educational time very memorable and entertaining. Since a TV fan can be related to the pre-90s when Johann Karson is considered to be KJK or Dave, the living legend of "The Tonight Show"? This original movie of HBO "The Lett Shift" creates real facts and shows the true facts shown behind the war in the scenes of NBC and CBS and even ABC Networks and they are fighting for J & Dave's service. Acting seems to be real because the very small TV footage is shown in real life with people because actors of Leno and Letterman consider this to be true. I do not know if it's true on pages that I did not read the book of Bill Carter, but I enjoyed this movie over the years. From the moment when it starts showing the CBS Entertainment title, Johanine is looking for Leno Sabe and they decide that they want to play last night. After the announcement of his unexpected retirement, Curson wants to remain loyal to NBC, but if the Letterman wants a crack on slot at 11.30 pm, there will be conflict. The helpless interview with Michael Wavets (Treat Williams) was fun, all those who want to consider Letterman be seen for the show. It was interesting to see Jevina's view that Letterman could walk to NBC and call CBS directly. And Rehai Little was awesome like Johnny Karasan, her screenplay did not match. And Lane talent manager Helen was given a lot of exciting moments by baking and firing, which NBC leaders pressure him to impose. Overall, a great film that really shows the TV shows and it proves that networks are power and money hungry, it shows that it is a cyclone business. There is definitely no business like show business. Great work from HBO is very memorable and a clock any time it showed the true story of late night war.
