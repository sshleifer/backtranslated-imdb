I've recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase. I was born in the 1980s, so from the mid-80s to the mid-90s, there has been a significant place in my growing picture. <br /> <br /> This special movie was my darling, and so when I'm happy it is available in the UK. It has not got worse over time, it's still a great movie, which has plenty of tension in its own way. Sure, it falls in the big, big budget shade, but you do not want to stop enjoying it. <br /> <br /> For a purchase of a discounted price or even worth a price you will get it.
