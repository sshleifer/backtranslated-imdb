This is the best movie I've ever seen and I love it a lot so sad and loving I could see this movie again and again. When I first saw it in Disney Channel, I would like to see this movie again. I like to watch this movie every day and I recommend it to anyone. This is really a good movie. Anyone who does not see this movie and thinks about it, it goes well and sees it because it's really good. The boy learned about the girl and since then I was in this movie. If I could see two movies every day, it would be one and loved one, my two favorite movies I really love them
