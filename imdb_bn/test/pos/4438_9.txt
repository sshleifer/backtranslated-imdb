Respect his father! He wanted to know about a person he knew a little bit, and at the end of the journey, I believe Nathaniel has learned what he has learned and personally has his subject. 5 years of filmmaking, and a quarter of the century after his death, Louis I. His commitment to his work of the ear - meaningful for humanity and the constant determination of building the whole world - without any hesitation, his life is proudly portrayed in his son Nathaniel's "Director of Non-Sunjor Journey" documentary. <br /> <br /> This image is not a title of Louis's work. There are lots of books and archived articles that have records of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary acts as a mystery, writer-director and co-producer Nathaniel Kahn was looking for the person whom he briefly knew his father. <br /> <br /> The image section In "Heading West" we are at the Sol Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. The sight of seeing it - an integral idea of ​​the building and the environment, the illumination of the scientists at work is amazing. 35 years ago, from a former colleague working with Lou, we have heard in detail about his immediate attention, how he can be 'helpless' - of course he did not empty the words in his criticism. A memorable scene when the camera is dragged extensively and we see Nathaniel skating around the Shaw Institute's plaza area - a small picture, such as playing with a baby boy's father. <br /> <br /> The "immigrant" section came to see us as a typing, which worked with the Argentine collaborator 'Lou' and gave birth to a girl Alex. At the age of 80, Nathaniel's return to the tie with the film crew on the Bath House project in New Jersey Trenton was nostalic. "Go to the sea", we are going to see Barias for the American Air Symphony Orchestra - all made up of steel, and met with Robert Boudreau, who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally called him 'son of Lou'. Boudieu toured, saying that she saw Nathaniel at the age of six, with her mother (Harry Pattinson), and she did not tell anyone that Laura was the son. <br /> <br /> "Nomad," like his father, Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem, and came to know about the Syignag project that his father had started but did not understand. He went out crying and saw that his head was stopped by his head, his head gave me a sense that he would not have to be a Jew, but to be the son of his father. We sit with her two half-sisters in the "Family Matters" section. We heard him speak to his mother talking to his mother and to talk with the previous officers in his father's office, we know how his father works deeply and lived virtually there, sleeping on the floor of the office floor, weekend, and everyone on the carpet. <br /> <br /> "Journey to End" was brought to the Indian Institute of Management Management building in our Indian Indian campus. There was an unlikely conversation with architect B V Doshe. In the end, Nathaniel finds his father Louis Kan a very live-his soul lives in him. This documentary is a tier jarger for me too. I was mostly scary in the eye - it was very sensitive and in addition to his famous works and buildings, people were afraid of the architect and his son and women of his life. Louis I. Kan wanted to give love to Jagogal Singh and three families in the 'whole world' (you can say that he has three women on his inspiration). Bangladesh Highway Capital's architect Shamsul Wars (completed nine years after Law's death), is so ruthlessly mentioned that: Louis Kan has given Bangladesh many times, spent time in Bangladesh, understands the culture of place and culture - as well as giving democracy through what he has achieved. , And for such dedicated people, usually close to him are often seen by them Do not miss. It seems that the value of being great comes with an inevitable personal sacrifice. <br /> <br /> This picture reminds me of King Weidore's "The FountainHade" 1942 (a good dramatic story on B / W with the music of Mac Stainner), based on Anne Rand's novel, Gary Cooper stood as inconsistent architect. By her own ideals, and Patricia Blue is parallel to her life as a supportive woman. <br /> <br />
