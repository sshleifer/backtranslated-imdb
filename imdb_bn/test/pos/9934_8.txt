After the death of the main actress in the car accident, her little little Betty was brought forward. It's very lucky for him, a problem: one of his fans who decided that he would kill all his friends and make his watch. What is his relation with Openers, and what is his attraction with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm a sunny fan, I think. Many people, especially critics, praised his earlier work ("Suspius" and "Deep Red"), but later, as "Slippes", which I like, are really filled. My favorite, "phenomena", is generally broadly intrinsic. "Opera" sometimes falls somewhere. Some consider this as one of his latest great movies, others see it as part of its so-called fall. I like it <br /> <br /> The picture is crisp, the music is great (in contrast to other critics, I love the metallic soundtrack), I can feel anyone for female leadership (from Jennifer Conley's "Not Different from Phenomena"). ... wonderful, great cinematography, and some amazing assassination scenes. The idea of ​​taping a person's eye needle so that they can not embrace ... bright ... my assistant Tina Thinking about the law, but doing so, the idea is more than paying the money. And some great effects, like a knife blade coming in the face of people? James Harper calls this film "stunning" and "innovative cinematography, well-made shots and exceptionally violent Attention to the murder. "I fully agree with this - a shot follows the camera through a rolling tunnel, and the story crows have used a very interesting visual. Mike Mayo Similarly, it is "striking visual eye-candy" and "nasty editing and camera work flow," praised. It is not really surprising that it arjentonara more appreciated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The girl in Asia and Julian Sands Even more interesting, in the same year, Michelle Sovi was offered the release of "Stagefoot" ("Opera"), killing a murderer in a theater by killing people involved in a presenter. With both great films, more towards Sovi's slashher. (Swav actually acted as the second unit director in "Opera" ... you can make your own decision. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> My only complaint about this image is length and pensing, although it is shot very nicely and killing scenes are magnificent but they should not be done as soon as possible. The first one takes half an hour, and then we get down in time between them Chief actor Wife steady will be terror, but everything was quiet again when the time was given to him. Not cool, Dario. We need to keep in suspense, low and high intensity.
