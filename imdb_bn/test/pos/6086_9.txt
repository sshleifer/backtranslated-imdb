It's a wonderful, powerful and ongoing experience to see "English patients" after the death of Anthony Mingela. Most of his body work is dedicated to an isolated point. Those steady moral struggles, consciously, walking very thin lines. "The Talented Mr. Ripley" Mingilla Patricia Hesse Myth's Immortal Remover from Tom Replay moved away to give a conscience to the conscience. "Breaking and Entering" requires the acceptance of the character of Mingilla Jude Law and the prizes are going on suddenly. Here, in the "English Patient", the characters of love are not far from the feeling of their offense. Ralph Fines and Christian Scott Thomas are fantastic. They are respecting our character from our competitors, with viewers. Juliet broached, quite simply, with his spectacular and wonderful New Andrews, his scenes "Mingillian" were full of sensual embarrassment. Anthony Mingilla gave us a film that is a great mix of art or business in some form or another. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without our own button. There's something clean, honest and pretty about Minghella's tears. I miss him already but I am grateful for reflection on his soul leaving behind.
