For all of us Dennukh fans of America, this little jewel is somewhat difficult. Thankfully, I covered myself with little bit of what I saw that youtube.com has previewed that I'm going to go for any length. I found it at ebay.com, it ordered direct from France and changed my laptop so that it will play Region 2 DVD. I tell you that it was well worth it. Be careful - there is no subtitle (unintentionally, the path should not be released on DVD, coach should be - they're good for subtitles). I do not say a word in french. I can anticipate a word here and there, order a drink and do not. That said, this film was a treat though. I could not fully appreciate the "stupid" humor or malicious dialogue. Danov and his classmates were enough for me. I understand what is happening without needing dialogue. It really says something about a movie when those languages ​​do not speak they enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is wonderful. Adorable as London sunny mother-in-law. Love gay mother And, of course, I can probably tell about our favorite Madamezle Denweg. She is one of a kind. Those eyes, that smile. I could see her films all day. She really goes beyond beauty People always say he's gorgeous. Well, yes, he's But he is very talented. I believe in him every second way. His conversation about chocolate and vanilla with London is very sweet. His character is even guilty of smoking about 15 years old in the street. Can not be missed! Fly to France and you buy this. Great. 10
