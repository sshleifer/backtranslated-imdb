Excellent performance. There are still good actors around! Also great instructions and photography. Very true to Shakespeare, and 'definitely' for all Shakespeare supporters. Macbeth (Jason Connery) left me with his final psychology (out of a brief candle), he gave moles of moral damage and made people face darkness, which makes it more interesting. Helen Becksendale, a very believable lady, Macbeth, who can be very happy sometimes and sometimes she looks just like a naughty girl, but the taste of blood and wickedness is deadly. If you love death and corrosion, and Shakespeare's song ... this one.
