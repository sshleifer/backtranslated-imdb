If there is a good suspenseful film, this is one of them. James Stewart USA Ben McKenna has a striking performance, who is in Africa with his wife and son. They leaned towards the scene of the murder, and the son of Dr. McKenna was abducted a few hours later. <br /> <br /> You can say, "bund your seat belts", Dr. McKenna tries to find out more about the attempt of a massacre. To stop it. However, others know that they can be dangerous, (dangerous to them), and try to settle it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the boy is alive, alive and well. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies, you will see it. <br /> <br /> My Score: 8/10
