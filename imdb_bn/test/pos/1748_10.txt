Generally I'm a simple "funny-crowley-hetine" girl, but after watching this movie (of course on YouTube), I have different perspectives. And I did not even know that my favorite animation studio - another film of Fleischer has been created, which is threatened by people in the city's garden house (light cigar and cigarette boots, footprints etc) about pest groups, and a fortunate young man named Hoppi saved the bees and honey Conquer mind; I love the lovely smile honey. You know, after watching the film, the bug reminds me of "Jitter-Bug" from Don Boulth's Thamelina. And I love the songs of this movie "We're Castle in the Castle"; When I used to sing the song almost cried around me. <br /> <br /> This excellent image coming out of this flashy studio is the second (and final) feature. Originally released in November 1941, the film will be released, but Flesiar's competitor Disney released this week before Dumbo Week, Paramount changed the date of the same date, but Mr. Bug unfortunately went into an inside, then unrealistic, trap terrible time. Because of the misfortune of opening two days after Pearl Harbor attack, Mr. Bug was a financial disaster, and he expelled Max and Dave Fischer from the studio established in 1912 and reorganized as the company's famous studio. Another big reason for their departure was that Max and Dave Fleshar did not talk to each other due to the debate (how tragic it was). Overall, I love both films of Flyers Bros. - Goliver and Mr. Bug.
