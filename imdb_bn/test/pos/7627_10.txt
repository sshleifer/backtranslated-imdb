The Last Dinosaur is a movie that is meant to be fun and exciting. It's both doing success. <br /> <br /> Maston is a big game hunter who hunts big game (go figure). Frankie is a photographer, a Japanese scientist, a person working for his company named Chuck and a photographer named African, who plans to conduct an operation with a group owned by a company. He is the name of many Safari, Boon Tao. The point is believed to be Tirenosaurus Rex, a dinosaur that killed the last operation of the region. They will reach this prehistoric area, which is carrying a drilling car that travels under water in the name of water bore. After reaching the area, they soon found Tiñosaurus, who tried to fire a gun, but his guns jumped. Chuck immediately realized that Mastan wanted to find Dinosaur in addition to linking his "Stuffed Jets" collection. When they were away, Tyrannosaurus attacked their camp and took away Polar Borer from their camp. After returning to the group, they realize that they can expect much of the area and Mastan says that he will kill the Trenosaurus. <br /> <br /> This is a great science fiction movie. Drilling in a prehistoric area seems to be something that can really happen. The scene is beautiful and it seems like a place where dinosaurs can still have. <br /> <br /> I also liked the character of this movie. Maston is usually the big time hunter who wants to get something that could kill a trophy. Also were big, Forest Ta, previously played by NBA's Luther Rackley, who really looks and works like an African tracker. Jackie is a common woman who creates problems for the group and thinks she is not in the desert. Former employee of Choke Mastane, who is wild with him when he has his attitude about changing his boss. <br /> <br /> Teenosaurus is one of the best films in this movie. Like Godzilla, it's standing on the very right side and it drags its tail, so it's a guy in a case. But the case looks good, especially the head and tail, and the tearansauras look good and very scary. Dinosaurs show cases even worse where I saw lots of other movies. In this movie, Tyransaurus sometimes roams like Godzilla, and at other times, "King Kong Espèse" and "King Kong v Godzilla" roar like King Kong. So a great Tyrannosaurus <br /> <br /> There are lots of actions in the Lin dinosaurs. Special note is a great battle between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. There is also a great scene where knit Tireonsaurus tries to spear. There are other great parts that I do not give away. You have to look for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this picture to everyone. See it and you will not be disappointed.
