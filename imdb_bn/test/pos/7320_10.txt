This third group of three stuuges have been made short, and like many of them at the very beginning, it is absolutely complete and completely violent! It is now owned by the DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Volumes. 1, whenever I like it, I see it! <br /> <br /> In this short film, mom, Larry, and Curley play three doctors who are trying to help everyone, but boy, they create annoyance with everything! <br /> <br /> This short one is one of the three favorite stogos shorts, I am a huge fan of the Celtic comedy, and the King of Three Stogues is the Slapstick! <br /> <br /> When I heard that it was nominated for the Best Short Film Academy Award, I was really curious about it, when I heard that it was lost, I was very disappointed! <br /> <br /> The most fun of these little three stoges, I highly recommend that you see these violent riots! <br /> <br /> 10/10
