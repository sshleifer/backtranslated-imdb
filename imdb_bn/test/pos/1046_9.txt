I accidentally discovered this movie and it was really a wonderful surprise. A Christmas classic, it's one of the fine sunny forty's. The storyline is simple: Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwick) earns her livelihood by writing cooking columns for the magazine. During Christmas, his boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), invited him to a young weak sailor in Connecticut farm. The only problem is that he has no farm and he can not cook. Elizabeth jumped out of a rich friend (Reginald Gardiner, whose ranch is there) and agreed to fly with her wonderful dog Uncle Felix to Connecticut. <br /> <br /> Peter Godfrey gave a fine direction and Cast is really amazing: Stanwick is never as good as this wonderful and romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardener and Sasker make ridiculous and human-supporting characters. Only leading people in weak points, Dennis Morgan She starts well but as the movie continues, it really becomes a bore. Despite the ending with Gary Cooper or David Niven for Elisabeth Lane, one feels very sorry for both, both of which were more appropriate for this part. However, this is a delightful Christmas time movie and colorful and sweet holidays with a refreshing score ... This advice is for those who like to spend in Connecticut.
