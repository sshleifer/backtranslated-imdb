Zeke Rippy (Mike) is great, you fully believe in his character. And it's scary as hell, I covered my eyes half the movie, the other half of my seat. It is not all calm and bloody to see this vague and horrible thing - but it gave me a bad dream. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie - it's your first chance.
