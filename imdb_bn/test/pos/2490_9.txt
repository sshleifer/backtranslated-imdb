It has been revealed that this movie was banned or banned in the United States. Since there is no information about IMDB, I have to rely on my other sources and believe in it. If this is true, then the film is more traumatic and scary and it is anyway. <br /> <br /> This film is so-called mockumentary, although I think the issue seems to be very serious. It creates a scene where America is like a military state and all the revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without evidence. After a compulsory tribunal they will have to decide whether to go to prison for some years or choose to park. Meanwhile, they will have to walk through the desert for three days to reach the American flag, post 50 miles away, when the police and the army will follow. <br /> <br /> This movie tells yourself a documentary about this incident and both victims of the Tribunal and the victims through the desert, illustrated by the European film crew. All the information is explained, interview questions and ask everything in the film. The people started crying crying directly. It seems very, very real. The realistic talk here is meaningless. This movie is not about how to create a realistic movie, whether it is true or not, how it looks like a movie. And it would certainly look like this. It will be filmed anyway. In such an 'ostrich' country, there will definitely be no European film crew that allows them to film. <br /> <br /> A lot of things frighten us. People from all social classes protesting. Political leaders, musicians, writers, philosophers, unemployed, etc. They are frustrated, rebellious, or scared. They are no heroes. They spoke a lot in the tribunal, knew that it did not lead in any direction, even then they said before all speeches, books and songs. One says he is not afraid to die. Is this true? Well, he does not need to run through the victim by the police. The protesters have no chance, or at least, their only chance, the decision between the prison and the punishment park, there really is no chance. Ultimately they decided and on the way to the end of the film, such heroism committed suicide. <br /> <br /> These tribunals remind us of many tribunals in the third verdict. Officials use the same idealistic lecture, ignoring all arguments from the protesters and screaming them, and then telling them that they should be calm. They warn the protesters "watching their language" and insult them more. They ask their questions, the defendants can not answer, but they never want to do it. A statement of what we call justice to these scenes <br /> <br /> The scene in the desert is at a different level. When we first see the prisoners, we realize that they realize that they have no chance. Seeing the desert and the mountains, feeling the sun and thirst, they have no source of how these free days should stand. The movie crew follows them and talks with them while fleeing this madness. They argue, should they play the game, or shirk, or rebel? It all leads to the same and nobody is surprised. Some people will ask, what kind of park will actually be in this state? Why not It empties the jails and punishes the government for revolutionaries. This is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed the Jews before the surveillance camp was built. The comparison is fair, because it is no different. <br /> <br /> The movie is scary and depressing. Problems that are talking about negligence known words. This is not science-fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not the pronunciation. This film shows us that government and democracy are presented to us, it is not just useless, dangerous. It shows us that revolution is not a solution. Protesters seem to be confused because they do not really know about this fight. They are things, but for nothing. Even it does not provide any solution to us, it's still a statement <br /> <br /> To me, the ban on this movie is the most horrific thing. Here we have a film that is responsible for the loss of freedom, moral and peace. It blames the government, though it is a revolutionary task, dangerous and inhuman. And such a film is banned. Think about it when you see the American flag next time.
