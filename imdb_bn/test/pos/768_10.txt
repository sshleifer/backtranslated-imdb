Lovely I just love cinema. I want to watch this movie because Rupert Grint is an outstanding actor. Her expressions are great, spectacular. The movie was excellent. Julie Walters It was perfect I think Rupert is the only boy in red hair that I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. And a wonderful accent. I think the movie was superb and saw Roopart another thing but with Harry Potter. And it's a very good actor, so it deserves more that. He just has a golden globe but perhaps it deserves an Oscar Academy Award. There are some actors who do not work very well but have an Oscar. It's not a concern. But she is perfect, bright and beautiful
