This image is about many things. The most obvious is that the film can be on the audience and what kind of magic can be captured in film life. China and Western countries have intense relations, such as many Chinese (probably, in the right way) tried to take their lives as "barbarous" and try to pollute them. Liu also tried to protect their living in movies because he saw that it will disappear one day. Liu's internal conflicts among China's loyalty and traditions against China's loyalty and western self-determination philosophy are also there. All these themes are woven quite skillfully in a coherent and enjoyable whole by Hu. A very enjoyable film.
