Good movies, extraordinary stories, great characters, I enjoyed it, when it comes out enough to buy DVDs. <br /> <br /> The real life story that tells you to be more interesting and stimulating than anything that could be with fiction. My friend who says in the media business does not show such an intermediate behavior, it gives the business a bad name. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> D. D. There are some problems with: First, the volume of the volume is very low, so you have to run the TV volume to see it. I run it to copy it's original production to HBO when it's like that of it. Second, for the first five minutes, the left side of the video is cut, the image is cut to one inch short on the left. After five minutes it fills the screen properly, from right to left. Such kind of sloppy technical production is very amateur and I do not know why the producers and producers let sloppiness slide this kind of. <br /> <br /> Still, with technical flaws, it's an enjoyable story, I think HBO is the best one.
