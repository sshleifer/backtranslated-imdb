I saw this movie at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian movie I have seen in Tamil and it has shared some similarities with other Indian movies (wonderful music and danceography, clean stripes), the director tried more than just entertainment. The film tells Amooda, a story about a New Year's unfounded story, that her parents told her that she was accepted, that she started an audi that led her to take Sri Lanka to war in India. Unusual visuals merge with the horrific scenes of violence to create a point, though it is a simplified one. Amhuda played Kaththana PSS, and she saw one of the few actors who could be steady and still boring. Her charm and beauty held together the film.
