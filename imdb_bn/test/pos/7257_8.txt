I like historical (period) films and get a new idea for dress for my historic group, and a friend recommends this to me. I love Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I think it's valuable, and I was definitely rewarded !! As a member of the English nobility, his screenplay is seen in the past, much more accurate than that. The comedy's view has hit my side, the costume was not terrible, and historically, I was not very worried. I also noticed that there was not a proper soybean system for many years after England, but nobody would keep an eye on the fact that England did not go deep into the mint. The price is definitely worth seeing. I highly recommend this movie.
