I grabbed it at the local Mexican TV at 2:00 and I decided to give it a chance because it relates to all cases of real life related to the murder of a common American family (a father, mother, and a little boy). ). <br /> <br /> The beginning indicates that due to strong differences with his father, the hints indicate Walker to be a murderer. Soon, when Walker and Luke were taken to the Sheriff's house. Examining with a false detection machine, things are going to be very different ... <br /> <br /> When Walker and Luke appear for meeting with their father's lawyer, they know that Luke will get $ 200,000 and Walker Heresy is out. Louis immediately made a convertible purchase. However, it is a great mystery movie that relates to betrayal, ambition, feelings, and cold, very cold blood. <br /> <br /> I know the real name has been changed but still the experience is the same. Try this movie one. I know that "based on actual murder" or based on such incidents, but it's really worth it. Pure quality on acting, direction, and plot.
