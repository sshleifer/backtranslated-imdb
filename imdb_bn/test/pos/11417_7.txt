I like this movie. I'm not a big movie buff, so I could not comment on the parallels between this and other films of this genre, but I thought this movie was quite funny. The story line, though a little clear, was not bad at all, some real scary / moment moments and acting (lead female role vocals) <br /> <br /> Overall I'm a little surprised to have achieved this rating in the low rating. I watch a lot of movies (working on a video store helps) and it's not really bad that people think I have some criticism though. The final call from the police was terrible, almost restrained, the body of the bathroom seemed to sleep a little (probably told from the talkie that he had said) and saw the children's reaction to what was happening between me. I hope they have died last <br /> <br /> I hope this helps some people
