You can not take this movie seriously ... The plot is expected and quartile, often at the top, the dialog is ridiculous; But it all adds great fun! At the end of 1950, three "working girls" find out the big cities and their mothers, perhaps warning of sedition and temptations: married men, alcohol, marriage, abortion, etc. <br /> <br /> Amanda Farrel (Joan Crowford) who is a professional success, but whose personal life is dedicated to the office in the name of his door. <br /> <br /> This film can be credible 50 years ago, but now it's just great cam fun! Rent / buy it and enjoy it.
