Story-based, it's not the best or most cleverly written Colombo film, but the film has been made very well, excellent directions and a really fine performance. <br /> <br /> In particular, the performance of this movie attracts attention. Director Nicholas Kolasanto has done a great job with the actors in the film. Apparently, he gave plenty of space to play with Peter Folk and John Casavets because both of them are being submitted here as an undisclosed director of the film. The actors will be part of its indicator style to permit this many rooms. It works extremely well for this movie. Probably he did it himself because Kolasanta himself used to act as an actor. He was probably best known to play the role of "Cheers" in the Hit series until his death in 1985 until his death in 1985 in 1985. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His role as Coolombo. Also senior actors John Cavets has done a great job as a murderer in the movie and this is a good match for Lieutenant. Alongside them, the film also has Mirna Lloye. A big star of the silent film era and Pat Murita also has a small role. <br /> <br /> But the direction of the film is not really good. Apparently and technically it made a really great film, with slow long shots, without any use to cut. Perhaps this film is probably more than most of the Colombo movies. It really takes time to set things up and tell his story. The film also has some of the features of excellent artistic and experimental shots. Of course, for all 70's <br /> <br /> But as I said earlier, story-based is not just one of the best Colombo films. Also the formula excluded for Lieutenant is a bit too obvious at this time. It considers the murderer to be somewhat stupid, as if he did not think enough about his plan, although the character is probably an intelligent person. Colombo has tried to do more than just try to solve the suspects and other characters in order to solve the crime at this time. It may be different from Peter Falc's other acting role in other Karlubo films. But in this case does not mean anything worse. <br /> <br /> This film also highlights the best musical score by Richard de Benedictis, who became a composer for Colombo films. <br /> <br /> <br /> To see a big penmoon movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10
