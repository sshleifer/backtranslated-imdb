Focusing on a very good picture, a very important issue. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is completely preventable. If more families see this picture, perhaps more children will not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs one of her best roles ever. This is an extraordinary movie that deals with the very important needs of a particular family. It's not against the thousands of families in the United States today. There are children struggling with this worldwide. The really important point here may be to prevent it all. More people should see this movie and take it seriously to say it. It is well done, with important messages managed in a disciplined manner.
