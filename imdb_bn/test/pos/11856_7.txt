Sophisticated sexual comedies are always difficult to pull. Check out Blake Edwards's films, who are reasonably mastered of the genre, and you miss a lot as you hit. If a movie of this nature fails to work, it will not return to the traditional and real toilet comedies of a teen sex comedy [i.e. "American Pie"], or the warmth of the audience with a romantic comedy feeling [eg. Julia Roberts' full career]. It can only push the end and hope that the audience can appreciate almost ridiculing its resolution. <br /> <br /> The husband / wife's team Wali Uldarsksky and Maya Forbes wrote, "The other people are watching" the car ended in just a few seconds after opening with the couple, Ad and Alice [J. Mahr and Julian Nicholson] in the United States. When frames are frozen, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From here, we welcome that the story of publication will enjoy views from both sexes. <br /> <br /> Two months of their oath is ashamed, Ed and Alice are already an old married couple. In the early bathroom view, their actions show us how comfortable they are to each other and how long they stay together. So, when the line of advancing the plot is pronounced - perhaps at least two possible possibilities - it is such that the relationship itself is calling for its own change, even if it means its own destruction. <br /> <br /> [Ed can not sleep with his mother, after all the ground rules have been set], in order to strengthen their relationship, two heads stop separating from their heads in hopes of finding some meaningless sex . First of all, everything seems to be a planned plan that their daily tests only help to stimulate emotions in them. But predictably, sadness and jealousy begin to show deep concern, soon they find themselves separated and broken at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And director Wolodarsky is not disappointed. Here he played my two favorite actress sister - Julian Nicholson and Lauren Graham - and could play them in their strength. For Nicholson, who always reminded me of a young Sheryl McLean, when he thinks less than his work, he also brings Elise's weaknesses and weaknesses. And for Graham, an actress who proved that she could have played a complete Howard Hawks, she stole every scene with a nice "A BS" personality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " British accolades are appreciated for acceptance and it should be appreciated for all hanging. But the actual behavior here is Andy Ritter and her sub-plot single mother, Helen Slater. Although his view seems to be involved in almost all other movies, till then he is the most fun and stealing his dead pand delivery show. <br /> <br /> To make an independent production, there is something more absenteeic from such a big Hollywood film - more personal and intimate feelings "shown to other people". Not to mention that this movie has some funny moments - in general, most of the Hollywood comedy. <br /> <br /> Ratings [5 star systems]: 3 1/2 stars
