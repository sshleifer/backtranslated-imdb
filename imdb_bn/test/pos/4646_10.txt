This movie is the first eighty as well as typing fun !! When I was young, I remember seeing this movie in HB, and this is my favorite movie. As it was a while ago, I knew I had never met it. Then, during my roommate said that he also saw it and it was his favorite, they started printing it again !! Thankfully, I now have a copy !! If anyone ever wants to see the greatest (Chasse) SkanCancer Hunt, then it's probably astonishing ideas for Fratus, this movie !!! (Watch - Chess has serious love for the type 80 movie!)
