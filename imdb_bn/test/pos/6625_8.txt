Oh, it sure works, a nice piece. In fact, most of the film's best scenes or at least in Bergman's movies can be found in this movie. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow as you would expect better. Does not these two give bad performance? Savan Nickvist has provided some skills, although unusually efficient, painters. The script is quite good, especially the different scenes. Sometimes the film lags, and speeds disrespect though probably deliberately. <br /> <br /> What is the problem? Well, the film is good for itself. The other Bergman movies are silent in the same way, but this is not near to the rarest. Finally, I just gave up and started to become a bit annoyed. I was often heavily influenced by the time of film, but in the end, I feel disgusted. This is a great movie, but I doubt that I will see it again, or recommend to my friends. Or, if I recommend it, I'll be sure to warn them of what I'm going to move forward. 8/10.
