"Walking with dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant. Kenneth Branagh really narrates in a way that makes you want to listen. The documentary script really sounds that researchers and writers have done their homework, but it is so insightful and it hooks you up and never lets go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it will be. But visual effects and scenery makes this documentary work so well. Visually exciting, and dinosaurs look so real, simply thanks to the wonderful effect. It is so informative with such a good idea and not only attracts children to adults. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it must be monitored. I just do not love this, but it's probably probably the best documentary I've seen. If anything, it may be done with the long, other that this is perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
