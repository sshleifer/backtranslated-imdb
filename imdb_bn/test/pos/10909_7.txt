I have remembered it a long time ago, and I knew most of the ideas, but there is no detail, so I'm happy, I have seen again from director Frank Oz (The Muppets Tech Manhattan, Boffinger). Originally the new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) won his latest Academy Award, where he played a gay soldier and he "normalized" normal, even referring to his previous school English teacher Howard Bracket (Golden Globe nominated). Kevin Collin), and he expelled him as gay! Howard is determined to remove his name, and like a reporter, the media came out from the spotlight, especially on the way to marrying Emily Montgomery (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Joan Cusack). So the wedding day comes, and Howard comes when he or she does not say yes, he threw himself out and confessed to himself and everyone that he was gay. Of course, he is being fired as a teacher, but everyone supports himself (on support) on graduation day, and Cameron even looks for everything to clean, so that everyone, especially the head of school Tom Holwell (Elf's Bob Nehart) knows it's OK to be gay. Peter Silva has played Tom Seleck like Melo, Debbie Reynolds, Frank Brackley Wilford Bramail, Gregory Zabara Walter Bracket, Glenn Off, Hypie Goldberg and Jay Leno, as Barnes Braket. The film's highlights are that Klein can not help Diana Ross to dance to the "I Will Survive" version, it should have been sure of her sexuality. Klein is always good, nominated for Kusak Oscar Oscar, and all supportive cast members bite them in very funny comedy. very good!
