The plot of this movie is stupid as the hair bag. Jimmy Smith plays a character who may be annoyed by the comic of the story. She is evil and a wife beater. It is possible to get as much as possible from its nypd and LA law roles. <br /> <br /> If you think his face and acting can really play the role of a bad boy, then he is present in your presence <br /> <br /> But <br !!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniscuits and little black minidresses throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> She always has the greatest legs in the history of the movie. This film has made this leg cheaper for the legacy. <br /> <br /> I bought DVDs for this reason if I found it available.
