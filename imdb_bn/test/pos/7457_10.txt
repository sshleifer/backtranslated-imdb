DoCaman was a show that lasted ten hours or more before the last hour or more before sleeping. It was different from the many kinds of animation that I saw; I was still a minor junkie for Disney and Lonnie Tunes stuff, and on Saturday morning, cartoons were still on the run-off of the peak from Nya Cartoon and Batman's Day. But at this time, I began to admit that more rugged, mature, spiritual, obscene and (though I do not know that word) satire cartoon shows were more creative than my used stuff. During the time of Beviss and Butt-Head, Rain and Stevey and even Maxx were shooting TVs with MTV, America showed two shows - one of them was a wonderful science and the other was Doccan. I've always remembered several key bits from the show, and some lines are quoted too much for those who do not completely forget it. Fortunately, I recently found a tape with six episodes that I taped long ago, and the jokes were very fresh. And jokes are a lot of fire fast in the good episode. <br /> <br /> The genre of talent choices in the voice category is an excerpt, music, intelligence mystery, and functional family unit for the peculiar parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and TV shows, which are the top notch for story-lines. Jason is an excellent choice for Alexander Dokman, and his performance is a comedy from his day of the daydayday (even here and there may be some similar features). Also, Greg Berger's unconsciously monitoned and Deadpenny Cornfade, Davisel Gappa, is supernaturally odd as Ajax, and Nansy Trives, as a related, unexpected sister-in-law burns, all contribute fully. Along with some great writings - when a joke is not sure-fire, its intelligence compensates - animation style, although it's rebuilt, crying far away from computer-enhanced products, it is inventive and often abstract. It's home-made, great quality, which is both Bevis and Butte-Head or South Park. And, like those shows, if you are a little child, I see that I was younger than looking younger, you do not understand most of the jokes (i.e. there are enough streamers and vide references to meet two shows). But it's an invention to detect lately on TV late night and it works better at that time slot. Only a DVD box can expect for the set. So, anyone who has rarely or even heard about this program, here's a simple note: think of this show that Dassle Hammett waltzed to meet Disney and decided to move to Vegas. Cooperate with free mini-bars and Lewis Bunuel and The Simpson's veins. Not to mention, it has been grouped by Rugrats (Strong) a
