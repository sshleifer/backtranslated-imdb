This firmly-decorated example of old fashioned Hollywood entertainment is an outstanding title, this film proves to be a successful success of several different elements: a one-time piece, romantic drama, a criminal film and a political thriller. Interesting, though Fox, made by his hero ?? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck ?? Both were usually associated with other studios; Their screen chemistry is obvious here and ultimately led to the marriage during several years. At a very young age, Taylor's frustrating hero (Personally appointed a Marine by President McKinnley to find out criminals behind the organized cleanliness of many banks); Not surprisingly, he quickly monitors (under the leadership of Traffic Brian Donley and the cold Victor McLaughlin) that he reads for a chancell (naturally, Stanwick) who has left him a lot with the gang? However, the truth will be told, the actress is far away from the actress! Similarly, in addition to proving his worth to make his fold, he must marry McLaggellen for Stanwick's perspective; However, the former ex-Joker personality reminds me of Charlie Chase's son, who was eventually led by William A. Sheter, of Desert (1933) son. Later, Taylor stays in the minds of Stanwick, and is trying to resign to the President when the girl escapes with her? But the jealous opponent interrupted his plan. Robbery was very scared, we died on the dock and the other two were kept in jail; Taylor hopes for McKinley's intervention? In the meanwhile, have we learned the identity of 'the inner people' of error and clearly ?? When the President himself is killed in the murder, it seems to be a dash (a great plot wrapping, though the 11th hour mystery is felt)! To get back to style film flutter, though the breakdown sequence of the voodware is a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows down a bit and creates a nice production in the thriller's perspective, does it really make a beautiful production? Douglas Fowl, Sig Rumen, and two US presidents, Sydney Blakemar (Bubble Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley) are already present in John Carradine (who just disappears after a scene!).
