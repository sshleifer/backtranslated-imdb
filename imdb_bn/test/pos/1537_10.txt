Alan Rickman's voice represents the Almighty, Shocking, Fascist ruler, this film gave me a repetitive nightmare. The most horrific film I've ever seen - mental terrorism is even stronger than any "horror" movie. Allan Rickman's voice will always represent the power and terror of the universal state, which is commemorative of 1984's Orwell. This film does not care about the reality of a large section of current world governments. This movie is annoying, but in such a way that everyone will see it - this is a fact that can not get the experience of a person, but many can do it.
