When it was announced that "pop of pop" died in the age of 50 a month before the start of a series of live reebok sequences in London and 2 Arena, it was a big shock for millions of people all over the world. She was, and will always be one of the most gifted voices and dancers in the music industry, and she will be terribly missed. I decided to remind myself of how excited I was by seeing Jackson Jackson's best video (and perhaps song) from director John Landes (an American Werewle in London), but seeing how amazing I was to be the greatest music video of all time. After the film opened with the break in the car with Michael and his Girl (Ola Ray) and after giving a ring to her, the moon came out and she turned into a Veruble. We then saw Michael and his daughter in this horror film in the movie, they were afraid and walking, and Michael soon followed him, singing icon songs. Soon Vincent Price comes in the voice and Zumbira takes the earth out of the cemetery and starts open coffins and Michael and Girl are definitely surrounded. He turned away, and Michael himself became a zombie, and he danced with all the other creatures, before going back to his usual voice for the quorum. The girl interrupts the door in the vague room, but Jamie Michael is still able to break, and when she touches him, she tells the normal Michael, "What's the problem?" Take the photo with him and take him to his house, and see our eyes being mischievous. Michael Jackson was number 14 on 100 Best Pop Culture Icon and number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star, the thriller album was number 4 in 100 seratom albums, and this video was 71 on the 100th greatest horror moment and it was number 1 on 100 best pop videos. very good!
