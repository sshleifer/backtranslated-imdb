Gene Roddenberry is not down to her fans. The end of his death will be the legacy of Sci-Fi. Earth: The final clash was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and produced nicely, but Rashtbari's touch was lost somewhere. Leadership defeat, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely strikes the series because it's an important part of how it worked. The story has been visited by mankind, by TLons, an additional paralyzed nation called themselves 'The Company'. After 3 years, they gave the world the new technology, helpful information around the world and more. Many people ask their intention in the world. Diane (Leni Parker) is the world's main connector in the middle of the races and is among the most reliable tileons in many of the races. The question arises: why are they here? What is their aim, is aware of the Daan about any suspect plot against humans? There is an underground group led by Millionaire industrialist Jonathan Dors (David Hemelen) who uses millions to investigate TLons. The first season is going well at the end, it seems to be trustworthy, Boone assisted the door during his investigation with Dowan and Tyslas. In the middle of the second season, started in the middle of a lot and once the spectacular and captivating series spirals were down, because in most cases Rodneybeare died and was not close to the producers' help, in which his wife was a co-producer with Majel-Barrett-Rodenberger. Yet, the first season is playful and fun to watch.
