I have seen all the doctors who played during my growing up to the local PBS station. (Get to know doctor through John Pertwey) Also copy "copy of American doctors sent to America" ​​copies. I had a great time / show, but did not take it seriously - I could be like a traveler I can say seriously. I went to Cannes, bitten the costume (doctor # 5,6, and the tenon was my costume letter), it's Then everyone suddenly came to stop. The program turned out that politics and drifted into a 25 year old ancient tradition who lacked interest and financing. When I heard that the sci-fi channel was picking up new doctors, My first thought was "cool, now my 11-year-old boy can see how I've been left-handed for these years, and I know what a Tiredness Hack is" (I was around my house. There are different phone boxes and teardies in different sizes) Do not expect good quality of story, character development and f / x. I had to say at least - happy. For the first time, I found a doctor who was a potter, a coat, a foam, Trip-head, a pussy, or a weighing. By now Christopher Eccleston date is most credible, now, Tom baker fans cool! Do not make me wrong, I like almost every doctor and his joke, but Christopher gave the doctor something he had never done before - the real word credibility. I'm just sad that he decided against another season. I will try David Tenant as I will be another doctor, but now the time has increased ... <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf Rule !!!!! <br /> <br /> 2008 update - I love David Tennant! His "mode" personality is something that can remember my generation, deal with my son's generation, and fashion geseppo can relax! He is a little more than a Christopher, but not as other former physicians as humas. I feel the rose, I dig Martha, and they were thinking about the pandemic they gave? !! It's still the best ride on TV
