This movie is a certified member of my film library. Although not a mainstream film, in my view, a very effective movie is silent, which includes Eric Roberts as an actor. (I will qualify him as a better actor than his sister Julia, who is ascending, but it is another review ...) Roberts plays down-on-his-luck former reporter with the perfect combination of descriptive accuracy and Z. Idealism: Two The element which is no effective part of the film, and the parcel. Roberts's first person description enhances the quality of the film and guides the real motive behind the crime. <br /> <br /> Set in Palm Springs, everything about film setting progresses gradually metaphor of the themes of persecution: Roberts is tortured by his past; Police are tortured by wealthy residents of Palm Springs who treat them as slaves; Rich, already, is oppressed by annoyance (see Johnny Depp's classic performance insightful rich child who only likes to choose ...); The separation of each character is more universal and has increased further by the heat and isolation of the desert. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for more contemporary versions of this silent version of this photo, there is an audience for this movie. There are elements in the film which may be more difficult but I get a copy of this movie and recommend it to be kept in the Big Slip and Chinatown in your movie library. (This image is based on Arthur Lyons' book, Castel Burning and if you like Roberts's role, you can get a copy of the ambulance, where he showed his funny, light direction.) Best line film: "Carefully warn me? The fool trailer park ignores the strange warning of women. "
