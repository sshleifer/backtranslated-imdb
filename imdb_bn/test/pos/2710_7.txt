Made a better one for TV biopics, I just wish it has been told to us more. I've read so many biographies and saw other things about the certificate, and this movie did what it could do based on the barriers to the families he had made. Cynthia Gibin did an excellent job to bring Karen back to life. One of my disappointments is that there was more insight into Karen's immunity. In the study, I have done anorexia control disease (especially for Cherie Buwen O'Neill's excellent book, outlook for perspective). Karen sees one's weight in her life, which she can control. He felt that he was being controlled in every other aspect of his life. Do not misunderstand me, I believe he really liked the song, but he thought he had little control over his career. He really loved his family, but they did not disclose it, and he did not know how to explain his family. The film could touch that much more. I think my music is valuable to the carpenters and he was alive to make more contribution to the music even today.
