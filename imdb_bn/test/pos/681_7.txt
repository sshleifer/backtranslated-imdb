Intriguing suspicion with home appliances (lupino, always amazing) is threatened by a psychiatric immigrant Hauskilanar (Ryan). The two masters of this genre, in their title, love the best they meet with a wicked hostage situation outside the posts of WIT, emotions and deliberately Saturday evenings. Slowly hued B & W photography with an unusual amount of close-up head shots. The young girl who teasing Ryan is really guided here. Impossible, but satisfied subgeno melodrama.
