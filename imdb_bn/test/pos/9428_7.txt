Sherlock Holmes was present for the publicity during World War II. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon," starring Top Holles, Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atuil, Dennis Howe and Karen Verne. Germany is a German scientist. Hollus is responsible for the appointment of Franz Tobel (William Post Junior) and the operation of the German government for surgery. After people reached England, her pain began only Holmes can decode the message W Tobey left before the collapse of the loss of Moriarity, saving arms and perhaps the scientist? This is an effective hometown story, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and the black color of England. The series is just fine working on the present day. It was not without its problems, but the problem with time was not that problem. Whose idea was to fool Watson? Nigel Bruce's Characterization - Support and deceit by scripts - Always false notes. I like the characteristic choices of Edward Hardwick in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Homes series - where he is attractive, intelligent and trusted partner for Homes. In the Rothbone series, Holes is often annoying and Watson is stupid, stupid fool. However, in this particular movie, Watson has the opportunity to be quite helpful in several parts. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge the full snake for Richard 2's Rothbon lessons - "... this fortunate plot, this is the world, this England" - I can not imagine that in 1924, to see this movie, Bright How much was the meaning Sherlock Holmes met his purpose.
