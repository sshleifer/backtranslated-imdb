I really think some of this photo is Oscar worthy! I really do not care about what people can say about this movie ... because it's Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly a part of Christina Rickshaw! I'm her big fan, just as I saw her in the Adams family ... she's trying to see all the things she's making, and it's one of her best parts. I love her face (though people say she's not beautiful ... I think she ... and I love her eyes) !! The film is about a lot of ... people say that it is religious ... people say that it is about racism ... that people say about drugs ... folks say that it's almost nymphomania ... well ... maybe that's all that little Bit !! But I really think that the high level of this film is open for blues what ... what it stands for ... and basically it comes: life ... heart ... pain ... sorrow ... and above all ... spontaneous feeling !! I hope you'll see it ... if you're a person who is not just through pictures or stories, but it's a movie ... it's a good movie to see ... if not ... Well ... See it anyway ... can not do much trouble, and you'll see so horny acting in Christina Ricci !! He is a fox !!
