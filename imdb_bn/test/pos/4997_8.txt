IMDB has some severe criticism of Kamachchar Moon. I think of these three reasons. First, the purists are disappointed that the mini series is not exactly like books. Second, it is not as good as the main lonma dive. Finally, people complain about the IMDB and the world's best movies. <br /> <br /> I want to say that it will not be as good as a movie book. That's the right way to do that. Lonesome Dovey was not as good as the novel. In addition, Lonesome Dove's film had some things switched around. Whatever it is, it will run with a movie adaptation. So looking at the moon on the moon, it's a disrespectful argument. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that it is not as good as the original dove. But hey, there's nothing. I learned from the dive of people to lead their life through lessons. If I'm going to compare each book that I read, I saw the movie, and the TV I saw lonsome doves; I'll be unhappy forever. <br /> <br /> It's made for TV Minniari based on Lonesome Dave (novel) and Dead Man's Walk Siegel and this is what you get. This is a pretty good TV that I have seen. It's a fun set up for the Lemon Dove. We know about the history of the Rangers, which we came to know and to love. Juan Gass did an extraordinary job to reconstruct McCracky. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (Spanish) also do a great job of creating help letters to meet the past of regular and newt. <br /> <br /> If I see again, I'll enjoy it, it's more than a few crumby reality shows.
