"Dead" is really a work of art. Obviously, John Huston meant that he still created it "in full emotions of some emotion", even his body failed him. After a long time this movie has influenced the influences of the mind and the links. Joe's little story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially Gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is in this movie. In the statement of an artist of love and art of life, "The Dead" stands alone.
