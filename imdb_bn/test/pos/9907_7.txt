Sometimes it's kind of a movie so bad it's kind of well. This movie was made in Germany and dubbed in English, so you have to get it before the past. Acting was also stilted and forced, except what is done by the real rats, who did an excellent job acting in the IMO part. Rat wrangler snap. However, the city has decided to cut the cost of the mayor and go to reduce local garbage collectors, leaving the trill large pilli everywhere. This storyline has been used earlier, notably that has happened in real life (very often unfortunately) and the audience is not surprised. But this is fine. What we are going to happen, and when and sometimes the audience needs a film where many brain cells are not required to follow. We are our heroes, whimsy faces and under the body, semi-heroes and of course our heroine, who is going to be a doctor, but only in training, even though he is actually going to discover it. When many people die sick and die and not just from rats bite. Of course, Wilen must die (okay, all villains, which means mice), and the last scene is one who reminds the audience that there is a signal in the works. This is a movie that you just sit and enjoy what it is and what it does.
