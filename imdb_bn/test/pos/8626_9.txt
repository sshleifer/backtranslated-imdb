I grew up with Abbott and Costello films, at A Because my father has grown up with them and our last name has been closed, so we pay some tribute, I did not understand the fax of this movie and others are also. It was really a classic reason, it was funny because Abbott and Casaleo were always the same character, but it was very funny, now what I like about Jack and the Beanstock is that the story of love is completely annoying and it's a song from the Rajkanya song, Ogg, Wonderful songs, but love stories, stories, couples must be married, because a state's money is going out because they are in prison Both because they can not go and fall in love. Being royal and they ended up being a couple, so happy ending, I do not think that it was the original version, but if it was supposed to cut them from this film then I think it was original and I like it. But it shows, lol, when the movie really kicks with the monster + trash and costello it's sooooo fun. When Jack is hit in the giant door and Jack is screaming "Open the door, open the door" that thing is really fun. And that trick once Jack Princess starts crying, Princess and all those dogs who jump on her. Kinda cheezy but really basic. I hope they at least tried to restore it, even though I shouted to Africa Jack and Seedling, and when I was on the tap, I did not think the reason for my quality was so bad that I guess. The beginning is gently funny, really interesting in the middle, and at least not funny, but I'm a 19-year-old and a 52-year-old film that makes me smile, this hard smile, this movie is really fun. I love their style. Also suction section. Jack is a climb up Benstock, and all of them sing a song about a distortionist Jack and he will die, which is quite funny
