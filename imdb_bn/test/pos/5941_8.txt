Of course, there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unreal. The lady is the first horrible woman, then a few minutes later, she starts kissing a little boy, when the old man is right next to him. But the film goes along, we learn that he is a little troubled girl (or whore) and partly explains his behavior. This movie is well done in cinematography. We can see lift from almost every angle and perspective, and some of their pictures and scenes really make excitement. Gotz George has played well in his character, a hot shot is becoming old and is excited by youngsters like Genne. Whitcock's The Torrents praised by Kurt, I give Wolfgang Keeling a great performance, although he does not say much, but he is the best actor in this game. One critic complained that the film was unreal and that nothing really would happen in any emergency. But then again, the mission is impossible or how realistic the movie as the phone booth. We are talking about a movie here and in a movie you have to deal with some scenes that can not happen in real life but you can still enjoy this movie. On this day I have seen a lot on German TV and I think that the style of the 80's has added something to this picture.
