This movie is historically one of the most accurate shooting films, which show the reality of the soldiers in the special circumstances of the war situation and Stalingrad War, which is clearly seen in comparison to working with this film as Anthony Beaver's book. "Stalinager" <br /> <br /> Better than "Enemies at Gates" where this plot drowns in a sniper / predatory story, this movie shows what a person can fight. Although portrayed by the Germans, "Stalinad" is something other than a nationalist forgiving movie. It shows that the movies of war are flagging the deadly truth of war, something beyond zygostic distortion, as Hollywood's "war" products seem to be. <br /> <br /> The techniques of scripting, acting, direction, and other "stunning" movies are among the highest qualifications. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see movie which commands an army and joins the command of a "FÃ¼hrer" order.
