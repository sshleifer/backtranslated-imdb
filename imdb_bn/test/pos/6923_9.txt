This photo should be a joy to watch and do well on DVDs and videos. I think you must be really Irish to appreciate some of the ingredients of Accent, Colquilis, and some of the letters of the dress, but I would like to assure you that when Dylan Muran 'Barrella' has been disguised, this disguise is known to most people from Dublin, There are many characters in the cities that see, work and speak! Free comedy and solo performer Michael Keynes Jeans is worth the money, but the top platform is great, the script is superb and the dialogue is fast moving and interesting. A perfect light entertainment movie without Jim Curry's Madpet Trick.
