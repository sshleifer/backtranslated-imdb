I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Film Festival and I was happy. The photography is so stylish and beautiful, and the story is not just your average mafia movie, but in reality this story is much more in the background. It is a medieval person's personal journey, which is trapped in an existence, he is forced to live. Actor, Tony Servillo, gorgeous, he excels this "cool man" The girl lives up to Olivia Magnini, Italian actress Anna Magnani's family and her family's title. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting your standard Italian movie where everyone is screaming each other family, this is not your movie. You're not mean clich√©s and it definitively worth seeing this one.
