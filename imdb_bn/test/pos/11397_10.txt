Boogie Night is one of the best films of the 90's and I can say that it should be at IMDB Top 250. I actually understand why many would dislike the subject. Based on the demands of the audience and the critics receiving the movie, I personally feel that it is making the top movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Not surprisingly, this movie is not a scene. Reach individual characters and touch you. It is not about imagining a porn movie that can be handled as sexually explicit, but they can not imagine it. The best aspect I have ever seen is that - and I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not about the story of a private individual, it is almost a lot. This is a letter study that has many levels in them and those who may find the most aliens in the industry, but who still see the same dream and both of them are bad and good. Boogie Knights draws you in the story from the very beginning and even though the film is long (I believe in about 3 hours), you will not notice honesty. And when it ends you do not want to do it. <br /> <br /> I'm not easy to print, that means there are not many movies. I want to give 10 to 10 ratings but this one. Except for multiple character studies, the film is used in music. I have never seen movies in my entire year, the music is not telling the story as well as the story. It was such a shamelessness, you know that you do not have to see anything every day. Perhaps the performance of what I saw him was best and Mark Wahlberg was incredible (I'm surprised that people still say that he does not work well. I do not know who anyone might think of seeing it), but the person who really surprised me was Heather Gram (Rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in his role, especially with Limo's Bart Reynolds View <br /> <br /> Again, I would like to say that this movie is not for everyone, because other IMDB critics have Echo. But I still think it was 10 of the top 10.
