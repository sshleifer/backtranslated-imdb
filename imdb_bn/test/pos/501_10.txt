This photo is fantastic! Wesley Snippets Place blades with a pure class blades of vampire Hunter, he sheds a lot of fluids and fierce ways that boasts Bruce Ley. The movie thrills a fast paced, action and fantastic stunts. The first action scene and the ending looks outstanding and Wesley looks like a terminator because he runs around wiping out all the suction heads. The script has quite good and very sharp dialogue. Wesley has done more than her action film, I know she is a very good actor and she does not play a more ridiculously dramatic role in it, as long as the action goes to Star, she is the best actor. All, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and probably Tom Cruise (if they count as action star) came closer. As well as Wesley's quality Steven Dorff is very good as bad guy. It is an unexpected surprise that someone with a little comedy should not stand by snippets, but he does. Overall the film is sharp, stylish and I hope the sequence is done with the same speed.
