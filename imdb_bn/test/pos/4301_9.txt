I saw it was one of the worst Columbus Mountains, however, I'm only in the second season. <br /> <br /> Normally Colombo activities are fun and annoying. His cigar's ash hurts him, has been seen before, and where he always identifies something with the murderer - cooking in this case, TV cooking program gets confused with the main theme. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the show, the brother's mixer wire was not even explained. The reason was not explained, nor did it serve any purpose. But the part I dislike is the death of the bride. This is not explained and why I give this section such a lower grade is the main reason.
