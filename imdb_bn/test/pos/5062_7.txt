I came up with a list of a miles-long error from "milestone", so my overall impression was that how was it a pretty decent movie? It is a film that is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> There are shields of big names in those parts, one of them does not give a memorable performance (Omar Metwali, a relative unknown, you remember it); If recognized aspects are beneficial; And a script that is both very complex and very simple at the same time. Metwali is an Egyptian-born American citizen who is kidnapped by the US government's Renaissance program, otherwise the United States persecutes the torture of suspected terrorists, acknowledging whether it is a distant truth. Ridge Witherspoon plays her pregnant wife, who is on behalf of an old college friend (Peter Sarsagard) who works in Calcutta (Allan Arkin) and her husband. Marily Strip plays the role of Renaissance program; Jack Gyllenhaal is interrogated by a young agent and gets to the conscience. Meanwhile, a parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top Egyptian officer, who is friendly to the American Revolution program and her boyfriend, who is training suicide bombers. <br /> <br /> There are many plans for packing in the two-hour movie, and I was going to wash the whole thing, especially the Egyptian Romio and Juliet's mistress, who did not think much of anything confusing. But then at the end of the film, a wrapping of the trolley brings together all the plots that want to revise what you know about the motivation of different characters and "Renaissance" creates more interesting movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Are you going to be tough to wonder? And to act as actress like Marily Streep, she will not have to do anything to work on this one-dimensional dragon lady. Of course, the film tries for relevance, but instead of addressing the fraudulent web of the national security issues, it charges the middle of the debate in a predetermined fashion. At the moment, when you think that the film will turn out to be interesting - for example, if Witherspoon starts to doubt her husband's past, for example? What happens if Metawali actually contacts with terrorists, as he is accused of interrogation? But no, the film takes the path of resistance to the lowest. <br /> <br /> But, as I said earlier, I recommend this movie. I know I did nothing but did not list a bunch of faults, but it got its head in the right place, and it can be as entertaining as the movie about recreational, or at least torture and interrogation. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
