Firstly it could say that it was not an art film or a documentary. I had a unique movie after experiencing the taste or perhaps a revelation. This world is a human quest to destroy everything in life on earth. Lead stupid and cold. He is like us all for our rich, laughing, traveling, eating and entertainment. He directs from one place to another in a giant RV and passes only time without purpose and self-entertainment. The end is too late. Since my first visit to the United States, it has evolved like a custom fit dream on me, where life on Earth is nothing but a wonderful experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist and this photo has been communicated with my senses. It was an ideal posture of impermanence. This may sound strange, but anyhow the film was able to touch me deeply like anyone else. I recommend it
