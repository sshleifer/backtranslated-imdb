Is this American version much better than the 1934 English film? There is no doubt in English version, antique and very low budget, and irrelevant acting (except Peter Lauer). In addition to the top production price in 1956, James Stewart sees the best 'innocent' American as a foreigner and Doris has always been in his best role. Special note music - American film music is almost classic; Compare both with "Albert Hall" sequences and you agree that Bernard Harman music is much more exciting than the original version (though it's basically the same music!). The only error in the 1956 film is the ridiculous taxidermy shop. I would appreciate any argument that the English version can prove good.
