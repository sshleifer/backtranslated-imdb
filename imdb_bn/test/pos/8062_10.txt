Schindler's list was as good, I found this movie more powerful as it is based on a documentary and real life. It describes the details of Frank family, and especially Anne. Although it is moving slowly (detailing their family life before the war); <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
