I saw this movie as the first available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people did not get the movie. If you do not, then it is a good movie with some interesting character development. It's a thorough human story about some incomplete people in the west of the western city, and really speaks to the original of Blues. If you leave the drama you do not know what "black snake monan" knows. And not .. It's not just a song. Christina Rixie has done a great job and has fully confirmed her role like Samuel L. Jackson. I think Paul Fiction plays his role and it's probably his best performance because of his character's character in his best career. The rest of the parts are strong here, with some bright performance here and there, especially John Kothran Jr. Rev. R.L. I am very fond of movie viewers, and this film really rated me among my favorites because it is visible from ethnicity, along with my opinion, a movie, sex, religion and neuroscience in rural areas, along with its cinematic genius.
