This film shows that the search for free enterprise systems and omnipotent currencies crosses ethnic and ethnic barriers everywhere. Finally the message determines the message that the market place is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is run by a group of African Americans on the street, under which a nonsense is a black man, who wants a money and believes that he can sell the goods by telling the truth. But the film shows that he does not try to do anything, market places and political systems claim that he is no different than his predecessors. Interesting, off-beat movies.
