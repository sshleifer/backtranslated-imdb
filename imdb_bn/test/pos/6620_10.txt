If you have ever had a friend, or a child that was skating at one time or not, then see this glimpse! I saw it several times and every time I see it I get something new. It reminded me why I came to skate in the first place (long ago). It reminds me that any skating brings to any person and I have also found a person who needs to help the squares, the good, the skate. Sure that the whole scene has a very dark side to see, which touches the movie a little. But it tend to focus on what key to skating is. Just a person on board, doing it because they love to do it. This movie was so inspirational that I'm scratched again (I'm 32 years old) and I'm not happy with my soul over the years ?? Give it to someone, you will not be disappointed.
