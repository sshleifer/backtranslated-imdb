Obviously this does not suggest my ratings compare with Argentine's enthusiasm, but with less than 70 budgets, fate drives and that section is really a classic. Lack of money, (Does anyone care too much?) Acting is better than a professional, (Is this more realistic?) But compared to many other films, not just low budget, it does not drag a moment. It may be slippers but your strap can have non stop breast and occasionally some camps, but it must of course have to see which I have no idea what I am saying. These crazy small films filled with crazy characters are quite stimulating at times, it is definitely made fun and fun to watch it.
