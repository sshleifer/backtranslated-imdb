I was hoping to be a stinker in this movie but I wanted to look for myself, but I was surprised how good this film was. I know that long films often do not work well at the box office, but outside of why it is dragged and not allowed to be seen by the public. It keeps my interest throughout life and visibility and photography are sometimes exciting. The plot was good and morality was a good game. I liked the reality which was along the "Unforgiven" line. I was hired to watch this movie but it was definitely worth it.
