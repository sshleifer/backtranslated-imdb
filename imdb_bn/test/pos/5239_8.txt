I really liked this picture. It depicted John Wayne in his first acting performance. Even then, you can call Owen the real presence, though he was not really mature in 1936 after the 9th century known to the stagecatch. It continues to establish colonial colonies from all Western countries across the country. Owen's character Broke Coleman joins to establish his colony, but for personal reasons. Most of the major actors were the stage actors and never made a movie, which is more amazing. He was able to create credible, individual characters and here is a strange mixture. Cameron will come one year later, and there was a similar story, though I did not like it like this movie, for me, the Big Trill is a strong 8/10.
