I always loved French movies because I think they are filled with passion and sense of a lot more than Americans. This image is a gem. <br /> <br /> It's so funny to start with a wedding that you just want to join them, and ultimately where small family kids will tell us who is the most fun. Catherine Dennis is simply hot and so good that it is completely possible that a young man can fall in love with him and Vincent Lynn is suited for that role. The best scene (excluding marriage marriage) is the reunion of the family where Antoine has gone crazy and awakens his feelings to Leah in front of the family. I am so shy that I buy this movie only from French, not even from English (so I have to learn it in French to see) !!
