H.O.T.S. A fun film for a trip back when leather flicks had a more positive fun filled agenda. They are just made to headline and have a few smiles. Everything seems less cynical and jaded. Girls have all the natural figures and there are some playboy playmates. Simple plots work with a group of young people who open an unauthorized streamlined house, who insulted them for coming back to exploited girls and insulted them. Instead of today's emotional strategies, most of the hijinks are innocent. Woman is an appropriate actress for this genre and mostly very interesting. To keep our attention in the overwhelming view, our mafia hechen, a stolen beer, a hot air balloon, a fanny house mother and the most expensive robot ever seen. Parties have even had Danny Bonadukis of the family. If you have a sense of humor, let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.
