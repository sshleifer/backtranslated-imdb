*** SPEAKER *** *** SPEAKER *** In the poster years, something happened in the air that made interesting settings for the night cities. City movies were created at night, not in America. One of the most notable is that of Carroll Reed's Man Man Man Out, an English picture of an injured gunman through Belfast's roads. In America it was a noon hero, or more accurately, silent of the picture of mid-pessimism. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not really the protagonist of the heroine, but there is a silent touch, even though it uses it for their own goals. , Which is with prejudice. Written by John Packston, directed by Edward Demitr, it was adapted from a novel by Richard Brookes. Books related to a homosexual assassination; The victims of the film were converted into a Jew. Though there is a mysterious film, there is no doubt in the film, because the killer is very clear soon. The film is so frequent and beautiful that after World War II, a city of Washington, DC, was one of the most gifted craftsmen to do films. Contrary to many night movies, the crossfire is mostly inside: police stations, house rooms and all night movie theaters. The soldiers are everywhere in the film, and most of them are risky to get back their civilian life. Yet we have got a sense from more than one person that their personality has become so much by their military experience that it is becoming difficult for them to return to their old surroundings; Something maybe even impossible for them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Killer, Monty, a kind of person. One sense that he was never connected to his civilian life. She needs people who are a lonely wolf. Undoubtedly alone, he has a milestone in a sadistic streak, and his joke butt almost always needs someone around. The man who killed him did not harm him, and he was actually unfamiliar to him. But once Monty discovered the person's religion, that was enough. He did not really want to kill him, because his 'mere' was intended to insult him and kill him. But he was quite drunk at the time, Monty's fist got him good. This work makes the story dynamic. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The opposite number of Montei is Keili, another soldier who, like Monty, is spontaneous and somewhat isolated, does not express any annoyance to anyone and seems to be a reasonable, even tragic man. Pipe-smoker group intelligence detective, finely, men are sandstone and a tad effete compared to men, but he proved to be more of a match for the various and mostly recalcitrant soldiers dealt with. Playing actor, Roberts Ryan, Mitchell and Young, each one different key, to give excellent performance. Ryan as Monty, intense and funky, always looking for someone to sort out; And one can feel his concern over hunting himself. As Keili, Mitchell is low-key, almost flexible; He never raises his voice; And he seems to have more to say, more of the proposals, which are allowed by the script. The youth's performance has often been criticized for being soft, but I have been fraudulently firmly and offshooted. He rides against the Hardboiled Police Stereotype, and makes Phinley's character a bit of a prince for crime detection. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises in the crossfire, though the script is sometimes wonderfully written even brighter. Character actor Paul Kelly portrayed one of the best performances in the film as a 'boyfriend' of a soldier in a bar. Kelly might be her husband or not; And she may or may not be with her, though she feels quite comfortable in her apartment. The beauty of this scene is that nothing is clear, and this person thinks what its role was, or what should be a little misleading ones. In this case, these scenes form the thematic core of the film, which is anomie. Without the exception of intelligence, all men in the film are dreaming, purposeless and largely lost, some more important than others. In this case crossfire, a movie about identity, and how easily it can be lost or fight for all the promotion near the end. Men in this movie have to move from one side to another, because they are involved in a kind of rowdy camerade, their personality is combined into the ordinary American male template. Then something happens, something is nailed. The word 'hei' or 'hillbilly' is mentioned, and events suddenly move around, and outside the community, the identity of a person, the idea of ​​a person, who does not like them, becomes deeply objectionable, even cruel. Then, after tempers flare and stirred them up, whatever solution or forgot, the men were restored to their loose, non-private group normality, and the order is restored.
