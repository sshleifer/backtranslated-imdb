I like Tom Hendes, and he's one of the few actors who will take me to the theater, although I do not mind about this movie. I am worried about bringing Hong Kong back as a "light comedy" because this is where he transformed from TV to the film - remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson War" is not a light comedy. It is a political satire, and a very well written political satire about it. The script is the star of this movie, and some of the best offers this year is to remember Harun Sources. <br /> <br /> Mike Nicholas is running a whole fled together, providing a movie that is very fast 90 minutes (time comedy everything, and if it drags it is nothing funny). Nicholas's choice in set and light is very memorable of the '70s and 80s TV, it is deliberately a piece of pieces used to crumble. <br /> <br /> The digital special effects brought back to the use of model work and stock photography also enhances retro look and credibility. Remember to design your favorite stock footage designers: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG, and a Bell and a Hin. But it may be a fun part. <br /> <br /> I saw this image in Philadelphia. The audience was interesting to watch and the audience did not get historical references to their own history. History repeats because the indigenous people have forgotten what happened for the first time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hendes and the hijacking of Philip Seymour Hoffman are both Kuds. The source code by these actors brings life, and the whole production team is at the top of their play. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended.
