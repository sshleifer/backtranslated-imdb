I'm not from America, I'm from Central Europe and I think the show is amazing. It can be easily compared with married. Children. My title says that it is not for the conservative people. I mean, I am not so liberal, but it can be a little different between European conservatism and our danger. However, the show started to be very popular in our area and it is very bad that it has only two seasons. The last episode opens many persistent and fun moments. Anyway that I will continue playing and many people will be happy. The last thing I am excited about is some moral lessons filled with ridiculous scenes. I mean, I've seen a lot of comedy which is very sad in the tragic scene and it takes more minutes that just does not fit in the comedy. War does not contain anything and laughs. It's like Simpsons and Married who has no sad or even illogical moments. I apologize for my terrible knowledge about English but I still hope that you can understand.
