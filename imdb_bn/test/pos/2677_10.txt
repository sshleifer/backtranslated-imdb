This show is amazing! I love every episode. Kerry is a lovable and never a moron that is a spitfire and a Doug Doug. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deccan and Kerry Bose add a nice ending touch to show, all the fun, pee-type type at the moment of your pants. In one season, Doug Carr√© tries to get drunk, because he is nicer when he is drunk. Good husband right? Kerry is not much better, when her boss needs an IPS driver to test his work in a small case, Carey is disappointed, because he sees Doug as a slab and does not want to embarrass him, so he instead rents Doug's friends. . Wife of the year But, I believe, being lazy, lazy-random Arthur. She is frustrating, and drops angry. Hey, if you were at the very bottom, there was a smelling smell in the mold and it bothers you. This show is sunny, and if you do not see it yet, you did not live!
