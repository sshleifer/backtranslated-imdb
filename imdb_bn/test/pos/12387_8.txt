I think this movie is not your ideal Spanish thriller but it's the basis of a real story held abroad. This movie is based on the real story of the genre-cloud romantics of the French, and the actual incident is much more serious and scary than the film. In the real story of Mr. Ramand, the family did not escape, after a few years after lying, he decided to kill his wife, two children, parents and dogs, and even though he tried to kill himself, he seems to be 'alive Try very hard. I saw this film on my side, how it can never happen in real life, these lies have become unknown, I laugh as I read the book of Mr. Romand and knew that it happened. I liked Jos√© Coronado in this movie, he played our best as one of our crew.
