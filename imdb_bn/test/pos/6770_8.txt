I'm not sure I've ever seen a black comedy from Denamark before but this is actually quite good. Humor is a good way to go with some of the terrible activities, low-key and deadpoints. Svend and Bjarne are annoyed with the work for their boss, because he always putting them (actually he mentioned that they were not quite bright enough to unzip before peeing at one stage). They do what they want to do to start their own slaughterhouse and when a worker turns cold overnight on a cold night, they hit something that became more popular than their Bush's shop. In fact, he sold his first "file" and partly because of his fault, because he had served them on a rotary dinner in their home and the guests were disturbed about it and looked at Seventh and Bijenes the next day. Bjarne is somewhat terrific what Svend did but it does not stop there. Svend has come up on his tragic little existence, which may be one of the new popularities for him and he does not want to leave it, so with all the familiar people of Freezers (and, at one point, "a small Sweden from the park"). The suspect emerges, though, because the former boss is something wrong to think of Holger. Bijnani was also afraid of her two brothers, Eagle, who lived in sanitarium for a few years to reduce and wanted to pull the plugging plug, so he could get the heir money to help open the shop. Eagle's breathing stops when he revives, many of Bjarne's awful lot. Apart from boycott, there is a love interest in Austria, who works in the graveyard. Svend not Bjarne better coordinated person and so start to spiral out of control of things. Deadpan humor does this really, and this louder material does not smile exactly out, although it's certainly fun. Though meat and body parts are considered relatively false, it is a bit unclear, especially these two take it as a matter of fact. If you are a fan of black comedy then it is recommended that I like myself very well. 10 out 8
