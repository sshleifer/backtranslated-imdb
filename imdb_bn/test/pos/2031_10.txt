If you like 80's rock, you will definitely see this movie! I recently saw it and completely fell in love with it! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very entertaining, providing you with plenty of rock music and not even a second of the movie. Find boring! It was a great idea that some genuine musicians were like this, they did what they did well. I was very happy to see Zacch and Blaise Elias, they all provided tough performance. I want to agree with many people that the first half of the film was much better than the second, especially on the terms of the script. It may work better but it is not a big task. Jennifer Aniston's performance was a bit annoying. I thought he was not the right person for this role, I just could not see him as a Rock Star Girlfriend. But if the movie is going on, you can understand how you did such a good thing. The honesty and sincerity of a certain quantity he distributes is that you do not live in cold. <br /> <br /> A good and funny movie, it does not go deep into characters but gives you a great fun, nostalgia, and of course Jacques Scott Soto and Mike's wonderful voice. Matijevic!
