Women will be better than men like this movie. Of course, more romantic comedy women than men - average. I usually like romantic comedy, but I'm 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie and 6.5 for the next 40% and 9 for the last 10%. So, frustrating, I can rate it 7. I keep the tape and keep all the movies in 7 or better rating and none 6 or more - at least it's my purpose. I have more than 1200 movies, so why keep dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife liked this picture a bit more than I did, even though I'm not sure why. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She was a darker in high school for the first time and will have to learn how to be cool around the second time around.

I thought why they would choose him for this role until I realized how capable he was to be a dog. Sooner than I do not think that when I got up in the morning, I would like to see him at the age of 15. Ah! Naturally, she eventually turned into an interesting (intelligent) woman and she became very popular. <br /> <br /> The very sweet scale is 9.9, so you'll love it. Otherwise, it is very memorable and not easily missable.
