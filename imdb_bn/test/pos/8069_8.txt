Argentina's director Eestaben Sapi's an indecent film, La Antenna, has both succeeded in reviewing the silent film genre and as a secret alert story. The setting is uninterrupted in a city on television, its people are deprived of speech without the presence of a lonely and mysterious screen known only as voice. To maintain their firmness on electricity, the television mogul Ramakrishna couple wonders, a strange couple, Mr. TV and mad scientist said. To kidnap Y voice and turn its unique talent towards their own gifted edge. This is a small family and voiceless, dark, dark son has to stop this evil plan. The result is a roller coaster of a story that is scoff at the occasion but is never surprising. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film that has many effects in it; Additional information for great silent movies such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be easy for anyone with a passing contact of their work. But more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such respect. Especially in the gangster vehicles of the 1930s. The TV and its heinchman were often silent, when the silent film era was dead and a very different industry started to emerge. <br /> <br /> La AntennaClitched Plot Device and theatrical on-activation are so common in silent movies, though it is very intelligent and ridiculous. It sets out La Antenna's wonderful visual style, which is really different from those respected movies. From the hypnotic TV logo to the Mensing Hilltop Transmission Station, does this movie invent astonishing visualization of the studio Ghabli animation rival? And using all these real actors and handmade sets. Moreover, although styles are often deliberately corny and dramatic, it is still an uncertain, provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism across La Antenna resonates in the struggle for power of TV empires and loss of words. At the same time, most of the most powerful images are genuine, in which the television sets have hypnotic cyclones and nightly TV factories. <br /> <br /> I do not want to finish this review, but I think La Antenna's English language release subtitles diminished. The original Spanish subtitles are used in great effect, play almost with words on many screens. However, the English-language subtitles associated with the original dialogue are frustrating incomparable, due to visitors and errors, the audience trim the pieces together for themselves. La Antenna is however an interesting piece of movie; An apparently exciting experience that demonstrates great power and humor when narrating a strong pretentious story.
