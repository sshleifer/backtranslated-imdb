Project A2 is a classic Jackie Chan film that hopes for all Kung Fu, crazy stunts and slapstick laughter. Prequel not as good but still it's a great movie if you want to see some fun. The story is simple, versus evil men versus Jackie Chan. So if you want a movie that does not have to be a banner for you to understand, I would recommend it.
