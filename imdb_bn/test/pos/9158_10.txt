I think my family said "Nicholas" at night (Monday? Tuesday? NBC?). This was a fantastic car for James Garner, very good writing, a great pairing. His character is very much like "Support Your Local ..." movies: In the retired gambling town with the mysterious past, there is an event in the city and every week there are events. In fact, it seems fairly clear that the same character was. It was just a charming TV show. Like a sleep, "my world and welcome to it", which can be of its time - I forget. I highly wish to be able to get this show DVD available. It was just a good TV. Probably "Briscoe County Junior" come around, but only by a mile.
