I guess I'm too much to add. After more than ten years of coming out, the joke became fun. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Songs are good to use during the movie, but the archive's background is very busy, very developed and if ever there is a movie to be edited in DVD, then I would seriously recommend that the background music is almost invisible. This has reduced the overall feeling of the whole film and I can see unconsciously why so many people passed it. <br /> <br /> This picture had lots of work for script, plot and comedy. Level It is very bad that producers and directors think that they need musical skilak to increase mood. Now to know this, I was very hard to see and I remained silent about anyone involved in the musical editing of the film. It was a jackhammer all subtlety.
