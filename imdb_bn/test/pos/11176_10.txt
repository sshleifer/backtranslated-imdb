Can i say Monkey Island Curse Fantastic. The story is good and difficult, but stupidly stupid, jokes are violent, the positions are confusing ... you can not ask for more of a game of adventure. "You will not see my identification." The bit itself is valuable to buying the game, not to mention the Marquee, which has become a hot topic among many of my friends (only some of them have played this game). You like this game. And if not, very bad!
