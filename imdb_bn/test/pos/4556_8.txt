Plan trainings and automobile reboots in a number of ways. I think it's a bad and tragic event that both John Candy and Chris Fary had left us when they still had a lot to do. God blesses both of them, I think the plot of 2 movies is really the same, because of many unhappy results of two different pole road trips and chills, this film can not be a plane train and automobile, but this is especially an entertainment movie. Chris Ferley's great performance, if we compare the missing parts of this movie to the comparison of the candy and martin classic, I think it's good
