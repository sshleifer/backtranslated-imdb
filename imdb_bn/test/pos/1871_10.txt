On Indian television, one of the best sitcoms, along with Chal Bhai's and its friends. Great acting, well read and a very funny script made this really a memorable series. The full fill of the fun filled opening (someone without the impossible teenager) gave a correct picture of what one could expect. After locking the TV show, I borrowed it from the year of the local video library. I hope Indian television will return to serials like Asin Saas-Bahu Soap and Reality Television, which are all good nowadays. Anyone who is found in a really good comedy will go and get this series. You can also enjoy some Pakistani sitcoms such as Gulf and Down and Arick and Aiko which are certainly India's best comparisons.
