By seeing this film, or movie set of my first kids, completely change my view of the possible possibilities of people's interaction and possible experience. This memorable exploration of people, and their historical setting, reveals how the existence of each human being is full and intense. Humans are portrayed as themselves: the smallest of the largest internal and external phenomena, their experiences are more detailed with most of the arts and concepts. Edgar Riet shows a fabulous perception of human motivation and sigh. <br /> <br /> When this phenomenon is set against the supernatural period allowed by the length of the work, no one can help, but to overcome the power and vitality of happiness, be defeated, desire, love, sadness, sorrow, That each person feels. When I saw these movies, I felt my future experience, my life would inevitably hurt and will be deliberately and accidentally reduced due to both events. I have long felt the feeling of living and what it means to reflect on past lives, memories and topics. A best composition and a revelation. I just want BBC to screen it again. <br /> <br /> If someone knows that I can get a copy, can they contact me?
