I saw this movie for the first time on a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. This is a real hug and passes the trip with less discomfort than normal 10-hour flight. I tried to identify a copy of it without success until I discovered a copy for sale on eBay. Now it's seen twice, I recommend it as good entertainment My only true criticism is that the translation of subtitles for English subtitles, sub-parallel, and even normal values. Also, subtitles are small to small, very often in movies and often travel fast enough to read well.
