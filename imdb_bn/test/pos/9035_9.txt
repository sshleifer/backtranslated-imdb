Dust in intruder the dust (1949) DR: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM is a classic 'Southern Gothic' story, called Faulkner's novel, Black Man, accused of a white Killing people, who asks a white-white boy that he has made friends to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Bouchamp (Juna Hernández) is a contrasts in this small town. She is a black man who does not think much of the land he owns and the ill-social order that mostly holds peace in here and similar small town. So when Lucas Vinson was found to shoot guns on Gauri's body, a small chick behind him was caught by Closer (Claude German) (Luca once rescued after being caught by the dog of his dog) that the city finally "Lucas a **** There is a chance to do. " With a very real chance of being arrested, and lynched before night, Lucas reached Chuck for help, as he was not "cluttered with the idea" as the only person. The chick asks his cousin John, to protect Lucas and when the people are initially annoyed by his own ideas and they fight against the crowd gathered to save Lucas. <br /> <br /> Unusual precision and mostly moralizing for its time is free. The attitude of the lawyer is the tendency to speak incredibly self-conscious conversations that seem like most of the printed page, but it has minimal impact on its voice. That's a credit to all other rich charisma. Zuna Hernández, who was most likely to appear in Oscars Mikocos films, is as fantastic as Lucas. As Father of the Porter Hall murdered man, perhaps I played him in the best role and supported Elkla Petersson as a lucky grandson, sympathetic towards Lakkas, and contributing to the support. The setting is fully realized. It is actually portrayed in the city of Oxford, Mississippi of Faulkner's house. Brown also effectively uses the crowd, it is always an anonymous crowd (like Lucas when he is arrested or John is on his office) against a single person, it is very dangerous. Or it was a parade of the whole city gathered in Gelhaus. An absolutely riveting scene of notes when Chicks and his friend Alake go to collect testimony in a cemetery. Robert Sartis (Bid and Great, Tokyo and Tokio, Ben-Hurt) shot the film. <br /> <br /> *** 4/4 out
