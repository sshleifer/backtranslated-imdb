The only presence of Sam Waterstein as an Indian, this film must be seen. He is both beautiful and very fine, both with no lines. She is flexible with her abduction, and yet we can see she is proud of all the young Indian men. Martin Shane decides to challenge Watertown (White Bull) for a fantastic white horse who just touches a fool. Other sub-plots are really unnecessary. I do not understand the acting part of Carolyn Langrish, as the White Bull kidnapped poor girl ... I do not know that she has kept this beautiful Indian man! Although it's a lot of fun; Especially if you are a waterstall fan. Man, he looks good on this one !!! Harvey Kettle's role is notable, true! But, rent it and enjoy it! Actually, I believe if the music score is good then it was a more dramatic movie ... the music is so bad, it's confusing. Still, Mr. Watersten!
