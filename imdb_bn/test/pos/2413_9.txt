Ralph McKee, a sign of "Karate Kid" once! Hillary Swann did an excellent job playing Julie Pierce orphan. Pat Murita, who is Mr. Miyagi played, he worked with Daniel from a different pair. Both Danielle and Julie were on the side of the cart. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most extreme person who ever challenged. And there were no tournaments to compete. And there are some comedies in this movie. When Julie came from school, I liked that part, Miyagi went to monitor her, and saw the cloth change in the process. That was so funny! And on the classic "wax, wax-off" scene was different. Miyagi said to Julie, "Uh-oh, miss spot" when it was fun. The set in Boston was crying from California The militant group of that group was like "Cobra Kai" of Boston. And Michael Einstein's Colonel Dougun was Colonel Dougun, John Crayes. Julie kicked some serious butt while her group virtually deported him When they exploded the classic Oldmobile, they all paid the price. What an awesome job At least they will be able to get relief from poison poison. This Karate Kid sets some morality, in contrast to the last three, which talks about "respect" and "honor". Hillary Swank is any movie and she is unselfishly warm everything else. Movie 9, Hillary Swing 10!
