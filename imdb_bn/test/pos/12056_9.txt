I usually love SRK as a fame (can you do?) And I believe that SRK and Juhi are actually more beautiful in comparison to the screen as they are both beautiful. Look at this movie, though it has some big flaws: <br /> <br /> 1) Good guy (Sunny) - Not just less interesting than Shah Rukh (in my opinion, which is very important in Bolfilms) But its role is less character - it will be better if there is a conflict between two powerful personalities, instead there is a conflict between our personality and the average soldier <br /> 2) Kiran and for the activities of Rahul Sunil's reaction is incredibly stupid and even homemade for the production of a Bollywood <br /> <br /> But it's not good to say that all the excellent Meddramatic atmosphere, great songs (genuinely great) and Shahrukh as a murderer. <br /> <br /> One must definitely see (with Anzam, Bazigar and Duplicate)
