This movie gives us some touchy romance with some WWII history, a little imagination and meaningful emotions - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage does not fail us, and here again works a great deal. And so do not have other policy letters. The physician / father operated by John Harde is a tea character, who delivered one of the best definitions of my love (to his daughter). Some incidents in the event are somewhat restricted to be real, but I regret that it is partly fairy tales and imagination. My wife and I really liked the film. And the people are happy to see the risk of the love of their enemies. A man who left our nearest theater told his wife, "Now the way of war!" I think you'll see what it means when you're watching this lovely Greek island's Italian residents.
