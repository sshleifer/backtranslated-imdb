I am mentioning that carefulness can be used here carefully for what I have discussed here, even though I do not really think that I exclude important issues. Any "dream" is really important for the success of this movie or the viewer's enjoyment of it. <br /> <br /> Without some minor flaws, it's a nice and very moving movie about friendship, time, uncertainty and deciding about their lives. Yet, at the same time, it is a very funny movie, small, mostly woven over at least diverse bits. For most movies, it progresses at a fairly retarded pace, but the film does not diminish its image in one and its characters, and at first it is mostly light-hearted. Some have commented that most movies are slowly being displayed slowly, but the life of such sympathetic characters is such a wonderful illustration that it can almost be seen continuously. As soon as the movie progresses, the movie becomes more emotional and continues till the end and the progress is surprisingly directed. Finally, some characters decide to loot a bank, and although it is probably hard to believe a bit, it is also near the point. These friends are an amazing addition to putting emphasis on loving each other and at the same time it adds humor and adds more mockery to the film. And, although a small number of old boys rarely have the basics, references and details are very basic and they make fun of looting a bank, such as Esmete (if I remember correctly) makes the aggression too much <br/> <br /> <br /> I said, there is less comedy than most comedy but still very ridiculous so I was glowing throughout my life. <br /> <br /> The actor is probably the real key of this movie. They imbue letters with deep personalities and sympathy and impressed them with great care and warmth. Characters have some small conversions or short descriptions of personality, which are easily and nicely closed. Of course, about the personality of these characters and how they care about each other and communicate with them. This has been very successful for them and if the role of lesser actors, then the film could well fail. <br /> <br /> Google is not without grief, but it only provides complete range of emotion and makes the experience even stronger. In fact, the film is so full of so much love and so rich characters that it is very heartwarming, satisfied and even happy movie despite the sorrow. I could see over over.
