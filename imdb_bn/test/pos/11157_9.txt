All right, I know that this happens. Taken on her page, it's a bad movie - perhaps in a league with "External space from Plan 9". The conversation is suspected (but the one is quite enjoyable ...), this plot is not quite believable, Gavin's character has a great deal of influence. Seeing the film, something that really makes you wonder ... handsome and Kim creates a tank, Gane eats a banana in a bath, just talking about Gavin and doing everything ("pssssssssssssssychico !!"). This thing is probably the fault of the separation. Taken together, however, they are mere quirks. This movie is an open mind (especially if you are not familiar with Singapore's culture) and guarantees to provide many smiles and memorable times with friends of an open-minded group. You can not expect a great composition in this movie, even if you can not even expect to take anything seriously. If you can take this movie for it - a miracle movie about the underdogs, it is filled with your own quicks - so it should be a good time to see you! I saw it three times and I will not hesitate to see it three times !!
