This is my favorite Renoir from the fifties. How Henry Danglord built and launched Moulin Rouge nightclub; We saw workplace bombings to start construction work and to train dancers. Finally, the knockdown and the long order of canakan dance. Financial problems and performers describe the ego. <br/> <br /> <br /> Gobin looks like a gangrape easily - he's been laughing with Nina's violent boyfriend. Jainani Aspocito Nine is going to be like a late Prince. With the body of the Amazon, Marie FÃ©lix, Longla, is as uncomfortable as the first boyfriend of Danglaard. Eventually, Franianis Anaral was a washing-up girl like Nina, who ended up at the end of dance for Danglard and became his daughter, only stunning; <br /> <br /> A bonus: we used to rule Moulin Rouge a century ago, they played by Edith Piif, Patchau, Andre Clavou and other stars.
