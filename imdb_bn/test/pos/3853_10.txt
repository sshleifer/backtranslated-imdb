Duchess is a beautiful white cat who lives with her three cats in Paris with her wealthy owner's palace. When Bad Butler learns that the rich elderly lady is leaving the cats with everything in her wishes, Butler is angry, because she wants to get everything first. So he kept them sleeping and abandoned them from the side of the street. When the cats wake up, they roam for a long time. A street cat cat in the name of Thomas O'Mallley visits them and offers them help. When Edgar saw his house, he became angry and started to match them in Timbattu. But Thomas's friends came to help save the day. The rich lady decided to leave her house for every lane cat in Paris. <br /> <br /> This is a charming movie. Songs, animated and enthusiastic with "AVBD Wit to Be Bit" Voice cast is wonderful, as Eva Gabr (who will play Miss Bianca later in the Disney Ricoco film), Dessesses, Phil Harris (Jungele Buck's Baloo, Robin Hoodley Little John), gives interesting personalities to their characters. Before Walt Disney died in 1966, proceed to the film. Disney fans or cat lovers are recommended for everywhere! 10/10.
