I first saw this movie at the end of the 60's, and when it comes to TV when it tries to see it, which, unfortunately, is not often. Now I have TCM and FMC, hope it will be at least once a year. Louis Garcet Jr., like an officer and a gentleman, has provided incredible performance with the classic screw-up appointment as Jack Web Paris Island drill sergeant, and this story line has been dated, touched, and well-behaved. And Cast Genuine Jar-Heads must also help in the film's reality. It's a great movie with best acting and a fantastic story. If you have a chance to see it - it's a good time!
