In Russia, General Teenager Vera (Natalia Negoda) is living with her drunken father and her mother Simplon, waiting for a call from the telephone operator's technical course. His brother Victor (Alexander Negreba) lives with his own family in Moscow and occasionally visits his flawed family and sheep, always aiming at arguing. When Bharara met Sergei (Andrei Sokolov) student of the University, they love each other and decide to marry. Sergey goes to Verra's house, but is in conflict with his father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I just saw "Malenkaa sheep", and I liked this deep family drama much. I am not familiar with the lifestyle of the former URLS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I think are very interesting. The first one, when Victor told the sheep that his parents did not seem to want him, but they wanted to go to the big apartment because the reason. Another, when the family goes to a truck beach. Commonly among the Third World countries of the sheep family and their friends have many problems, suppresses the park and other situations illustrated in the movie. This low budget movie is very well managed, and the story is very deep and real. Cast is a great acting and actress Natalia Negoda is very nice. On the cover of the Brazilian VHS, published by the distributor of Sagres, there is information that the Natalia Negoda Playboy was the center of the magazine. I'm not sure how subtitles are true in Portuguese, because limited sentences of many long sentences in Russian languages ​​are limited. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pecka Sheep" ("The Little Vera")
