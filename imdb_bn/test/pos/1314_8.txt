Paul Shader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima, and thus, evidently illustrated Yukio Mishima and parallel to his work life. The film is divided into four sections: Beauty, Art, Action, and Lucky Day when Mishima Army General holds hostage and talks to Garrison, it only laughs with him and his Burundo community's Samurai Code. Mishima did Rishi Seppu on November 25, 1970, and she planned it as beauty, industry and work fraud. With three different scenes of Egyptian novels, the revised scraper was edited on that day: Golden Pavilion Temple, Kyoco House and Runway Horse. At the moment of Zooming, the moment of Sipaku holds the camera and pulls it behind the camera and fully understands it with Climax. <br /> <br /> Black and white sequences are combined with colorful moments described in the Mishima novels. Black and white scenes represent memory of Mishima's childhood and youth. Shadar is related to novels related to these autobiographical moments, which often parallels Mishima's real life, such as her stammer, body building emotions, and the encouragement of the Samurai Code. Examples of illustrations selected from each respective novel in three themes of beauty, art, and action. Colored sequences are primarily, fragile, technicolar films, memorable, giving the film, perhaps, considering a standard superhuman quality. <br /> <br /> Kang Ogata plays the perfect Mishima with firmness under the leadership of the General Office. That is similar to the lucky days and the real Mishima. Shadar took a tremendous risk with this film and he concentrated on his novels and Mishima kept comparing them with both personal life and literary ambition. In the three main divisions of November 25, 1970, the editing of the film, black and white growing areas and colorful novel scenes clearly indicate Mishima's deliberate disguise of these elements of beauty, art and work of life. Occasionally, it is difficult to follow, and it can not be recommended for unwanted visitors. *** big 4
