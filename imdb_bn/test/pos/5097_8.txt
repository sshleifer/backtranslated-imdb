"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a superb written and photographed music version of the classic 1939 film. There are hundreds of stunning scenes in the visible rural areas, spreading on the London side street from Peter W. Owol's wonderfully regulated, pedantic schoolmaster-like boyfriend, who finds love and changes by it, at least acting, from Greece's ruins. Leslie Brick's songs and songs have been criticized for film musicals as neutral or non-sectarian, but they are used to increase the story instead of saying it. Many songs are used to montages or underscore the view; Some "show off" numbers are not removed. In this way, the songs do not penetrate this subtle story, but it increases the characters thinking or feeling. "Where did my childhood go?", "Walk with the world with my", and "you and me" are especially useful. A absorbing, brilliantly acting, directed and written film.
