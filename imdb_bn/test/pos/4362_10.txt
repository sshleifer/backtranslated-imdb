Flight Little Dieter was my first film in 1999, the Goebburben FilmFlash edition. That evening I was very tired, I was not hesitant to see it, but the total number of IMDB 9 numbers allowed me to go there. <br /> <br /> This is a pure 80-minute battle! There was a living standard of living dinners through his own story. See <br /> <br />! And if possible ... watch this movie!
