Nobody knows if this video or film for this could get my hands on. I've been searching for it for a long time to show her daughter and I can not find it anywhere. Perhaps it was only in the video and they never made the DVD or VHS or IDC. <br /> <br /> I saw this rights to Disney in 1996 and I think it will be the best video to show. A good movie that has the passion of every kind seen throughout the whole movie. There are also many actors who have started their career with this movie. If anyone can get a copy of this movie or wish to sell it for a copy and 50 rupees or something, please call 201-566-0148. Thank you
