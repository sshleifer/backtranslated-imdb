Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, one year before "Memento", and this is almost as bright as this classic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In all matters. One day, he followed this man, Kob, who turned the tables and opposed the bill, who broke and acknowledged what he was doing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , Both men are starting to grow a bond between a sort of voyursurs and two of them. <br /> <br /> But cobb has a uninterrupted purpose to take care of this relationship, and it's very smart at the end. No, I do not waste it but it's a very cool movie and I'm starting to think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like amazing movies with amazing movies, then this is a must see.
