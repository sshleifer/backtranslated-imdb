"Hell to pay" bills itself as a classic Western regeneration ... it has succeeded as a western film film that the whole family can see, and not against children and boomer films some decades ago. Good guys are good and bad guys really bad! . BoaSavenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prin (Excellent in this movie) Team Thomson and James Drye are all great and it's fun to see it again. James Dry really shines this one, probably better than his days "Virginian." In this case, "Hell to Tune" reminds you of 60 of these movies, where you make the look that you are performing from many shows. If you are a specific age, then we have been able to see these icons because Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Danny Miller and William Smith provided a "Wow" factor. Screen legend, "Hell to Pay" features with the new name of Hollywood. The most notable of the story of "bride" is Rachel Kimsy (Rebecca), who I met with "The Young and the BestSales" and Kevin Kazakoff over the past. Want to live and stepping or "doing the right things" stepping. Fantastic with William Gregory Lee Chance, Karbie's evil and lively brother. Katie Cain Rheller, Rebecca's sister, was a woman who needed to be alive, but to give up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role, Jeff Davis, Mr. Joe, who plays former Confederate with a rather nasty average line. I think I will see more of these subtle actors in the future. "Hell to Te Pe" is a great story to say, a fun movie ?? Popcorn, we headline 'West!
