I first saw this image on the cable in the 80's and it pushed me to the root. It was again seen on TV about six months ago. Pictorial, black and white cinematography graphic was portrayed in the 1950s as a "urban jungle", which was a lot more artistic and port operations in the city, especially in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mr. Cassavitas always brings special intensity towards his role, and he is great in the role of the army's leader. His short 1959 TV series "Johnny Stacko" was a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> But Jack Warden's extraordinary performance is like a violent, brutal shift boss, which has attracted my attention. To get an idea of ​​the widescreen variety, see this movie, then see the 1962 episode of "Series City Nagar", a series called "The Spectator of Rose Street Gang (Available in Video)". If you are a fan of Film Noor, it must be seen. Enjoy!
