One unfortunate reality of Soviet Russia was that there was not much change in the welfare of the people during the Soviet era. "Window in Paris", it is seen that most people are depressed as before, but they are encouraged to go after money. <br /> <br /> Everything is changed to music teacher Nikolai Chizov (Sergei Donsov). He finds a window that leads to Paris. He and his friends naturally amazed at what they found. This movie I've ever heard is one of the most interesting discussions of Elvis Presley and Edith Peef. So watch this movie You are sure to love it. It's sort of a harbinger "being John Malkovich".
