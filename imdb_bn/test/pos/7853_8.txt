I thought Eastwood's most remarkable role was in the Madison County Bridge, but until I saw The Begead. He pulled it off, provided a very good performance and so left the cast. This movie is fantastic that the film was created in 1971 and there was no plot hole - which the director sometimes seems to struggle to cover - we will talk about an extraordinary movie. It is still strong, <br /> <br /> 8
