I saw this series on TV in 1990 and loved it (I'm nine years old) I bought the first DVD box about six months ago and got the second few days ago (thanks to my favorite husband). Sir ... It was difficult to sleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what would happen to Madeline and George. The problems of slaves and the civil war have always fascinated me (Fifteen-year-old). I advise. For those who really wanted to get past and read the slaves in the family by Edward Ball for those who really understood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I want to see heaven and hell, many people say here that it was not really good.
