I do not believe 60 percent of the voters voted this shot as ten, now I can not find how the rating is five impossible eight, I understand how it is fully distressed. However, the show is great, the story is great and the character is interesting, obviously ten out of ten in ten, I think the animals look cool, they look great and I hope my great show of Nimro was a great CGI hope there is a second series there and got many answers in the first season. The more animated the Nimrod will be, the more the animals will grow, why the vote is more so the rating It will be so low <br /> <br /> 10/10
