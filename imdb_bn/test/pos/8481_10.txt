Jamie Fox is absolutely Ray Charles Its performance is simply genius. Owner of the film, owned by Spesk, "daughter of Koen Monir" and Kaida-owned "Great Belle of Fire" Actually, it is hard to remember that Ray Charles is playing the part, and he did not act himself. Ray Charles legend. He is well-known as a musician and the song is deep, complex, and innovative. I'm more innovative than perception before watching this movie. The film can create new fans who can tell a little about their music. Ray's life has provided excellent biography for film, which is even better than another composer's film. I acknowledge that I know this picture very little about the life of a man. I was influenced by Ray Charles' courage, strength, and innovation with people and musicians.
