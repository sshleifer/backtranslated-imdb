I like this movie a lot, but my feeling that I have taken the most away is how much memory it is to enjoy the novel. The film now plays the best two actresses - Jessica Lange, who is awesome here, and the divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who can do the best with the thin-painted character she has given - as well as an amazing nice Michelle Pfeiffer and a permanent Jason Robards. Adaptation is basically a trustworthy book, at least faithful, it can be in an hour and forty minutes. The film does not really shine except for specific scenes between Lanz and Pfeiffer, but it works perfectly capable of making this amazing tragedy visible. As far as novels go from adaptive movies, these were definitely better ones. Unless anything else, my memories have been returned to recreate favorite passages from Jane Smiley's novels, and to brush King Character in lowercase letters, so that the depths of parallel have to be deepened. Value your time as a film, definitely, and hopefully enough that you read great literature to remember as well as a joy.
