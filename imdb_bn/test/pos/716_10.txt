I watch many movies - DVDs, features and classic, you name it. The night I saw Jerico together, my wife (who ordered it on the Internet) remembered it from the time she was in high school, that she lived with him for all these years. Slightly I was sitting (with our daughter and son), and the first opening was riveted from the title. We were all <br /> <br /> She, who is the original, and our kids (18 and 16) think that there was no idea about the film, there was no idea about it. Our favorite scene? When Strauss, Peter Strauss jokingly loudly said, "I'll do it again!" It was a defense offense because it was not a defense crime, but we could not believe it so intense ... When the colleague's colleagues gave him food for his efforts, we did not have dry eyes. <br /> < br /> <br /> Someone please make more movies like this. Incredible !!
