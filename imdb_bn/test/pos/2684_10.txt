It's the best comedy time. It's so undefeated! Shiny Dazzling Humor, Great Welding! Jerry Stylar Shore Jaw, she is so incredibly funny and playful, only a ridiculous genius! Doug and Kerry have great chemistry! I do not see it when everyone talks about Hype when everyone loves Raymond. Lam Jokes is mostly humorous and not just a diverse show, I can not seem to laugh in more than 1 episode. Queens King Kingdom is a rare comedy that possesses all the serious ingredients, which gives you a stomach smile because of Arthur Spooner, I think this comedy has its capabilities and Lum Raymond and CO do not.
