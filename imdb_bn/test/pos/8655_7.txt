Netflix has caught my attention in the instant play because it's only half an hour (it's 4th here), and it's Norwegian, which I wanted to follow with Dead Snow and see what the country is offering in international films. OK is a drill and delicious WRI rope, this movie is transmitted to some manuscripts of a man, Andreas, a brave New World city, where everyone is happy and happy and no taste of food, nothing smells, even loses sex appeal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vagina shaped hole in a concrete wall which emanates music. On the other hand, if there are two attempts to break it, they can track a little bit of light tracking. But of course, fantasy figurines, wills and illusions are not allowed and the elements of the city work to end Andres's efforts for freedom and sense of self-control. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Other similar science fiction matches are not worthy of evaluation, but the movie still gives a unique feeling and some interesting scenes with some fantastic horror issues. I like the limited but effective use of Gore in this movie, some isolation and flagging that gradually moves your heart slowly and slowly gradually. The Trond Fausa Arbor is a reliably melodic actor who feels physically from his surroundings, which works very well. Though the concept itself is not something to write about the house itself, everybody involved works on it and the film fully realizes its world. <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
