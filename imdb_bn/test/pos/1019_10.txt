OK, I love this movie !!!!! I saw it over again. It's so difficult to tell who the attacker is. If you are one person, then another, then the first person, then remember another person. It's so mysterious that you want to see who wants to take your TV faster. <br /> <br /> Gayle Osborn is raped and goes to his home. She is in the hospital and started telling stories about her being raped. It meets her teacher's boyfriend with her teacher, who loves her, her ex boyfriend, all the different stories, all the suspects But who did this? <br /> <br /> I love acting, here they have lots of talent. Mystery is wonderful and the settings are fantastic. It comes to it in the TV watch. *** 1/2 to 10/10
