The Blue Planet series is one of the greatest all-time great documentaries in the world without any doubt. For five years, filmmakers act shamelessly in Syria, and do not get any footage (like the title, Deep.) <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this series. It is really a treat to see the finger fish outside the small pictures shown in textbooks, but the Blue Planet has only one needle in the vast Gulf of the sea. From the open ocean to the tide pond, on the deepest part of the ocean the coral reefs take the magician journey around the BBC Ocean. I must admit, one of the first dreams of life was Marine Biologist, and the dream was revived after seeing this series. I've studied the ocean of this world for years, and saw numerous documentaries on coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But above all, someone was not able to take the life under this wave and the people under this group. <br /> <br /> See this series 'Blue Plate', I will not regret it.
