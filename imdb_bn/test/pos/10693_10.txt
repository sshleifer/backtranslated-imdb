Nizini III: There is plenty of non-stop ninja action as the dominating. It is a story of love, freedom and revenge, but it is basically the story of killing and killing people brutally for some reason. If you are searching for a movie where a ninja becomes completely nuts and they take all kinds of people to their graves, then she is only a person and she can do it, this is the movie for you. I can not think of any movie to compare this, because of this horrible cause of any movie. Wait, oh, have you ever seen things with two heads? There is a section where the title travels around the motorcycle and about one million police cars are behind it / behind them, but they are continuing to crash, and because you do not see Thatcher with two titles! Well, that kind of ninja like the third. Especially if you like the following, I specifically recommend this movie: Ninjas, Touvre, Breaking 'and Breaking' from Lucisa Dickie 2: Electric Bugaloo, Video Games about a bouncer repeatedly, confused and unrealistic love stories or "good" Ninjas
