Probably the best movie in the last five years. I have always believed that people are far more difficult to cry than to make them laugh. If you want to see 400 adults alike in the same room, check out this movie. It's exciting Javier Bardem plays the role of his life. You'll cry, laugh, you laugh ... The most appropriate is that everyone in Spain knows about Ramon Samadoro. Personally I knew the whole story and even the end. So, the excellence of the film is said to be like that story. And in this case, Amenab is a head teacher. <br /> <br /> This movie is essential.
