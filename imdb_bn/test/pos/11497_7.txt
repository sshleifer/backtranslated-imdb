Jolin (Heather Graham) runs a nightclub in New York and lives with a photographer, her husband Carl (Luke Wilson). About 500 days after the marriage, Jolin came to the house to find a note from Karl Karl that "some places" him and his favorite flowers, a glass of daisies. Joe immediately puts the daisies in the blender and press the button. Soon after that, he started to search Carl out of the West somewhere because he later became Karl's "committed". However, when he finally cast him into Texas, the camp first decided to go out of his house, hoping to find a clear explanation of his decision. He met a fantastic sculptor-neighbor (Goran, can not spell his name!) But, but his attraction discourages him. When he learns Karl's new girlfriend, he decides to consult with Mexican-American mysterious (Alfonso Arau) for advice. Joe is committed but what does Carl's mean? This is a very fantastic, great deal of marriage plagiarism. This quirky script and offbit style are undoubtedly infectious. Graham is a cruel woman who is going to spend a lot of time. Wilson does not give her best performance but enough as a mixed-up husband. The rest of the cast is quite beautiful, but the garland is excellent as a nice neighbor. Both scenes of New York and Texas are very beautiful and the clothes are fresh and fun. If you like romantic comedy and independent films, it is ordered for you. It is quite interesting that to walk a beat beat but still deliver the final happy ending category.
