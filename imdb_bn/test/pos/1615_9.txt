Brett Piper has again made a very good movie that is trashed by the so-called "expert" movie. It's low budget, but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. I could see more of Irene Joseph. Good fun fun I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. Special effects stop motion animation, and the call they call today is much better than computer-produced shit. I always enjoy Bret Piper films, and if you like it, then I beat him, scatter the dead and do something else. I look forward to seeing more of his work like Mrs Joseph. I can not see just why this woman has not been more movie as it's nice acting.
