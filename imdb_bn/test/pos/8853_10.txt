In 1982, "The Thing" came out in theaters throughout the world, it was a cold reception and result of very bad box office, which became the failure of John Carpenter's career as director of Halo; However, the time has been proved that "Things" were certainly not a failed project and frustrating commercial results were not the fault of the film. Nowadays, John Carpenter has been grateful to "The Thing" and is considered as a fearsome classic by many awful fans and without any reason John W. This new version of Campbell, Junior's story, "Who goes there? (Formerly adapted as" Things from another World ") is close to the original story and it is a well-researched study about paranoia, with a higher level of suspicion and a frustrating attitude. "The Thing" started in the winter of 1981, located in the remote area of ​​the United States Antarctica region. During the time of the research center, when the crew members were on the way to the Norwegian helicopter, members of the helicopter are trying to kill two Hussiki dogs, who make his way from the foundation of America. After Norwegians were killed eventually, Americans find out what their madness is. Trying to do so soon they will discover that the Norwegian dog huckus dog Not only was the natural dog, but an animal capable of imitating the living creature, not only this, it is an extraordinary hunger. <br /> <br /> Directed by director John Carpter, he achieved a place in history, when he used the word "Halloween" in 1978 Did, where the mystery and atmosphere were exaggerated and on the shock. "Thing" can be seen as evolution of that style, because the carbunner uses the robot's special effect (which is labeled "annoying" by critics on its day), even the film still focuses on the atmosphere and mystery. Rather than fierce (and very good) display. Along with the feeling of loneliness, along with the feelings of loneliness, the "bad actions" among members of the crew increases the feeling of piano because nobody can be things, even our main character, RJ McDaddy (Cart Russell) is faithful. <br /> <br /> This plot material was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and this version felt very poorly ignored by the previous version (not completely a bad thing, it is not a big difference). A new concept of the source novel, like a remix and more. Bill Lanquester's script manages letters with a brilliant domain, which gives them plenty of difference, but not too much to believe, due to the horrific terrible feeling of running through this movie, it makes them a necessary element. Most of mysteries and mysteries, such as no one can say that Thing and which are normal, with great results, uncertainty of the plot and increasing unpredictability. <br /> <br /> Cast is very effective, and their performance is so effective that anyone can feel bad feelings in their character as real. Carter, as McDaddy, regularly co-authored Carter Russell, and we saw his insanity with his eyes and became alarming as the worse situation became worse. Of course one of his best performances. Wilford Breamley is awesome like Dr. Blair, who became mad after discovering Theing's motives. <br /> <br /> "Thing" is a film made so surprising that its flaws have become strangely, although they exist. The most curious is that Mike Crowe is very rare and sometimes inappropriate score. It's not bad, but it feels the space outside of some scenes and it's not one of the best works of legend composer. Also, due to some harmful effects on special effects, some scenes were dropped which actually fill up some small plot holes, though it is neither of the greatest importance nor is actually boring. <br /> <br /> Speaking about the movies of John Carter, most people will often write the name "Halloween" as their favorite movie, but personally, I'll go with "Thing", because I made it one of the greatest achievements of the presenter and sometimes Think of one of the most fun and horror horror films made. As far as I'm one of the best movies I made 10/10
