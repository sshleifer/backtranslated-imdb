As a zombie fan, I really love this kind of plot where people end up in strange places surrounded by evil monsters! PB also has a nice tie-in with Readic Chronicles (COR). The gang had to run as fast as they were away from the darkness. There is so much metaphor in the story! Reddick is this bad guy, but he tries to save those slow people who are heroes. The Muslim man, Imam, depends on the position of the sun to pray five times a day, but he is stuck in a country that will rule in darkness. Overall, I recommend this movie to any Sci-Fi fans. You will not be disappointed.
