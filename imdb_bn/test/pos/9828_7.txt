Among all the actresses in today's film, Christian Scott Thomas, I would love to see if I would choose someone to travel to a desert island. <br /> <br /> I used to tell him to sit on the chair for a chair. A few hours So it is difficult for me to have a full purpose for her film. However, I've enjoyed this movie and its story, more than that, the person commenting on this site before being rated by the average rating among many. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is not one of the actors, although I enjoy most of his performances. But he is a handful of people who reached the level of reaching 8 times from 7 images every month, so whom can I argue? <br /> <br /> Although Ford is often frustrated in his acting style and sometimes it seems that the acute need for acute and a shot of caffeine - and "Random Hearts" are in this group. <br /> <br /> In the investigation of his loss, his passion, which he and Thomas both understand related to their linked husbands, gave his job as a detective - but not the level presented here. Although not far away, it crossed the line in the "boring" section. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes of being involved with Thomas and Thomas were attractive and well-played. <br /> <br /> This picture can be 9 * but I will reduce it to just a few levels based on Ford's overall performance, and the other, because it needed a little more than unnecessary sub-plot elements.
