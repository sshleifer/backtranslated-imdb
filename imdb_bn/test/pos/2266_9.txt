I really liked this movie ... but the advertisements I saw were applicable, and a published review actually said that the film "benefits from the touch of light." This is very confusing to me. <br /> <br /> There are actually lots of laughs: Bright, unreasonable, sometimes a bit of humorous humor: Usually ridiculous I usually feel very attractive. But most humorous things are that are conscious, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful. The film's past and present, weaves the perception and the theme of truth, memory and activity, life and death together. The whole film is full of European anti-Semiticism history, and especially Holocaust's history. <br /> <br /> How can humor and horoscope be combined in the same movie? The review that I saw is the humorous Absurdist. I do not think this all in this case; At least not in the general sense. Instead, I think this movie is mostly in the tradition of Jewish / Jesus literature and theater. I do not claim to be an expert in this area; But from what I have seen, in this cultural context, both of these public tools have been used as tool tools for the terrible tragedies; And Humor is used as the "Divine Recovery" for men and women, who choose the path of faith instead of the way of despair or disrespect. See "Fayedar Roof" for Humor in both ways in this rich heritage. <br /> <br /> Elise Wood (Jonathan) Wood Horn Remembered Wear Glasses which really shows him, well, weird: Compare to Sina City. He wore the same type of glasses with cool effect. In this movie, it is easy to see that the glasses become a metaphor for their search and perception and its struggle between truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lessing (Old Ax) are really nice. Jonathan and Young Alex seem to be very different from the same generation, still very different; And then they find that they are not so different after all. And the process that evidently changes from the racist voice Jonathan gradually changes to Young Alex. The journey of invention invented for Jonathan has become one of both the inventions of both the New Works and the Old ... ... so much for me. <br /> < br /> There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from Prague and the distributors, the story line stands for Ukraine. All seem very authentic and seem to give a wonderful idea; Although I have never been to Ukraine and can rarely testify it from the earliest experience. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a light comedy, I would not recommend this film to everyone. On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delightful and deeply-running movie, please watch this great movie.
