It looks B grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this movie! But no! I do not expect anything in this movie, just some time to pass, but I was hooked from the beginning! Two attractive courtyards - a bank robbery has gone wrong, one million dollars is missing and two girls in the street started to start a new life - how will these two stories happen? When you think how the movie is managed, you know, it does 180 and you blow it off with a great twist in the plot! It has a great but unexpected ending, and you want to do more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
