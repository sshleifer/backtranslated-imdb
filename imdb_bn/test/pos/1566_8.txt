Six of the seven positive people reacted while commenting on the film. A negative review (or did) live on the first page of movie location in IMDB. <br /> <br /> I found "Alice Foundation" one of the best movies to be almost never heard of that I have seen this year. This 6.4 rating can be a function of a problem that is far more confusing than the quality of the movie. Who will think that truck stop is a movie about a prostitution fraud prostitution? Again sin <br /> <br /> For me, "Alice" was a positive attentive psychological thriller. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It is a very believable story with a realistic script and is very well cast. In a beautiful world, actress Judith Ive won prizes to guess whether you were good or bad. Avoid rating <br /> <br /> and see this great movie. (And anyway, I had a soundtrack album.)
