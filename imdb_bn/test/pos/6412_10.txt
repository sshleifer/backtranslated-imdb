One of the movies I have ever seen, discusses abnormalities. It tarnishes in a light Taipei, where the rain is irregular; A DAMP world. It showed us the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. An event, or luck, links their existence, but they can not open another one with the sound. Characters Reflect the mirrors of our society about interpersonal relations. An abnormality is taken to extreme limits. All characters exchanged only a few words during the film, dialogue is almost absent, and when some words are said they are often weak and empty, far from describing the real feelings of the people. So, the progress of the story, the evolution of the character's feeling (intelligent idea!) Is visible by musical contraction, only apparently meaningless, the film touches. Emotional events and the progress of the drama of the female playwrights makes us a great finisher, very symbolic. A movie is completely different from the usual normal, a clever perception by a great talented director. Psyche Forgive me for my bad grammar !!
