Most of the industries have forgotten about how to make this movie: Family Entertainment, Money is something that is enjoyable to people of all ages. This special Wallace and Grootet can understand the references of adults who prefer their grandfather's color and intelligent rabbits who can be enjoyed by everyone of their adult. <br /> <br /> This picture has good aspects like any aspect, and I mean literally. It is also packed with little bit of humor, and to read all the signs and handbills in W & G's world, there are many interesting details in the background of each scene that I would like to buy it. <br /> <br /> I would like to see at least twice this movie in the theater, then buy it in DVD. You will see it too.
