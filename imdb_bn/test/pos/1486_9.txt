Because Mr. Bin does not talk about anything, I sincerely recommend using a DVD player that the teacher holds his finger on a break / play button. At the end of any age lesson, just give 5 minutes to pause and play the DVD, what are students "What's this?", "What will happen?", "What's going on?" Encouraging its answers to shout, "What's wrong?", Or any other question that sparks feedback from new vocabulary and grammar. <br /> <br /> Because everyone is watching TV, usually shy students become voices. Since the DVD can be started or stopped at any time, when the students are moving and reaching, weird "sometimes" is a perfect "filler". <br /> <br /> I tried another DVD, especially "Tom and Jerry" cartoon and Red Scalton DVD, but others were not as good as "Mr. Bin", which kept constant attention of the students.
