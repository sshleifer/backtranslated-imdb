"Out to the Sea" is a funny movie starring Jack Lemon and Walter Matthew. This image is not as funny as their "Gramps Old Man" comedy (which is very similar to it), but there are so many smiles here. Lemon and Matthew play together with some law-enforcing agencies. Once they get in the boat, Lemons are not known that they have signed their dances as host so they will not have to pay for the cruise. It does not destroy Lemons brutally. What's worse, Matthew does not even know how to dance. However, they go along with it and process it to fill some of their fellow passengers and crew members. The crew members are here: Cruise Director Gil Goudwin, "Star Trek: The Next Generation", played by veteran Brent Spinner, who works like an evil dictator. "Barney Miller" star is played by Lynnden and veteran filmmaker Donald O'Connor, two co-star dance hosts. The owner of the ship, Mrs. Carrter, played by "Golden Girl" Ruiy McClane. For the passengers: Vivian, the widow of Gloria de Heveen, who loves LeMon. Lease, played by my greatest actresses of all time, Diane Canon, who loves Matawei. Lease's mother, Mavis, acted in actress Elle Stich. And they meet with others as well. All these actors Lemon and Matauo see a pleasure as they play from them. Seeing canon here is very good, look beautiful as before; The currents are a hoot; Spinner is a funny comic villain who played it fierce straightforward; De Heaven is wonderful; Linden, O'Connor, and McClean have a good moment or two; And finally, the two major stars are as delicate as normal in Lemon and Maitre. A nice little gem in a comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (find four)
