During my review I told Veronica while leading a young actress as Katrina. I was involved in character and I guess I'm not related to names. However, she and the film are bright. As I said, the use of cinematography and director Montage is Eisenstein and his cameraman, Tis worthy. The production design is top notch. In the pioneer land, actors, middle grounds and backgrounds are worth studying in any given mise n scene. Stunning, memorable camera movement, and an end that leaves behind a mental punch which has a lot of Hollywood film. Ghee! Instead of sunny walking heroic self sacrifice Thanks again, John Hart
