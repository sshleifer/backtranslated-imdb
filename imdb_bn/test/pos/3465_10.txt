It's an incredible piece of drama and powerful that hits you. I saw the film was superb and in order to get involved with the disadvantages of the two main characters, both Michael and Rory were both represented in a great performance. Based on the real story, I think the story is trying to send a message to the audience that the common man should respect the needs of the disabled people and let them have the same opportunity as the other human. Completely this picture reached my soul and I felt touching out to send creators and manager creativity. The whole picture is that some actors take it out of their character and show part of the audience's credible character, but I think these two certainly have done a great deal of talent to portray the drama as a genius. Of course not to miss!
