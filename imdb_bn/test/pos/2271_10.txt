If anyone suspects about the talent of Leve Screebber, his new movie "Everything Is Gimmint" is a scene, which is clearly not one of the best actors in America, but a new director whose first attempt is really an inspiration and a harbinger to follow. Jonathan Shereb enjoyed a novel by Jonathan Saforon Foyer, who will live forever on the path of adapting the director material. The picture clearly exceeds our expectations, since we had no previous idea. <br /> <br /> For those who do not see this movie, you have to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. His love for his grandfather is unlimited. She looks as if her grandfather dies and her grandmother's death bed. At a clear moment, this dead woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for her collection. Long ago, seeing a picture, a young couple were seen together. Jonathan thinks that it brings grandfather and his girlfriend to a happy time, thinks. The snapshot looks like this intense young man seems to be inspired in Ukraine to find past his ancestors. <br /> <br /> Jonathan has arranged for a travel agency, heritage tour of Odessa for his travels. To Trochenbrod, the legendary place where his grandfather came from. The agency is managed by an elderly man, who claims to be blind and his grandson, Alex, is a man who holds his imagination, and loves pop American culture that holds its contemporaries. Alex speaks in a kind of English and does not interact or translate, sometimes joyful in our ears for the use of the English word for the benefit of Jonathan. The old man has forced his dog, Sammy Davis Jr. to force Jonathan's will, who does not want to sit beside the trip while traveling. <br /> <br /> In search of Trokenbrand, it is clear that his partner, especially the old man, has no source where he is going. At this point, the film has become a road movie because three characters around the country's back roads became more familiar with each other. Three sunflower fields eventually reach the house, indicating that they actually came to the right place. Some place is a clear reminder of past conflicts. <br /> <br /> An old woman living in isolated places is missing links to the story. She is possible to keep things in the right perspective. But here the story goes out loud with a loud knock down loudly. We watch these adult people start thinking about things themselves as we watch. Instead, how did we discover how Jonathan and his guides are always connected by changing the dynamics of the film? <br /> <br /> has expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story of some criticism on this page, after all, it has been a work of imagination and independence. It was impossible to create more movies and more in the book. A tricky way to tell the viewer what to show in a great way to share the film in different ways. <br /> <br /> Alien Wood, an outstanding film actor, did a great job of frustration. Mr. Wood is one of the best scenes of any film about the main character's interpretation. Eugene Hoot's fortunate casting seems to be an idea made in heaven as a Ukrainian tour assistant and translator Alex. About the best thing about Mr. Hughes film. The use of his protection in English gives the film an interesting angle which makes the viewer happy. Boris Lescin makes a vital contribution to the film as Alex's grandfather and tour driver, as well as Larisa Laut, who is seen in the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> The countryside of Czech Republic brings gorgeous to all the greatness. Paul Cantalan's musical score is in the background that it enjoys the film by adding film prosperity. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is the first victory for Lewy Skeb, which is the first time the director must go, whatever the next decision.
