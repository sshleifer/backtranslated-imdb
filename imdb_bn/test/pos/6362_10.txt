Not saying that I'm sitting in a lot to see "The Coach Trip". I had no idea what it was - I think it's going to be a journey in terms of sex when I played Chavie Chess Condom Man and the title of the film is "Siege Trip", * Wink, Wink. Then I realized that it was something with a mental institute and a patient escaping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, and in a way, it's a comedy - it's not the greatest mess, the plot is ridiculous, but you know? <br /> <br /> Dan Icured is a patient in a mental hospital who can not really be emotional or may not. He has given psychologist, Lawrence Bayward (David Klein), a lot of sorrow and sorrow, which we believe he is a prominent person after all. <br /> <br /> Mental Institute Riot Some cafeteria, Barnes is waiting for tongue-quarrels in his office while the phone rings. Barnes likes it, says Bayed, and finds another line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Română) wants to have a radio collapse called Dr. Bayard George Maitlin (Charles Gradin), who wants his wife Vera (Mary Gross) You're having a vacation with this. Michaels wants Bayard so bad that even he gave a plane ticket. <br /> <br /> Barnes escaped from the institute with the help of the receptionist and went to OHR. He said Baird got a ticket, got on the plane, and finally stood in the wind like a wind. His show is a tremendous success. "People love him!" A man is saying, and another person answers, "Because he actually thinks about them." <br /> <br /> Donald Baker (late, great Walter Manu) is a former psychiatric patient who For the sake of keeping him quiet, Barnes was unemployed, with a percentage of his income unemployed, and kept him secret. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mattlin and his wife are in an argument He went home to finish his holiday and realized that in his speech people are not really after Dr. Bayard, but no one believes in him. He has received the true Dr. Baird, but unfortunately he has lost his ID, so the police as their nutritionist It does not accept and listen to their stories. <br /> <br /> <br /> When you saw this film, it looked like Burns Dr. Bayard Iye, but he did not ask for ID, even when it comes to claiming his plane ticket (he was robbed, but he was sure that he was still bayarda). Barnes is so great, how was the original Chicago. Bayard people did not talk about him? Word travel And finally, why would police ever arrest Mattlin and Bayard (the actual Bayard) without following their story? <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could not be less careful. I stopped this movie and it surprised me - I really liked it. It's my entertainment His ideas are mostly ridiculous and not all realistic, but Dan Icodd has a real-hearted performance as a half-a-lun, which creates a trip to "The Coach Trip". <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 They <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
