This jewel has proven the first life of the 80's. '83 boys as a grade <br /> <br /> myself, I must say that Valley Girl (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters are correct representatives of the era; <br /> <br /> The name of the Vipid mall, the pseudo punk rebel, the Propy Jokes all <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Before the soundtrack's existence, I searched for the records <br /> <br /> and tapes (it was only after 80!) JC Cotton, Sparks, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> This movie is worth the honor, it's not just a good 80's juvenile flick, it's a great movie.
