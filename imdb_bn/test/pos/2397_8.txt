I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to accomplish on top of his overall influence on me. I say this because I know this independent movie was limited to budget / organization, but despite this, it came as a strong and orderly operation. <br /> <br /> There are many relatively unknown actors I can not help but believe that in the next few years there will be a big noise in the industry, Eddie Monroe has failed to keep my interest and my emotional meter dancing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Someone told me that Paul Regina has recently passed, and if it is true, it is a true tragedy . Because his physical performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Kudo with Fred Carpenter, who really won the winner. !
