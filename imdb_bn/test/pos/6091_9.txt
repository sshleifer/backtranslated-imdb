Can read as many reviews here as it is a movie of love or hate you - apparently there is not so much space for opinions within. I think that's a good sign for one. <br /> <br /> I have always appreciated this movie, although this is not my standard style (I have never seen Titanic and are not planning) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It shows that people can be different when they are in a foreign environment like 'home' (cathrine), it shows how slow, strong and totally painful can be devastating love, it is extremely sensual, going back One (e) pain, how stupid someone can move. <br /> <br /> Photography is just stunning, not to mention the play of the actors. Slow, but timely, and judging books, timeline, and depth / development of characters. It should be kept in 110 minutes (as some seem to be proposed here). People are having trouble with the speed of the movie ... so they get to work. Oh - get a life! ;-) Enjoy ... <br /> <br /> I give this image 4.5 out of 5.
