Overall, I saw this movie better: exceptional scenes with rare scenes (some essentials, some vain) and weak second half. The film is divided into 2 parts, holding spokes. I thought Pianist's first half was horrific. We meet Irika Kohat (Wonderful Isabella Huppert), a piano teacher, and get acquainted with his world. He struggled to find his place against single mother, a defensive and borderline deadly mother. We understand that he has lost much less love or less experience as a physical + psychological chemistry: He protects himself from being sharp and obnoxious for people, expressing his sexual tension in sex shops, as a watcher, or misinterpreting evil . The first half is very clinical and produces incredible excitement in the film, almost helpless. <br /> <br /> Then Walter, a young, handsome and outgoing person (Benoitte Majimel's great acting) comes. Although initially he felt the coldness of Eric, he threw him away and gradually broke the Erik's fort. She needs him to deeply love him but to fulfill his wicked desire. Then when he is going to read for him, he hates his world, and ultimately we discover that Erica can not love or feel (especially, that Walter is considered impossible by someone who seems impossible). The second half of this photo, very sensitive as we see, Irrich's incompetence / inexperience leads him to love. The second half felt less skilled, and sometimes great (i.e. very frustrating) scenes that dramatically reduced the drama. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is at least a crude movie in the French version. : You see pornographic sequences from sex shops, brave mutilation and sexual scenes. Many conversations between Maggiel and Huppert were great, I think and understand the sick relationships of Eric's love. As an actor, Hupperts are fantastic through this movie, Maggel gets better and is good till fullness, and Girdot (Mom) is excellent. <br /> <br />
