Last night I saw this picture for the first time. I have been thinking about it all night and this morning. I can not say that this is my favorite film, at least not yet. I will see it again. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is stunning. Each shot has a lyrical word that will be expected in a movie associated with the name of Weepders. <br /> <br /> This is always tempting to see De Chirico in any of the pictures of the disappeared orders in despair, but in this case the analogy fits. In many ways Malkovich Fayyar's fog and the wind-through-the-air image spreads the shadow of the closed-canvas statue, which halted the main work of Italian-Greek painter Milan. He is a little annoying, who influences the whole story of a person who watches and his ability as a film director. <br /> <br /> Dedicated Wonders fans can not help, but Daniel and Kassiel revolve around Berlin's streets thinking of little, but seeing all without having to contact residents directly. And, following Himel Uber Berlin metaphor, the angels (or Malkovic director in this case) can communicate together with the stories. <br /> <br /> At this point, I should take this line of criticism very far. I will watch the movie again. I'm pretty sure that this thread will bring together Malkovich. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his songs and portions are violent, empty conversations that sound good, but can not be padded in real contact. Maybe it's a whole point. Anyone can confirm this degree with certainty or authority until the end of his homework. <br /> <br /> We must be careful while throwing the word "alarming". Intellectualism is easy to write anything, but it creates a horrific psychological condition, in which only one conversation is seen as genuine, original, or pure, the most inactive. When we meet philosophy, God, existence, money and all the brain candy discussions, we establish our culture for a slow, stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antononii are giving us. This is not the only movie theme, but I think it can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> Another (and most obvious) bitmap satisfaction. There are so many things, and a thorough review of all subtleties and consequences of this leitmotif's development will exceed 1000 words for this review well. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch the film. But I give a warning: This is not an autonomous movie (at least I do not think so). Some pictures interact with intellectual and artistic thinking of their time so much that the audience must have a background of Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-Dela les nuages ​​is one of those films.
