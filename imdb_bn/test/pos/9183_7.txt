That's the trailer I saw and promised by which I hired to rent. Correctly, a serious filmmaker will not expect much from this title, but surprisingly enough, Smith, Mendes, James and Wallet have reached a theater's performance, which can transform their rap dance-floor routine metaphorically at the end of the film. : Their characters have formed an effective combo that can prove to be better than this Sunday afternoon on DVD, your date is not the French-Sweden-director-director of the 60-year film fan. > PS: The score technique is all true, especially the "cocktail girl" routine!
