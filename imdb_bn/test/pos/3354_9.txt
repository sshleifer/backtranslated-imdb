For the first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland? An x rating rating musical comedy", along with some friends in front of '80 at the movie-theater of NY City. I think we actually enjoyed it a lot, though we were wondering why all the "goodies" shaped colored patches were covered in different forms and why this movie suddenly moves from one scene to the next, which guides us ... do we just miss Have done It was obviously a soft-core version, which kept me interested to see it again, but its original integral version Well, I went for more than 20 years, in the meantime I forgot about this movie and just a few days ago, with very little scope, I used a heavy VHS copy (which saw good times: scratchy sounds and a few errors), but guess What? It's the original original version and this time, I really had a ball! Humor, musical instruments, and porn can make a weird combination but, in this case it really works and nowadays, most of the annoying porn flickr attackers on our screen, it is impossible and entertaining sexual fantasies, which will not disappoint you. The cute, instant editing of the movie flies to the movie like a bird, all known characters are preferred or simply funny, all actors seem to have a good time, the songs are interesting (this is the "rising" Alice at the beginning of this movie and "Sunny" How do you like a beautiful girl like this Night is doing "), dance numbers are good dances and stage (surprising energetic terry shows that they" dance " Desperately frustrated him ... Do not worry, he works well for what he has done ...), acting, singer, set, costume quality level and then ... Kristine has "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in his career First acting role and (son of oh!) He really has a few HC sequences! Personally I think they are not very annoying, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and quite excited. He is young and (oh!) Very nice; With the help of her new friends in Wonderland, she invented her body and her sex, so she sings, she dances and ... what do you expect? She is sexually examined! The sequence of closing, when he finally loves his boyfriend, is very well-photographed and directed and highlighted in the film. I think his "physical du roles" (innocent blue eyes and impressive laughs) and his acting ability, those obvious sequences are then acceptable and actually extremely enjoyable. There's a lot of sex going on (this) Wanderers and everyone is interested in getting "busy" with the first available boy (s) or girl (s), which means that a lot of hard work can be seen. On the other hand, some close-up shots, definitely "spliced", just make "porn-horn" really happy, a little scarce for my personal taste. In general, though, sex-restraints are not objectionable for being operated with a lot of humor and it is almost united with music, dance and comedy. If you think you and your partner can manage graphic sex, then watch it together. Talk to me, you have a good time of one and a half hours (perhaps even after an extra show ...) Be careful that this "adult entertainment" video does not leave the video almost or in other kids. If your 10-year-old man puts his hand on it, he can ridicule himself, but why would you be forced to make an embarrassing explanation about how this "Elise" louis carol novel behaves differently from Red or Disney? I bet, you do not forget this "one kind" soon. It's a shame that they do not create it anymore! I give it 9 out of 10
