"The Planet" is an amazing part of the making of the film. Steatron production for only 8000 pounds has long been one of the most real science-films. <br /> <br /> The physically horrific Mike Mitchell is acting, the film is a mix of special effects, powerful stories and good planning. From the opening spacecraft, to the end of pounding, everything about this movie is displayed on its budget. <br /> <br /> To start with special effects, the "Revenge of the Seed" level, if not above, is the choice of Babylon 5 and Farscape. And for a snippet of a price. The details and the movement are fantastic, and captures imagination from the close. Anything else, design of ship, weapon, entity A real wonder for a movie of this budget involving imagination and creativity. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the power of the story, and its pressure. There are some twists and launches, which are written well in most scripts, wonderful and well-played out. I was surprised, I made 15 years ago and the first two years of imagination, some aspects of the story are relevant to today's society. With the event around the world, there may be some definite resonance with the length of time the tenants are forced to live. <br /> <br /> Even the effects of sound as atmospheric music are spot-on. Add more to the appearance of professional use of light and costume. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen shows a lonely and lonely position. <br /> <br /> In all the facts, this film shows 10, if not 100, budget expense times, and that is a creative, hard working group of people, to the director, to cast, influence through the producers and the word team. Wonderful effort, I suggest you get a copy of your hand copy
