All right, this was not the biggest horror film in my life. Despite the low budget, though it is a beautiful movie. The monsters are unique and trustworthy. Hack, they are scary in the scene where they harm their harm to the poor family. Although, you will finally see the monsters fully, you really "WTF!" The only part that really bothered me was that when it was thrown * they killed it! Kitti no, Noah, why? Although seriously, if you look for hardcore violence and gore, this is not a movie for you. Go to the mountains to rent or have something along those lines. If you have a small child, I do not recommend watching it with them; Probably will give their nightmare about trolls in their room.
