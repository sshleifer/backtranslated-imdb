I did not know what to expect and did not go into a screening of "SISTER HELEN" at the Sundance Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was riveted by the people of this documentary. Helen is an incredible character !!! The filmmakers took over the helen of Helen's amazing soul and took me to an unknown world. I was totally satisfied with the journey and completely watched the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
