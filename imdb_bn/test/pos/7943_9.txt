At the school I was taught how some shots are spoken and two directors have been mentioned constantly: Osson Wells and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I did not take too much care (I was a child!) But now I know why Eijenstein was a genius and it was shameful to see what was possible in 1938, where we were stuck for more than half a century, and countless empty movies! Some people say the film is not genius in Eisenstein's genius (after which they can not say anything bad until after watching it) or worse that it's some preacher for Russians. Let it be said, it is actually pure propaganda for patriotism but not "personal judgment" or "longest day" is not it? Where America is heading to the top, I can take a lot of pictures, why not Russia, and apart from each war, the fight for patriots why they will raise the flag? Alexander Nevsky is often required for anyone to care about cinematography as a glorious picture of every shot. Perhaps it's all the surveillance but I'm wondering why it is not included in the top 250 of IMDB, where it has a lot of Oscars.
