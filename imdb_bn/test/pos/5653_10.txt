"Noble" or "Fire on the Plain" is a film that is so nice on many levels, it is not enough to say anything about it. My only regret is that I did not see this 1959 film as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Some of the film's purists, I want to watch films for dialogue, acting, photography and even their artistic competence based on them. Finally, I want to know whether the film is "truthful" or the person who wants to think about what I want to think about the situation of the people, think of me without torturing me. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie because it is a portrait of a photographer filled with realistic human response to the death of a great historical catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Ichikwa's film condemns war at all levels - since there should be no good war film. War is horrific, bloody, destructive. It is a killer on emotional. However, the undemocratic appearance of Japan's soldiers about the basic thing about "fire on the soldiers" It gradually shows them gradually the weight of America's higher energy and the inability of the war to build their nation. A fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is in the heart of this madness. <br /> <br /> I finally saw the bitter fruit of Japan's military corruption after 14 years, so honestly and brutally I saw the Japanese as the "Great Pacific War". Ichikwaya addresses the German "life of war", which reveals the plight of the common soldier. <br /> <br /> The picture of the Ichikwaz is interesting, as it is still working hard with its wartime religious fanaticism, control of the victorious people, its war against China and war crimes, which is not only against soldiers and officials but against the prisoners with the practice of practice Do it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Strong representation of the torture of soldiers by the combination of bad political decisions and cultural pressure in Ichikwa. <br /> <br /> This hard work illustrates skillful soldiers who appear at different times, at different times, fear, brilliant humorous humor, conflict-rich dialogue, and a plot whose complexity is fierce, lying in the desert setting. <br /> <br /> An impressive and painful tapestry of defeated men in portrait of Ichikwu. Tigakulara Tamura is a good soldier who is unable to relinquish his humanity, although he is frightened and lost like his colleagues, starring as a hungry and gentle soul by Eji Fonakoshi. Before he goes to the hospital, he will refuse to be very healthy, Tamura will be given a grenade in the hands of a senior man, who recognizes the frustration of their condition, recommends you kill yourself. <br /> <br /> Why is Tamurra helpless? Not provided surrender orders to the supplied and militaryly disabled units at the beginning of the film. Itchawa makes it clear that the war is over and everyone is just waiting to die. When Tamura leaves his unit in search of hope of physical and spiritual salvation, he undoubtedly digs his colleagues for the air raids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By doing so, they drag themselves from the Almighty forces. You know that they will not survive. Itchiwawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than the defeated army is that it has lost her honor by abandoning humanity and her colleagues. Suddenly, we face greatness, death, and dryness through the jungle of Leight. Cancellations can come back behind her ugly head because Americans can eat each other instead of surrender "jackfruit beef". <br /> When people talk about surrender, how their campaign will be propagated by killing American prisoners, an intelligent soldier who reveals that feeding and caring for the impoverished Americans of the war criminals because they respected Japan for their respect to brave soldiers. <br /> <br /> It is the Japanese who want to die in the fight, the emperor lost all the money after a long resistance. Those who want to fight with death will die. This is the calculation of war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its death is a lonely picture. Ichikwa was trying to talk about the internal conflict of our common soldier, who wants to be alive, but who is trapped by his country's suicide code? <br /> <br /> If someone looks at this picture carefully then he will see that the enemy of futurism and fanatism. America has been portrayed as a technologically advanced technology that is willing to use technology as an inexpensive military force - a lesson that has transformed the Japanese poster society. Ichikawa's film is not so shallow that it refers to America. Ichikawa indicates the harmful layers of Japan's destructive policies that create war, and then it can continue if lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ichikwaya does not mention nuclear weapons in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He does not have to The slow pace of the Japanese imperialist Japanese army exposes the seeds of insurgency in Japan.
