There are warnings, spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian sleaze films I've seen. <br /> <br /> This plot is a teenage girl who is interested in occultism and has a supernatural power, her mother is a member of Satan's family and how much she is afraid of her influence on the girl. No need to worry, the girl knows what to do and there is no return, she belongs to the devil. <br /> <br /> During the film, strange things happen in the simple Italian way, there is not much logic, but this is the only good thing. It's amazing how much these movies are entertaining. In the final battle, we and his mother see each other fighting together (nude course) and doing some mysterious shows, you can guess who won ... the final photos of the movie keep your mouth open and Why terrible why not take more pictures? <br /> <br /> With great music, full movies and actors are good, such films are better than usual. Especially Anne Hyugde shows up and works well. It contains some unusual camera gles and stuff like that, so not all are annoying. My rating 10. <br /> <br /> Hope someone is released on this DVD.
