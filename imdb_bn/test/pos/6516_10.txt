I have seen this movie a long time ago, but I always liked it. The story is about a young girl Sally O'Mayen, who finds out at a young age when she is praying to Saint Anne, her prayers are answered, so the luncheon luncheon and an average neighbor who falls on her and she prays, anyone For tattling, give him a black eye. Well, one minute later someone hit him and he had a black eye. Sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good. He is well-known and loved around the neighborhood because he has a copy book / journal with the request of all his friends. St. Anne Meanwhile, a local boy came back from college (I believe) and Sally awestruck at how much she raised up. Sally has a huge crash on her, but so shy. Would he use the strength to pray for St. Annie's selfish desires, or will the most popular girls in school try to trap their dreams? This is a great movie, which is great and Irish, the hilarious annoying and sworn Irish neighbor - the enemy who touches with grand pop on a daily basis. O'Mayance wanted to buy his property, his own story, a small house in between two huge apartment complexes, in other words, O'Monens House is upset for his lovely buildings <br /> <br /> This movie must be a watch Enough and rare enough to add value and your movie collection. I hope you enjoy!
