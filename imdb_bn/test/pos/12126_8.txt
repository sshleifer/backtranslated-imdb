A very surprisingly underlying movie. Very realistic And authentic. With great dialogue Being Italian, I can definitely relate to the circumstances and phrases used. I thought Joe Cortese was great. As a crazy crowd cowboy kind, and Pesci and Vincent were great. I liked actor Criscuolo who played the boss. She was very pure. I think director Ralph DeVito was going to great things, but it was too early because maybe he knew a lot. I think it was very good. It deserves more airplay and recognition. It was a sleeper movie. Great very good. It was really good authentication. It is working well.
