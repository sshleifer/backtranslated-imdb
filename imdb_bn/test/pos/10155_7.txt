This is not one of my favorite hitcos movies, although I acknowledge it is still quite good. Among the things I really like, was the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improved the middle part) and the presence of incredibly scary finder killer (who looked like a skeleton with a thin layer of skin spread on it). Although it spent a lot of money in the studio, I did not take care of this movie especially for Darius's Day - he saw a lot of crying like "Queer" as a wholeback. Yes, I know that he can sing like this, but this forever hates this song for me. Sorry <br /> <br /> Another complaint, though I was a kid, was that my movie was "very polished" and "Hollywood-esque". The original version (complete with hitcoaks) seems to be just great and salty - and it has been added to alarming environments.
