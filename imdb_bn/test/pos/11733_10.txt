Jazz soundtrack looks like Clint Eastwood's movie. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the whole thing has beat me like a quilt. The story is good and the film is full of a linear, which I am carrying with me today. (Bad guy's Reynolds: I'm going to pull you over the chain because you're in my town, and you want to know the worst part? You're from the outside!) <br /> <br /> Highlight: Technician 1500B Relay to Reid is for Audiefs Excellent set dressing! <br /> <br /> Charles Darning is having sex relations prostitution tapes with uneven foaming. (You must see it, believe me, it is ridiculous.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What a great! (Where can she go?) <br /> <br /> Doc Severinsen and tonight, the show band is back to normal as they play back. (Joe William's guest guest. Manhattan Transfer "Route 66" has been re-recorded.) The soundtrack gives class to the whole point. <br /> <br /> Do I say more? This can be the best movie of Reynolds ever. <br /> <br /> (Yes, she plays herself naturally, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
