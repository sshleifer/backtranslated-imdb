In Lucino Vicente's film Death in Venice, not only the beauty of the surrounding world, but also in search of beauty, Gustav von Aschench falls into a man's only shell. For understanding the erosion, we must admit that the beauty that encourages us, it is best described, and quoted in a quote from Socrates found in Thomas Mann's version of the death of Venice: "The only beauty, together with beautiful and visible, is the only spiritual aspect that is We understand through our senses, otherwise what? If divine, if zuki If we talk with us through quality and true sense, will we not be lost and hungry by love? In this film we can see, become taller for beauty, which becomes an intense interest for the boy, even though the level of his mind He tells him that the beauty of beauty can be insomnia and abandoned, he can not keep himself. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful film. Nana will be easy, initially, we saw Hereafter excellence, and upper-class life in the twenty-first century has been treated with a perfect sanksiptikaranera, films by the artist pasakyalino de santisera the film has been caught. But Wisconsin is not busy with the safety aspects of Venice. Instead, the glorious and impressive artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these issues are directed towards the past. The city we know as a unique beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a restless hotelier with leisure entertainment. Hateful jewelry and rolling fills in the streets have become impressive, and the city steps up step by step with a drama. Only through flashbacks, we allow this famous musician a weak and innocent person why a glimpse. With the failure of his daughter, and perhaps his wife, his music failure, we can understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Asencheck has a deep conversation with the meaning of beauty and who can create it; But Alfred is much more than a friend, he is a changed arrogant, and Alfred says that the musician expresses his own doubts and fears. Aschenbach decides to leave Venice in the scene immediately following a clip of Alfred saying that he lacks weak, isolated and lack of feeling. Ultimately, we can be able to decide whether these flashbacks are not actually realities. This is the loss of memory instead of past material rendering, these flashbacks have become distorted memories. We can say that these damaged memories are related to even the relation between them, he declared, "reality distorted us and diminished us;" And following the scene in the Travel Agent's office, we see that Chechen tackled Tazizio and her family and warned them - leave Venice, but after facing face, we saw him sitting with Clerk again and realized that in his imagination, he worked for a long time. Scenery without dialogue caused by Gustav Maheller's ruthless music We can go into the minds of visitors when we look at Ashenbek's life and respect for the beauty around him. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The broken city established the stage for attracting medieval people to the Tadijo, which can not even imagine such a romantic desire and ambivalent romantic desire. The beauty of this Polish boy burns him, firstly, makes him shine, then he eats it. Seeing a film with Von Acebacchak on a sea beach chair, while watching Tadijo with his friend, we can see a black-colored hug from his hair and it seems like it's a harmful blood, this is one of the expiration of his life. Before his last breath The final damage has occurred, the city around it has become dirty, and what he hates with it has become. Aschenbach died, he was disturbed by a man that was the face of the same paint as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film. It was the beauty of pursuit of artistic beauty, in order to find artistic beauty, he could not understand his own death and the city around him; His consciousness involved, kept in check by the presence of continuous death and erosion. Together with Venice, beauty, death, and loss, these themes are related to obstacles and deaths, these themes are the beauty of Wisconi's art and beauty. <br /> <br /> <br /> In this picture we are treating a great man with brutality. We look forward to finding the true and pure beauty of musician Gustav Von Assencheck, and in pursuit of this feature, it wanders around him and leads him to unconditional, lonely death for his affection. I believe that through these movies, Visconti is trying to tell us that it can not be beautiful. The cyclone is inherent in the world around us, and when we get distracted, it can destroy glory. At the death of Venice, it was removed due to the culture and the beauty of beauty. During beautiful and destructive times, Wishkanti's works are bred with bricks and bellows, these themes define their artwork.
