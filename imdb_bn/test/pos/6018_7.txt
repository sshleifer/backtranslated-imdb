"Gypsy" is probably the greatest musical written ever, so it is very bad that its movie version is frustrating. To create for him, we have been rebuilt, if not faultless, it is an enjoyable and well-composed music. The script is completely accurate, includes all songs, and the staging core remains close to Jeremy Robins' staging. Bate Middle Rose, a thief choice for his song and personality Marman-Esquiera and his performance is excellent. Peter Rigert is a great singer, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibbs is a straight forward, natural Louise. In fact, a live tapping with a 1989 Ten Deli resonance can be a good idea, because the "Gypsy" is more exciting on the stage, but this film is a fine translation of a great musical instrument.
