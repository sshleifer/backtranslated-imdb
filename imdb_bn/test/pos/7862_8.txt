Eventually I took years to catch this gem of a film and it was worth the wait. Almost all his movies Clint always plays the hero. It's a hero, anti-hero or an upcoming protagonist. He is a pure villain in this film and he played it well. <br /> <br /> As a wounded union soldier, he was brought to a confederate girls school for students and teachers for the healing of patients. After she started seducing women after their age and some were young. He plays on their jealousy and pits against each other. Finally, you are not so happy to see Clint's terrible death. <br /> <br /> This image creates such a gem. You did not create any other movie like Clint and you had your desire after watching this movie. He played the villain role, so he will surprise you why he did not make any such movie. It explains why the film is not often seen. Most people do not want to see Clinta as fame and this picture is soon released to Derry Harry, it has become a hidden gem. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. You do not like what you see but you will not forget it.
