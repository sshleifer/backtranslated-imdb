I was lucky enough to see this picture in a festival last year and half expected it to be released. It has been shot in a digital camcorder, it certainly has hindered its success, but I realized that it was not the intention of the filmmaker that it looked like the first film, it was more about stories and their stories. Relationship Is not it supposed to be a movie? But there is a quality in the texture of its visual face, which suggests that Thomas can give some attention which we have to pay attention to. For the sake of independent filmmakers and producers who have talent and lack of money and drive, I learned a lot about this film, technically going everything for it, lighting, music, etc. I have never seen any other digital feature film and so it is very appreciable. Actor Performance is a point worthy, if not played a little bit, I felt much more depth, especially from male lead John Paul Clark. But one thing that really bothers me as a filmmaker, is it necessary to cover a lot of sins compared to the color of black and white? Do we have to learn more in the progress of digital technology? Or the future of making this amazing, affordable movie?
