I caught the first screening of driving lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Green shows that he can work before Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as emotional mother. Julie Walters is a delightful as Dame IV Walton with a bad face than a sailor. I hope that this movie is selected by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This image is not just about driving lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) wants to follow the father of his sympathetic mother and visa and save his life. This is an amazing movie, which is an amazing director who took his own life and kept everyone on the screen to see, and everyone should do it.
