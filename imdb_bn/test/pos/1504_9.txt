This is an interesting movie. I think it's ridiculous, though humor is too dark. Phulchi is good and funny, it's an artist's really fun and real crazy "self-portrait" ("I create scary movies. If I make love movies, no one can buy a ticket ..."). And it's really SEXY movie: Almost all the "action" or excitement is going on; And many sexy girls / women ... maybe why it is the first one to start a movie / industry goes to the root ... it's a real cycling trip, maybe a little drunk or a little bit of the state of mind. Of course, there are some really nasty grape scenes, of course, because it's Lucio Fulci. Some scenes as events are quite annoying. However, it was one of the three best and most complete flute films I saw (others did not see the House of the Cemetery and Zombi.Beyond). Indeed, the script is officially, my opinion is quite impressive. You can see this movie as a portrait of the ultimate neurotic, or a person suffering from outside compulsive disorder (fashionable words): there is a compulsory requirement to recognize the character of "crime" or bad thoughts; Especially in the crime he did not even complete. And he himself asked all the time: if I did it? I want to do this? Did i do it I want to do it She overreacts and exaggerates her thoughts. I'm sure Fulci has been interested in psychology, and may even read some of the areas; His "House of the Cemetery" -Movie has a character named Fredstein, for example. This is probably the most frequent and straight personal movie Fulci did. I like the simplicity of photography / pictures in this picture. The only thing that bothers me a little bit, especially grief over women. I do not understand why? Is it entertainment? Is it art Is it horrible? Anyway and overall, these really interesting and well-made movies, definitely suggest the classic film for the least approaches or anyone interested in this genre. It may be too much for others.
