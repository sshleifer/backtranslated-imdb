Virtual reality is a sucker search, though it is still not clear how much the manager meant to himself. This movie deliberately takes you through different layers of artificial reality, which is leaving you only a delicate formula about any level of virtual reality, which creates an anterior confusion to consider the viewer's views. <br /> <br /> can also be seen as a mockery of video games - although the whole movie may fall on the form of this form here. It seems that the video does not escape the trend of the game which imitates it; The ridicule became problematic in this way. <br /> <br /> Although there are several interesting ideas across the crystal: Biological mutant one; Technological and biological interfaces, the desire to overcome the reality of the cyborg - and the ideas of existing existence such as Hydegorg like the title - such as, the new characters are partly scripted or scheduled and partly free to change their fate, and they think of the game as a strange wonder. A character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life, thereby reducing the difference between virtual and real. Likewise, you have to travel around the world to explore unexpected topics where you do not know what will happen next and how you can play, because you are only going to find the target and unknown rules. In the game is a virtual game titled "TranscendenZ". It also criticizes how virtual violence enables us to feel the impact of real violence. Even at each level of autographic existence, the hero feels confused about their own violence. They do not like it, but it's the thriller and part of "play", which they are afraid of. <br /> <br /> The creator of the game is ultimately killed; Yet the video game that we saw in this scene is running parallel - and viewers believe that it is still part of the virtual reality. In the end, the film does not solve the doubt about whether the film is "real", but the matter is clear (whatever it is to me). Existenz means Da-Sein: You're there. You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries of each level. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates the reality. And its common game motifs are like strangled royal streets, expressing their own attraction with violence. Still, Craniberg claimed this philosophical diffusion in an interview about this movie, he claimed that he was very much against the film "Reality ... [underground group underground name]" and the actual 'level' Both images are illustrated. It seems that Krenberg himself did not think so much in this film, although his impressive education came. Syst's interview has given the impression of middle-class intellectuals, who are trying to become ant-guard by the trend. Cronenberg is next to simple imagination - the modernist credo of the Clich√©d bourgeoisie - despite the acknowledged ambivalence there. (Here my impression may be due to a limited interview.) However, Craniberg believes that his film believes in the absence of an imitative form (here imitates computer games during a satirical criticism, but a criticism that is "unable to pass on the same form") is probably Because he actually thinks that it is "fantastic" and fundamentalist. Yet the fantasy world of the film is less bearable than our short-lived world, and more jejune. It is trapped in the computer game worldview.
