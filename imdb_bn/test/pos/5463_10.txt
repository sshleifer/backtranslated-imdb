As a former TV editor, I can say it as authentic as it gets as. It even led to Letterman's producer (considered as a source) resignation (finally) in real life. Letterman was angry (okay, so a stupid thing has thrown him soft tails at Tire Swing in his estate) but he made the real truth about Litarman's shameless rebel wars after deciding to leave NBC to the original information Lillar. The problem of an agent that was not ready for a big time, but he let the show (almost a disastrous departure) out of his famous loyalty. See if you can not understand why this idea of ​​Letterman is jealous today, then see this tape.
