This was Charlie Chaplin's first debut film. Yes, there were some words and conversations in his latest film, Modern Times, but it was still a silent film. So, until 1940, Chaplin did not hear the public speak to the public. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly popular and has a lovely reputation. Although I enjoyed this movie, I was not nearly as impressed by the mid-20s and other full-length films like Chaplin. Especially when he was delivering his lecture, he played Adinod Hindkel when I was bored to see some of Chaplin's dopie over-executive. The silly pseudo-dialogue seemed to be something that was used in less comedians (such as three stages). Plus, it's hard for me to play funny Hitler. However, when Chaplin played a Jewish sailor, he was not particularly funny (he did not really want to be funny characters) he had an extraordinary voice for reason and modesty. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it is not really Excel), but for its excellent acting and humanity. The final lecture by Brar (Hinckel Incognito) is bright and tears around my eyes. See this film alone due to this.
