Although I'm not a golf fan, I was present in a sneak preview of this movie and I liked it very much. Due to historical settings, differences in Blantant class, and good on both side of the divider line, the whole attracts my attention. The actors and their characterization were all mesmerizing. And I was at the edge of my seat during the golf segment, which was dramatic and exciting but was not easy to follow. At the end of this movie, "Sebiscus" reminds, though "the best game of all time of all time" is less complicated than the film. In both cases, my interest in events that really happened in the event is deep.
