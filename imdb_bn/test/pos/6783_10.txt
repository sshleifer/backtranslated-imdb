This game is one of the best horror / shooter games I have ever played. The plot is a bit sticky, but the game fails to send you lots of cold and tension. Many people enjoy this game when they find that there is no duplicate code for it and very few health drinks and verandahs are available. But in reality, once you leave the game once, you become more familiar with monsters and different rooms, so that you can easily get it for the second time. Puzzle is great, not very difficult, not very easy. There are tons of different monsters so you do not get bored. And there are plenty of gaming areas. You really feel as you play as a good Stephen King novel. It's nice and awesome. Choose this game cheap and have some fun.
