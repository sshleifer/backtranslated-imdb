I read other comments here about this movie before watching it. If you read them, you know that they are almost all negative. I do not really understand I admit that it is too long (it needs to be cut approximately one and a half hours to spend at a bit speed). Music is often inappropriate. However, Ford and Thomas's strong performance are enough to carry this. With all his fame as a movie star, I have forgotten that Harrison Ford really can work! This role as a person who defines himself as a liar is a wonderful one. I think it is totally credible that he wants to get what he wants so he can see what was true and what was the deception. Thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. Its initial denial that leads to confusion and then awakens in internal peace. This movie is not going to be a list of big flickers at times, but it's not bad. I'm glad I waited for it to watch in the video, but it's worth $ 3 or $ 4.
