In April 1947, New York City faced an epidemic crisis. A cargo importer from Mexico, Eug√®ne Lauber, came to the city, brought him a fatal white virus. He complained of fever and headache, stopped a bus, and soon died in a Midtown hospital, but before he was infected by a dozen passers. The damage has already been completed; For the first time in decades, Chicago has sunk in New York City. The city's health authority has worked rapidly to isolate victims and to hold viruses, more than 60 million New York defense against the roots in order to run free fisheries campaigns. Thanks to their rapid response, the virus was least involved with casualties. The outbreak has left an inevitable mark, after several years, it followed two similar theme-film Neir Thriller, where the doctor must track a single infectious career in millions of cities: Alia Kazan's Panic in the Riots (1950) and Earl McAvid's low budget 'The Killer That Stocked New York (1950). '<br /> <br /> The movie of McAvoy is released in an inconsistent Doku-drama style. It seems as if the report of Reid Haddley was knocked off directly from the newspaper, as the information went to official police transcript reading. This technique sometimes seems a little cheap, but fortunately the description is limited to the movie bookend, as well as some explanatory fillers during the break of the plot. New York "murderer" is not a molten importer from Mexico in this story, but the beautiful diamond smuggler Rock Bennet (Evelyn Kiss), who came from Cuba. Within a few days, Sheela follows her two parties independently: A Treasury agent (Barry Kelly) is arrested for the smuggling of criminals and a group of doctors (led by William Bishop), who has identified her as the source of the origin of the root outbreak. As 'Panic in the Streets', routine manhunt is given higher knowledge of urgency, especially if those who generally try their suspects have no idea as identity or appearance. <br /> <br /> The occupying killers of New York 'are mostly driven to expel their low production budget. As well as several lines of dialogue ("We have to stop it!" Dr Wood is making such a difficult decision at one stage), filmmakers and cast members allow this story to be revealed in realistic, flexible fashion. . Indeed, in this case, the low budget probably helps the film's objectives, which is a documentary style requirement that connects with the outbreak of contact with the outbreak. Evelyn Kies is a remarkable resemblance to the outstanding role of leading roles; At the end of the film, she has been so disrespectfully due to her illness that her face is almost painful to watch. In addition to the virus, Charles Korvin is the main villain of Tile, as the greedy and ruthless husband of the rock, who is resting, everything is coming to him. And if all the nurses looked like a dorothy mallon, probably did not seem like bad breaks that could hold roots.
