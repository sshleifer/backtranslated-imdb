This is a good action movie movie. There are lots of battle scenes, sure acting (for this genre) and RS1 is remarkable. I do not know why people feel compelled to trash the RS1, I thought its effects were very nicely executed and its design looks great. The plot was acceptable for the martial arts film. Not saying, I'm going to tell you that Ringong is one of the worst actors in San Hong Kong who I've ever seen. At least RS1 was the right idea to kill him. Now, Sam Lee (Allian) a bad actor thought you all are seriously! I'm glad to see Jane-X Police (estimation) and Sam Lee playing the same character! <br /> <br /> Now, please, all of you, who see highly rated Oscars, do not wake up! It's a thoughtful people movie! It was not necessary! Just meant to be enjoyed, that's all. I hope they will create sooner.
