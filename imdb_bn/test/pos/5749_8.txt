The ID looks just as good as the film is good and touches. The film explains the real meaning of you being saved or born and set very well. Acting was quite good but could do with some improvements. The story board was interesting and when my church was youth service and we saw it, 8 people gave there life of Christ. ID just want to say this is read to anyone, give your life to Christ and repent from your sin. Please visit www.lifeofacristian.piczo.com Thank you Andrew <br /> <br /> The Word of God will not be in vain. So save and get repentance from your sin!
