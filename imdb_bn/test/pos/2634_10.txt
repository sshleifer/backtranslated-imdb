Chris Pan Jeff Spicolie is the laughing stock of the all-time Stone Brother. This movie is great because it was much more real and fun than the fastest time in Redidgeton High. Casting was perfect and almost all of my favorite soundtracks of Eddie Van Halen, which became the music of ou812 and unlawful physical knowledge. This movie is one of the great stoner film Hieroglyos with Cheech and Chong. Fast time was more depressing than fun. Abortion, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in the bathroom, bad work, and failing school. Will have to hate eighty thousand more ridigemont than wild life. Limitations of the movie Mirell's vintage shop was surprisingly like a vintage shop or Ben Stein in the first part of the store.
