The two hands are a very enjoyable Assalamu Alaikumar crime, which connects the film with very interesting characters and situations with exciting dramatic moments to give the film proper balance and feeling. The film's comedy happened naturally, and the smiles were not very set up and did not work too much. It's really fun, thanks to the fact that every character in the film is thrown nicely and every actor / actress admits and can be related to Australian comedians. They portrayed it very well and very realistic. Of course, they helped author / director Gregor Jordan extensively with a great script. I saw another review of this movie that saw it, and he criticized it by passing it as a pop fiction clone. I think that's just garbage. This movie is not trying to be a pop fiction, but the opposite of the feeling and style of each of these excellent movies. If you do not want ambitious or arrogant words, I would like to fully understand this movie; Humor, sincerity, character, etc .... You have to be Australian, or at least understand the culture, which was not clearly to other people. Some Americans, whose reviews of non-American films are unknown to some American products (and to understand the problem), seem unaware. It's a real shame, because it's a really cool movie. The story of love shown between the main character and the girl is illustrated in a very real, sincere and sweet way. I am very proud to have this film in my collection. 4.5 out of 4.5
