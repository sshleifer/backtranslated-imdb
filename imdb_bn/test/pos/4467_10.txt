This is Lucio Fulci at its best. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary picture is played by Dario Argante's "Birds with Crystal Plumeage" <br /> <br /> <br /> You are an Argentine fan but you like Lucie Floric films. No, <br /> <br /> "Bound", "Manhattan Baby", "The House of Cemetery" etc. Do it with others ... These Italian people say "Geylon" ... it will be something like a "K-made-it" movie. <br /> <br /> You do not know <br /> <br /> But besides, this plot: some patient who lives in a small village kill a young boy ... a journalist (Thomas Million), a sexy young girl (Barbara BUET), a priest (Mark Porl), his mother (Irene Papas) and a witch (Florida Balkan) is the main character of this damned, bloody story. <br /> <br /> Talking about the actor, I'd like to say that Thomas Million is fantastic (always like), and Florida Balkan is superb. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, of course this image To see! <br /> <br /> (10 of 10) Of course!
