We went to movie cinema to expect a big budget release and got an art house movie. The film was digitally projected about two-thirds of the screen real estate, the classic projection of the digital projection, and the limited stereo soundtrack that was lost on the film's experience. <br /> <br /> We have seen the same old historical content, but the audience is highly sanitized in preventing sickness. Live action scenes were a little bit of them, used in the classic documentary style, which became boring after a while. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised that only 4 people were waiting to see it, but the rest did not know anything. <br /> <br /> I think producers recognized this image as the ninth anniversary of Gallipoli. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
