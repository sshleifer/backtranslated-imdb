A great example of how a great movie and low budget can be a great example of the Demon Night. Sure, most of it is fairly convincing, but it is more enjoyable than any other way to see it today as "Horror". I gore a hard 9, and one of the Demons's-liners is actually fun. I still "look at me off!" The soundtrack was well done, I heard "Stigmata Shaheed" from Bouhouse! There are some cool tweets in the display, as well as some hello good make-up effects. The second film in the series is also good, but avoid the following three. Giants may be night, dark, and low rent, but it still has a lot of potential. It must be at least a rental price. Give it a chance tonight, just stay away from the old makeup! (You will understand when you see it!)
