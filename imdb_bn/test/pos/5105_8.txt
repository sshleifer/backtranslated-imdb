This 1969 movie was captured on cable TCM one night. Seeing Hong Kong's first movie, I think, I really enjoyed Peter O'Toole and Petlulla Clark's songs and performances. I love Francis Ford Coppola's "Finis Rainbow" (1968) Best Clark, in contrast to French Astyar, Don Franks and Tommy Steel. Finally, it is heartening to learn that, finally, this delightful Irish-flavored pot of Soviet musical is released from the DVD! Ah, "It's the old devil moon (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Waul as Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - totally released He may not be an expert on musical instruments like Rex Harrison, but he played an amazing role. The scene running across the lawn in his caps reminds me of the PBS series, "Serve them all day" - a loving schoolmaster and loving man, he, Mr. Chipey. 'Clark and O'Toole somehow gave us the right mix of spunk and circumstances. Songs and songs by Leslie Bricusse are as interesting as usual. "You and I" and "Walk Through the World" (with me) have been with me for all these years. And "what a lot of flowers," "and sky smiles," "fill the world with love" - ​​not the most syrupy. Sometimes I think if the world is immersed in the songs and words of the Bricas, then we will overcome all the opposition in the world and will be 'lovely' all day! Yes, "talk to the animals" too. ("Doctor Dulilit" 1967) <br /> <br /> <br /> A movie is a blessing around the movie, they are bigger than life. Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) who gave us "Chetti Chitti Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppings" (1964) - like its music and songs - who are not only delighted "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"? I was ticked by a featured song and dance number in the Spanish film "Km.0 - Kilometer Zero" (2000). "My first ever French filmmaker Jacks Demi's" Rushfort Young Girls "(1967) Katherine denaubhera Color Cast and (late sister) phrankoja daraleka, Jacques Perry, Michael pikoli, Daniel dyaririksa, Gene Kelly and George cakirisa dances to the music.
