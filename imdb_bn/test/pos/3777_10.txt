Mark Blankfield played Jakele and Hayd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I suspect it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was quite popular playing Polly Popping Doctor on Friday at this time. Thomson has made fun of anything, from film to series to stand up comedy. If I find this movie on DVD, I must buy it. I closed this movie with HBO '822 and wear the tape pretty neatly. One of the most fun of Jeake and Hayden theme. <br /> <br /> Of course. With all the cocaine references to this movie, today becoming politically wrong, like Chechen and Chang. Very bad, because it's drunk, drunk, fun!
