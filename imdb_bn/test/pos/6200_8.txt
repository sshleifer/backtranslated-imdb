The sleeper cell should have been 24. 24 is a cartoon. (I see 24 but every fool stages with hypocrisy, up to four or five seasons, who can keep track of the same. Jack is getting hurt, Jack gets out of trouble and immediately comes back in trouble and then ...) Sleeper cell really Good work is done and much higher. Unfortunately they blew it with two ends of the season. I can think of half a dozen good finishes in the top of my head, which works well for the author's obvious goals and is not so far transformed. Shame on the authors for the debris was what really ended up in a good series.
