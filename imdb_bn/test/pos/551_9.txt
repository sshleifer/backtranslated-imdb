Natalie Portman and Susan Sarndon play a young girl with each other like a symphony living with this young girl, whom you ever punished for life as the daughter of the most cruel woman you have ever encountered. Sarandon has this ability, if you like, play some of the most echo letters in it and bring talent to it, bring their humanity in front of any film that he made. Over the course of this year, it is obviously bright and instead of being the mother of the small girl, Sarandan mother, and ballet dancers, the children of childhood are the alternative instead. More importantly, he did it with strength and flares without touching the painting of all the Portman girl. The question is always asked when we cancel the film plot, who changes? This picture is about the girl, but if you look at the dream and offer the sacrifice to your mother, you can see it closely, but she realizes that she changes the steps with her daughter. I want this wireless to make the all of us want to change the audience. Fine drama hallmark
