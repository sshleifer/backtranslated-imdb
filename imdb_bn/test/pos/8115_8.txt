I like this movie! It was adorably touched and fun. Finally, here is a story about a group that meets some challenges, a little blurred, and then decides to be yourself and ultimately happy; When did you see a picture in the end? Characters face real problems in tackling life, love, and intimacy of sex (although men's groups often resort to camping trips and humorous situations like humorous lions) and manage to learn and improve without film, dark frustrated, or very unrealistic. You will love letters and take care of those who are far away from the stereotypes, really touching the truth behind their labels. <br /> <br /> A good Romcom for Saturday afternoon, and the only movie I have ever seen where sexual intensity ends happily, and nobody is forced to do something that they do not want to be. Jessica Stein is a better choice than kissing if you are tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lessons and bitter lessons. Or, you just want a good British romp? James Purefoy always looks as dashing, and Tom Hollander is deliciously funny. So go ahead, watch, enjoy; You do not regret it!
