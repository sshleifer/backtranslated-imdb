Anyone who has seen the trailer for this movie will be forgiven for remembering this movie out and out. Indeed it is a light heart, though not too ridiculous, the ryppe about the Highwayman. <br /> <br /> There are many flaws in this picture. Scripture and plot weakened and love love story is astonishing. Yet, despite all this, it is quite enjoyable, thanks to Robert Durlley and Johnny Lee Miller, respectively. These two fine actors, especially Carlisle, are always good to see and here exists a good chemistry among them. <br /> <br /> The next generation of director Jake Scott's family, whose brother, Ridley and Tony, have given us the film as Allian, Blade Runner, True Romance and more recently GI Jane and Foe of the State. His debut is driven with energy and enthusiasm, which surrounds the film, although he did not work as well as the results associated with strong cast. <br /> <br /> If you were easy to find a usable film after one and a half hours, you could do a lot worse than Plunnet and McLane. On the other hand if you think something subtle, historically correct and thought provoking, go elsewhere. 7/10
