Everything is enlightening, Elisa Wood is a juni-American who, while WWII is looking for women to save her grandfather, she plays. In a sense, the woman who saved her whole family. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive story that is an unexpected journey. A strange land so to speak a stranger. Jonathan is not fully prepared for this adventure, he's a serious thumb sticker in Ukraine (he'll probably stop somewhere like a racket). But he discovered, much more than he expected. This movie will make you laugh and cry to you. Eliass Wood is really good on this movie, based on the Jonathan Sapphor 4 novel. <br /> <br /> I talked to someone, this movie is somewhat different from the book. A book I collect is really good. Still, this is a good movie, it has everything for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can anyone say Oscar?
