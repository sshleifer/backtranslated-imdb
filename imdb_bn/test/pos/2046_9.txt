I think Shane Black is one of the greatest action screenlines of all time! He gave us superb (this time) Lethal Weepon, Mel Gibson shooting at Super Star. Then the second best movie, Bruce Willis, is sometimes with (The Last Boyfriend). The Last Action was a little disappointed with the hero, but he freed himself with Long Kiss Goodight. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of action movies, it's all ... action, comedy, thrills, then it's top of action, comedy and thrills. Jina Davis is great, Samul el Jackson even more. Do not miss it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
