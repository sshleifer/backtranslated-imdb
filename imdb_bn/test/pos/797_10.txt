Well, I'm a huge trasy fan, so he's ranked in the cinematography automatically 8.5+ ratings. But alongside her as well as I think it was a good movie, especially it is an HBO movie. But if you take Tracy out of the movie then I'll be scared, okay. But one person can not do it and he is a wonderful actress. She just keeps getting better and better.
