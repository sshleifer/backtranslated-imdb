I certainly saw this movie about four or five times, and it gets better with each visit. Not saying: It's the best movie I've ever seen. And I think I saw a lot of things. <br /> <br /> But I'm always wondering why this movie has so much to be so blocked in some reviews or ratings. For example, take IMDB Top 250. Why is it ranked at # 216 (as of today)? Of course, the answer is not in the film itself (because it is nothing but faultless), but its reception. The film has created controversy over the conviction and showing sympathy for his anti-death sentence. And so, obviously, more conservative-minded users probably did not like the film (as you can see from some other comments). So Walking Dead Man is a map that gets nothing ridiculous about his standards. They did not understand what the movie meant, and they probably did not want to prove to the death penalty. So now I've got it: it's all political You're executed - you do not like (and do not want to hear it) what the movie will say. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, there are still many people who have a new perspective to question their faith when those who easily tune. <br /> <br /> m Robbins, the problem of your movie is divided into people's opinions. Some revisit their perspective, some do not simply listen, but you made a very important point. Your movie probably will not be shown in the "100 Best Movies of All Time" list, but it will be remembered that, after a long time, movies such as BrewherHat or Babbie or Apollo 13, (forgot your movie on all Oscars, were chosen unfairly) 1996). Congratulations, Mr. Robins, and thank you for this important part of the filmmaking.
