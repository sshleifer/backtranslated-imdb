It is bad that Izz really showed the genius of George Carlin. He's really sharp as a tack yet. It's a shame that we lost him last year, but his comedy will live forever. This stand-up special literally performs a comedian one of the most funniest one I've ever heard. Although he is having fun with small children, he laughs at some things. It is true that Curlin can literally make something that seems inappropriate and makes it among the funniest things you have ever been to and will ever hear it. I really enjoyed this stand-up, especially from Karlen and those who liked this choice tested more about George Curlin's study-up.
