From the beginning of "The Age of Love", the audience was taken to the WW2 London's fascinating world. We follow the lives of four people who have made this movie, who seek female friendliness and find strains created by marriage and infidelity. In addition to one letter, Dylan Thomas, probably the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reaction to the world around him was not only selfish, but sometimes really weird. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on Thomas' writings about love and romance. These were adapted by Sharmin MacDonald's (Kara Knightley's mother) a sharp screenplay. Director John Mybury claims that the real man is one of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> The four perform very strongly. Sailena Miller Dillan's wife, Keira Knightley cabaret vocalist Bhara Phillips Matthew Rhys, Dylan Thomas, and Cillian Murphy are William Killick. The first part of the film takes place in London during the Nazi air strikes, with which the followers of Vera William, waiting for a soldier to be deployed. By experiencing an opportunity, Dylan met with her first love, Vera. Dylan's wife is showing Kitelin from there. When three were drinking, William successfully broke the protector of the sheep. <br /> <br /> This image is married to sheep and William following her life and she has been sent to the war. The dread has become pregnant and is back in Wales with Dylan and Catalin. Vera suffers to support Dylan and Catalin with his wife's wages. Through this period, friendship between sheep and catalins increases. So do Dylan's infatuation with Vera. He gives in. It creates the first test for two women. <br /> <br /> When William returned from war, he rarely recognizes his wife, and there is no ties with her child. Things get worse, like Dylan weirdly see his friendship struggle with battlefield fatigue (later traumatic stress disorder). Something happened between William Dylan and the sheep, and the drunken angry shoots Dylan's house. <br /> <br /> "Love Edge" breaks into London and starts like a stylish romance of the war and storks, retina life maternity, betrayal, and trying to kill in Wales. Treatment of PTSD is well done, and should be talked with an American audience. Some days (see finishing) <br /> <br /> Each star has a great moment. When Miller tears his head in response to another man's abortion in his head. Nightly and Murpy when he finally bonded with his son. Oh hell, almost all their scenes are awesome. And when Rais stood up to send his own husband to jail. <br /> <br /> However, the film's original star Jonathan Freeman's cinematography and John Maybery's instructions They understand that how wonderful the story is or how the historical Thomas is, it is influenced by two great actors of our time. And they cherish their view with stunning shots. Although it is not the best picture material, it is a very good movie (more attractive than "Dachchas"). It is a visual lyric that strengthens the use of Thomas' poems. Also, this is clearly one of the best performances of his career in Knightley and probably Miller's best. <br /> <br /> I have always found weakness in artistic struggle, that is Moosert of Hulce, or Hoffman's Capet. But I was amazed at how much sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. His struggle with alcohol is well known. But his challenge for William and Catalin to take his first love vault allowed him to become a bad man. <br /> <br /> Is this award worthy of the Academy? Obviously not. At least not this year. It will release the state party in March 2009, it will become ineligible for the academy. It is 9 months after the liberation in Britain. In the US, WW2 has completed the piece of british time in the US, between Attitainment, Miss Petridgue and Bridehead Revisite. very bad. This movie is different but without attentions. But this one, Knightley's soldier comes back, but as a shell who leaves him.
