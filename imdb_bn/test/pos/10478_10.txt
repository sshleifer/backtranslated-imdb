If not sometimes the best movie to be made, "Babat's Feast" is certainly the most loving in course. It is a wonderful invention of art, generosity, loyalty and grace money. Humor is mixed with low greed; Charity is examined with honesty but with respect to deep respect. Meditation, fate, old age and trust here are meditation here. Wonderful camera work by cineographer Henning Cristiansen: Suddenly the fiery faces looked so enlightened in candle-light. The meal is collected by the melodic music of music, Brahma, mozart and song of the common people. Enjoy this festival for the eyes and the soul, as the general says: "Mercy and truth are gathered together, and righteousness and happiness will kiss each other."
