This is an entertaining B-Flick in Dracula, The Wolfman and Frankenstein's Concerted Universal Horror series. This plot revolves around Dracula (John Carabin) and Larry Talbot, Volfman (Lone Chaney Jr.), went to the revolutionary doctor separately. They both ask him what they can cure, and the doctor tries to make the path for every one. Below the doctor's fort, they buried Frankenstein's grave (this is apparently a reference to the previous film in the Frankenstein series). <br /> <br /> Of course, if the plan was planned then the movie would be incredibly annoying. Instead, Dracula can not suppress her appetite, and by blood pressure, the doctor finally gets infected by blood pressure. As a semi-vampire, the doctors become insane and awake Frankenstein's mind. With all the Universal Horoscope series, the end is completely dissatisfied. A beautiful woman from Hanbach, who is a doctor's two associates, especially the fearsome. Plus, you have to feel sorry for Frankenstein's mind in this movie - he woke up for about two minutes, killed a police officer, and yet another building (this, now the fifth?) Fell on him and was eaten by him in the fire. It is also unfortunate that the great character created by The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot has really diminished here. People that underrate the film and channel's performance. Here, he will be criticized as strictly as the structure. In all, though, it's a pretty fun movie in 68 minutes. Time is a nice waste. 7/10
