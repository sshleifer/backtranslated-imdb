My second favorite movie of 1970 (after five simple PCs) was completely dismissed by the stupid, which called the audience trash-biting pieces. A well-known liberal Peter Boyle, incredible as hard-working hard work that has some problems with young generation. She is a fearful dude, but has a great imagination and is very funny. During this liberation war I was a teenager, but Joe seemed to me, he even leaked me! Susan Sarandon, her first role, is perfect and a mixed up-fox-rich fox. Quinn's Dinner scene is insightful for everyone who is sunny and involved. <br /> <br /> It could not win a exploitation film and script (which was nominated for the Oscars). The director did not just earn enough money which is enough to give credibility to Hollywood. But now your political continuity, you will love anyone in this movie. A specific 9 in 10 This is the DVD and the video. Look at it!
