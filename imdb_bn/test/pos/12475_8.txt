The cruel mercenary Bruno River (in Paul Nassichi's sticky format) believes his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko (well played by Echo Nagasima) for keeping a monotonous dobby on a fate of the diamonds stolen. But Bruno severely injured Meiko before she gets away. Bruno is a terrible wind chill of Don-rich Doctor Don Simon (a fine performer of Laureo Mutua). He has attracted the attention of two hottie daughters of Simon: the fiery Monica (Joyful Silvia Aguilera) and the sweet Alicia (nicely written by the lovely Ausca Hern√°ndez). However, Bruno soon realized that there is something very insane about the isolated place and he plans to escape as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Bitter Meko tries to find Bruno so that he can take revenge on her. The snake, who wrote and instructed him along with this little unexpectedly combine his weirdest, most rolled and distorted vehicles. Offbat plots and mysterious atmosphere have become more weird and unique, which unfolds the story, eventually moving towards a truly amazing startup. This film also gets more benefit from graphic graphic moments (Be careful for a commemorative sequence of poorer people living with harmful meat pigs!), Alangandro Wolver's shiny paintings, and a good fungus of nudity and soft-core sex. Dr. Raksana Dupre, Sassi Dasi Rakel, Mitra Playboy Don Serifin and Dr. Pep as Ruiz. A pleasingly serious and suitable shocker
