Another IMDB critic said, "... imagine 2001: an aerospace odds in the desert" and you will not be far from the brief summary of what to expect from this movie (I'm deeply hesitant to use the word "film"). A lecture on the philosophical perspective on the Creator, mythological stories surrounding human existence, before and after, what has happened, what has happened and what will happen. Some are probably "2001" sand for it, but they deal with the hopes and prospects of mankind, on the basis of different philosophical views, evolution and the future, the phata Morgan itself is a somewhat radical journey. I hope I can publish it effectively enough. <br /> <br /> The Horizon Style will not like everyone, and those who may not have a felt hardcore section of cinematic viewing, and it's probably going to be extremely difficult, even after 72 minutes it will not be seen in the end. Fatah Morgan is rewarded very slowly by mixing together Sahara footage with villages, villagers and various other places for some of the supernatural finishes, songs of songs and almost mythological descriptions. <br /> <br /> With a montage of several photo shoots of flying aircraft for more than five minutes, you have already reached the confusion at the beginning of the movie and these ideas will not be similar to what you have seen before your mind echoes clear. Three divisions, creation, paradise and divided into the golden era, Lata tried to mortgages and was able to mix the natural beauty of the desert, so that people made it by creating instruments. Its three parts are described separately by individual individuals, especially with special sections related and long emphasis on soliloquy and desert montages. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film dealing with the existence of humans on a human being in our world. It has been created for natural beauty and looking at the potential beauty we have, more importantly, we are contributing to our reality where we live. Each shot is purposefully designed, the picture's words, words and music can be described as 'The Holy Trinity of Feming' described in this photo. Each shot in each of these three pieces provides significantly fewer shots, but when they bring together, they make something bigger than their whole part, they create unbridled beauty and deep thoughts in our minds. I would not be able to qualify this film with singular words only, if there were my pictures and scores, and I know that the public would not be appreciated, but it's a deep and I'll never use the word "art film" because this is just simply Art. This is the art which moves the mind and stirs the soul. Whether your intention of creativity is irrelevant whether or not this movie is about intelligent design.
