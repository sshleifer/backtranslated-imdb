I saw this movie when it was for a while in the early 1990's when it was in VHS. At that time, I think it's interesting, and especially why Russ Russell was hit by the segment, seeing the victims' attitudes in the accident and his surgery. <br /> <br /> Last night, the last Indiana Jones movie, John Hart's view of the second round, an unexpected flashback was raised in "Ariya", which I had not thought for many years, and the sudden memory of Russell piece was enough to spread tears for myself. . <br /> <br /> If I can do this observation, I keep an eye note that the love-hate reaction that people have revealed in the Russell segment, and I have found these interesting differences in other films which have been deeply scared. And its response Someone gets it, others are not interesting. <br /> <br /> I saw comments and how the rating has hit humans in different ways in different ways. How it affects and affects me
