In this extraordinary movie, the last day and Satan vs. Jesus's themes are treated in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the two seals and Satan fails to try to get hell in hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon and Jehoshaphat are going to be a company! And the book of life is a bit difficult to open. <br /> <br /> What is memorable about this movie is faded pictures, out-focus shots and light effects, which are effective, but sometimes annoying. And of course, Donovan is such a glorious character, Jesus is trying to understand the world and its people! So, if you find the opportunity to see it!
