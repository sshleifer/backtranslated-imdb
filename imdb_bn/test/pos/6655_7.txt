I went to this movie thinking I was not going to like it, but I'm hoping to be surprised, but it has become so dull and hopeless as the film. But do not make me wrong, Minghilla delivers every bit of the epic epic and those who enjoy such experience and willing to accept it for the courageous and willingly accept it, then they will not be disappointed and it will be their opinion one of the best films of the year . The performance is high quality and it may bring a triangle of Oscar Knom for L'O, Kidman and Zelger, although some portmantean scenes may be the most powerful of the film. The places are beautiful and there is an eye for a good shot of Minghailera. However, those who like me who want to move the director instead of willingly to their courage can be frustrated mainly due to Mingala. And its orientation. The film is so light-hearted, which I think is a punch bag epic, a film that strikes hard to hit emotionally, but it is so extreme and so often I did not have the time of the film. The time of investing mentally, or from the previous blow, and it became unreal and actually became very difficult for care, hope is not significant. Overall, "Cold Mountain" has often given me a lot of reason to think back to the good aspects of the film, because I think death, which can be a basic motif, but focus on characters rather than characters.
