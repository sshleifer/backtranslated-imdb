The whole series, not the Blue Planet, is nothing surprising. The best nature series we've ever seen Deep space outdoor journey! We saw it with our 10 and 7 year old boys and our four were not able to pull away. We read a negative comment about this and could not believe it. There are so many new information that we never learned at school. The best view of any television or movie we saw as a fine balance of our eco system of the world. The time of retaining these shots and the amount of effort you get is very clear when you sit and watch this series. <br /> <br /> Everybody must see.
