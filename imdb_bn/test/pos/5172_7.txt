Even if I have never heard of Georgetown, CO, it will be a sweet little movie. But my father was born there and raised there, and the people who see my uncle's horse pulling you sleigh! So this movie is very special to me. Shots are shot in many internal buildings and houses, which I can recognize and very realistic. The story is a little hockey, but Georgetown is such a magical place where something like this can happen. John Denver was a better actor than many people who earned him credit. Mary Wickey has played in several other films, "General Woman with Most Sasses", especially "White Christmas". I usually do not go there in the winter, so I would like to see "weld me" until my next trip to this movie during Christmas!
