David Kurtch wrote and directed "Jane and the Art of Lanscaping", a young man named David (his friends called him), and a small film on how to deliberately live on a strange day in his life. Jane works as a lancer for a high middle class family. Trying to help cheating her husband without knowing the house lady. Unfortunately, her son gets her husband instead of them. From this point in the film, as well as being involved with the people of the house, many of the characters started in a fast pace through many manifestations. "Jane and the landscape industry" is diverse, smart and thoroughly written in a very good way. Actors comedy timing is very strong. This is a fun, light movie that I strongly recommend.
