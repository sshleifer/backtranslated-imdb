I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = Very hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. It does not warp characters like other movies there. Everyone is in character and can play a role! <br /> <br /> The picture is buster and bobs flowing through the river after flooding (Courtesy of Buster), going on a tour with Hampton (Sunny Pursuit). , The Elimites are running near the oppressed animals (almost normal), Fife crushes around for his vowels and going to the movie Sherley and Fowlmouth. <br /> <br /> According to my own personal opinion, I do not like the booster and Babs is part of that much, though they had some significant dialogue and joke. I said Plaki and Hampton 'Vacation' was the best part! Hamilton family Hilary! I especially like Uncle Stingky. Fifie was delightful at the hotel. I love the actor Camio during this scene. : D <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most famous part of this film, again IMHO, is in Foulmouth and Sheryli Movie Theater ... LOL! You've got to see it to appreciate it! And when Hampton and Plaki want to make a wish through the tunnel ... :) <br /> <br /> This movie went slowly in the sitting / Babes part, the rest is pure gold! I rated this movie 8/10 Show your kids one day or even adults - check out this movie! You do not regret it.
