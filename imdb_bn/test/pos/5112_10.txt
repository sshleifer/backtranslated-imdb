This is a wonderful movie. I had different parts of the movie movie. This movie is very funny! Go to Ernest's fun club web site at www .ernestfunclub.com as there are many movies: Ernest goes to camp, Ernest keeps Christmas, Ernst goes to jail, Ernest in the army goes to Ernst School, Ernest Rides, Slam Dunk Ernest etc. I am very Recommend All star Jim Verney is trying again www.ernestfunclub.com Which is the best Ernest movie? In my opinion, actually 2 goes to Ernst camp and Ernest goes to jail. So if you ever have Ernest P. Do not see Warrell and do not see him. Will you get him quite satisfactory "I do not mean"?
