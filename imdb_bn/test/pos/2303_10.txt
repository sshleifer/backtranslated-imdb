Passion empire begins to be confusing - that is, you are immediately expected to be a horror movie in it. James M. Cain's postman is twice as fast as the ring, for the first time: Saki (Kajuko Josaki) rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamurra) rickshaw driver and two skilled and hardworking working wife But when she is not out of the house, and she is at home with the child, then honest and purposeless young man T≈çjiji (Tatusuya Fuji) comes to bring some things for the SSI and a little more. They are sleeping together soon, but after doing something (tell her just a "shave"), she knows that she will find out, and immediately suggest that she killed Gisaburo. They drink him, stick him, and then toss him a good bottom. Naturally, it will come back to pursue them - but they literally change their gear in a Japanese ghost story 'Kaidan' (at first, very frightening and later on suspected tooyji). <Br> <br /> This is a movie where the horror does not come from "Oh, Ghost, A", but comes out of total fear created for the character. On the one hand, there is only one film-noir activity mechanism in the opposition of the 19th century Japanese village in an American city or small town (i.e. snapping police, "evidence" probably found by others). , Getting closer to the word, the doubt arises, etc.). This is compulsory because Ziko really was against the plan from the beginning, impressive by the radioactive but ill-timed Taijjee, and his reactions to the reassurance of Gisburu were wonderful to him. Take the one who comes from the poem: Gisburu's ghost, pale-blue face and most silent, cooler, the speed of the sequo to get rickshaw He is reluctant, and he surrounds him on a road, he pushes me about hours of dawn before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghosts want to story in the sky but they can get it in this frustrating atmospheric way. <br /> <br /> Oshima has the right to do this unique thing when it starts looking at the end of violence. After a huge hit in the world of international film about In the Released of the Sense (which, maliciously banned in his own country), he claimed that he did something else which was 'Sense' Maybe he was right; Pastoral empire predecessor (Tarsua Fuji, which is a great physical actress in a great deal) is far less graphic than sexual content, but there is a false accusation in the horror of her brave world. You can believe the ghosts in this story, but you also have to believe how much love will be for their personal heels. Snooping detective or gossiping dude is at least their concern: the fate of their souls is occupied. <br /> <br /> And Oasim may take other hands only to be juicy pulp (sorry, it would be 'surprised me before working on an American remix)' and a fantastic shot of craftsmanship, repeat miss-in-scene (e.g. With the shot of Siko and Toyoji that walk along the road, a Dutch camera shot corner, the earth bent and surrounded by dense blue surrounding surroundings) as well as some ongoing movement which will remain long after the end of my type (That is, Taoji has thrown the leaf in a gradually step by step, or how he is blinded and then nude body is revealed). In connection with a level of the soul, it does not have to be confusing with boldly-spiritually, although there may be something - links to life and death are related to each other. It's a classic wait to discover.
