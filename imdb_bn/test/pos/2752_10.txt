I watched Revidence - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! This is an energetic tribute to the great Irish dance of dance, music and dance music! Lead, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne were captivated with their fine dance! They should always keep shining and dance. Stage chemistry was amazing to them, and the unity among them on the stage was clear. They look like they have been dancing with each other! This show is my absolute favorite, and probably will always be there. Long live reversion!
