I have seen this movie three times at different ages of my life and have always enjoyed it. This Can-Can is a genuine explosion of Joan de Viv√©, such as Stanley Dunn and Jean Kelly's musical instruments, but in French way. And a Gene Renoir admirably in his time, his friends, lovers, music and dance. This is a show of the same time full of chronic, tender and French mood in the business. It is a very clear tribute to influential people (who like the impressionists who like this picture). It is particularly respectful of Toulouse-Lotteck and Jean-Renoir's father, Pierre-Auguste. You'll hear a credible and gorgeous colored entertainment that works on some Renoir Master's. Nice casting, scenery, sound effects and music. Even let us know about the creation of the Moulin Rouge of Paris, perhaps it is a fiction story (and not very original by the way, it is very well known that the program must be run). But Gene Renoir production is great. <br /> <br />
