Romuald et Juliette is one of the French romantic comedy where they all seem to break the rules, such as Trop Bell Porter Toe. The excellent Daniel Outeul learns about true loyalty and love when he threatens to crash around his life ear. The film is not a promotional morality story, but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked up to the end. Feminine Richards (as Juliet) women who will be happy - their smiles, my memorable memories of this warm and diverse film. His child is driven by his parents - especially on birthdays - the downward path of the world - this film raises your average romantic comedy. But the French always show us how easy it is!
