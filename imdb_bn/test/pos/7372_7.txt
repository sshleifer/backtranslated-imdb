"Campfire Tales" is basically made up of three wonderful stories, after a concert, after a car accident in the jungle, a group of friends say. The picture starts with the classic "Hook" story, and then we are introduced to the group of friends driving from concerts to home. They pushed their car, pulled out some flares, and started a fire in some abandoned chapel, warming themselves with the fire, someone waited for help. In order to pass the time, they started to make a decision about the terrorist horror stories, a girl who hunts an internet hunter and a motorcycle who takes refuge in the shelter home, tells the classic horror stories. Since they say envy stories, each story is becoming increasingly dangerous, but the real shocks are not waiting for them ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story was probably the most horrific and some genuine, horrific effects. The first story was right, and at the end the automotive sequence was a bit annoying. The second story, in most cases, made many mysteries more than anybody else, but its anarchic plot was the collapse. I thought this movie a long time ago when I was eight years old at HBB and the third story was shocking to me, though it is not terrible for me now. You probably recognize some of the castings, especially Emma Smart as "Hook" Interlude Stories and Christine Taylor as one of the main actors in the film. The outgoing end was also very interesting, I know I'm not coming, I thought it was all trickled down together. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a horror movie, time worth, rent this, you should be happy. It is a great mythology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film was nicely tied together. It's much better than what you expect. 7/10
