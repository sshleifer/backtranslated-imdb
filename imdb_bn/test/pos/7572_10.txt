Jack Palenas, (John Wighting), was generally a bad guy in most of his films, and in this movie he showed his superb acting talent over and over my expectations. John Wight unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years of separation and years after year. Christopher Walken, (Jacob), after spending the night in the family's father, tried to accept the Father's appearance. Jacob's son and younger daughter greet their new grandfather and at the end of his rope, he accepted him as a very old man. Glenn Off, (Sarah Wighting), entered into the character of John Witting, and began to tell the truth about what had happened to her in her years of absence from the family. It is very warm and loving about real-life real events.
