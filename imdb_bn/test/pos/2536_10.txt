It was a tough movie to watch, and I was even more difficult that I wanted to know that the actors playing theater actually acted at the age of 19 when the police were killed in his house. Pixot (Paivi) is a street child in SÃ£o Paulo. He was caught in a roundup triggering by a murder which was involved in one. He is committed to a teenage prison where he testifies cruelty and exploitation that ordinary citizens do not try very hard to believe. Finally he escaped, he and three comrades survived by the only way, they know, which crime is. The picture makes it so impressive that both pixels and actors do not want to create a character's life situation clearly by illustrating it. Pixot tries to believe in faith and love and bondage, but there is no room in his world for the gentle side of human nature. The one at the end wants to do something perfect for the rest of the world, but what? Building children's prison in the children with higher walls is certainly not the answer ...
