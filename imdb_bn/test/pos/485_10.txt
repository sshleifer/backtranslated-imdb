Cowboys and Indians are an excellent movie. Writing, acting, direction was not good. This was a story that was told, and this group of talented individuals and groups did an excellent job of doing this. These stories are not fun but work to remind people of current social injustice around the world. It is my hope that when this image will be shown that attitude and ancestors will change. That's a rare thing that can make a film a rare one. Andrew Berzins is a wonderful writer, and in this case his talents and skills came shining through through this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for telling this story !!! <br /> <br /> Ruby
