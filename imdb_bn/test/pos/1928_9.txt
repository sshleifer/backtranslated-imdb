I happened on this by chance. I was home to my friends and started looking at it, so I was thinking that we would shoot the air while playing in the background. However, within a few seconds I was submerged in this Doku-drama, and we both focused solely on this issue and did not talk to each other. <br /> <br /> I did not know the story of the first single story in the World Yacht race, abandoning the tragic events of a man's attempt against the catastrophe, which determines his ransom for all his misfortune. Life, but ultimately becoming an example of them. After learning about this story, I saw it with the same intensity because I imagine people are reading about the nation at the time of the incident, which is involved in what is happening and interested in more information, alone amateur is hoping to pull it against curiosity and pro- Beating the beat which makes the frustrating twists of the story more tragic, I felt that the story was alive. <br /> <br /> The story is said to be carefully, and the interviewers obviously had a reflection of the tragedy, which gives great insight, but naturally reversed by the footage of the interview archive during the tragedy, the only sailor's recording and photographs are also used nicely, and the sailors' mind And how insight affected them, their insights are fantastic Law <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this story has become more widely known or film, but appreciated. Grateful that we have this drama-documentary, to tell stories from those people, instead of adapting some sensual movies, and grateful that I grab this pure authentic opportunity of a movie. <br /> <br /> It must be seen, whether you like the documentary or not.
