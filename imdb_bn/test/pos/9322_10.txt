This nice musical movie, in beautiful technicolor, is so nice that everyone from the Irish tribe feels proud. Full of joy and celebration of all things, Irish, great cast, bright settings, and superb theatrical traping, beautiful Irish music and star dennis Morgan's extraordinary Irish tenor voice, Irish to enjoy such a wonderful movie again! Remember, not for Saint Patio's Day, but throughout the year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jack L. A jewelery made of Warner, which was similar to Barbbo's studio boss in the 1940s. <Br> <br /> This beautiful picture is included in the home video and the Warner Brothers are not available in the DVD!
