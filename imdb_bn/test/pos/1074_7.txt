It's not really about wine. No, the real goals of the Nocitor are those who will strengthen and enrich local specialties for business purposes. To this end, he made a nice, motivated film. The stimulating, intelligent, emotional, and faulty independent wine producers match media-fished, Adonischurch americans and the Old-Europeians: wine-producing industry against market-driven, labor-intensive product makers. This is an open ceremony that does not lead to conclusions. <br /> <br /> The movie shows sometimes hate in the movie - the cameras are not hidden in any way, nor the stadicos. There are plenty of subtitles, as well as captions, a very short time on screen. <br /> <br /> However Moore Moore goes out of Michael Moore, however whatever. Speak for letters - and therefore condemn - themselves. A good 7/10 view
