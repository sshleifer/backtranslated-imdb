"A Slight Case of Murder" is an extraordinary TV movie which is worth a rental price. William H. Messi is a movie critic, who accidentally killed his ownership, and then tried to conceal the crime. Although it may be dark, but the film is a memorable and fun, with many memorable lines ("It was harder than me - did you ever see body hits? I think Bill Hurt is forgiving" and my personal favorite "next week for the film Noor Answer these two questions, what do people do on this day, and why it rains?). In the film, the real life of Messi is Felix Huffman, James K. There is a great supporter of the actress, including Armin omaoyela and Adam. Macy fans will see of course!
