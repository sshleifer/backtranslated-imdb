I hope a good movie I got a even better movie. Chemistry between James and Smith is incredible. He was happy to see him in a big motion picture! <br /> <br /> The movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly. Smith will be fantastic with his last-end charm; Kevin James Sunykhoshi, and Eva Mendes ... Well, just say that he plays that wicked / sweet / boring role for his skill. <br /> <br /> About what I like about this movie is that Smith was not even trying to be lovable. He was just !! "Date doctor" was all the right steps, the most perfect way to say everything, and never went to the top. <br /> <br /> Interesting part is ridiculous ... and cute, romantic part is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie. And not, it's not a chick flicker.
