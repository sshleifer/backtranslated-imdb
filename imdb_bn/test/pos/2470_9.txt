I caught this movie on TV yesterday. I had a certain curiosity about it, it's being managed by Emilio Estevez and being played by her father and Martin Shane in her real life. I love watching a movie about a father-son relationship that involves father and son in real life. Naturally, there is an instant chemistry between Shane and Estave and conflict scenes are even more intense, they are actually related to. Of course, it helps them both that both are awesome actors. I've seen Martin Shane in a very intense role, but I think this is Emilio's most important role - I remember him from most of the "Mactus docs" series - and I was very impressed. Genius is really run into that family. And Cathy Betts steals an Oscar-worthy performance movie. She tugged my heartstrings with every sound of the conversation. Beautiful actress Kimberly Williams of "The Father of the Bride" - very well, she has kept herself in a team of talented experienced actors. <br /> <br /> The film is a little stereo, for a clear discussion with dialogue, but it did not bother me. This is not meant to be an action movie; This is a character research. And for a film that's a game, it does not get very clostrophobic. When Emilio's character, Jeremy reminds her day in Viet Nam, we actually see the memories of her life. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely powerful and realistic, without feeling emotional. In the end, I hope all the conflicts will be solved and the family will become hanky-dori, but not how it becomes. Without the end of Hollywood melodrama resort, let me cry. The reality is that much more gripping evidence than reality can conjure up to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood of a beautiful, strong play that closes your socks with very extraordinary performance ... please check this implicit gem. Hopefully, Martin and Emilio will unite with Charlie and they all make a great movie together. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (out of 10)
