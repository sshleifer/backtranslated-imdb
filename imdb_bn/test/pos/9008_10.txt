It was based on the characters based on this show that never came with the best Disneys. The text really makes this show what makes It's a total classic. Given, you will appreciate the kind of humor for enjoying it, and this is hard to explain. This humorous 40 and 50 Disney is visible in old school, with modern spins. It does not reduce fart jokes or something like that. It's not the humor of Adam Sandler, though I've enjoyed it. It allows the movie's permission to permit only the same comedies, only TV. So if you do not like it in the movie you do not like it, but IMO emperors are the best thing to get out of Disney from the new GrooveGirls. <br /> <br /> A +
