Do not really know what to expect from this movie - and myself pleasantly being surprised. I recently spit across Norman Ridas and tried to find out the pictures he was in. <br /> <br /> I'm not grown up in Hosteller's movie or cinema, but I have to say, this one roped me in a minute. Probably because I could not leave the image out of those who fell right. This movie is stylish and fast, thanks to a story that is trustworthy and outstanding performance of the place. <br /> <br /> While I was fascinated with most of the film, it must be said that Dagmara Domingnik is very nice. <<br /> <br /> Give it a chance - it's really a fun movie.
