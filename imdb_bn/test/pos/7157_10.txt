Forgiveness of Franklin I have seen for several years the best films. Acting was wonderful ... especially Marie Blackwell, who was really extraordinary in the role of Peggy Lester. He brought Peggy to life with incredible skill and made him real as my own neighbor. I also enjoyed Robertson Dean's father's role ... he was able to drag even intimate scenes with real professional, and rare grace. The entire cast performance is very nice, but actually made the role of Peggy, played by Blackwell. Cinematography was beautifully covered and was most impressive. The only criticism is a slight weakness in the last scenes I proposed, which gave a little more attention to the excessive stretch, repetitive, and wrong character. I liked to finish it on a note of pardon .... But despite those little flaws, it is worth watching and appreciative for everyone involved in creating it.
