This is a movie that is better with every visit. I have seen it three times and actually registered iMDB because I wanted to comment on it. Movies about "food" have been done before, some of them are really good - for example, a certain Japanese comedy that knows the fame of Asian film. But this one really is in its own league. The Christian protagonist in his keynote symbolizes the ideals of generosity, but regardless of our religious beliefs or its lack, we all address "good" among us. Babette Feast has a wide range of measurements and refinements, but it's the message of the film, if anything strong, not all weak. If you can not join the bateat's extraordinary physical banquet, you are still welcome to this festival of souls. Highly recommended !!
