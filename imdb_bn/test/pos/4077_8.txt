I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and one of the H-BO type channels found it. I missed the start, but when I started seeing Deadly Voice, the clerk was lowered down and I did not think even until the credit. You will find yourself rooting at the villains and the end of your La-Z-Boy, against these villains. It will take time to see the time you get the opportunity. Every time I just thought about closing my movie channels, but when you stumble on such great people, you know why they should pay extra money. Happy holidays to everyone from Cape Cod !!!
