The account seems to be real with a human factor mixed. Many sadness I'm sure I was not her ... adding another thing that all the women in this show were not really women's beautiful accounts. But, I do not think it was about women, although it was JFK junior's passion. What a shame No real loss of life is a real shame. <br /> <br /> Her life resembles a good account. I recommend it if you are biography and melodrama!
