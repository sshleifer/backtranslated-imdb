Marine Furley said, "Bad dreams always come back like unwanted friends," half-sister sister Laura, who lives in a large middle-Victorian estate. "Last night, I found myself in the building of Limeridge church, usually the dead are dead, just as criminals who are divorced more than victims are more guilty, but then what happened to us was not normal." And on the novel of Victorian Mysteries of WikiCollins Based on this we are away from the first class Gothic story of mad, fiction and villi. Good idea to get close attention, because plots have plots, all of them are involved in a clever and ruthless plan, what, money, lots of money <br /> <br /> <br /> Marion Fairy (her Fitzgerald) and her sister Laura Furlie (Justin Waddell) are devoted to each other. Marion is awesome and protective; Laura is soft and very romantic. Mourin has no money on his own; When the age comes, Laura will get riches. We know that Marion has no marriage prospects; Laura pledged Sir Percival Glide (James Wilby) several times, who pledged to a very charming elite. They ward their uncle, a cruel, condescending, highly self-centered hypochondriac (Ian Richardson) Everything seems to be quite routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartley (Andrew Lincoln), is taught to teach their drawing and artistic gratitude. And he reached the local train station at night, there is no car there, so he set out on foot. In the dark forest he faces a strange woman, all the dresses of white, turn around and understand the things he does not understand, then disappear. Are we uncomfortable?

And the relationship between Laurea, Marian and the white woman is gradually concealed ... we learn to suspect Sir Perceval's intentions ... Do we come to enjoy Sir Parवीvel's close friend style and entertainment? Calculate FOSCO (Simon Callo) ... and do we finally understand the deepest depth of pride, as well as the power of respect and true love, which humanity is capable of? Do we visit the Victorian insane asylum, fall from the high tower, we dug open graves in the middle of the night and see the punishment in the roaring fire of the locked church? <br /> <br /> Okay, and this is a huge journey for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program has fine performance and outstanding production value. Colin's 500-plus-page novel can fit into a television show for less than 120 minutes, meaning a good deal can be spent or enforced, and some changes may have a greater impact within a short period of time available. Still, my opinion has been taken, in my opinion, The Woman in White Indigen works very well as a moody, romantic, dark television story. Like Marin, they give Fitzgerdad the ability of a commanding officer to defend his sister and then to determine her sister's life. James Wilby, like Sir Percival, gradually lets see the prostitution of the skin gradually. Ian Richard's young girl steals almost uncle. He gives such a bossy and intense performance that he almost appears almost helpless about each story. Simon Cloos is perhaps the least weak among the main components.
