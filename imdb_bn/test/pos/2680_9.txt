"Queen's King," in my opinion, hit a pure CBS! I have never seen any episode, I still enjoy it. Because of that, which episode is difficult for me to talk about in my favor. Even so, I can certainly say that CBS really wants to make a good sitcom. Before I wrap it up, I want to say that everyone always gives a better performance, the production design is spectacular, the costume is well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, after the CBS closure, this show is in syndication, but I strongly recommend that it will be caught if the wind is stopped properly.
