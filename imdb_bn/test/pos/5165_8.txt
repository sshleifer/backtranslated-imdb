I've already seen the spin-off of the cartoons of Flintones, Scuba Doo, Tom and Jerry and Loney Tune, and most of them are superb. <br /> <br /> I saw all the grenade pilots in 2001, I saw Ragrat see their teenager-teenager-teenager and it was something that was usually something that was going on concert, going to school and living on the ground Happened. <br /> The real TV show is good because the Ragrat appears to wear different styles of each episode, and Angela is not punished just like her original Ragretts series. Tommy and Susie were sentenced to this series. <br /> <br /> I noticed the repercussions of this show and even noticed how the ragaraats saw their flashbacks in the original series. They actually talk to adults on this show because they are 10 years old. <br /> <br /> This event is the target of a slightly older audience than the original ragatats. Viewers of the original show may like this.
