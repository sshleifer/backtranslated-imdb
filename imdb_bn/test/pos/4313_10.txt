Nobody (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese silent. It is about three salaried people who go over their heads when their innocent, drunk cheap ports *** one night from three other people one night at night. When these three mysterious strangers, even far more terrible dirty than the film, let us know, our "heroes" could lose the living daylights of one of them, decides to return the favor quarterly - only they accidentally killed another boys! The remaining two rebels then started destroying these poor terrorists regularly, including their fast-moving Sanati. A reviewer quoted Fidra Video DVD Slavi, which described the film as "a paranoid street crime fracture!" Called it. Or something like, and here the more applicable word. The annoying, intense, very violent and low key (but still quite annoying), most deliberately ambiguous moments and characters with character motivation, accurately guides the viewers, which are several degrees, they get all that deserve!). I give it a 10.
