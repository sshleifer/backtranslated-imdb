I love to go to Ernest Jail. This is one of my Top 3 Favorite Ernest Films. Others go to Ernest Dard Stupid and Ernest Camp. Ernest (Jim Verny) works as a bank director in this movie but he wants to be a bank clerk. Soon he appointed the jury, but soon he was in danger when the evil murderer Felix Nash (Varnieo) drove him out and changed his place! Soon Ernest is in the prison and he is not forced to work like Nash, nor else, Nash Charlotte will kill Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest to an electrical chair, he thinks that he has become power-hungry and he has broken down and saved Shawlat from evil joys! Ernest Ges To Gel is full of lively scenes and comics, a movie that will make you laugh so hard! It still has me! Jim Verne was such a wonderful actor! He has done a good job both good people and bad guy! Verne was like a star Tom Hans with his Toyo Story. It did not matter what role played their role, and it is something that Varney will be remembered forever! R.I.P. Jim Verney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing Ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!
