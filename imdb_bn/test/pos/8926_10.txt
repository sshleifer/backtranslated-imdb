I read an incognito hidden comment on previous comments that this picture showed a bunch of gay homosexuals roaming around their homosexuality <br /> <br /> This can not be more confusing. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. Of these, there are only three gay characters, and one of them is a victim of victimization of commentators despite the confession of justice. <br /> <br /> Pip's grandfather was not gay. Flexible scenes of soldier and his sergeant are important moments of death. But some people were surprised by a kiss and welcomed peace to fly from a person killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is the direct relationship of Pip and their sweet daughter and their social obligations and their parents facing them. <br /> <br /> Ralph Reus www.r1313.info
