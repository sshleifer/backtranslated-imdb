This movie was so beautiful! It was ridiculous! There is so much that you just watch over the film over and do not get tired. John Turturo and Tim Blake Nelson, like Pitt Hogwalp and Delmar, are fantastic! I love those guys! I too love that love they went in. I definitely recommend this movie <br /> <br /> Also, the music in this movie is awesome! I love to sing along with all the songs!
