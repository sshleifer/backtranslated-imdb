When I saw Lone Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff cast, I was hoping to find the "Awesome" of the 1950s horror film. The opening scene (a graveyard with a loud burial in the background) began to make sure it. Once I started to see it, what I discovered was a nifty little mystery about an English (Richard Green) who wanted to take revenge on what happened to two of his friends who disappeared in the Black Forest and if needed, the evil number (Stephen McNally ) Who ruled the area. Chaney, as a ghostless gorgon, had a limited role in it (actually reminds me of the note-by-Dame Hanback), Karlf had a somewhat important role as Matsin. Actually, the more interesting characters of the film were Messin and until it was very good it was difficult to know that he could be a good guy or a bad guy! The castle set was magnificent, and even limited illustrations of black forests were real enough. Compared to other movies I've seen anyway, it certainly does not come across as a low budget. The only disappointment, I think, was played by Rita Corde in Countess. She seemed a bit dry and did not seem to feel very passionate about the role. <br /> <br /> On one side, I have seen that this movie keeps my attention, and there was a great suspicion about how it all went, it was worth watching the observer. Definitely, recommend with a 7/10 rating.
