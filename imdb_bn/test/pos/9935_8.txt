Even if it is not labeled as a slash flick, it contains all the components. Slashers are well known for everything its low budget, Long Plot, Chase effect, and everything you can add, does not mean that there can not be a good slasher movie. Fill out the "Opera" description. Although it is part of Italian Geiolo; <br /> <br /> Dario argento proves that he is entitled to the label of one of the best directors. "Opera" is one of the most stylish horror movies in the last 30 years. Although the movie takes place in a beautiful, shinning place; The situation and Gore make it one of the terrible places ever used in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Although I think of "Opera" as a stylish slasher in depth plot and character development. Most slaughter cheese accessories used on Flickr do not appear here, but in return we got a suspicious, visible stunning story. The plot of the film is simple (like every slash). Opera has a psychology that is obsessed with some limited actress / singer and forces him to see deadly deaths. The scene of death is terrible and good things about movies. In my opinion, the highlight of the movie is the infamous "Pip-Gha" death scene. This is a horrible death scene that no other Argentine can be freed. The knife is another horrible scene through the neck (and mouth) but less violent than the death of the scissors. The grave of "opera" please the wicked and violent lovers. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is the lack of logic or logic. I mean, after the first death, the main woman does not happen, as she goes quietly in the house and does not make a big deal about what she shows. Also, he is left alone at home and does not take security measures. Still, the mystery of the movie forgets the lack of logic. How Argentina knows how to create tension and fear the subconscious. For example, when friends from Betty tell him that someone is seen from outside, he goes astray and hides something if something happens. <br /> <br /> The film's direction is great. It's nice for an Italian giallo. Argentine's creative Pov shot captivating. Ravens also added a wonderful feeling to the film. Add your unique spice to Argentina. <br /> <br /> "Underexpress" is one of the most underground and popular reasons for the Hurr community, my opinion: - The scene of death of the hole in the hole (bright) - finally attacking the raven, Opera setting - Throat with the throat and the face - with the music Heavy metal score (this music has never made me stranger) - The killer's hatred <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only thing that I do not like "Opera" is the scene of death. Rta heavy metal music. It's OK to bother the viewers but I think Opera Music can add a feeling of action. Nevertheless, the use of a "heavy" metal of heavy metals is a monotonous attitude of the film. <br /> <br /> See "Opera" if you do not like Gore. There are many doubts and tensions that most suspects can fear. It is no "Suspiria" but it deserves to be among the best of Argentina.
