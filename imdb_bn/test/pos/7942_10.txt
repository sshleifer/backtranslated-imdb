Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant part of the cinematic propaganda. Russian people are threatened by two main enemies, Mongolo and Titanic knights of the Holy Roman Empire. In the Russian state, in order to unite the competing prince, Nevsky took charge and played two recessions (Titonix) less. This influential film has been copied many times and it is still up to this day. A sight and sound to see the soundtrack of the composer Prokeev and the directive of the Direct International Directorial. Many years later, John Millionaas used the film, pieces and costume of most of the film's films and included the Conn. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite lines from Canaan is taken from this movie. "This is not a weapon of iron, but the power of the person operating it is important." The comparison is unmistakable. The armor of James Earl Jones and Titanic Knights is virtually identical. True respect given by one director to another. <br /> <br /> I am one of my highest recommendations to Alexander Nevsky. Cinema Richard plays like the third law of the final. The presence of Prince Alexander on screen is really amazing.
