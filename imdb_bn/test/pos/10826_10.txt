I went to see the Van Voyage, I expect a good, efficient multidruman order in Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With some exceptions, which of the characters was completely good or completely bad - just like in real life The acting was wonderful, especially those who played Frederick, Raul and Camilo. Photography was amazing, because it had been repeated over time, and during the new public work, it was directed to fire at Bardx / around, but in June 1940 the "look" was conducted. Clothing and makeup were right. There is so much of this movie that it is second to watch. It's exciting, fun, and, ultimately, to touch. N.B. - Do not forget to see it in a theater with good quality projection. This was the subtitle below the focus in the first 30 minutes (Montclaire Clermont) on the wide screen and in the theater where I saw it, but the actors had a little unclear face! This is ultimately corrected but the film refrains from pleasure.
