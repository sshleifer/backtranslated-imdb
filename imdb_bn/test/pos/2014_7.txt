'Rock Star' is not always the best way to go to the 'Stairs of Heaven' section, as one of the best rock movies, but it makes you 'jump' from time to time due to high-level energy. The film's theme is a body of rock clans, which actually became the main lead of his favorite band. The story is based on the true story of what happened to heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a variety of script and intelligent ones - then you've got 'other things coming'. However, Jennifer Aniston as the Queen's star's devoted girlfriend was acting fine, 'what was shook me over all night'. I could not say the same about the rock star; Mark Wahlberg was as much better as a porn star than a rock star. I enjoyed the touring movie opposite the 80's. It reminds me of my teenage years where everything is 'smelled like a soul'. I think the movie is valuable to watch, but it will be better for you to watch it, make sure that you 'bring women, girls and girls together.' *** average
