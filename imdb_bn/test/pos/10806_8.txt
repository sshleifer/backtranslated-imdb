It's a great movie to watch, since it was so beautifully directed by Andrzej Wajda, but at the same time I want to reveal more depth about this story. It is a historically related movie about the last days of the French Revolution, but the film has forgotten to focus on the motivation of the character, which can make the film look very bright, which is considered to be a brilliant and relevant movie. <br /> <br /> Because it does not make the movie look great anyway. It is made with passion and eye for details. Every aspect of the film looks good, such as its settings, clothing and camera-work <br /> <br /> The story still works as strong, although at the same time it can be even better and more powerful with just a bit more character development and insight historical information. If you are fully familiar with the French Revolution and especially about Danone and Rosssey's stories, then this movie will be perfect for you to see. <br /> <br /> It is a description of a somewhat general for a French film without gradually stepping in detail and subtle, ever detailed. Often it works brutally, but in this case the film can really be done with more depth. Still, the film is still a classic example of French cinema, although it is managed by a Polish director and has a lot of Polish actors. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardie has decided to focus a lot on many other characters, though the film has its role of the spectacular. The film probably has some letters, but each performance is a great one, so it will sometimes not be a big one, but it can slow the story down at certain points. <br /> <<br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
