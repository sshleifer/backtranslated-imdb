A murder thriller has been added in The Line of Fire in the Jackal, Eastwood's oldest timer's bodyguard Frank Harrigan was bothered by the past failure of the job. John Malcovitch's reptile murderer, Lari, rebukes him on this neurosis - personal love (Rissoos lily rain) has become somewhat personalized in keeping Frank's mind busy with love. > <br /> Malkovich is a unstable presence - not just shining on the screen, but also often changing actors. This is one of his best films, focusing on players and player Pietersen's game. Eastwood is very old but a) does not care about the audience, because it is written to him and b) his age is written in script, not only but a repetition joke. A lot many as you expected but well managed. 7/10
