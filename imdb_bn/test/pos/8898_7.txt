I do not pretend to be a big esters fan, only saw the adaptation of another film and read only two comics, but it was a great movie, similar. I've only seen English versions, and have met perfectly with the voices - Brad Garrett, especially Obliks and as John Austin as Sansthan. The story itself was interesting and really fun (especially the ending of the opposite name - all the viking names end in "F", though all the names of the slavery must end in "ix") even though I extended the story, although it reduced the overall production with unnecessary clichés . <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is - Viqing head, Timandahf, is sick and tired to attack the village and then found them empty. So, he consulted his "wise man", Cryptograf, whose complete screenplay consists of old stories, and the cryptograph tells him that "the fear lends to the wounded villagers". In this literal sense, Timandahf believes that fear allows man to fly and goes on an expedition to recover "awesome champion", which is an operation that takes him to Olishstra and Obelix's Gulish village. <br /> <br /> This couple is currently very disappointing - Chief VitalistTyrics' coward, pacifist nephew, Jästerfrees have been assigned to them so that they can train him from a male, and the boy can not do anything in any progress. When Justforkix recognizes the "fear of everything" in the presence of an unknownly known Viking Olaf, he is considered "fear-fearing champion", and is abducted. Asterisks and Obelix were sent by Vitalastics to rescue Jästerfries before they returned to the village to bring their son home. Finally, this is a great movie that has some clutter along with some flaws and sometimes a corrupted dialogue. I enjoyed it thoroughly, despite the fact that the trick was not true.
