A family is traveling through the middle west. Widowed Ben (Charles Betman), his girlfriend Nikki (Anna Capri) and Ben's younger daughter KT. (Geri Reischl). Then hit a city called Hillsboro, where everyone works a bit weirdly. Their cars collapsed and they were forced to stay. They soon find a spell that has a witch coven across the city and up to incredible evil. <br /> <br /> The story is not good. People just have to find things out of nothing and where they are ending witches. There are also plenty of left dangling at the end. The acting is very poor. Betman and Capri embrace and everyone else is about the same. Only old professor Stortha Martin and L. Jones give good performance. Still works in this movie. It works with Blood and Gore (some are PGs) and magazines with some scary visuals and atmosphere. Acting hampers a lot of it but it still works. Martin especially chews his role in the scenery. I can not accurately explain why (I) like this movie but it works on me. It is not that a quiet kind is awful that is no longer made. Rarely is a masterwork but this is worthy to rediscover. A 7
