This is a real old 80's fix that a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to throw off her "lovely two shoes" and is becoming part of a gang gang called The Sister. For them, their initiation consists of spending the night in a grave. Something terrible mausoleum has some Psycho Russian mental "final" resting place and he is still dead. It seems that this man found in his apartment his teleconnectic target, many things stuck in the wall from the practice, as well as a lot of young girls found in the closet. All the evidence that hiking hiking can be dangerous, so listen to girls. This guy's girl (Reimar) is rather annoying about the death of her father and a man comes in front of her and says that she knew Reimar and tapped for listening. Her husband (Batman's famous Adam West) laughs laughing, and there is not much else. But it seems that perhaps Raima's daughter may have some power which she can not understand. However, by submitting their unfortunate pledges to the tomb, the rest of the sisters fall to the streets to get back to the stuff (masks, sheets etc.), but shyness is scared of them, but they do not doubt what is happening and little doubt. They get more from the terrible crap from them. Even Reema is a busy guy for death and he is reaniming lots of bodies for recreation. And it seems that there is a thing for jail bat. Overall this is not acceptable awful, nothing is too intense but nothing terrible. Media Blaster's DVD has another version of a movie which is a rough cut, I guess, I just saw a little bit of it, so I do not know how different it is from the theatrical release but from what I saw, I guess it's a "warts and all" Presentation. 10 out of 7
