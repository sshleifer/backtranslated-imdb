A film in the hospital that was created before its time. Produced by screenwriter Paddy Chyfsky, this film, which gave us the "Oscar-winning" film "Network", related to staff in Manhattan's large majority hospital, overall disability, and bureaucratic corruption. Georgie C Scott, Excellent performance as a chief doctor, leads to alcoholism and death, because she tries to recover from divorce, puts her son out of the house, and worst, where there are medical facilities, corruption and inefficiency care and the treatment of sick and injured people. Takes priority. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mr. Scott makes his own film and will be surprised by what the spectators see in this medical organization. You can feel the "pain" (punitive purpose) of what you have done in this hospital. Lively images of the inefficiency of this hospital are so vivid and dramatically strong that you can laugh at yourself and get deeply disturbed by the scene. <br /> <br /> If this movie starts with an authentic style of fashion that starts with the premises, this picture will be bright. Unfortunately, Scott is falling for a sub-plot of an army patient girl. Patients are killing patients in the hospital! The credibility of this photo is where the strain becomes. Romantic dialogs do not add anything to the picture, and a psychiatric patient, who poses as a doctor, I feel completely incredible. A simple safety call and record check should be prevented from killing the patient patient. Prior to getting out of the patient's hospital, the entire film takes place without the security person being brought to the film. I do not see a person as much as corrupt in this hospital. Moreover, the character of George C Sket is "Over Warcade" (for another intelligence), because a lot has happened in the script. For example, in 20 minutes, you can blame more than 20 doctors and they may or may not have denied what they should not have done. With nurse and eds, it's the same story. Someone found a mistake in the chart, someone was given a wrong potion and died, the same doctor directed the patient to a worse patient than the other doctor, the other third nurse was not called because the second nurse was admitted that the patient had his coffee break. There is a lot of fine, dark humor about feeding viewers with the same message of ambiguity and corruption. <br /> <br /> Repeat of medical futility is unforgettable. However, mistreatment of murder is more confusing than helping in this movie. When the focus of the film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scott's responses, you become glued on the screen. But the conversation between Scott and the patient of a crazy patient turns the film into a mystery, "Who did it?" The scenario that hurts the movie quality badly in the scene When the husband's patient was publishing the killings, I wondered: Why do the producers "find out the murderer" of sub-plot of madly? I think the only point in the character of Scott was the relationship with the senior patient, to whom he would have to contact anyone. He should have maintained the hospital's love interest and the patient's patient treatment of the crippled patient's perspectives. It should be focused more frequently on misconduct BS in his house. In this era where this film was fantastic, sub-plot stories made the film very well, rather than a nice nice image.
