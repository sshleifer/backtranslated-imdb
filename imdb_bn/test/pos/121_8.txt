Now I realize that this film is not meant as a complaint against all Indians, but it is an extraordinary film because it dares to investigate some hypocrisy that some Indians have related to their women and sexuality. I know for some time that sexuality in this society is very common (women are killed because of their husbands no one wants to do more than their family because they had small dowry and the female fetus was the reason for constant murder) they were seen as a blessing instead of a blessing Is). I also understand that some of this culture will be heavily shocked by the film, but the following line is considered to be true - even when it was published in India a decade ago, the film attacked so strongly. As a result of the extreme misogyny of the film, most Western audience members will be frustrated or at least drag on the plight of women in this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I'm male, I'm slowly feminist and I was straight, the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is not an agenda film that can be enjoyed only by lesbians and "haters of men". Actually, I do not think this movie is promoting hatred of male or lesbian, but rather credibly argues that for these two women it was the only reasonable option for their evil spouses. Yes, I use the word "evil" and understand its meaning, because the husbands living in this big family are both selfish and have no consent for the sex of their wives. This is the real event in many traditional societies and women are destroyed for the empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> Sita married a different young girl outside her husband's family obligations. This arrangement is uncomfortable for both of them, but in the beginning, Sita tried to connect with her sister husband. However, he saw himself as a victim and took less care of his mother - and he kept a relationship with the liberal Chinese lady. To make things even worse, he did nothing to hide the matter and ask for forgiveness. There was no way that their death marriage was entirely for the production of children and Sita could not meet any sexual or emotional needs. And unfortunately, she could take care less. <br /> <br /> Another husband married a woman who married (Radha). Surprisingly, after trying to be the first child, they have gone without any sexual contact in the next 13 years! Because this man has decided to become a monk (for example, in Hinduism, a person who gives up the joy of the world for acquiring inner knowledge). Now her job was good and she was good if she did not already get married and was responsible for her wife. However, getting married, it was an incredibly selfish work and like his brother, he felt that his wife had no sexual feelings and he did not take care of her. The closest he would allow him to sleep next to her - because of his side helped him to teach "to overcome the desires of the flesh." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, these demands combine this sister together - firstly, not only emotionally but also in later sex. The film was brilliant on how it looks at me and understand how sex is healthier than inevitable and even healthy mental secretion in some cases. <br /> <br /> The intensity of their sexuality is discovered, it does not lead to completely unexpected reactions from Radha's "illuminated" husband - a person who seeks spiritual insight and peace, so much that the true insight and growth that surrounds itself Impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a very challenging and adult film. Although it is very nudity, it is very old and it is not a movie to show your kids. Really very annoying is a small character that masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady - as I said, this is not a movie to watch for your kids. However, for a mature audience, it is a wonderful and highly erotic movie that will be able to remind you. <br /> <br /> The movie is good acting, complex characters, excellent writing, beautiful mood music and gradually dynamic. Some may be annoying, but which I found rewarding. The only serious negative I can not blame on the film, but in VideoEip it is silent in the liberation war. Because the film is in English, at the moment it is quite strong and it is not easy to understand what it is called. But, and the worst part of it, there is no closed or open caption - it is certainly necessary for Western listeners including them. If you see this movie you can find it in DVD or hope the video will have a new release title - I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Directed by Deepa Mehta, Popular Female Director) created more wonderful films like Earth and Bollywood / Hollywood. A consistent theme in his film has a strong influence on traditional Indian culture and expectations and Western religions, on the contradiction between female characters. Not surprisingly, this western thinker Canada builds her house and is divorced - at least one woman unusual is to say. For a similar movie like the search of traditional cultures, Western culture combines, try another Canadian jewel, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN
