China syndrome is not a completely paced thriller and is not very slow or annoying, as some people have been saying. From one scene to another, the transitions are great and the film will keep you on the edge of your seat for a full two hours. Jack Lemon is very good, always a few nervous plant operators and Jane Phunda has succeeded in some real emotion stories again. You can see this movie as a political statement or simply an intelligently created thriller. It is of course definitely worth the price.
