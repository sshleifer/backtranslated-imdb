I'm 13 years old and I'm writing this review in my mother's sign. She will later write her own review. <br /> <br /> This is my most favorite movie. It was illustrated in England in 1944. I have seen so long that when I was young I was wearing a video tape. I love this movie and it changes my life! Beautiful landscapes Strong pie-dark horse full. A little Irish village with a young girl who wanted to do what any other girl did, made a competition in Grand National Steeplechase in London with her favorite horse of her parrot. They all wanted to ride me on horseback (which I have done for seven years now) and to learn about their breeding so that I can paint and draw them. It is a win-win film against all triumphs, crossing your fears, believing in yourself, and reaching harder goals by working hard. Also, the races were the best of all time ever and I have seen many movies with races. I do not get tired of watching this movie. Everything about it is perfect. Especially if you are a young girl and enthusiastic about horses!
