Some people say the motion of this movie is a little slow, but how is it different from any other hitcot movie? They all move very deliberately and, as a point, have spurts stimulated through the mystery and bright montages. This film gives us the right amount of comic relief, which seems suspicious scenes to be more suspicious. One of the best examples of the genuine movies in the collection of Hughcchor in the Albert Hall scene (best known as "Rear Window"). Pure cinematic for Hituko means a series of small small series of films together without dialogue, apparently to tell the story. It is, of course, the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence and the sequence of short stairs at the end of the picture. <br /> <br /> There are not many slip-ups by Hitcoak, and the performances are exceptionally significant, especially by Doris Day.
