When fleeing from a bank's operation, expelled Vans Shaw (Randolph Scott) helped Western Union Chief Engineer Edward Criton (Dean Jagger) who supervised the Wild West and accidentally collided with the horse. In 1861, the Van Western Union was rented from Omaha to re-work with Salt Lake City poles and wire organization organizations. Vans and Harvard engineer Richard Blake (Robert Young) flirt with superb Edward's sister Su Criottan (Virginia Gilmore) and likes Van. However, when he hunted his past, he stole the cattle of the General Western Union of Western Union (Berton MacLean) Indians. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" is a good but predictable western region operated by Fretland. This story highlights the problems of the brave and idealistic men, which is responsible for installing Telegraph through the West and facing thieves and Indians. The entertainment story contains action, drama, romance and fun situations, but there is nothing surprising in the story except Jack Slade's identity. Randolph Scott gives another superb performance with a great cast. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Oss Contesters" ("Winners")
