These films deal with losses, personal struggle and transformation issues in a smart, modest, sensitive and visible super-perfect way to be completely transferred. It is a rare jewel in a film that honors beauty and women. You will see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays subtleties of an extraordinary person if somewhat broken personality, in a way that relates to each woman. I found the honesty of the psychic interaction in the characters to be impressive and deeply engaging. There was nothing in this movie that thought of me as a "low budget" as much as worried about the quality. There is nothing. This is a low-budget movie that is respected by filmmakers The final order of credit time will also close your socks. It's a bright celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspirational
