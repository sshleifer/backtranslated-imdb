I think this movie is very enjoyable. I guess I enjoy Casey Bates. I got an extra pleasure in singing her songs. She has a very nice voice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo takes you from his married life in Chicago, England, recently Victor Murder Victor Fox's house There he meets his three surviving sisters. He discovered that Victor had left a male lover, Dirk Simpson. <<br /> <br /> The story takes you to some wonderful humorous and hearty situations because Grace and Dirk develop real happiness for each other after a truly happy development for each other. They come back to Chicago where they are grouped for the size of Grace's pint, the sunny daughter Maudi, the search for a serial killer of Victor. <br /> <br /> Everybody has done a good job. Especially Julie Andrews, Lin Redgrey and Barry Manilo. This movie was fun. It makes you cry. The song is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> There are no other sources of posters who have found problems in any part of this movie. <br /> <br />
