I agree with the comments already posted on this site with the previous comment <br /> <br /> I was involved in this movie in the early 80's, when I was in a mental hospital. Unfortunately, targeted barbas hit home many home targeted. I especially enjoyed the end, where the teachers of the psychiatric hospital will talk about the door. Believe me, it's fairly accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, most hospitals do not lock the doors of the hospital, or today's strudgetas are not used much and should be licensed for getting a "pad room" in a hospital. <<br /> <br /> But an amazingly underlying movie, and of course one which is quite fun. <br /> <br /> Jeff
