"Tourist Trap" is a wonderful, horror movie of the 70's. The film is about a group of young adults, Bakey, Jerry, and Molly, who are traveling in a jeep in a jeep area. Their two other friends, Aileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When a wheel becomes flat, Woody takes it to a nearby gas station - and meets some strange telenetic myam and some vague manicon near a fatal fate. Friends are tired of waiting for Woody and the local "tourist trap" goes from Mannequin / Wemble Museum. The car broke down randomly in front of the entrance, and found a pure area for girls to swim, where they reached Mr. Slusane, who closed the attraction near the road. He took them to their old Western wax museum, and while he was behind the girls, he and Jerry went to fix their car. Islin, both of whom are curious, swirls in an old house nearby, where he falls in the hands of a mysterious masked killer, and a bunch of life like Manquinus. After waiting for Aileen, Bikey and Molly went to look for him. When the real horrors begin and face the mask slouse's brother in teleicetric (he can remove objects with his mind), he begins killing his teenager while controlling man-made manuscripts of more than one man. <br /> <br /> 2005 like "sound of wax" remix sound? Well, that's it. I've heard of this movie but have never seen the "House of Max", but now I see interesting matches of two movie shares - "Tourist Trap" was probably a big contributor to the "House of Wom" Rimak. The movie's makankines are scary to start, some look in the eye, some do not see their eyes and sing some songs. The singer was extremely awesome if you asked me, and mannequins are eerily designed. Curious to start with mannequins, they're so lifelike yet they are not really. The film "strongly mixes" elements from "Texas Chess genocide" (masks used by murderers, like masks of leatherfaces), a small part of the original "House of Wax" and telephony capabilities that are displayed in "Kerry". The results are quite satisfactory. Teleconceas was a great touch for the movie, making it more deadly and unexpected to kill. The mask was terrific, and the plastering scene was really annoying. <br /> <br /> The score for the picture was done very well, if some were not used a little more during the scene. What can not be played particularly, but it was not really bad. Chuck Cones Shadow was really good as Mr. Slutton, the character provides a shadowy but friendly feeling. A young Tania Roberts is also in the film, she is known for her role of "Charlie's Angels" and recently known for "The Show of Sextom" The 70s, Donna's mother is playing. Robert A. Barnes worked as art director, he did an extraordinary job in the original "Texas Chess" and also worked well here, creating a cluster-driven, uninterrupted environment both by the Randown museums and the old old houses by the Manquints. I found it a little odd that the original rating of the film was PGI, it looks very scary to see such a harmful rating, but the film is not really violent. <br /> <br /> Overall, "tourism trap" is an eerily unique, fast-paced, highly acclaimed horror classic. The full moon gave it a suitable 20th anniversary DVD release, the commentary was interesting and the film was mostly clear and miserable over the video version. If you enjoy the old '70s slash-horror movies, "Tourism Traps" is an underlying retro gems. 8/10.
