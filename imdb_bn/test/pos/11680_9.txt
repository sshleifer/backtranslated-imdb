One of the Top 10 Best Music Films! Completely indispensable educational experience for a musical power - especially young rock / punk fans ... To understand the beginning of a particular "artistic" movement, it is necessary to understand the roots of the music, as well as the mentality and musical environment. Not to mention. And, in addition, this documentary is flat-out Rock-n-Roll FNn !! Do not miss it !!! Anyone could tell me, if ever, "Western civilization collapse" ... part 1, (part 2, not the metal version) will be available again. Hope on DVD?
