Egg bit of a curate, this one. I started to hate it, with its predominantly 'Old Dark House' setup, it reduces the regularity of recent US threats and reduces upgraded corridors on regular trips. <br /> <br /> But it's going on and <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not just hard to jump and one, hard to do.
