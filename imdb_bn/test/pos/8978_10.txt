Charlie Wilson's war only shows Wilson's war of the Church about how vain battles can be the futile wars, especially those who spend countless hours and financial funds. The memorable characters surrounding the film, stupid acting and extraordinary memorabilia scripts surround the movie, which consistently vaired the best of the year, under the leadership of Mike Nicholls. Politics was never so funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See also unexpected interest. The CIA's secret mission expert and Joan (Julia Roberts), a wealthy socialite, initiated the help of Gast Awakakotes (Philipp Simmur Hoffman), and made a vow to supply Afghanistan with the Rocket Launcher and Antitank surgery for the serious damage to the Russian military. . Finally, by the end of the 80's, the rock war will end, and the funds will be cut immediately, thereby removing all help to rebuild and retrieve the new country. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine, though it will be expected more than the cast. But a large part of it, the script should be blamed, which allows each character to be accurately enhanced and memorable. And a hearty aid to that achievement goes to the same name novel, which is very honest. Tom Hans has delivered another unfinished performance like Charlie Wilson, who has done so much for so many people and is still relatively unknown. Philip Camer plays Hoffman Gost, a character who clearly Boffff in both his physicality and his anxiety. Incredible Hoffman once again shows an impressive range of characters. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the movie with her generic snap character and non-fine-enough pronunciation. And then there are "Jelly Beck" squads of Wilson's young fishermen who hate to keep him happy. Always delightful Amy Adams led, there is its delightful moments in each supporting role. <br /> <br /> The defeat of the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially considering the many disputed goals among various political leaders. Why is the Congress saying a word and nothing is doing? A disgruntled politician questioned. "Most Tradition", Wilson returns. Everyone seems to want to end the cold war, but blind eyes are seen in the persecution in Afghanistan. As well as inspire Wilson, it takes a tour of the refugee camp to fight with his original financial source Doc Long (Ned Batty). Wilson used strategic ties with the committee for surgery from $ 5 million to $ 10 million for surgery in Afghanistan, but the Pakistan President was frustrated with the idea of ​​winning a war for a common command. At the end of Wilson's campaign, according to Wilson's prediction, Mujahideen has been sent $ 1 billion to open Russian helicopters - the first step towards victory Apart from the scope of the film, due to unstable instability in Afghanistan, there was less corruption, which Wilson probably predicted. <br /> <br /> The main character travels to the United States during the war of Charlie Wilson. Go to Jerusalem from Afghanistan to Jerusalem, but wherever they go, bitterness will always follow. Considering that political initiatives are usually serious, there is a wonderful amount of comedy in the film. Hoffman, with its naturally demonic female-chasing ideals, hongs, provides jokes with almost every exchange dialogue. A scene appears to bring Glass out of Wilson's office immediately, because she tries to straighten out a legal problem through her neck ("You can do MM time", but you '') I think of a slapstick routine from Marx Brothers. <br /> <br /> Instead of the important issues of the press club, Wilson focuses on the complaints of drugs and It is clear that at the end of the film, politicians deny what they really need, and because the screenplay is so fast and awkward, some audience members will not be able to keep up with all dialogue events, but Pakistan The difference between Afghanistan and Afghanistan is seen by unconscious politicians On, it is another reason to support the Charlie Wilson's point. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massey
