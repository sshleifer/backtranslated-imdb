A while ago I saw it when HBO was shown to it and from what I saw, it looks like a good movie. So I'm in Blockbuster today and I saw the DVD there and I'm deciding whether the hell. So I rent it. I was amazed at how good I was after I finished watching it. <br /> <br /> This movie has touched my heart. It was so amazing at everything. Story, actor, dark humor, music !!! Hey, do not start music in this movie. PT Andderson is one of the great. Clearly, the best thing to get out of Quantin Tarantino (a god). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> If they do not already have it Anderson is probably a movie lover. In films he rips off many other tecniques directors Pool scenes with cameras, such as through the pool, water the girl. Obviously "I'm Cuba." But there is no beef with me. The film is very respectful with Reeff. <br /> <br /> I can reveal this picture to anyone, which is something on the picture (obscene) <br /> <br />
