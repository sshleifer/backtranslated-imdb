I'm not sure what makes these movies so intrigues about. It's great, weak, written, often humorous, and in most cases, the mind slowly slows down in the brain (the person that I was seeing it fell asleep twice). And yet there is something in this movie which fascinates me, though I'm not sure; Probably the character of Sam, a former former patient who was laminated by a former head doctor and who was impressive on the snow pop forever), or surprisingly, the chief doctor (I forgot his name). <br /> <br /> However, look at it and you form the structure of your own opinion; I have it in the last one seen in the film.
