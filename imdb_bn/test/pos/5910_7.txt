Everyone knows that Lindbergh was successful on the first transatlantic flight. If there is any mystery or plot in this film? Well, there is. Do not ask me how, but there is. Due to partly speaking of the director's story but mostly because of Jimmy Stewart's extremely compelling performance, we dragged into this story as if it was open for the first time in our eyes. Since half of the film is depicted in a trembling copyie, it is dynamic even though there is a step flick. So if you are scared of watching this movie, you think you already know the story, give it a shot. I think you will be affected.
