I like this movie. It focuses on both topics: reality and imagination. The reality is that hey, we all wanted a date from the popular people delivery. And none of us have yet kissed, okay? Be honest <br /> <br /> Another real problem is because of the pain of people living. And yes, high school life. Remember it? Fantasy is finding your true love, when you're 25 years old and still in high school. Not really imagination, but close enough! <br /> <br /> Although some part was incredible, it was a great movie. There are no other words to describe such incredible work. And the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore has done a ridiculously fantastic job, such as the delightful David Arquette. All those who have done the movie are wonderful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It does not show the reality and some-something problems for people like you.
