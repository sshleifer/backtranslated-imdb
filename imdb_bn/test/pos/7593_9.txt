I am very surprised that so many people do not like this movie. I think it is much better than most of the movie, which has recently been released - ten things I hate about you (we can say tiny bopar movies and how can these novels write original novels?), Cruel motives (where a character is a fun They give virginity due to the car ride), and all that (intermediary). If you're looking for something that's just fun - I sometimes go to Kiss with Been. My mother likes it and she hates the movie (her darling is one of the beaches). It's a great idea about what you would do if you could go back to high school. Those who were unaware of high school, would probably like this movie. This reminds me of 'Rumi and Michelle's High School Reconciliation'. And last keeps me the best mood. Sure the plot is done, but you can tell how much recent movies you did not have in a form or in any other way. Cast is also charming. And for those who think the drill can not be geeky - he pulls it off just great. Another good teenage comedy I've created recently was the election, but it's a mockery in school and politics.
