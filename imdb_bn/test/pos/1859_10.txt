I've read reviews of this movie which it seems to be 'frustrating' and 'confused'. I am at a loss understanding that this will be harm. From the beginning I got it a tremendous experience and a complete joy to visit. <br /> <br />: Opening titles are a beautiful visual overlay of the evolutionary process, and it introduces the story with a continuous and latent style. Although the film is not about the process, Charles Darwin expresses concern with his conscience, his wife, his dead daughter and his love for the truth. <br /> <br /> The presence of her daughter reveals a painful mind that "kills God". She is an adult, tortured Darwin with adult comments about her work and personal suspicions. Was he responsible for his death? Real life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give really wonderful performance as Charles and Emma Darwin, such as Marie West Anne. Bettany's size and peculiar movements give Darwin the true feeling of reality when Connelly feels very comfortable with his English pronunciation and sometimes with some serious personality. <br /> <br /> The timings of this movie are easy to misunderstand. There was a firmness of religion on religion and an internal struggle that a man like Darwin could bear to bear witness to the truth. Science and religion have always lived on a painful bed and even though it does not spend its life, as it did with many men and women before, science hindered husband and wife, truth and belief. <br /> <br /> I've given ten sticks to this image, because I think it's a nice, deep, pretty good performance and a genuine, no-exterior frills original world look that really needs talent. <br /> <br /> It seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... see the wonderful "religious" of Bill Mehr) was hidden for thousands of years. The truth, once it was discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. The Creator examines the pain and realizes what we earn. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cinematic experience.
