This is a wonderful movie: a romantic thriller cheated by the use of brightly repetitive visual motifs, including a rich but fully built and devastating parallel plot. It is all beautifully pictured: women, apartments; But more amazing images are devastating juxtapositioning, almost every scene has other echoes. This is a story called in a lot of color-parallel colors. When I see it, it makes me happy. <br /> <br /> acting is very good. Roman Boehinger is stunning like a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her change with her mood. Vincent Cassel la Haine plays a very different role in his part; But no less excellently: bent and sympathetic at the same time. And Monica Baluchi - Oh, Monica Baluchi, okay, she kept it easy, she played the world's most perfect woman (not?). There are three quarters of the way where he has nothing but a small scene; Yet instantaneously, Hollywood junk has been saying for hours. <br /> <br /> Nobody on this film trial does not mention the remarkable, consistent measure: judges, tragic, ridiculous, and subtle But if one moment retains the brightness of this work, then this scene is the scene at the beginning of the great sound, which has been presented before our whole story before teasing. Yet when the moment comes, it is very delicately handled, so briefly, so shiny, that reflection on it makes you gasp. Only frustrating confident director will have the courage to reduce this important point. But confidence is justified. The movie does not come much better than this.
