Leois Caracas is the brightest and one of the best movies and cameras in the business. So, the Pola X is not always surprising like the perfect intricacies of most intimate twisting stories. Seriously If I could find ways to climb into my video monitor, then I could hit Pierre one inch of his life. In addition to the Heathcliffe of Wethering Heights of Emily Bronte, both at the same time have the right to be selfless and foolish. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, my brand needs a big glass. I have never been so angry at a major character. All right, saying that Pola X is a stunning film with some complete sex scenes that can be seen in a film .... which means that another part of the film is great ... and I'm talking about graphic here, by the way. Pola X will kill you from hell, but if you decide to see it, make sure that you are ready for it.
