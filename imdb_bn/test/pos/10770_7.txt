Month Oyama was the most successful carat master at the end of the 20th century. He discontinued the club's "training" during that time focusing on an intense no focus on the training form. In the end, without compromising his education with hundreds of schools around the world, he built his system in a huge business empire. Examinations in Kyokushin schools are still required in some martial arts schools in some physically challenging exams. Oma was an ancestor due to his Korean descent, and he spent time in proving loyalty to Japanese and Japanese Karate. This film series was part of that effort, though Oma (I've) had the opportunity to meet anyone who would not obey him in Japan. In this series, Waima's most famous student, Soni Chiba, was invited to portray her master. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ouma came from the village where he was training alone. He challenged and did little work in established Karate School. Disgusted by the state of Karate, Wama returned to her solo training. She finally liked a student, fell in love and found the way of Gangsters compatible with Karate Schools established. In the middle of it is the legendary bullfight with a crazy bull. How true is the picture? <br /> <br /> <br /> Uncle could kill a calf with his bare hand. He is called to repeat this feat several times. The examples illustrated by Waiam are really doing this, although sometimes Bauls seem to have been running for years. Sony Chiba strongly illustrates his master and who is quite good at him. Chibber was not the best carpet practitioner, but at this time he was certainly more than average. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is good, most of the plays are better than martial arts films. I always wonder why it is not even better known. Perhaps it is very realistic illustration of martial arts. People are tired and hit in front of 99% of the action film, where the hero has an unlimited shower of strength and every hit immediately sends the opponent to death. Chiba has become so tired at one stage that it hurts to see. Perhaps their entertainment does not reflect so closely with the viewer. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for martial artists.
