This movie reminds me much about the Rock Hodgson film Man of Feuquette Sppup - a fishing writer who never fishes and is forced to enter the fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwick Martha Stewart is a writer who can not cook and does not describe the perfect family in her article - she actually has no family. Well, like Rock, he is maneuvered in the execution - in this case, making a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside. Since there is no family there, she takes a gentleman and some friends home and says "do not let the cats leave the bag", she hardly tries that she can not do any work she can do. A cute little comedy and an annual holiday movie lineup is a welcome film.
