This broadcast of classic musical "Sweeney Tod" does not work in production, but it is still quite encouraging. <br /> <br /> First, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the Wheeling Multi-Wonderful Trap Set. Then, staging is nice, slashing right down. <br /> <br /> The main failure here is to give performance to the people. Oh, they're trustworthy, okay - but it is very frustrating when some people hit their time like fast during the song, "kiss me." Indeed, Johan playing the actress is not a frustrating degree, but rather a little off-key. And Angela Lansbury's little overdone cockney accent is a little annoying. Another thing, too, is exactly what George Tunchin's "Johanna" is so bad about the performance that it has been banned from American theater, but Cantill does not sing "A Little Prize"? <br /> <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a wonderful production. This is an exciting thing for people to see what they love - and I'm not even talking about "nails".
