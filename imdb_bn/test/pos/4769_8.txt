Just this bit is not seen many times, it was the true enthusiasm and cleverness of Mickey Mouse in its first 30 years. Mickey is a smart ass little whiner nowadays than this. Steamboat Willi always laughs me, at the end where Mickey laughs after killing a parrot with a potato. The animation is very nice and although SteamBeat Willie does not have any dialogue, the music is enough. <br /> <br /> If this bit is not worth 10/10, no cartoon is simply not that classic, but because it is full of fun and it's always fun to watch.
