"Broadcast News" directed by James L. Brooks (complementary terms, it's as good) and a great cast with William Hart, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone gives good performance, but they are really impossible to take care of them. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are really brilliant, such as suggestions and concise scenes from Jack Nicholson. The main reason that it does not work completely, it's a film that relies on funny things instead of being funny on the characters. <br /> <br /> You can consider it more than a play, but it's often too silly to be successful there as well. Still, the script makes it worth a watch. Of course not for everyone <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 7.0
