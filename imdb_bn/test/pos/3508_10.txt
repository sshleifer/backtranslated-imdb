I remember years ago, BBC 1 was used to show the film in a very tight form. I tracked it down on a few years ago and seen it again. The film was slow and slightly weird (mountainous men look very strange) although the atmosphere was brutally effective. This is one of my favorite slash films and I have no idea where an uncut version is available. It's been deleted everywhere (in the US where it was suddenly a horror collection!). It's embarrassing that you can not see this movie because it can be seen. The wrong turn (produced in recent Stan Winston movies) just owes a great deal before Dawn. One of the more than 80 slashers is the ability to be seen by a larger audience.
