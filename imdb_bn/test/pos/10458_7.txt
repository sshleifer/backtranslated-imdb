The movie starts slowly gradually, a "romance" (Javan) that must be closed (all the parts of the plan ...), then about one hour of this glorious movie The Feast It is that paying attention to the attention of the first hour. Feast is still serious, but ridiculous. Suddenly, recall and little tiny life comes to life, and everyone (you and the characters) left feeling feeling rich by experience. <br /> <br /> Women love this. All kinds of Christian characters will have profound faith. Not always my favorite movie - there's no dinosaur or laser beam, but after all - but certainly a movie I'm happy to see. Do not miss <br /> <br /> Jim
