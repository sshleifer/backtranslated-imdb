On the far side of the Sun, the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun, which divides the same orbit like the Earth, and hence disappears until a space is discovered at the distance of the sun. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Thins and Ian Hendry) are sent for discovery, but due to an error, they crash and return to the world within just 3 weeks of their six-week ride. Of course they are berated (at least in Thinnes, Hendry is gravely injured) and grilled and asked why they returned to their mission but claimed that they have claimed. Thinnes seem to notice some very strange things about returning "home" back. Sometimes it is nice to have a few conversations and do not cry much from set and feeling "Thunderbirds", but once the actors are there. This is not a big "Star Wars" type product, but a little silent science fiction that is a little bit of a concern. The good price is to see and print out the DVD that it is the culprit. 10 out 8
