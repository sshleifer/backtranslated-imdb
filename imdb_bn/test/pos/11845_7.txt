"Cing and People" is a bold romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (J. Mahour and Julian Nicholson). They live together but both have doubts about their relationship. Alice has realized that she had a sexual relationship in the past, she could only marry Ed, because she did not remember anything else. So they started making fools for some time to test their relationship with others. <br /> <br /> This movie adjusts to a wise question - "What will happen?" Can the aspects of life really work the opposite and only you feel more stress? When Ed started sex with the girls of college, he became addicted and forgot about Alice - when he realized this, he was afraid. <br /> <br /> I did not hear anything in advance about this picture but I Enjoy it It is not made very well and clearly thinks of a low budget indie - nevertheless it is much better than the mainstream romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you get it.
