Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love Dogma movement. I wish it was long lasting. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried to stop them. I do not know why. This is the most interesting step in the history of the cinema from the French New Wave. In addition to Fuckland, I saw the series first, Festen, Idioterne, and MIFFune. They all were great, in my opinion, Festen is a Best Composition. Fuckland does not have those others until I was just fascinated with making film. It's like a real documentary, it has played a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to deny it. In some points of the film, it has become clear that it was the work of fiction, but that illusion was prolonged for a wonderful period. I want that filmmakers make some interesting on the screen. It's basically about this guy, Fabian, who visited the Falkland Islands as an Argentinean. The Argentines were only allowed in the forefront of the islands within a few months, and the FÃ©bians planned to restrain the women with Argentine children. She set her eyes on one, and most movies are spent on her seduction. Two actors are very natural Camilla Heiney is the only indication of the actress. Fabian Stratas is completely realistic. The politics of this film is a bit confusing to me, because the situation surrounding me and the island's recent history is just one ink. I think 3, I think, when Falkland attack The final bit of film does not work at all. I did not find the movie makers going there. Still, check out an interesting Dogma in Fuckland. Although it breaks some dogma rules, especially any additional diagetic music rules. There are a lot of that. 7/10
