I must admit that I was not expecting much in this film. I was surprised that I really enjoyed it. The script was not oscar material, but it was not awesome. The acting was great by the great Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great support role, and looked as lovely as ever. For me this was what music was in the movie. If you do not like the 80's glam metal or hair band, you probably will not be like this movie. It's all about being a rockstar. Some were present in the cliche, but the movie did not bring down at all. I like rock and roll and stand up and remember that anyone recommend it !!! 10 10 for great acting and awesome music. <br /> <br /> Jason
