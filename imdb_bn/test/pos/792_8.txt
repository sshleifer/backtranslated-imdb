My eternal shame, I have never seen a silent movie - even in all vampire movies, "Nosferatu" mother. However, if they show half the creativity and boost to this effort from Booster Keaton, I would probably try to see more. This really funny as well as the silent comedy has a stunning role in the world. It is a misunderstanding, such as the misrepresentation, misconception that Kenot mistook for the famous bodyguard dead shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St. Cleair). It increases as many chasing and escapes as it gets increasingly frustrating near Keaton. <br /> <br /> You are surprised and amused in equal measure and left to entertain. Keaton is a natural comedian but a accomplished stunt-man, he leaps and judges quickly by jumping like Jackie Chan. And comedy is also a very high quality - she was very laughable because my Better Half was a short call to her parents! If you have never enjoyed such a silent film, it is no less than an observation to watch - it must have blown up any idea about silent films. Naturally, it's not as polished as today's movies - the act is very awkward, the truth will be told, but it does not matter because you enjoy the movie regardless. Anyone with a passing interest in movies should not try to watch it because it will not be disappointed. Bright!
