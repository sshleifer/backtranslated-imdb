I do not like the first part of this movie for about an hour or more until the cruelty of animals by the civilian people of Scotland, until the second half of Scotland came to me and I was so sad that I could not see anything. However, the filmmaker had created a point that the primary natural scientists have destroyed everything living that they do not understand "literally" without considering the rights and creatures of living creatures, which we now do not know that can be studied anywhere but They live in the natural world, and as far as possible unreasonably. I recommend this movie because it was the most serious and honest story of Tarajan and in 19th century scientific world as well as a pure and simple, beautiful primitive life, living life as a Tarzan made a point of showing cruelty to the deadly creatures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Terozan's super-rich Scotland's aspiring-riking village, in his latest film role Andy McDowell was beautiful and beautiful as his Gossip-up and civilized "Jane" in his first movie role. From his charismatic work and his very scary eyes in this photo, I do not understand why Lambert did not become a big star, but later he could have his bad movie choices. Horrible Ian Homam, helped by Tarzan as French wounded in Africa and then to Tarzan returning home to his former unknown, ancestor, then Scotland was always as great. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy that Tarzan got sick and did not live in animal cruelty, when he returned to the civilized world and Africa, his gentle and loving relative "relatives" came to live with him, who is like him in Scotland and the kingdom Instead of living, instead of living, it would destroy him if he did not. Kill him first.
