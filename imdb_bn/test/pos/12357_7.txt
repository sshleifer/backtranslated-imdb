I will make it a story more imaginative But the event was below rather than the earth, compared to death's career. Actually there's a lot of a social drama. Naturally in the "European authors" movies <br /> <br /> Actors like the average silent film are not interesting. It is not good to have pictures stuck in your mind, like Bergman's Smalatonstallet. <br /> <br /> It is true that comparison between the two films is the main point here. The character of Sjöström where Smultronstället starts with a vision of a death car can see his own body. There is no clock without hands. She is forced to look back what she did wrong. The country has dreams of his happy family. Suezstrom's wife does not cheat her in front of her eyes, but she wants to escape with little boys because it will not be any better with her. Finally, the verdict of the verdict of any kind is judgment. <br /> <br /> I'll add that Szstrom is destroying the door with the ax, because his wife has locked him and plans to move with the children reminded me that the blaze was shining. Which was a lot more of a fabulous story with the death of hanging around.
