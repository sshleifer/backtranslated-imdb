Ah, the classic comedy. In the movie where the brain accumulates together, Bruce Campbell partially defeats himself, a two-minute scene reminds me of simple movies and ideas that catch you and wrap the whole film. <br /> <br /> Years and years, Bruce Campbell knows we want any kind of movie of him. We would like to see strange movies like Bubba Ho Tape. We want to see the role of Cam Raimi in Sam Raimi, and we want to see 'Man with SkyMing Man'. With the title alone, someone knows that it is like a totally stupid film, like the army of darkness, with just more stupid and less monsters <br /> <br /> <br /> This idea is simple. Bruce Doctor See. Doctors have new ideas. Bad things happen to Bruce to look after the doctor. Eventually, the doctor wanted to show him what to protect him. Hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi as a weird Russian guy, and Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov as the passenger Steach Keach, it's funny, it's funny, that this movie. Completely funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not like Bruce Campbell, why would you see it?
