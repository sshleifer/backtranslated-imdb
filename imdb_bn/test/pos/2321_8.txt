Down Persepope is not a "Great movie". But then again there are very few flicks. So if you are looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, without this capital, is a "great movie". No sharp sex or graphic violence spoils this mild comedy with a bunch of antique submarine muffits. They could get their extra star in a general so that they could fail their work. They must take the entire US Navy with the nuclear submarine. But they are terrified and it's a comedy so you can guess the results. But you are the root for those underdogs and it makes a very entertaining movie. See and enjoy ******** (eight stars)
