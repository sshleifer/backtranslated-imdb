The best part of this movie is that you can see it over again and still will not get the viewing content. For the last 12 years I have seen this movie at least 10 times and still it makes me ridiculous so that I see it for the first time. I like it for good comics like Orgajmo, Chech N Chung, Monty Python series and many others, but it is one of my favorite movies in Hindi. Recently in Hindi, some of the noise, the Munnabhai series and the Herfari series. So I can say that the Hindu comedy finally evolves. But Above Yourself, I said above the movie is quite different from the movie. Hindi stoneware comedy, which is available near Hindi in 1994 and rarely what I say Cheers with Rajkumar Santoshiya for the bright movie.
