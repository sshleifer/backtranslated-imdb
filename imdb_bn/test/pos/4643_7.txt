I taped it as a teenager in the middle of the 80's on a summary of a cable guide (Scavansor Hunt Passption I Appeal), this picture has no knowledge or expectation. What a wonderful surprise when I saw it! It was a funny picture and I remember to see it over and over again. I thought that the idea was well implemented, I enjoyed ruthless competition among different groups, and I thought that the Schwanger was quite clever. Sometimes it seems that people have too much expectations for movies. Not all movies are going to have a heavy "message" or starring acting, production quality, or special effects. Sometimes movies are meant to be entertained and fun, and this one is both successful in levels. It was nice to read comments from actors while playing Twin. I have not seen this movie for a few years, but if I think I was as warm and enthusiastic as a teenager, then there was a reaction. Even though I type it, the snippets of cheese are running on my head: "When you start getting midnight madness ... it does not matter what you say, it does not matter to you ..!"
