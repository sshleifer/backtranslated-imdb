Surely the Gershwin family has realized that this is one of America's greatest operas. Thousands of fans are waiting for the DVD to be released. Please do not be so shocking, give us a break. Think of the joy and the surprise, you can get rid of this great GMT and bring it to the hungry public for quality music. Do not wait until the film is over repair. Cast first rate, music is awesome, we need beautiful music in today's world. It can not be reprinted again with such a great cast. With today's home theater system, wonderful sound system and the need for great music, I request the Gershwin family to re-read and release this great movie. Thanks a lot
