This dark black and white slapstick comedy with a dark (but hopelessly addictive) plot is a real crowd that lets you smile (as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief). It is not a matter of great importance in the story of an old train, but it is no big deal that the thrilling part of this film seems to be just a rival to the grand protagonist of Robert Gastfusson. Both his helpless, almost helpless optimistic soldier summoned both compassion and scandinavide to a fashion that is almost like the Choi Chase rival. <br /> <br /> The image that appealed to me the most is that it is impossible and happy to be daily annoying and train travel annoying properly. <br /> <br /> This thriller comedy must have borrowed most "mystery" from Hitcoo and in my opinion, it should be seen only for its comedy quality (which is really high). Alongside the Gastfansen, Lars Amble is worth a price of admission to firm performance as a delightful enemy misogynist. <br /> <br /> Sincerely recommend.
