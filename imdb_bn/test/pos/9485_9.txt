I was a professional musician who was inspired about 20 years ago, after listening to Jimmy Page in Lead Zeppelin 2, to start playing guitar. Although I do not play in the same style or style, the effect of that person has become huge. Now, almost 20 years later, I finally got to see something that I did not see the song very well. Again, I've performed many bands, some small - some current 'master.' No band, no where, by the way you can taste this DVD, you can actually taste the magic. <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Plant may sometimes be a little too long, and you can understand the distraction of the page to forget about the song, but I do not think it is - especially for the era. . Bonham's genius is more aggressive in this album with Zempelin, the band of Joy or Lord Schenk. The JPJ is quite common - but the magic of this DVD plays their four together. The world chose to imagine that they were black magic (K) etc. - it was only the interest of the page. Magic (notice I say this much), this DVD is rarely watched by the rage of 4 young boys who can play wildly, they are not really playing. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> A fast breakdown. The first of two DVDs is where the true magic is. You should be able to feel the power and harassment of their initial day Zep. At the end of the second DVD page, Convarth was fighting with the music of his time. (Until this time there is no secret that he is severely addicted to heroin). So, I would recommend the first disc to a music lover and the second is only for the true Zeppelin fan. <br /> <br /> I'm going away for some guitarists here, but after seeing it I'll say, the page is definitely more creative and inventive than Hendrix. Yes, I said it. And if you do not agree - watch the DVD.
