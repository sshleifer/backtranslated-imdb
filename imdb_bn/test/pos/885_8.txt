I would say: Check out this one out of all modern Korean martial arts movies, price is out. As Musa-The Warriors, it was not epic and did not develop letters, but it was a great idea. Simple story: A elite soldier died in Korea after the end of Japan's reign in Korea during the medieval period. Her opponent was her best friend before and now she stopped him out. The battle scene is for all the sword or with different weapons and very interesting to see. The purpose of the statistics is finally discovered first. You may need to view it again to get all connections right. And I personally ... I love the end. I could see over over again. Maybe a little sad, but the real freedom fighter story ... people can be killed, but the ideas they are not standing ...
