The 2005 version of the Royal Rumble came from the center of the Conservation Center in Fresno, California. WWE's two top championships were being saved, The Undertaker fought Hassenritch in a casual match, Shawn Michaels was taking Edge in an annoying match from October, and of course, the rope of the royal rumble is itself for everyone. Who is going to take this price? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerro? Edge? John Sina? Batista? Edge? Shawn Michaels? There was no lack of claimants. <br /> <br /> It was Batista, which won popular victory in the main event, but not without controversy, or I would say, a closed finish. The two men were the finalists of Batista and John Sena Range. Batista was supposed to dump the young smackdown! The star on the top rope but all went wrong and they both went to throw the floor. The referees acted on their legs as we had our surgical competition like Britt Heart and Lex Luger in 1994. It brought the chairman of the board out. Vinnie's walking on the Mac Ring, but she herself was badly hit on the ring. Vince McMahon sat down and saw the two players do not wait to resume the match. Then Bautista asked him to play in the first round, and Rachelmania trapped Sina by sealing his future with the championship 21. <br /> <br /> The undercurrent for this year was a very solid line up to the Royal Rumble, matching the competition with many WWE's biggest big matches. Each of the brands had two big matches. <br /> <br /> Round Shaun opened at night with a match between Michael and Edge. It was a good technical competition. Back and up until Edge got Pinfall. This was a smart booking decision and kept it as a rival for the World Heavyweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The second round was the end of the match between The Undertaker and Headenaric. The match was not a classic, but then again did they have a classic cassette match? It was entertaining. Especially when Snitsky got involved and Cain popped out of a great pop cassette. Undetector was not surprised by the hedenaric and pouring the lid on this medieval rebellion. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Triple threat match against both the covert angle and the big show This match was very good. Again, a classic but entertaining someone is less. After pinching the cart angle, JBL won. Her celebration was short, but Backstage Teddy Long asked No Way Out to compete with her WWF Championship against Big Show in the Bird Wire Steel Cage match. There is not a nice way to spend Sunday night. <br /> <br /> And certainly there is no show except Punch. Of course, Punch is controlling the World Hewlett Champion Triple H Unforgiven with Randy Orton, its reunion of 2004 was much better than facing the real. This is a sad reason because they simply do not ask to make a good click on the ring and if they do this then it will be a nice conflict. Orton played a very good acting role and defeated the game and went down. <br /> <br /> So 2005's first big one was good. It has achieved its goal. End of hostility and new start. We were now officially on the streets of WrestleMania 21.
