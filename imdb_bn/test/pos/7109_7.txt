This is one of the more unusual plots I've seen in a scary movie, but it's good, based on solid universal studio rentals: many monsters, beautiful heroine, torch-based villagers. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (The Wolf Man) searching for his Lycanthrops remedies. After his death in the original "Wolf Man", he was resurrected and traveled through a search of ways to end his suffering through "Frankenstein Mets the Wolf Man" and "Frankenstein's House". I think the first time viewers will find their search very interesting in this particular movie. <br /> <br />
