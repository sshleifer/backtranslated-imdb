I've completely completed watching this movie for the first time (though I've seen some parts while showing Britain's first scene in the mid-90's), I really believe this is a wonderful composition by the end of the 20th century. Undoubtedly, a movie about this opportunity raises a lot of questions, why there is some descriptive difference between 'Himat' and Harman 60's Harman in this film? For example, in the first film, Harmon has a fairly significant relationship with his grandfather (he pays Harman's electronic music), where his father is not mentioned until the final episode of "Die Jute ...". <br /> <br /> Another point attracts me; During the last episode (Spieler Coming) in the last episode, it has been revealed that Steven won a prize at the Venice Film Festival (Rewez won a prize for Best Debut, for his film "Mahlzeiten"), while reading on Edgar Ritez, I saw the historical analogy between Stephen and I Work); Reitz's film company was called 'Edgar Ritz Filmproduction' and was named after Stephen. Stefan is interested in me as an autobiographical character because he probably likes friends at least from Helga. Maybe, Stephen's Red Harring, I do not know, I know what I like and I want to do more without Michael Henke's "Cache" and Warner's exception. In HarzG's "Grizzly Man" modern cinema, there is no such ambition, myth, and passion. I can not wait to see the number 3 now.
