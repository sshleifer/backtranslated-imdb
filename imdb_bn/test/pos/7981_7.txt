This image where the Batman franchise should be closed. Although I would admit that the "Batman forever" ideas were wonderful and could easily be realized by a suitable director, because it would not have been proven that this event was not there. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> In addition to the statue of hope other than Burton, and to respect the conservative ugliness, Centuries TV series of their next decision, I do not understand how "Batman Returns" can be considered in frustration. True, this is not the same as the first movie - although it fixes all minor deficiencies in the style found in "Batman", it is a weak script that divides the conflicts between the two but not the other three characters. Better comparison of Keaton and Jack Nicholson's great duets like Jackie in the first film. Yet for all this, it is a fantastic dark film, true Batman always meant and congratulated. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton came back with Batman and his changed arrogant Bruce Wayne, Nuwauhu Rich Tycoon Max Shrek (Christopher Walken in honor of German silent actor of 1920), his partner-in-crime-Oswald Kobbalpot, The Penguin (Lancer Olivier "Richard III", Danny Davito on the bright makeup) and Selina Kyle, Ketwoman (Michele Pfeiffer), whom Owen Romance himself And as Batman had both romance. The four principals make excellent performance, especially in Wakeen and Davito, together exploring the dark side of the Keaton and the Peafferer Double Identity. <br /> <br /> There are some playful ideas in this movie. Regarding the only weakness, I can really mention that in some places there is a specific scripture of the script, which I think this movie is most often due to the war in four corners. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I recommend this recommendation combined with the very first, and then weep for the better how the series was continuing under Burton and Keaton.
