A brief history of time. This documentary is cosmic content interesting, inspiring thoughts and people ... bright. Yet I had a hard time enjoying this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way to interview family members and professors seems so irrelevant. These members were interviewed on a specially created set and were given uncomfortable instructions. In most cases their accounts are very acting and strongly operated. (Intentionally) questions included in the question does not include manipulates information in a very rigorous and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is responsible for the interview, but they have done a terrible job and have turned away from the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is good to see an interesting documentary, only to present interesting ideas.
