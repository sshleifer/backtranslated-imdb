I saw this photo in Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. This may be one of the few less popular movies in the festival, but it has become more attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the actors is trying to get involved with himself and his environment after the withdrawal of drugs from the drug, based on the real facts. Moreover, genres playing in the film genuinely revive this experience, for the movie at this moment, which is partly set to play at a stage. Zia Honsenhen's parents are also acting in real life, the methods of expressing their relationships towards Zia are very effective. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some actors in Zia Honseng. At the beginning of the late nineties, the arrest of the Chinese Action Film. After that you can see him in great films like Frogen and Suzhou. In these two career paths, Zia became a drug addict and could do some work or even produce something, but without making a slight effort by guitar Vertuaso. <br /> <br /> I like the author's path after being withdrawn more than the fear of drug addiction. We really feel the pain and struggle in Zia. At the same time, we hate him for the behavior of those around him. <br /> <br /> The image attracts the viewer in a tedious pattern. , Who tried to take care of her, her father and sister dragged with her. Because there seems to be a personal 'interview' with letters that we can know Zia not only through ourselves but also through others. <br /> <br /> This picture has a heavy feeling, but Zia cycling scenes are odd and partial tone light with its friends. So bitter humor in many events throughout the film. The music was beautiful and stayed with me for some time later. It is a film that can not easily appeal to many people, but it is a powerful recommendation for those who are interested in more serious and modern Chinese movies.
