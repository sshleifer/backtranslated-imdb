After all, South Parks should make fun of Republicans by ignoring their comments. Everyone is doing this now, Why is South Park doing the rest of the media in the dark? And what Republicans do is more serious and less fun than Al Gore and its global warming histariari. <br /> <br /> But with this exception, this episode is just fun. Al Gore's screenplay, the politician I saw, should be one of the best characters, it was original, and it was based on people's opinion. I do not want to give anything, but it was hanging me on the floor. <br /> <br /> <br /> I would say that this is one of the best episodes of the show, and I would recommend it to anyone.
