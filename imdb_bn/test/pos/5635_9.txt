When we are young, we all choose the ideal career for ourselves: artists, actors, writers, rocket scientists etc. Although most of us are growing up from the dream of our pipes, but let us go to the main character of American film Mark (and at a thirty-something age): Become a wealthy acclaimed director. Although Morphy's law does not leave Mark alone and seems to be a bit wrong, Mark is able to stay firm with more drives to achieve his goal during each target event. His desire to be a director controls his character so that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to absorb in achieving goals. When I see other IMDB commentators marking Mark's selfishness, I think it is almost entirely selfishness - because of selfishness, not as a famous director for Mark, but equivalent to the death penalty. She remains steadfast about leaving any type of symbol on earth and she sees filmmaking as a way to do this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any viewer in this movie has started with the fact that there is zero opportunity for him to dream of. Is he aware of this? No, not least, and none of his family or friends want to keep him secret (some of them believe in him). Although weirdly enough, the future of frustration in the audience's mind should be sure that Mark does not prevent the power to find humor in this film. This is a very interesting documentary. Most of the smiles come from the filming of Marx "Covene". A scene where an actor has a break in his head, and it is not working. Another scene tells Mark's very old Mama Bill on several lines in the camera; Not saying, more than 20 head cratching and line-stubbing bill finally decided that it had enough. Much of the sadness comes from Mark himself. His script, which he thinks worthy of a Pulitzer, is ridiculously bad: "All right, there is something to be here, Jesus told me." <br /> <br /> "American movie" What people can think of, anyone who can enjoy (even my sister, although some scenes were seen, it seemed that it was suddenly odd). Chris Smith is a film that can be successfully screened, inspired by Mark's troubled lifestyle, to worry about the bill (which unknowingly died before the film was released). It says a lot about him. I wonder how the visionary mark honors this documentary. Does he think that he has put him in bad light? Or is it set up to show him as a fool in many scenes of this movie? Or does he see something that will be shown before his own A & E biography department? This is an exciting thing to wonder, and I hope the next day will be true for him. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
