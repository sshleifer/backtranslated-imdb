Born in 2002, Borne is one of my favorite movies. However, many books of the book have complained that the film was not very small with the plot of this book. <br /> <br /> Assignment is the real agreement. It is odd that no one mentioned this movie on the "Bourne Identity" thread. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> Identity itself. <br /> <br /> The action is completely realistic. I especially like dramatic training training, which was very inventive. <br /> <br /> It seems dark and lively. There are a few wonderful plot twists. Acting is excellent <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can not adequately recommend this movie.
