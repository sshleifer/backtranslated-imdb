I just saw this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and loved it. The summary was listed in our program "An old Shakespeare actor invites his three children to his suicide squad". I was not sure to see it because I could read about it because I knew about it "suicide party" was very interesting to me, but the "old Shakespeare Actors" worried me that the film would be kind and dry and annoying. But I decided to try it. I am glad that I am. It was not at least dry and annoying, that dialogue was great, it was fun in the clever way, but did not rush and did not have difficulty to understand. In this introduction Peter Fox was fantastic, he stole the show. I am surprised by the performance of Laura San Jiaokomo, he usually gets bogged down, but I have enjoyed watching him in this film. I think Judge Reynold's part may have been better than another actor, sometimes he felt impressive and it looked like acting, just as you do not see this character. But the movie was so good that I could forgive an actor's pain. I would recommend this picture to anyone and told some people to see it as soon as possible to the general public. Who knew suicide could be so ridiculous?
