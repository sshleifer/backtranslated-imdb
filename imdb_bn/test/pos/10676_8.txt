This is an excellent Anderson production which compares to the best episodes of the UFO or Space 1999 (first series). Of course, this is not some SFX Extagguna or Star Wars Suedo-Mastik trip festival, but a fine film that is moving slowly, but it refers to the weird, stupid and unusual atmosphere of the best Anderson productions: 'cerebral' sci-fi. Lynn Lauring's voice is awesome. SFX is good for this kind of product and well played as well. Two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun, but instead of home crashes ... or are they? Ah, videofone! The next "next gadget will be in the next decade" and then 40 years later. On the opposite side of the sun, the world's Twin Planet was also returned to Gaimara Daikuzhu Girin (1969), so who was copied?
