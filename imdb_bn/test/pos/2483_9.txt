This uncommon pseudo-documentary created in 1971 captures the Joe Zeitgeist of America today ... which makes it even more grim and relevant. "Subversives" (college students, hippies, black workers, educators) are rounded by the government and how long the crime and social protest protests have been given in prisons for long. As a substitute of life in prison, this "criminal" is guilty of "three-day penalty park" Their aim in the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom is waiting for them. Not surprisingly, the Penalty Park option is a messy lie. This brilliant film by Peter Watkins also has pre-dates for "Battle Royalty" and "Series 7", although the angle of its attack is gradually more political. Shot in '71, it looks like and feels fresh as something like today. For example the performance and direction razer is sharp. The paradigm of the various groups is backward because of the harsh conditions of the park and the trial of McCarthy. Today, this picture still retains its power. In '71, there was nothing like nothing. It is a best composition which is successful on a dozen levels. He has a ball that most people lost today.
