I do not pay much attention to this flashlight until I have learned that Paddy Chefsky - the bright "network" writer - script writer. His work pointed me to his talent, so when I came to the 'hospital' at TMC, I was interested to see it. I was not frustrated. Looking at both this movie and "network", it seems that its big theme is the stupidity, turmoil and cruelty of big human organizations (such as hospitals, networks) against personal experience and the sanctity of humanity, and it is completely black humor a knife edge idea Delivered with. "Hospital" is a "network" as a comedy black, and excellent cast by the extraordinary Scott, his job is to complete justice. This is a keeper; Of course do not miss.
