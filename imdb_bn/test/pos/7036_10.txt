I do not know what it's like about Dirty Dancing There is some magic in this film. I probably could not show hundreds of hundreds (yes, hundreds) that I've finished. But whenever I get it on TV, I enter and keep it secret and sit down and stay there, love for the movie for two hours as I see it for the first time. Although Patrick Soze and Jennifer Gray hated each other with hatred, they have a great chemistry on the set. It enjoys watching this passion and commitment to the viewer much more .. And I can not help until finally burst a little bit, when Patrick arrives in Hausmann's family and tells his father, "Nobody puts someone in the corner". (Classic moments) Small and hungry for those who believe this movie is probably one of the ways, but it was a scandal in 80 films and Patrick Soze was placed directly on the map; His performance was sacred. <br /> <br /> Three cheers for the dance dance !! <br /> <br /> PS-soundtrack is superb, an absolute dancer
