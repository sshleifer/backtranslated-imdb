My friends and I went in some time when we rented a movie which was never heard from us. The only good movie to come out of it was "Restrict the movie" just as the movie started, we can say we were for the real classic. Perhaps the music of rural white boys was made in Colorado, but it sounds like a rap of 90. The star of the ceremony, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, played the bad boy so well, especially the whole movie played the whole movie. This movie is based on the climb, and I'm not a mountaineer, but I think it's more fun when they are struggling to climb the mountain and there's a guy in the background who is primarily 'steep' walking. If you do not want to miss this movie, you will see the same clip again. You will get surprise from every woe. You will find yourself quote the unforgettable line. I highly recommend this movie to anyone by anyone. Take it ice Disclaimer: This movie has been done badly, but that makes it great
