Dennis Leary can indeed be fun and clever at times and may always be desired, but this takes a cake! This show showed the talent of the layer. <br /> <br /> The job has been set in New York. Larry married Mike McNeil, who is a very intimate intelligence detective, has a drug problem and has a girlfriend at times. McNeil has a serious attitude. So she weighing it. Except mechanicals are full of fun, interesting and full-featured characters. Have a nice cast too All of these show episodes are really fun and addictive. These shows are everywhere in one liners. You will be stitched after listening to them and after a few minutes they will laugh a few minutes later. There are other things to hide the cases related to printing, bathing hostage situation and above. This show was very good. Many seasons can get permanent feet. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A great, fantastic show. I miss this show in love. All episodes of this show are great. You get even belly-laughs ... a lot. ABC made a huge mistake with this room. Very poor Leary cable does not revive the show for TV. Still, I'm one of my highest recommendations on this show. One of the really one of the kind shows.
