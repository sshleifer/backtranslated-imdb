John Carpenter Thing Things is featured under the worst horror film of all time. Not only that, but this is my best favorite of all time favorite movies. What makes the movie so great? It's hard to keep my fingers. Everything seems to work in Things, it's one of the rare cases where everything seems to fall in the right place. Mudi is better than film alien than the best of atmospheric hen. It's not only Gore (which is not surprisingly BTV), but it is capable of creating a pano that is unfinished in the film. Really truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all the awesome buffs, and anyone has good taste in the film.
