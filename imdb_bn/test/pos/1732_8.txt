I only saw Doctor Hughes in the last finale of the season 2, and this show is an extraordinary episode as well as this show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> This is a tragic loss that we say once again to a major character in the season. The final but the ceremony continues. <br /> <br /> To increase the budget on BBC shows, there may be a lot of things happening in London and in the surrounding areas. Apart from having some impact on very important issues, the strange program will be even more smooth. <br /> <br /> It was a huge gambling for the BBC to bring back a lost show. It's a long way before and congratulations to them. <br /> <br /> Christmas 2006 Specially Roll, 2005 was the best thing in Christmas special television.
