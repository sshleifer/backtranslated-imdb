Since 1950, there are a handful of thrillers about the diamond and infectious diseases of some smugglers from abroad. Evelyn Kiss pulls all the stops out as the essential victim of this film-hero. Once in the US, he was not aware that he could spread the disease with everyone and he could contact him with any contact. Finally he must follow and stop before an epidemic happened. Other than what's interesting, others are well supported by villains Charles Corvain, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Alabarite, and Whit Bissell. With Finland's spotlight and hundreds of spectators, a threat to Miss Kies over a building's borders. A good b flush!
