Wang watched Kara-Y's other films (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Time Ashes), I knew what to expect in the theater; While cinematography will be pleasing, the use of space and perspectives will be different, the acting will be fantastic, and at least one of the characters will be consigned by an unacceptable loneliness. This, after all, is precisely the strategy that Wong Kar-wai's art does on it. What I was hoping was a degree that I could draw in a movie that some critics were rejected as "incomplete" and forced by the letter "Feeling Hungry by Announie" <br /> <br /> I can be so disgusted by a movie that is interesting that many of us express feelings and settings, and many of us may forget or forget: the awesome feeling of error, better than betrayal The crime arising out of the thought of becoming; The deepest innermost moment in relation to relationships, where verbal expression is absolutely essential. Wang Kar-Y has been trying to portray this movie and achieve that much good. <br /> <br /> A lot of Americans are eaten every minute of a movie filled with stock dialogue; Wicked rebels, hostile satire and exaggerated confessions may seem to offer the "best" American film. Wong Kar-wai shows things very differently. Wang's characters are clearly identified by their feelings and understanding touching the face, body position, and yes, silence, rather than the characters that are not known about the feelings, perception or perceptions of the audience. <br /> <br /> If viewers only consider the film from the point of view of character development and action, then they may be frustrated by what they have suggested. If they are willing to try themselves and realize the feelings of the characters, then they may think differently about what they can offer them.
