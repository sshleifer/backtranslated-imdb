I'm not a big TV person ... but when I saw the Greek episode, I could not wait until next week! I miss the show to do nothing! <br /> <br /> Thanks for the DVR! LOL I love Cappie ... She works like a bad boy, but she is so sweet ... Everyone has their own character, so we have a lot of people in all sorts. You can still cast a Hispanic and cruel people. <br /> <br /> I did not go to school in the US, so I do not like the views of broken rooms and stuff, so when my husband told me about the show that I did not pay attention, until he wanted to see me and I was good I did not say to work, so I agreed. I smiled so hard on the first night that I needed to see it. <br /> <br /> I am with other people who voted for this event! I hope, second, third and who knows more about the episode! This is a really good show, very fun and entertaining!
