It can not be considered as a movie review, but when I was a young man, I just published a comment on a movie. I felt ashamed of what I saw after coming home in the evening. I tried to retrieve my parents' part of the story, but if they understand well, then that the love between two children's boyfriends fell and grew up together and was so weird about two children who were born. You'll be convinced now that I'm referring to Blue Legoon (1949) which has disturbed me and annoyed me for some years (about 50), and now this movie has expressed concern and hate about who or who has hampered the film. Cassette or dvd or whatever. I have got a chance to hold it for a day, and nobody knows about it. What a waste really! Sorry my english is not all technical or scientific, but my mother tongue is Spanish. I am doing my best to understand myself. Thanks, my name is Juan and I am writing from Uruguay in S.America.
