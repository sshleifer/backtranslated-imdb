I was very interested in Antomi (Una Antoomi) and if I was going to see it, then I would have to buy it, since this movie did not carry any video store in my area. Since it was not a low priced DVD, I took a chance and thought that I would keep an eye on the other comments of IMDB. Most of the comments did not give me enough hope to make a huge amount of money for a film that I have never seen and there was no source of that. I got a sexy youth-based roaming concept compared to most cookie-cutting teen thrillers. Well, some of my mind behind me ignored such comments and bought it! I, and I was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If this is going to compare any other film, I would say it is a variety of coma and extreme measurements. I can not compare films like screams, urban legends, etc. Yes, cast young (because they are Medicaid students! At least they are not increasingly annoying high school type characters), and yes, some lively (originally played by Anna Anna Lousse and it is managed) quite well in the German language version), but Anatomy is well-built, has an exciting mood of life, amazing set up, makeup effects a carrier and frog Ka patenenta very credible in his introduction. I have enjoyed myself even though some of the plots are in the hole! The story of a student who is still discovering a secret society for automobiles of living patients is a vague phenomenon and what is happening next to patients is quite tricky. Sure, you can ask why did he just leave that town? OK, but then the film will end in half. <br /> <br /> This was the first attempt from the German part of the Columbia film, and it is actually quite impressive. There was little care in the production and in fact some of the genuine thrills were a success. It is somewhat mature in mind, because it does not adopt for sexual violence (breast festivals) or teenage drug abuse opportunities. The character of Anna Luos, often when looking for sex comments and some fun, was actually a nice touch - having a character that was more intelligent than a woman in school. He saw that the gender was simply a confusion for him and for the lack of men. Important ingredients: This is the best way to enjoy this movie with English or French subtitles in the original German language. I saw dietary trailers in English and got annoyed with the change in vowel. I have never seen the dubbed movie right in my life - they never find the voice of the film's actors or characters. Certainly, I have tried to see some kind of dandamic language in English and its intelligence level has been severely reduced, it seems more like a comedy. A good example is that, when a man shouted and shouted loudly and cried out in Germany - he heard it, he was scared, but dubbing in English, he made a sound like a comedian. Actually, people feel ill when they hear that they can not read subtitles or see a "letterboxed" movie. Anatomy stops stupidly with W.D. Voices, which makes octigues more appealing to anyone who you see in the movie, and Ano Luos' sexual comments quickly sound like awful comments such as Rigmeynt High in Fast Times. Negative comments about Anatomy are from those who watched it, if it does not look like the same movie! This is not a cheap horror film and it can be seen as being made. These English subtitles feature some of the features and "complementary" supplements. Please note that when I became active, I got jamel with antimimy and won. It does not try to have a capable thriller with the desired characters and the cheap thrill.
