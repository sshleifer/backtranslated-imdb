I really liked Lord Traci. She can not be the world's greatest actress but she is rather good at this. He is a 'T' weak, conservative, reporter's game. It's a great little thriller that keeps you guessing a good time. Jeff Fahey Tracy's boss as well. I think a decent break can be given to Traci as a top actress. She is certainly worse than some of today's leading women.
