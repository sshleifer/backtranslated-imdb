In this modern period (what is the issue about Germany's counting?), The politically correct films are "Litmotiv" of the projects of modern young filmmakers. At the time of the WWI, the "shoulder arms" directed by Charlie Chaplin (which was released only a few weeks before the surgery) was a brave example of early pioneers of the film, why a brave man! It was a complicated thing to handle a ridiculous film inspired by the terrible, bloody first world war that only a few directors could be allowed to do with those dangerous and bold ideas? The venture on such fine enterprise and success was reserved for geniuses only. <br /> <br /> This German count, "Shoulder Arms" was created during WWI, during which time the world completely lost its innocence (thankfully the German fat heir of this elite class ??) and it is a war for any Ridiculous, innovative social mocking. This film is full of gorgeous gagan and entertaining movies for a story where this tram is risky and will have a brave brave face in front? Whether a hero for friendship? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Did not mention that Kaiser got many medals on his uniform ??) It is impossible to overcome a miracle of a movie even today in an elegant, fun and fine way. Remember that terrible wartime, hard work only thanks much to creativity and talent. It was obviously too much for Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br /> And now, if you permit me, then I will temporarily take my leave because this German county must return to the Scholls train. <br /> <br /> Her graph is Ferdinand von Galligazen http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
