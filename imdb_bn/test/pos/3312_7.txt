Although the date, this film is definitely worth a watch. When I opened it as a teenager almost eight times and it changed my life ... I just lived in New York. Johnny Mathew has a major startup shot in Manhattan's skylines, "Romance is still ... everything is best ...", which is the West Side Story competitor. Instead of the real world's first supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry, jones D.), rather it's a great performance. In the late 1950s, its insights were given in America - our passion for sex (and at work, at least!), Romance, and marriage before the release of women. It represents an era which is its best in New York and a super-malicious demonstration of Joan Crowford's only cake cover.
