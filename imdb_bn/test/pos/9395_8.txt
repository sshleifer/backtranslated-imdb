Well, language stewart Gordon's film is not easy to get out of the film "Death Bid" a few years ago, because it's "The Beat It's". And how do I start to describe this? Well, for the start, obviously eats a bed. This is the result of the giant tiarrupp, which certainly affects most things, I think, in a negative way. Some old quarters of the bed or something of the bed, and its time is responsible for the disappearance of several people. We have a narrator, who is sitting in the back wall of a ghost and collects all non-edible pieces (jewelry etc.) beside the bed. He died because of eating, not lying on some bed in some of the people, he was probably not sick, because he saw him bloody blood hacking ... It has a very strange idea about the movie, but it played all the beautiful stereotypes. The film has been divided into several "works", I guess, "breakfast, lunch, dinner and just desserts". For strange weird and weird fans, well, this may just be your gloom. I can say that you will see it to believe it, it nicely denies the description. 8 out of 10.
