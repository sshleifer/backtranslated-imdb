This film is the best horror film I have ever seen. The plot was great, the plot twists were even better and the cast was great. It is hard to believe that they compiled the most unknown people 8 years ago and they will be a big name today! <br /> <br /> Plot is easy. 4 teenagers have their car destroyed in the middle. What they should stumble on in this campusite and everyone in the accident. Create a fire and tell horror stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "Even if you do that." Great opener Anyone in high school heard the diversity of this story on some other night. But they make it good in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "Honeymoon." OK, it was not the best of 4. It was quite good and you will see some fools. Some of the words "Emphisis" This is just the story of your basic animals. <br /> <br /> 3 "People can do too much." It's careful about what's happening in internet chat rooms across the country. This segment is only needed to see parents, who have internet access to children. <br /> <br /> 4. "Pendant." Now this best movie is the best story. A motorcycle broke a guy and this muted girl goes home. Very good plot twist <br /> <br /> The original plot, "Campfire" has the biggest and best twist in the whole movie. I would not say because I do not want to destroy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> could not write, br> direction: A + <br /> <br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> Overall: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to more than 13 people, "People can leak to." The child needs access to any parent's internet Need to see it with their child.
