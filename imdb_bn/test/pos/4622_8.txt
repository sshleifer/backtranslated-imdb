Many other viewers say that this is not a good movie because they think that it is not "realistic". How it can not be considered realistic. They think that it is not easy to relate the part of the crime, it is not common. I can guarantee you that you have met more people than you did because of a brutal behavior. Many of them are not going to come out and tell it, and most of these victims Also, many people are gay and still the closest, because they do not know what they like, they know they will be ridiculed and perhaps abandoned. And tell me, how many children have you been pregnant or have food disorders? I bet a lot, and although pregnancy does not come mostly from turmoil, it is still easy to relate. Who can not be reluctant to be frustrated or stupid? That happens all the time. And many visitors are probably concerned with learning as Marx. Having a stoner seems pretty common these days. There are so many things related to it. Though more than rest, as much as you can be popular, you feel invisible or alone, do not notice, do not give up as a victim of suicide, how do you feel about how you can relate to the movie? I have seen that the movie might seem vain for others, but I want to think it as important. It's an interesting way to show suicide and be aware. It does not show their unhappy thoughts, they come from very amazing people. Those who show up the problem sometimes may commit suicide, but when you hear of suicide, those who were supposed to be guided by it usually go through the minds of most people. <br /> <br /> Finally, it surprised me, I was not expecting it to be the girl until finally, most of the scenes were an extra, and not even started. The story is even narrated in its description, about 6 teenage life, when it was actually 7. My only real disappointment was that it was not one of the characters that we have learned, it seems to be the only real victim that some random chicks were in vain to watch the movie. Until I get more thinking. It is a huge surprise to create the perfect knowledge, since that is like suicide. Plus, the other students had more reasons than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Although there are some bad points in this movie, but most of the movies have some, but I would recommend this movie as long as you can deal with the sad moments of suicide, and violence and superstition shown in this movie.
