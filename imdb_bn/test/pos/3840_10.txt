This is one of my favorite films, never. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Compared to other Disney films of the ages, this film never encourages viewers. 101 Dalmatians, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they all were good, but the lack of what we have here. This is fun, creative, and always targeted. There is only one additional thing in this movie that you can not learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the story of Brilliant Tony. But it is followed by a respectable second, The Lady and Tremp immediately. Just watch it and enjoy one of the movie's greatest achievements. And by, I'm not a small kid, for this older audience is seeking to restore their childhood. An absolute must!
