My family really enjoyed this movie. The film is as rugby as possible for the United States ... well I'm sure that will be controversial. But both me and others around me, I know that after watching the film we were more interested in sports and personally I earned more respect for playing. You can imagine how this is possible, especially since the film does not sink and explains rugby. But in general it gives you a sense of player and play and emotional emotions. The film was inspirational as well as inspirational. It made us smile and cry. Chemistry has done a good job among San Austin, Big Budah and Shan Faris. Some people think that the movie is a little small, but I seriously make more movies to Hollywood. I could not help playing the parable of game and life struggle. At the end of this I tried to test myself for my own life so that I could do good, so that I could be the best person I could be. Sincerely, I was grateful to learn the moral, values ​​and teamwork, but there is a lot to it. After watching this I really hope my kids coach is coached who have a visit like Gelix.
