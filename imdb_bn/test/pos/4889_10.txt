I'm addicted to TV shows, live shows and whatever they are. And they were the last work in TV / film 'The League of Gentleman'. <br /> <br /> If you love the series you absolutely love the film. This is a nice ending of their TV series. <br /> <br /> It's tricky and fun. <br /> <br /> Although it does not focus on some popular characters, it is very good to see all the characters together with the authors. A Gentleman fan will see a league. See it! <br /> <br />!
