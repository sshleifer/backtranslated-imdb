I love this show! It's amazing ... even if I saw it already I could not miss an episode. Perfect for the part of the actress ...... I love the girls in the guild! I've gotten all my friends to see it Even their parents now watch it. I see it every day and usually I see it once a day. I wish my mother was like Lorelei. My friends say that I speak and act like Loreriy. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. This is a great teen show because they can learn from seeing it actually. My vocabulary ranges from watching obscene girls. Suitable for Lorraine Graham and Alexis Blood El Lorelie and Rory parts. I think Les and Lorelai should get married because Chris Lorrelli and Rory have been over many times. And Lorelei's heart was broken too many times.
