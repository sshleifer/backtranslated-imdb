In my never-ending quest to see as many quality films as possible in my lifetime, I shook the cable in this movie. I tried Whitcak three times this time, and I never felt that the work of the person he was receiving was for the praise. I was always good, I was not good (from what I saw) It was his best movie I saw. Robert Walker was absolutely cool, his performance film wanted to go to Hitchcock. Even an average performance here is the overall product damage. My favorite scene was his emotions about getting a lighter from the drain (how much did he get his arm down?) Bruno is a pretty impressive character, but I like the character of Patricia Hitchcock like Barber. In addition to the Morton family, Guy was somewhat dry and boring, but he added some sculptures in the film, as well as got some good script lines. <br /> <br /> Finally, no doubt movie, you're going to live and die by your end. This one holds water, I saw a couple other hitcouch films. I was really uncertain how it would end, kept me on edge when I saw and watched.
