Lady and Trump II are very colorful animated, and songs, especially the junkyard dogs, quite well. However, the family feels even very idyllic, and I can not help understand the skamp offensive when everything is banned. However, I also feel very proud of Angel, until he was Jim Loving and Darling had never met a loving family. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
