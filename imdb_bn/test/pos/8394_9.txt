I grew up with air nut, but I was disappointed that both the movie and scarlett are different from the small series of books with the wind. There are many things left in the film with the wind in the film and they did the same with Scarlett. Both were good movies, but I really liked two books well. Many characters from Scarlett were left, and some characters do not seem to match the age book. The time line does not match. Scarlett has understood the book being pregnant by the ship in Ireland, but she can understand when she returns to Savhahnna. Also, an ugly monkey was created like Sally's book and the film played to act as Genie Smart, which is probably not an ugly woman. Above all, Scarlett is a good film and it helps anyone who gets disappointed in the ending with wind, if Margaret Mitchell writes himself in a series, see what might be.
