A retired old rich opera setter set in Paris in 1910, decided to give up his fate to his cat's creeps (Voice of Eva Gaber) and his children, but the jealous Butler Eleven came up with a plan to kidnap his cat. And leave them in the countryside. Thankfully, with the help of Thomas O'Mallie (Phil Harris's Voice) with the help of an independent tomate on the road and try to foil with some good friends like Swing Skit Cats (Voice by Scammon Croshers), with the help of their help. Edgar plans <br /> <br /> The animated movie, "Everybody Wants to Be a Cure", is a very entertaining and wonderful post-Walt Disney death episode, and some great animations for this, computer animation, even during this time. Not one of the best Disney animated films, but Disney is one of Disney Animated Fav and one of its gems that works well, highly recommended.
