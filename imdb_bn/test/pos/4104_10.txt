It can be a remake of the cinema 1937 movie, but it is only wrong to think that way! This Hilton novel was published completely differently. Excellent as a musical. The scenery is horrible, the characters are good and "Leonard Multin", anyone who thinks the song is too horrible, it should be completely deaf! I firmly recommend it
