I thought it was going to be a lousy movie, frankly, Rupert Grint, Ron, Harry Potter, acting in a different movie, it was really hard to portray the picture. But after the film began to show, this guy has a talent, that is, HP is the best actor of three, for references, are you trying to play Emma Watson? Or what about Daniel's acting? Although they played in a million Harry Potter films, both of them lack experience. Ben, his character is a very shy boy, inconsolable to his real feelings about everything, angry anger against his ruling mother and his father, who can not resent the resignation of resigning and facing his unfaithful wife. Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! When trying to remember Shakespeare's Sonatas, it is absolutely surprising to try the old retired actress to live with her shadow. Also, it seems that many young people are lost in religious dirty work.
