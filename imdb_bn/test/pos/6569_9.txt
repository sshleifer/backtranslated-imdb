"Uzumaki" takes place in a small Japanese rural town, where people are going crazy. They go nuts on subsidies and spirals. The crisis is getting worse, because people roam around and the vaults are present everywhere. "Uzumaki" I've seen the most bizarre and original horror films. This plot really is cute and the cow's scenes are really interesting because this picture does not take very seriously. "Uzumaki" is photographed nicely and uses color-top-genuine. Letters are equivalent to and have amazing surprises enough to satisfy Japanese awful fans. Despite some sunny scenes, the overall tune of this movie is quite dark. "Uzumaki" "Ringu", "not as good as JU-ON" or "Audition", but if you like the Japanese horror movie you will not be disappointed 10 out of 7
