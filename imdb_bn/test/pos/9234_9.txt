This is a very funny movie. A self-immersion, there are icons that are very interesting in the movie. Characters are interesting. The film flows very well and holds your interest in 1 hour, the film's 50-minute period Film quality is not the highest Hollywood standard; But the original film should have been made in a great punk-rock style style. The film effort is very well detailed and easy to follow, and the documentary about the subsequent betrayal of filmmakers is easy. Original filmmakers have become their main characters in the documentary edition of the film. Film-makers and actor interviews have gathered in a very entertaining story that struggles in creating original movies, the last failure of the original project, and this Phoenix-like document is growing in the movie as well as from Ashes. In my opinion, there was much more interesting and entertaining films than the original (Treason Texas Tel) original film (Waldo's Hawaiian Vacation). Two thumbs up for good work done.
