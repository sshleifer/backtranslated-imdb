Riffi has been mentioned significantly for the famous haute scene, and, in fact, that scene is eligible for all credits. It's a masterful piece of mystery, character interaction and photography. But the rififf is not just this scene - it is not just teaching the film together, and entirely, the film is not taught only with mystery, plot and character, but it is a moral story set for the scene, silent film silence over the years. <br /> <br /> Cinematic and technically, the histricic sequence may be one of the most impressive scenes of the film, but for me, this is the final scene that holds the maximum power - to the Halcyonogenic release of Tony Le Stefanos.
