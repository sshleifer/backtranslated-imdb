This is a defender if you want to shoot western shots. I thought the movie was fun to watch and people who were not seen in a while. I have no expert but I like acting. Cities and types of cities and types of temps etc that would be found on the border were fit. This is a Western, not enough public and budget. Clothing and firearms were right for time! I hope to see young actors again in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebecca and Kei were great. Members of the SAAS (Single Action Shooting Society) contributed to this effort were very good. Hope to see more.
