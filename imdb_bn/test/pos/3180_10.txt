I remember coming home from school and before coming, it was a black family story that took place in the group of Hito-up class, the family was named Wilson Frank Wilson, with his own business business, his wife was a bank manager with 3 teenager Kevin Valerie And Marcus was there. It was a very good show. It was educated with being out of circulation. The show was well written. This show focuses on a successful African American before we can see Casino. From the role of Aast, many of the black actors were present at the show, from David Howard to 227 Stonehenge Jackson. If you are able to find this show on DVD then you will get it for your whole family
