I love this movie, although I do not like how they portray the Egyptian, myself as an Egyptian citizen! That's why it makes 10 to 8 earnings. <br /> <br /> Relationship between Augustine and leopard is painful, and of course due to loneliness and for a long time living in that cave, he creates a kind of craze and the passion of the leopard. <br /> <br /> When a leopard dies, very sensitive view, Agustin will respond. <br /> <br /> I think it's enjoyable for everyone, and I look forward to reading short stories by Balzac.
