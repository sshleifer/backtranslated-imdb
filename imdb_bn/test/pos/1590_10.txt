Satisfy every moment of this strong philosophical accompaniment with music (5th is great in the mansion, but to listen to the 3rd symphony's voice in this movie). There are many aspects of this film, but the main thing is the powerful power of beauty, its spontaneous nature, the absence of reasoning for love and loyalty. I am a bright fan of Bogdar and I believe he was rarely surprised (but try him as a "slave"). Note: I recommend multiple visits.
