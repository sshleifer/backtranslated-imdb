I am currently living in an Australian Japan. I saw this movie on TV here and was very much impressed by the accuracy and honesty of the Western and Japanese ideological skeptics. Anyone who wrote scrapplele and directed this film must have a better knowledge of Japan's desire to be a foreigner. The only part I thought was Hollywood - when Tom Selleck's character kissed the woman in the middle of her office and she gave him a kiss. The display of affection is not really acceptable here. Finally a movie that truly shows the 'Gaiazin' experience! 9/10
