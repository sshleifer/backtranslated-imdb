A real surprise "Disney" is not entirely family entertainment. Some violence, a long time, and a great story, are actually based. The theme of "Night Crossing" is a firm determination. Never lose their purpose, they are at risk of escaping their brave balloons until independence of the two East German families. Both of the stories are annoying and heartwarming. The time is not beside them. The East German Police is the last and the end, far from the result. If you are looking for a good evening entertainment, have any nudity, and limited violence, then I highly recommend "Night Crossing". This is pure entertainment. - Mr.
