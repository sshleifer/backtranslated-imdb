This is the most fun show on TV today. It marks 99% of the time. Generally after a few years of watching a sitcom, the actors become cartoonists, as if they want to play favorite characters. This role of my actor has been true in their roles. There is still chemistry, writing has gone down and I'm looking forward to seeing it still. Family dynamic seems still real, and after this moment the situation has not come so far that the authors seem to have reached an empty bag trying to keep showcased for another season, except that I see some shows are remote for me to switch fast.
