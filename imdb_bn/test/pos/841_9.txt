"Female Curse Scorpio - Beast Stable", the third in the series, is an excellent part of the decoration riddle. Compared to other Scorpion entries, Nicos Ats is violent, pink and spontaneous and it is uniquely photographed, operated with brilliant enthusiasm, and is full of gallery by villains of villains and degenerates. The first installment director Shinya Ito, who started with this Scolian (Meiko Kazi), came back for the fiction with a hand drawn hand on her forehead and fleeing to the Tokyo subway. She takes refuge in a red light district where she shares her friendship with prostitution, which is first seen in her obscene sexual relationship with brother (which ends her growth). Scorpio's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually showed his identity and all the abyss broke. She is beaten, sexually harassed, and a vicious bird is locked inside the cage in the villain's layer. I like everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic, and emotionally-touched movie. It is the first of three first Scorpio films and the other is a great visual feature. I can not recommend extremely high.
