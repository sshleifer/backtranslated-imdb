Before cutting the film, I do not completely agree with one of the critics' opinions. After reading the book, it is being influenced by it although it is a kind of literature that you really can not like (like Hobart Sellby's writing) I'm hoping to be disappointed but the effect was even more subtle than that. Hobart is a brilliant actress who has managed to reveal multi-layered character in Isabella. His scenes completely draw attention to him and his subtle change and I can imagine some actors who neglect so much for their acting or images, who will do so well. These coolness, distance, cruelty and at the same time have this helplessness, injury and pain. There is a person who is regulated and controlled at the same time. Maybe it's not realistic - even though you read the newspaper, you'll be worse off - but it's true that it's hard to carry. I think this is a great movie but I did not enjoy watching it. It's not annoying but I wanted to finish it. BTW, his male counterpart has played very well (and I like it well).
