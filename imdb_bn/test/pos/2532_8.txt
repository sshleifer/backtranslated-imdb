I have been reading a Brazilian movie since 2004, when I pushed towards "Sided de Deos / City of God". I say to you that this movie is probably better than "the city of God" or better. <br /> <br /> This movie creates a unique experience under the influence of acting, cinematography and music. I'm not going to Brazil yet, but this movie presents a harsh reality that is in front of Sao Paulo citizens. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy good movies then I recommend this movie. This movie is annoying and you can feel a little frustrated after watching it. <br /> <br /> Whatever you want to see, but you will not go to sleep.
