If you really have a good Jack Black movie, then a little bit jerky, and then added a Dash of Texas Censo Genocide and a 1000 Dosh home ... to be your Monster Man! I went to this movie, not really expecting much, but I really enjoyed the movie. The whole compound is really Chess, a demon truck chase down a man of man, but it's so funny that the writer / director does not expect you to take it seriously. Justin Uruch should have a comic gem and a very committed career. She is the same as Black Jack. The only problem with the film is the incredible hero role played by Eric Jongman. But overall, if you really look for a really fun movie, you'll crack up until you roll in it and at the same time, you will be scared of shy ... see this movie.
