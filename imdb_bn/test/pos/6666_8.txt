Kevin Speacy is again elected as the winner with K-Pax, a romantic film that expresses the deepest manifestation of man's existence through the stupidity of proto-characters, but at the same time, it is also foolishly wise, from perspective. <br /> <br /> It does not extend as enjoyable plot as 'he is not or he is not out' and flashed out the character of Robert Porter. But some may end up being dissatisfied, but in reality it can not be any other way. <br /> <br /> Some of my problems with the film are turning around rather simplified images of cartoonists and psychiatric patients. I was surprised because the film's plot shows a lot of intelligence and I do not think it lost anything by being more honest about how to deal with mental health problems. <br /> <br /> It was a movie and was not a documentary and the film itself shot nicely and the story was unexpectedly at a delightful rate. <br /> <br /> The bridges are superb and spacious, providing a lazy and stable performance, and a stand up from an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that will talk to your friends.
