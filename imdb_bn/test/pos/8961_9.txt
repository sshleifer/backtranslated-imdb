I'm not quite sure about this movie, but I can tell you that I had full entertainment about this movie. Playing perfectly by Philip Simmur Hoffman, the cow's character was one of the most unique, yet entertaining characters in recent memory. This movie says that the audience is managed to avoid publicity. It made me laugh, made me sad, thought me alive, and was happy to spend time watching movies. It does not take any time to understand what's going on, and you take real, human emotional roller coaster ride. I knew my history, apparently I do not know it all! I give this step 9 out of 10, and recommend it to all adults, and young adults and young people, not just young. But as soon as they are allowed to see the rated rating movie, it is a priority.
