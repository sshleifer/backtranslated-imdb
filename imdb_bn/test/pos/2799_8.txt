After watching this movie, what I wanted to do was see again (because I missed a lot of smiles). I am European and I studied abroad and lived with Spanish, French, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which is often not much, P *** was closed, and I saw other reviews that I saw it stopped by P ***. But, the film gets stereotype so I can not blame. The French man is a drunken party, without the means of being a beast. English people were the perfect "Geezer" stereotype. Drunk, annoying, insulting but shines through the end. Besides, the psychological aspects of the film are also correct. She is shy at first, nobody knows, she wanders in the house, does not know the way around her. As time progressed, it became his home and when it came time it is very difficult. One can understand only the feeling they've experienced it. I highly recommend this film.
