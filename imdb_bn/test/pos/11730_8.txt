This is how Boo Reynolds describes this movie, which can be the best of all time. He plays a Vice-spy in search of his way from Tom Sharky, who is financing from an international detective (Bhartio Gassman) and the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holman). In William Daiell's novel, the story is more complicated because the President runs for him. This is a very long film, which seems to be more than three hours instead of two. The filming in the city of Atalanta and the Peachtree Plaza Hotel is just right for that story. Reynolds does not make such a lot of humor in comparison to his comedy movies. He is very serious here, especially at the beginning of the film because he was demoted for the dope bag to make a mistake. Frequently, the film works more dramatically as a dramatic drama than a crime film, as well as trying to approach the woman of Martster. At the end of the film, violence decreases, which becomes cold bang. The sharking machine with a lively sketchy scarf by Darling Larry Skinner is a superb urban jazz soundtrack that includes Chest Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim and Body de Franco, The Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughn and Joe Williams. Al Capps manages scores with magic. This movie has sometimes become one of the best crime dramas. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8 scores
