One of the best shows ever made, and it gets better with age. <br /> <br /> For me, the main reason is the English adaptation adopted by David Weir. <br /> <br /> One of my Japanese friends once told me that the show is more radioactive and less flat-out in the language that we all know. <br /> <br /> This show is so strong for its non-Japanese fans, I think, due to Mr. Way's inspiration and some winning voice-over work. <br /> <br /> Well, sir!
