This picture was awesome! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both pulled it off. Toss Smith was so funny as cousin, and he could not stay away from his business. When her daughter needs her, keep it down for her girl. Alma was sweet and played a dear grandmother, she really reminded my grandmother. And oh, I can not forget about the stripper, she was very happy, and I do not know when I cover my eyes or smile, she shows her sexuality on the big screen. He was good Tangi looked flawless, and sexy, and she stepped up a notch from Felicity. There were many "A" list actors and actresses all over the movie. It was funny, sexy, crazy, touching, loving, emotional and wonderful. This movie must see a must! If it is not, go to the DVD now!
