Two Australian girls' film - Debi (Nell Scofield) and Mama (Suit) - and when they became friends of two surfers, <br /> <br /> In 1981 Technically I was still a teenager (I was 19 years old) so I was interested in watching Australian Terra. Script wise There's nothing new here. It shows teenage events related to dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what was going to happen before but I was never bothered. I found what I liked, despite the pronunciation and some changes in clothes and hair, these thirteen Americans were not much different than the teens. They had a lot of the same problems and hang-ups. It is also a real surfer girl and based on a book of her true living and (I heard) it was a trusted adaptation. Acting was just right but the actors were attractive and this was well made and quite interesting. So it's not an inappropriate masterpiece, but it's a nice screenplay, like teenagers and trying to stay with popular kids. I give it a 7.
