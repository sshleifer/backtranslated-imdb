It is very easy that people who do not know the movie below say "decent" below. "The Dell Master" rarely creates horrific and suspicious scenes from outside Asia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the first rate, acting first rate, first rate Set and Effect <br /> <br /> It's okay with the best Asian horror movies; Ring, dark water and a tail of two sisters. <br /> <br /> is an absolute must. <br /> <br /> <br /> Get a name from a guy who knows his movies.
