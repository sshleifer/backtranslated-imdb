Van Voyage is fun for the viewers because it combines the necessary silliness with a comedy with enough levels to keep the audience engaged actively and invest in the results. Although most important, the film is historically educational; This is the tension of the so-called "Phoenix War" and later, before the German invasion, the French elite flew away from Paris. Yet Van Voyage is a "fight movie." This is a comedy about the life of some people against the extraordinary time backgroup. A nation of collapse of forest voices declares a wide range of French reactions in chaos, confusion, and emotional redemption and new political order. This film is a comedy that entertains the audience, a romance that uses many clich√©s efficiently, and whose country often collapses.
