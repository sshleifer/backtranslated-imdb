An extraordinary movie, when I felt so much, I had all the kind of feeling of patronage. I liked it, and elton John Music When I was young, I saw in movies, and for some reason (limited release?) I never knew anyone who saw this picture during the liberation war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have never left me in a few decades ago, and after seeing this film again I have completely withdrawn, but I acknowledge that my children (in 20) Did not experience similar emotional experiences. Is a generational thing? <br /> <br /> Why is it not a DVD?
