This movie was a riot, it's all about fun of "Madonna - true or brave". I love Madonna and love Julie Brown. How can I learn more .. Julie's "bliss" fool, the headline "Vague" was violent. "Kelly Leckock thinks she's cool, She's just cool on a paper plate." "Brooke Shields, Doubler, Palm Personality Spam" !! I died! And wait until he can do with watermelon !!
