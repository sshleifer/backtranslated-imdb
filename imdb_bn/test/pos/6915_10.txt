Inforne gives Los Angeles what he owe - a baptismal fire, death from above. A nice cast of obscure characters can survive and the corneal mass may sweat out of the loss of emissions, but it is not funny and of course dramatic.

So, we apologize for not being in the heart of the fascist president and other bigger baffdom statics "heart warming" because they integrate integral plots to save the selected residue (Ala Deep Impact) of mankind. Here sweat-busted and passion-driven dirty half-dozen perform their own redemption or face the old fashioned way of their personal abstraction - together at the person or ...... alone alone Excellent TV Film in all. Sophisticated Network Execution is definitely not denatured by the destructive meddlesomness. I highly recommend it.
