Universal studio. This name has given many memories to the deadly fans of beautiful paintings ... er ... landscapes, fencing, full moon, haoling wolves, barn and torch drivers. Yet, going back to this movie is quite strange, how many years the true classics have been. It was the best compilation of 30's, but most of those who were from the same director and most of them today are mostly historical interests. More than 40 'silly' mother language films have been produced, it is higher than the industry, and most fans acknowledge that the classic era of Gothic horror films ended in 1945 with the 'House of Dracula', it embarked on with Abbott and Castello comedies and formally 50 After the death and the advent of the nuclear era. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that probably the 50th Gospel of Universal was made! That alone makes the film a curiosity, since the costume plays were out of their way everywhere. It may not always be comparable to the classic like James Hellowon and 'The Wolfman', but it makes all the fun elements of those movies narrower in a delicious treatise! Get ready for nothing but fornication! Since various social holes have changed, the film is involved in violence that was not allowed in the previous era; There is no blood there, but we shoot the letters and read it straight away, even on the face there is a burning torch! <br /> <br /> This picture can not be a really horror movie, but it definitely means the atmosphere, look and feel! It starts with winds (and wolves) in the night, because two men apparently seal the tomb of dead young lovers, but wait! One of them does not die, but he does not leave! He is trapped, but silently speaking about his own mind, can not communicate! What is his story Now that you have started a horror movie .... <br /> <br /> English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, one of his best performances) disappeared for the disappearance of Richard Beckett. His two friends disappeared in the invincible Austrian Count Von Bruno's palace (Saka Baron Cohen saw it?). Many years ago, Von Bruno called African Natives as a god to steal ivory, he was open to Burton's men, and the negatives separated him. Now he is looking for revenge. <br /> <br /> All cliche in this movie, the stronghold of Jonathan Harker-style, a busy villager, the trap of death, and the Hollowing Mannavant (Low Chaney Junior). In the scene of the torture chamber, there is indeed doubtful, which includes a panel beneath which enables an ornamental door (which later creates an impressive gateway scene). Is it an imported panther (!!! ??) and even an engrossed hole! And then Romeo and Juliet-style fatal death that leads to the suggestion of film. <br /> <br /> This plot is clinic and the world-view is black and white. But it still creates incredible entertainment, with director Nathan Juan, in the environment, making every scene lid and fresh and new. There are many plots, too much. Why Ronald is trying to leave the accident? And he never resolves what is happening to his friends, even though it is clear, but he does not know that when he leaves, he definitely thinks earlier. Strange <br /> <br /> All the actors are great. Despite being a rude upperclassman, Richard Greene makes one of the most favorite protagonists Burton I've ever seen in a baroque film. The Ritter Cord is a nice "farmer's wife" in the county, who became interested in Burton's love, all of the films of this era may have difficulty in 'falling in love with one's glamor', but his long-tolerant woman's screenplay is heartwarming for a wicked monster. , He also showed suspicion and intelligence to some of the film heroes of this era, even Burton Shawn The strong effort to see (and to his nekalesake trousers, although it is easy to analyze it as a significant source) as a rape attempt, yet he did not think pyaranoya nasty in the audience sympathize with him. Although Von Bruno does not feel truly foreign and no other junior (he was still a villain in a horror film), Stephen McNally gave the true cool performance as a tragic personality. When he reveals his burning eyes, and the psychological smile, it's really scary. Lone Chaney Jr. is also great as its silent Henman Gargon. <br /> <br /> But Boris Karloff's mysterious doctor said. His first screen has a little screen time, but he stole the view he saw. This is a performance which is frustrating, sad, mysterious and ultimately heroic. When he applied one of Henne in Brunei, he spied on our hero and in the famous language, 'You know that I'm not good' voice could only have Carloop, if you are not a hero then think, almost always skulking. And even though he worked as the main agent of our hero escape, he still showed man's weaknesses like greed and fear for his life, even before agreeing to Burton, he made a man poisoned toxicly toxic poisonously for the benefit of Burton. His plan to help our hero and heroine escape also put them in the background of Von Bruno because he arranged for a wonderful tragic death (if incredibly defective) for them, which could inspire similar scenes in the serial of po series. It does not have much screen time, but it is easily one of Boris's best performances. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the end, it may seem a bit unpredictable and anti-climatic, where half of the fun is available, and there will be many tensions there. The hero was heroes and when Villains was behind the day and living. It's not a great composition, but it's the best epician fun.
