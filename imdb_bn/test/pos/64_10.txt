Darling Lili Perfection and Magic Mix! Stars; Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson could not make a good effort they could try. It is full of magic that a young lady longs for, and thinks that it can really happen to you. Director Brightness; Blake Edwards is shown to be his best. She kept the woman she really liked on the screen! <br /> <br /> The combination of each song went perfectly in the moment of the film. The movie closed with the same song of Andrews with the song "Wing ate in the dark" and song sinking with July Andrews. <br /> <br /> When it was released for a great movie, it was an impossible shock ... <br /> <br /> As it is: "Inspirational ... Pure ... Inspirational!" ~ Andrew is one of the most memorable lines in this movie!
