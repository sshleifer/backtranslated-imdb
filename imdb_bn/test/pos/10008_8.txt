"Excluding" may be far more likely than being pre-identified with the withdrawal of drugs. Along with Beijing's arrival, a young artist must face this young artist in order to overcome the success of his peasant guardian's role in distinguishing this young artist from his roots. But problems arise when new people are very new, when it exits too much from family, history, nature and personal identity. Imagination between upcoming division and general and heroism and confusion between real and inconsistent on one side, complete examination of an intestinal test or extermination from each other. Hongsen later went to slip and could go back to his long and lonely road. <br /> <br /> But a particularly credible attribute, honesty, and sensuality director Zhang Yang and his actor came to this ride. No clich√©s, no stereotype, no rigid gender roles, no necessary sex, romance or violent scenes, no necessary street language and boots, there is no meaning to float character work and comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> In Hong Kong her twentieth century He is a talented actor, an emotionless, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally hungry. The perfect recipe for her enablers He soon figured by "calm" actor, young man. "He was warm in the early nineties." "She must always be the most fashionable." She needs extreme, and goes for heavy metals, earrings and a scarf. His acting means art, friends - and roles, but also offer any personal challenge or input. And by the instant of success shameless reveals his self-criticism, double self-esteem, self-denial doors - "I did not know how I could work" "I felt a messy" - and the medicines available to easily prevent them. He said, "I had to do it to do what the director wanted." So, as an actor, his shallow identity is exempt from the identity, through medication. <br /> <br /> Deficiency of Hankscen's narcotics and his false life is very slow, intermediate - and his own hiding Thoroughness, space, meditation thoughts, reflexes of speech, therapy replacement Is abstract out And a large part of its change is outside - --- not on the ideal places, but mainly on the green patch under the high rise of the freeway, bridge and Beijing. Physiology is almost romantic, but is not. The bike is a typical Reiton Park, a long spontaneous walk, a propelled sun and rain, grass picnic, sky patterns and mites that absorb its moving. He drifts to reach, always picking up a real and realistic identity cues. He said, "I started to open" he said this time. And the communication seems to start with his lanky body, in which the status of a kind of dancer (strange, delightful, funny, story) in the present situation. If his mind or soul lacks, his legs can force him to walk all night. <br /> <br /> The central role of his coming back is to reject the set role. To end the determination of acting and its new identity, he shocked his video and TV and hit his head until his bloody "John Lennon Eternal" poster. He has given up his emblematic anti-artist artist - but he knows the only effective guide. He himself portrayed himself as the son of John (Yokko Ono) and called her "Mother Mary" as her "hour of darkness" and "time to be in trouble". (Pain on the wrench, reduction of pain - hallucinatory and squid adolescents) "It is much more real than playing music" he says. And talking about Lenin's effect "showing me a new way." In the psychological institute, life-saving apples (resistance, nutrition) reflect the presence of lanterns, for example, when Hornsen needs to re-release his hero's poster in its reconstructed cell. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The effect of the father is grounding. Though parents and sons are both actors and users (drugs and drinks), the difference between Figssen's son is under the change of his son. The father is more secure on his own: He admits he is a Chinese, a farmer, a rural theater director. And he exercised control over both his habits and his passion. It deals with Hensenen as a sound board, sometimes dealing with anger and anger, sometimes with humor (blue jeans, beetles) and passiviti. His most insane and violent exchanges with his father, in which he accused him of being a liar and a fraud, revealed himself more than his father: "The work I accomplished before was bullish ... life is violent." And "You are not my father," he humbly replied, "Why can not the farmer be your father?" <br /> <br /> With extra help with the prisoners at the time of these two teachers and their mother, sister, friend, rehabilitation, he created some real relationships with a real (not completely) nature. Long-Term Drug Impact Reduces, So Its Old Identity The repayment of the indebted pride, the mistrust of faith. Honesty banishes her black cloud. All its ends are soft. "You are just a man" Repeat continuously after he was released from the whip down for refusing drugs. Behind the house, the peasant farmer soap is now fine with him. And once he became "rare and true friendship" with his music partner friend, it became clear to the worst back-to-back fence scene. Hankscen says about this movie: "It's a good opportunity to think about my life." And I can add, new actors, art and life are tied together. Like Lenin, he achieved success without losing his identity.
