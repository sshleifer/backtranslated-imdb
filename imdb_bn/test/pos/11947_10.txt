"Crazy summer" is the most fun, paglist (not necessarily the best), I've never seen that movie. <br /> <br /> Just when an insane scene is complete, another appears. It does not give you the rest. One thing after another. The soundtrack is great. Songs are right for the scene. <br /> <br /> This is a clear film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If they fail, they want to see? There is a serious side, that parents and children do not live in dreams each other. One should always have an open mind, and all options are weighted. This applies to both parents and children. "In a crazy summer", parents are wrong. This is not always the case.
