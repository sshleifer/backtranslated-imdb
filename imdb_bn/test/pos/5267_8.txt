Like Jadith, electricity is astonishing, strictly the only strong and compassionate member of patriarchal family. His brother David was so frustrated by his father that he wondered if he could not put his shoes, but the father wanted to do this for him. <br /> <br /> Other critics have already identified this plot, so I will not be rehash it; However, I would say that Nan, who is pregnant with David, is also married. This is not an external marriage pregnancy, which was horrific in the standard of 1921. Two are secretly married, but Nan's father, from David's father, pays his marriage certificate tears. <br /> <br /> The death scene of Nine in the presence of Jinthe is really charged with heart-Ran experience and extremely passion. This scene is valuable only for watching movies, but there is more to it; Why is not the modern movie in the world made with the same attention story?
