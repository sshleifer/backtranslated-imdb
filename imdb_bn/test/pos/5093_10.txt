Peter O'Toole gives this movie a brilliant performance. I saw the original version with Robert Donat and I love Peter O'Toole's performance and generally love the movie, though it is a musical instrument. I've never seen anything that Mr. I do not like O'Brien. He is a brilliant actor, very talented, passionate and full-length performer. Petula Clark also gave an amazingly good performance and was perfect for the part. It's an impressive movie around, full of softness and bittersweet fun. I will always remember (in Paramaus) where the chips who expressed regret never gave to his son, and he replied, "Of course, hundreds of them - all boys." Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to know my opinion.
