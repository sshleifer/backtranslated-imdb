I just saw this thriller again, which I previously believed as one of the few hit hits. How wrong you can be Perhaps I grew up, or maybe it seems that the film is good with every visit, but now it seems like it's great. Every point of terror comes out from the smallest detail, and that final scene is just breath-taking in the Maya-round-round! Highly recommended, every way, perfect.
