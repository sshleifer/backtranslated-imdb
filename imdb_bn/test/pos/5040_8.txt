Probably the role of John John Travolta Saturday Night Fee was a great movie and role, but a long time ago. I can not think of most of his movies or roles which I liked, and it is easy to think of the bad ones. He can do my companies like Paul Fiction, but he made the perfect Phunkie angel and it is difficult to imagine that it works well (evenly sluvery) with someone. Plots are available everywhere, but plot points are not. Just go for a ride and enjoy the cleverness of little funnies along the way. There is nothing to hate about this movie, unless someone searches deeply. I wish there were more movies like this. We need a break from deep or horrible or grisly or complex or hysterical.
