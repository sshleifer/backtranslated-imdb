At first I must admit that I have some doubts about the director. He made some films (with Zarqovsky) about the recent "czech = east" history or how accurately the family (person) lived in some historical moments. But it is always sweet like sugar food. This movie was completely different. It was pure, it shows bones of life, it shows the diversity of human nature. This image is a wonderful part of the art (story, acting, pictures, music) but it shows the life around you in a lot of bright light that does not want to see you. I saw it with a DVD (English subtitles) but I'm scared that I will not be able to get it in the US.
