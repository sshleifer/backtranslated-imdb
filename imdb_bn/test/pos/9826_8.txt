Why should people follow the opinions of the public and critics' sheep? The Random Heights, which is directed by Sidney Pollack (has a small role in the film), another car from Harrison Ford. For example, it is quite good and entertaining. Of course, anyone who can see it is in the mind, or the book can not read well. I even included myself to Christian fans of Christian Scott Thomas, who knew that his older uncle's love interest would be different. Even as such, the film is satisfied. What is so bad about this film in another Harrison Ford film? This film is not an excellent work, but it is not as bad as the public viewers believe.
