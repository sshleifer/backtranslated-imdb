Funny movies, Dean R., if the watchmen are not very fun. The novel written by Quotz is certainly great, but the movie itself is entertaining in its own way. This film has many changes for the novel audience, it is a major difference between the tragedies. He was an adult and retired Delta Force soldier in the book, and he was a teenager in the film. Viewers have good points in it, there are some serious scenes in the film parts. I was a fan of Mikhail Iranside and was very good to see him in this movie, he always played a great role in all of his films. The OXCOM constimm seems to be a kind of chessy type, but the camera does not actually fully show the animal to the end of the movie. It was well trained because the dog was fascinating ininstein. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ Both tests are telepathically connected because the two animals will infiltrate an enemy base as a part of a military project, the animals will then attack and destroy them. The dog finds a teenager in the name of Trevise and makes him aware that he is intelligent and so he names the dog Einstein, while Oakscom often kills people and closes their eyes, two government agents are sent for these two tests. The event gets out of hand. Soon, Treviss learned that he is not safe by dragging a dog near the dog and he and his friend will not stop to die, so that his girlfriend is rescued by the two friends of the Trevies and her mother. They are then hiding in the woods, when the government agent and the OXCOM are not very far behind. <br /> <br /> Viewers Dean no longer. Quotez is not a great adaptation of the novel, but it is 80 horror, some fans may not want to see the book, although this book is not faithful for the book but fans of the Chess 80's horror movie might want to test it.
