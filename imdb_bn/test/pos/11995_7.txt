Seriously If this is the first shake movie then it could be passable as funny, stupid and stupid. Light satirical commentary on class system will make this an enjoyable late-night rental. <br /> <br /> Everybody wants to compare it to the first movie, and it is probably not fair. The first film is a classical classic; Perhaps it could follow? There is nothing. So accept this second image stand alone, and it certainly has its moments. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is doing her best Rodney-Wanaabe incognito. Is he as well as Rodney? No As well as his line? No But he's funny The rest of the cast falls into the appropriate line, but not outstanding. You can recognize the face in Caste and wonder where they went today. <br /> <br /> The film is expected, but not the most? Again, this is not the best comedy you can see, but if you love the cannonball run-type fun, you will enjoy it.
