I've been sitting through many Pauly Shore movies, but I've liked this alone. Of course, it is much less annoying than usual, it's even a little preferred. The rest of the rest is a fine work, especially underla carla gugino. The film is basically a silly and stupid comedy, and although some of the magicians are particularly funny, the film is overall entertainment.
