In the early 80's, I've recorded the Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable. Since then, I have waited, hopefully it will be in the DVD. Yesterday I found it. It's one of the best ridiculous character research I've ever seen. Old fashioned episodes are invaluable. At this time (4/28/02) only reviewed two. One hatred, another loved it. If you have a DVD player, rent it, or buy it as it has bought.
