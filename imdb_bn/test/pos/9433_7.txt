Watson, Nigel Bruce, Dr. Marriotti, Lionel Atoll. Marrias are always evil as bad as a bit of a shock to sign up with Hitler. Is man stupid? I do not think so. But Atwill delicious evil <br /> <br /> The story is quite fleeting as Holles and Watson want to recover the material to steal before reaching a U-boat. The Rathbone performed well in its usual civilized self and several Holmsian camouflage well. <br /> <br /> The story of this and other 1940s Homes is now available on DVD and oldies.com has set out a very nice four-disk wooden box: This movie has been included with the bonus CD of a meeting with the age-old dial. The set retailed for DVD and CD stores for around $ 26, but I found these and other sets from oldies.com at a warehouse club for $ 14.98. The transfer is very good. <br /> <br /> Dazzle watching very nice and late night. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
