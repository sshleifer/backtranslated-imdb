As far as I know it was my first experience with Icelandic movies. It is so much relief to see something other than a regular motion picture of Hollywood. It is very bad that such films have a small chance of being successful in the big world. I just hope that people accidentally recommend it or by others ... <br /> <br /> Because it's really valuable. I feel the movie really sad. I could not find the tragic fate of characters from my head. And when I thought of the complexity of the film, I was more impressed. It was not just a sad story, it was a great comic relief and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see! Think it really excited and think of me a lot. <br /> <br />
