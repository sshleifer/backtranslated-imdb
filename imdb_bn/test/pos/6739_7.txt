This is a silent comedy coming from more mature periods after the entry of Blue Simon, the upcoming old comedy. Although there are many ads to go along, it is not one of Neil Simons's pieces, where each character rewards one-fish fishing jock for 2 hours as they are guest star in Bob Hope. Also dramatic elements (some work, some are extra) are stories which lend some weight. <br /> <br /> Performance performance on the board, especially as the mother of Bleth Dannar (though he and Judith Ivy had a strange WASP-ish in Jewish women's game). I'm not ever fond of Jonathan Silverman, but I would say that the real notes are considered as violent, serious, and full-horned-up young man's story / playwright. <br /> <br /> This movie is very similar in voice to Woody Allen's "Radio Day", but the latter is far more imaginative and fun than that.
