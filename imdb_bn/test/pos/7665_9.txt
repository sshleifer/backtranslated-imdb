I did not read any good reviews for "Vanity Fair" and I do not understand why. That "races in ten days" comes close to something that's all amazing for it. Although "Bikey Sharp" is a good film and Mary Hopkins is good at the time, but there is nothing to stop it from getting tough 9/10. Occasionally, Mirna Lloyd may seem very curious and beautiful, but once she has to tear her eyes and the air temperature exceeds a dozen degrees. Mu! Removed from a more modern setting does not work against "Vanity Fair" and only something that really creates some clashes. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was 5 feet high, and some of the leading men were very tall - all of this together seemed like an Amazon woman! <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is not how bad any of the original characters are similar to "Craig's wife", but you have to love him. And you know that he deserves his feeling and then something, but sorry for him when you get it. Although based on the same story as "Bikey Sharp", this version had a different end, which was interesting because most of the other movies were almost the same. For the value of contentment, the end of "Bakey Sharpe" is more enjoyable, though from aesthetic and storytelling, there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is good, whether you really like it or not.
