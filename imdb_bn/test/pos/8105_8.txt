I was once caught up to a 20-minute part of this movie in Turner Classic Movies 6 months ago. I thought that every minute I saw gold, and, because it was somewhere in the middle and I did not want to hide the whole thing if I wanted to see it from the beginning, I decided that I would hire it immediately. Well, there was no copy of the video store I used to be frequently, so I took six months to the end and had to go somewhere else. I had seen some earlier Chaplin shorts of that experience, I was not funny but very careful, but after seeing the Great Dictator snippet, I had three other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times (City Lights), I'm a bit of Gold Rush I've flipped extra, but still fit, and one of the fun movies I have ever seen in Modern Times ( The second most interesting is, behind the Sherton's junior, more accurate). <BR> <br /> Finally, the Great Dictator's whole was both good, honest, both in the comments and drama, but these moments do not always mix well. Works well.Meldrum (the best example of City Lights), however, it does not always work with social commentary. Also, because of the conversation, Chaplin's talent is in the back I do not make mistakes, I did not like the movie, but I used to think about the results, but I rated it 7/10 on the ratings scale, until the Jewish sailor concludes that the final lecture is very strong. Temporas and chickens were overwhelmed by the 1940s, but their message is now fully applicable to the world. This speech brings me to tears, and I saw it that I saw one of the best endings. Final score: 8/10.
