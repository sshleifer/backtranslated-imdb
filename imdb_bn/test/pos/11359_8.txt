My Dinner with Jimmy's 60th man-rock band, the progressive and ruthless journey to fame with The Turtles. Turtles were a 'second level' work during the sixties, but the film clearly shows that they can eat, drink, and party in the hippie culture tights. And, not only, they were muscular chop it back. Most of the star's works are seen as interacting with the band and the game. My only complaint about this film is provided. From the very beginning to the beginning of the film, someone sees that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convert these recognized stars firmly. Most of the time, during filming, I felt like I was watching an amazing show of phoenix wings and mosquitoes. However, if you are a turtle musician, or general of The Swing 60's, it might be a movie for you. And, do not forget to see extra. The band members have a very interesting (and informative) bit by Mark Wallman and Howard Kylan about their harmful experience with the manager and agents.
