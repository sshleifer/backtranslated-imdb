What can I say about this picture when you see it, you will not be given a preconceived idea? Very small A teenage girl will be intrigued with returning from hospital after she is broken. What is that movie after that. It has been one of the most mind-paced films over the past few years. Everything about the movie is a little closed and well ill after filming. This is not a perfect film. The film has a problem in its last half hour, which further confuses the confusing story. (If you read IMDB and any other elsewhere, you will know that an attempt has been made to pass a big time to unlock what is actually going on) I am not sure whether I am really afraid of this movie that it was scared to me and It affected me so well that there are some of the best known horror movies. You like horror and do not remember everything that's clearly not compiled, but I suggest you try it because it probably crawls your skin.
