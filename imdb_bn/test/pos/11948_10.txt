I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was in HBO and I like it !! It's very cheerful I've counted it countless times. I love Stark brothers and kind, ugly dogs, Bosco! The movie of my favorite quote is, "It is so ugly, it needs to sleep." When a little sister pushes girls behind and their face takes that way, I also like it. I love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this film. They were great. This movie brought back memories of my college days when I saw it. I watched the movie over and over for rent rent. My college roommate and I just could not get enough of it. Who can not love this crazy movie?! I want to buy a DVD copy, does anyone know where I'll get it?
