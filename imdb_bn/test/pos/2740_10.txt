My dad was in this movie as 8mm Reel. When I pulled the projector, taped a sheet near the wall and Gerald McQueeng played Boing, I liked it. The idea of ​​a child approached through my father-in-law impressed me. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed as autistic as diagnostics. Doctors will ask me about my son as "How did he contact you?" I replied, "Have you ever seen a cartoon, Gerald McBeung Boing?" I want a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his teachers, thus seeing my son he can see this world. <br /> <br /> Recently, I spoke to a digital transfer expert who did not hold the word until the mid-1970s when most of the private 8mm movies were seen. I think I had the sights and sounds of Gerald McQueen Boing in 1972.
