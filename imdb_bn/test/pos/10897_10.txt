Golden Ya is a wonderful composition. The story is amazingly illustrated, characters are beautifully animated and weapons tie-up. The story is so interesting, even when you complete each single mission, you have to overcome the higher difficulties to get even more. And multiplayer mode is so tyte. Choose the weapon you want to play, then play. I and my three friends always play Golden with my brother. If you do not have this game, then I suggest you buy it.
