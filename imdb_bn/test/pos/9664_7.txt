Not a bad movie but acting and screenplay could be good. I love this movie because I have a life that is in a good part like a movie. Living in Romania is difficult for the lost generation, and 90 percent of us prefer something else, and if you face me with other "bad habits", you understand me but it comes with the area. This movie represents me and I like it. I am angry that I talk to people about barley, I live in Jagannath society and I can not fit and I do not want to, and this is the film story, if you like me, then you understand the real movie, if you are easy And do not find cheaper.
