I use IMDB too much. Mainly I did not read reviews about movies or other people. I thought it was time to write something about this movie, which changed my life and I saw a movie. I think I saw it in the theater for the first time, when I saw at least a dozen times after autumn 94. <br /> <br /> I think Kislowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think this is her best one. It was his last one. I was very trash that he knew he was dead, because we had lost his chance to get more from him. <br /> <br /> The Red Cassettes have a great role of the best Casilloskie + Trinigint and Jacob +. . You have not seen it look for it !!! If you are, just come back to it !! <br /> <br /> Red: Just a nice composition. Please, forgive my poor English !, reader
