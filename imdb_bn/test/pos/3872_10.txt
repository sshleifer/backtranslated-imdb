By Tyneshha Mells In this play, J. Roule, who stars as a rage, struggles with the loss of his father. Recently, the cold blooded Thaga, released from prison, helps her old friend Joe-sister, Regie find her father's murder. A week after the death of his father, a preacher died of Reverend Packer. It seemed to be angry that he had to be killed, but what did he do? Did Reggie Reverend Pacers Kill Or Was It Some Kind Of A Setup? Day to return also has a couple of romantic scenes. See, the love for the prostitute daughter and Je-hoon has fallen in love, she does not endorse her love protest. Je-hon tries to destroy whatever they want, the regent learns that love is about forgiveness. But J-bone is doing, what does it work? Does the ragged and his girlfriend break, or does it bring them together? I love this movie because it makes you wonder what's going to happen next, and it happened. I like movies about senses! You can recognize things so that you want to stay in the movie. I like this movie because if everything is fine, you really pay attention to it!
