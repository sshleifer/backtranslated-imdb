This image is telling everything to say about religion - I want it to look for all the points and be clerical. <br /> <br /> The story is set in the hundreds of Danish villages. Almost two very religious sisters, whose late father was a harsh priest, who discouraged all the dreams of love and discovered the world and its many beauty. They are now old and spend their life and beauty. Their cool new help - to whom they teach "to teach" - Babette (played by her husband's beautiful husband Stephen Audon in Claud Chabal's film). The life of the village reflects the simple and strong side. <br /> <br /> When Babbet won the lottery, he had a chance to prepare a banquet - the real labor of love. The festival and its main guest way expresses the message of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This father must definitely watch for his sacrifice to be prepared. And after the lecture the general gives. Perhaps the best international film of the 1980s
