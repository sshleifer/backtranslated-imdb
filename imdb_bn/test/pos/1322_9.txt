This photo has taken a lot of views for me to fully appreciate it. Initially, I was hit by the styled set, but the rest were getting slow and dull. I thought that Chem Russell's treatment of this kind of sensational thing was needed so that it could be ascended. I now find compulsive restraint (placed on production by Mishima widow) for the property. Some of the other luminous aspects of Mishima's life are similar to those of the novel that are repeated and dramatic. I think it helps to get acquainted with novels - which eventually made a difference for me. Still, the film seems to be a bit tricky and warm, but it is truly unique, and deserves serious attention. Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. Philippe Glass is mesmerizing scores.
