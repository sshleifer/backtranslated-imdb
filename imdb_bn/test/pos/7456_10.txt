Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the United States, "Callman" shortened to 70 episodes in four seasons. <br /> <br /> "Simpsons" (often a beautiful show on your right) often in contrast to shameless criticism. , And ridicule for the absurdity of "South Park", every bit of this series follows a plan. The criticism of the American society, from its tradeism to selfishness, it bites far more than any other animated series. <br /> <br /> The cultural references to "postman" sometimes tend to be obscure (anyone who browses to fan sites will even have to catch most). In it, it is different from "Simpsons", which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-width elements hidden in "DoCaman". As other people wrote about it, there is an increase in the letter (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also, the main character is not just an objectionable neurotic, but a real tragedy (which has been explained in episodes "once and in future") does not have anyone ('you love him till the end of your day ... ...') and "Beave is a holiday "(The series can not tell Beatrice when he gives Beverly the chance to say), the series is deeply involved with reality. <br /> <br /> She can not feel sorry for her and her strong crazyness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it is still in the DVD. Many things Doc said today is a lot of knowledge.
