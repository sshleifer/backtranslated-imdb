This film is the Happiness Mets Lost in Translation, completing a six senses (or maybe a tiring game surprise), and with the best soundtrack I've ever heard ... if they all understand. <br /> <br /> Most of the first 30 seconds have told you that you are on a rolling ride. (I was surprised that nobody did not go out during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film settled into two real-time harmful people, Daphne and Badiere. <br /> <br /> They are lonely, messy, and boys they talk about sex. Daphne escorting brings her most interesting story, some funny (Mr. Chang) is a bit annoying (Harlan scenes with music that tells us what's happening now, or what Daphne really feels), and because of a friend of mine There are friendships with, I can add, mostly seems pretty real. <br /> <br /> You are alone in multiple levels and mostly bright. All right, maybe a few minutes talking, and I do not know that we missed something. <br /> <br /> I tried to know again later. <br /> <br /> <br /> I like this picture. <br /> <br /> (Director Dr. Shrota to write a review in IMDB because many people can read them. The request has been granted.)
