I watched this movie on TV many years ago and taped it from there, I never realized why my own mother was so upset with it! It was because I was so young. I have seen sitting in this movie again, now I have 2 children and should have tried my tears again, but it did not happen. I was crying most of the film, how different you are to show that you have your own child! Such an amazing family such a heart-wrenching film is really wonderful! Some have said that 8 are still alive and I want to know if you are still touching any news! All pictures touch!
