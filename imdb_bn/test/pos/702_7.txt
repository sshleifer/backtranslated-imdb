Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford once outlined pals together, but now Scott's a Sheriff and young Ford are still recruiting his gun. He is engaged to hire a bank to work, but to reach the city is delayed and to get someone else to hire him. It leads to all kinds of complexity, for a movie that is not too long 90 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn got both of them here. Claire Trevor plays cheeks with her heart's good good time with gold. And Evelyn Kiss, the daughter of Edgar Buchanan, who took a big time for Ford, does not understand why he or she came to town in the city of Scott. <br /> <br /> This is done in the West, but for the unusual time and Columbia pictures, it is treated as a complete technicolor. The Disparode identified Glenn Ford's technicolor's first film, reserved for more expensive movies than just a big studio. Harry Cohen certainly could not have shelled out for him. And certainly not during the war. <br /> <br /> Ford and Scott are both examining verses / skills versus skill / duties, because the plot gets a bit slower. In this plot Randy has several high-class hydrological edges, which the original outlet is possible to the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Climax has a cattle stamped and a city out of salon shooting and it's the best of all time in a western film. <br /> <br /> Four Lead and the Western people will enjoy this.
