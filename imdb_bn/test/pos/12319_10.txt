Easily one of my three or four favorite films. Of course for a desert island. There is nothing 'brilliant' about this film. Rather, it glows warm and welcoming. A group of visitors are invited and, like a good party, the joy comes in contact with the guest and you learn from what you learn from one to the next. Appreciating Joses, the title of the film highlights a number of ideas that keep the audience away. The film is not scary. It is not depressing. This is a beautiful look which has gone past, in which people are growing up, and others roam around. Some are frustrated, and others are calm. And present in the evening, people, and people part of the rest, the rest has been rested. These exquisite actors are offered to talk about perfection and, Irish brood music music set, a myth festival, especially for our flat-toned Americans. I mentioned about the lack of brilliance, I took it. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Angelica Haston and Donald McCann. Talk about quiet volume about it ?? Well, everything. Some lovely snowy evening, rent this film and just let it happen before. No gunfights, no car, no dinosaurs ?? Only the film in its most magnificent time.
