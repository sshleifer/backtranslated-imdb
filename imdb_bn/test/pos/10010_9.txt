I first saw this movie in the IFC. There is a great network by way of looking at underground film. I saw this movie and thought it was a pure drama and a story line that does not contain water. But when it was really a price to watch. The main character is so rough, and you hate seeing him deny, but it does not matter which one you can not hate him. He is a great metaphor for Beatles and John Lennon for his life and for his helplessness. <br /> <br /> The film's atmosphere is also great. Occasionally, you think that he can see what he sees, in some situations he feels what he thinks. You do not want to know more about this movie, or do not waste a camouflage in the plot. There is no error (my opinion). I have always been a fan of foreign films, especially in America, America is so badly prepared. I really enjoy foreign settings because I think it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture. This movie has more to me and more. Please watch this movie and it is a great start if you are new to foreign movies.
