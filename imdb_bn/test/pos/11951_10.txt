I noticed that many people have never seen this movie, and those who generally dismiss it as garbage ... it's really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time, I acknowledge that almost one person was ... Thanks to God I am patient, otherwise I could never find such a classic. <br /> <br /> Like a fool like this movie, it's definitely a fan of the 80's movie, or just a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know that there are many people there who tell you that this movie is dead like a better offer ... then what will happen? They were both excellent movies! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
