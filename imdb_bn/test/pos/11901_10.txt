This movie was just amazing. Writing was incredible and directed and played. The story has made you interested instantly. This movie is one of the movies that enhances your heart all the time. Always Diane Chopa Bright, the screenplay on her is as strong as a Hollywood actor. Throwing in this photo is perfect. Each character has made the story more complete. Cinematography was impressive and it made the movie better. I was stuck on the screen and could not see it, there was no objection to popping or doing anything. This film is the best year, even the best. Rent a movie for this, I recommend this movie if you want to watch a great movie or just for entertainment.
