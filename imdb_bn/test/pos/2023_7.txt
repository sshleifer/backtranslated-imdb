So, you want to be a rock star? See this movie. You do not like rock, you say? Or are you really in heavy metal? Then keep your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has no offers. Suddenly I saw a movie that was capable of portraying the dream of the rock band. In the early 1980's and early 90's, I had long hair and I had played guitar for the past 15 years. Do I like Rock Star? Yes Music is good, not great, good actor, and credible, even plays his part in perfection of Jennifer Aniston. And Mark Wahlberg's wannabe rock singer is perfect as a singer. So you know what you're going to get. Dreams come true, a step-by-step, and finally a movie about what life really is to find out. This is seven good in 10, no less, not less.
