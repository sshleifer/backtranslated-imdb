I really liked this movie. If other people want to average it around 5.0 / 10 their choice around. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland's performance as a private eye is completely awesome. The story is amazing, people, exciting, intelligent. Dialogue is good. The story may not be perfect, however - the film's mood is good enough to compensate for it. In addition, the end is incredibly cool and the puzzle on their Jog-eye really comes back together. So anyway I like it. I think female lead actress performs very well. I'm not a big fan of detective films but it was really good because it did not give a slight disrespect for the occult conventions.
