Fall series is amazing and director PS may not get enough credit for making this movie. I'm a little surprised that many people have not seen this or the other two, but if you want punk photos in the early years of the seventeenth century and in the early years of detention, their worthlessness is ineligible. The film starts with a splashy collection of clips across the band from the band X. Many interviews with band and punkers offer an enlightened view of living below the mainstream rock stairs. No internet, painful work, and all strife clash out of this style. True reading for new kids who did not listen to these bands or just started themselves, how to rock this movie. Performance of all the band (and there are many) horrible, especially those who fear me did not stop to surprise me. This and second installment are amazing times capsules which offer a rare surveillance care in the lives of these crazy people. It's a real punk like an interview with Derby Crash's girlfriend when they remember a painter / mysterious person who died mysteriously, and it takes a week or more for them, then they will take pictures with the person and everyone else's photo of EMT It was circulating, and in a real interview, the boyfriend was asked if he would Hkhita or upset that this man died while painting his house, when the response "No, I hate painters." How black flags their apartment / rehearsal space fares 16 dollars a month! My jaw was almost stopped soon when I hired ten wrists to train at 400 rupees. Seeing this and Deadwood, I think that I was born in a wrong period, only that cowboy day and night was absent. Old way The public and the bands associated with the film have made way for some difficult music today, and they did this in their own unique way. Bright movies, ten stars, part 2 as well as its equally awesome, part 3 though, I do not know what I want to say.
