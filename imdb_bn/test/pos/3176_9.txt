This was not a movie that was not publicized and it was largely missed while acting in theaters. <br /> <br /> I came across it while switching to TV channels and immediately got mad at the old Rodo left story, whose reluctance and lack of responsibility hit everyone around him. I often wanted to see the film again but could not remember its name, and it was never seen in rented shops. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles and Rodeo was the first rate of footage. Being an action movie and having a Western setting and theme, it can be enjoyed regardless of their taste in a movie.
