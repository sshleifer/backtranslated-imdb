The drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark end. Originally a man and his wife are infected with some internal ear, a high sound emitted by some military equipment is transmitted by sound waves. From this episode, Mulluder's conversation in some of my favorite parts, and the scene where the schoolmates go with Hammat's team and does not completely affect the little deaf lady as they think of a virus. The end of the course is tragic in its reality because it believes the audience will actually be able to drag this comprehensive plan to save the victims but people will die only when Mulldar comes. 8/10
