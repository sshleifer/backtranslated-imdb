A speech on the life of Ray Charles, a painful magician. His paws in piano make music of fire and his nostalgic voice creates exciting, cool tunes. He never kept every obstacle faced by the rival, and he found the way to all the conflicts. A real lesson. A great team of producers will revive the era and follow armed Rai's story with armed roles, hair and settings, in the belief of direct, direct filming! The audience goosebumps with freezes an ice music and performing tricky words. But, the most important part of the film is Jamie Fox. Her acting is really gorgeous, the most diamond polished acting ever seen. He plays his role. He is the judge of the light.
