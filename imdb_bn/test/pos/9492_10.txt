Some people do not like the Led Zeppelin, but thankfully the number of those who are unsafe v vers. I am a proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans and this is why I could do this. <br /> <br /> How can one listen to "the stairs of heaven" for one or the "immigrant song" as I fall in love with the gypsy with the gypsy, but playing guitar and not like the page ... it's like becoming a Christian and like Jesus Not. My friend was like "Lead Zeppelin sucks!" And I was like, "Oh yeah, see this!" About 2 minutes after the page was seen by "White Summer / Black Mountain Side", he became glued to the screen and did not say anything bad about Zeppelin since that day. <br /> <br /> If you did not follow the current metaphor, I would say this DVD is Lady Zeppelin's Bible. Used as a converter for high hold and unwashed heathens by the followers. <br /> <br /> Certainly missing some things like "Impervious hills and far away", is a good version of "immigrant songs" and I really did not need 2 versions of "full loaf love", but what should I do, br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To compare this, there is nothing more "beyond the songs". It gave a 10 and even if there is more to compare it, I could still give it a 10.
