I watch the show every day and it's very entertaining. It provides technology news, video games mostly geek updates to everything. They are the official broadcasters of E3 and Comics. If you are a geek, gamers or really something, you will enjoy this show. They have raised their play-up definitely from the bottom guy (2006) to my review. This is my only place where I can get my technology information. Kevin Perrera and Olivia Munn work nicely with each other and the show always mentions things about games, movies, comics ... things. If you know that universe, you can understand the jokes. Short story short, aots are a ridiculous show which gives me all the news about anything and everything about me and everything you care about. I'm now seeing it while typing it, that the red bull winds are 'in' in San Diego. Sweet
