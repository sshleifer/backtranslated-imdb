This is one of the great modern Kung Fu film. Most reviews remind the point that the comedy is sometimes very well-oriented (mostly at your fingertips) in the old and new corners. For example, whichever hookie is said to be a pumpkin in the country and whenever it tries to adapt to it, it hurts, but ultimately honoring Shahidul as an old fashion heroine in contrast to Hijiyo Ho's modern martial style. Gordon Liu seems to have played his part for laughs playing off his terrible personality with his serious, stupid wigs and a guitarist. The last fight is simply gorgeous and rather a defeat for Johnny Wang's end. Qawan Yung should mention the moon's 'invincible armor' for a great game of lip - only great. And who Hui has done some great acting and fighting. A great film.
