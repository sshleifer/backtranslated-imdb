Plunetate and McLean are an entertaining, expressive and refreshing movie. Unlike most of the time, the audience is not tried to preach the history or to preach because it refreshes - in fact, historical accuracy is ignored. The film does not take it very seriously and tries to entertain rather than being enlightened. Planket and McClean have been set in the 18th century, but director Jack Scott offers a full 90 percent share. There was action, sex, and lots of sworn oaths, and in the inevitable force, the elite showed dancing scenes in disco bits. Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are always bright, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming, as a flashing fawn, is also extremely entertaining. The film is visually spectacular, and a combination of comedy, action and drama, with a connotation of English expression for the sake of love given by Louis Tyler. In short, if you are looking for a few hours recreational racing, it's the movie for you. It will not mind you, but it may laugh at your face.
