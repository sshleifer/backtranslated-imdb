Show more French films that are able to face Hollywood, and only spend more money on money than their films. No one would be surprised if the forest noise in the United States was created. In 40, when Nazi invasion, technically unreasonable, and most of the international French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledovane ...) were fully established in France. In two parallel stories at the Forest Voice Center: a scientist and his disciple (Laden) who tries to hide the discovery of a discovery of a Nazi discovery (a type of water that can act as a nuclear bomb); And a poor man of love with a well-known actress (Adjani), who ends up in a prison convicted of hostage for him. <br /> <br /> Van Voyage seems to have been done in the old style, without unnecessary camera movement and impact. The plot is not big. As I said earlier, they themselves did a great job about production. But the main issue of this movie is about the script. This is a spy-movie? A romantic comedy? A spy comedy? Comedy A trick? It is not clear. That Van Voyage makes a little incomplete. When you think that you are watching a comedy, then suddenly another storyline, more dramatic, changes at a slower pace ... I think they reason (the one about spy plot) and the rest of the romantic part in the background. <br /> <br /> My rate: 6.5 / 10
