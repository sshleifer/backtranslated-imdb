I originally posted the first user's comment on this movie and claimed that it was painful and it did not understand. I cautioned the senses. The story of Campfire is a thoroughly enjoyed movie (now 2 years old and last night saw it). The actors are not famous but popular. The acting itself was more than acceptable, it is rather good. I will rate movies per movie cinema. <br /> <br /> 1) The black and white scene (AKA- "hook") is uninterrupted, it looked good, but did not hold too fast, only disappointing, I do not think it was included as a segment. Fear-o-meter here. <br /> <br /> --- --- (poor) <br /> <br /> 2) RV Story (Honeymoon stuck in wood) Perhaps the most entertaining of all the stories, it was such a good act, usually Carverne sex The scenes disappear. Yet it seemed that "that door was drowned". It was unclear, and not too lazy. <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ (very good) <br /> <br /> 3) Internet chat TAIL (Fill Little Girl Psycho) EXTREME. Although sometimes dull, the last few minutes were the most entertaining, I could not make mistakes, it was still fun to see. Blurred, and can be with someone, so look at who you are talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very Good) <br /> </ br> 4) Ghost Tale (man ghost kiss) ?? Not the best, it was not too atmospheric for a ghost story. It was strange, the direction was rather good, music or screaming, but it was very real to be very terrible, although it was good, it was bloody, and <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> These two interesting gulls and boys are telling stories through stories. The good thing about the movie ended, it had a great impression, the last was completely unexpected. See it, it was very good, the realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (top note) <br / > <br /> 6) The film was more than the stories of Campfire I took, I really liked it to buy it in the video, forgetting a true entertaining horror movie. The trash you see these days, like many, I was really dissapointed that I did not go anywhere now, it was a direct video, it was better than all the propaganda to me "rubber" you see these days Overall for campfire tales <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- 10/8 out 8
