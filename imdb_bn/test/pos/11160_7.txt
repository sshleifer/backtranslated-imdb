It is not difficult to imagine the main issue of the scriptwriter, who wants to keep 18 equal well-written characters with the same screen time in the ongoing film for more than 90 minutes. It is almost impossible not to be back in stereootype and writer-director Ralph Westhoff is also here. Very few letters can be recognized as a person who you and I know in real life, many of them can be characterized and vague with only two or three features. I'm aware of it but still think that "Shoppen" is successful, that means it does what it wants. It is a film with very good writing dialogue, a very good acting and a movie that often laughs loudly. I do not think this movie wants to make a deeper analysis of our loneliness in modern society, or it wants to be the moral commentary of fast dating. This is a movie that exists and some movies about its use and its purpose. Fun and entertaining.
