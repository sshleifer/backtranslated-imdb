This is a great late night movie! This means that I enjoy playing my $ 3.00 VHS copy (now I have $ 6.99 DVD copies!) Before sleeping or insomnia. There is only something about this movie which makes it fun to watch over and over again. Basil's Rathbone "secret surgery" which can make many fools wrong and disguise Hels's assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson), but the housewife (Mary Gordon) can make fun of not being fooled. It could be spying, code cracking and WWII themes. The director may also have light touch to manage the threat that threatens to find himself when keeping the threat story going. However, "Secret Wipen" is simply a delightful and enjoyable detective story that takes us on time when the Nazi wanted the world domination and did it with the bonus of the camerarias between Watson and Homes. If you agree with patriotic lecture and "Save the World" themes of this movie (I think they are okay!), I find that they only repeat the recurring taste and fun of this old old adventure movie and repeatedly. I rate it a pretty 83/100 point rate.
