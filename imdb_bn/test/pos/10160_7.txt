Apparently a story about Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day's young child. The boy kidnaps his parents to keep silent. They know something about an intriguing plot to kill an ambassador of an undiscovered country while performing an action at Albert Hall in London. <br /> <br /> This movie is rich in Hitkochi. A friendly but unpredictable French man looks innocent by stewart - grinding a doctor from Indiana - seems to be very shamelessly shameless. Later, the French showed a knife behind the disguise of Arabia, behind them and gave some information about Stewart's assassination. Stewart says to his wife - Doris Day is very quick to show up - but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk her son's life. Instead, couples try to find the killers, buy them, and bring their son back, take them from Morocco, where Hittkok gave us the general viewpoint of customs, location and food in London. Stewart and taxdemy shop workers have a set-to-be-horned wild-hunting challenge. Employees are more concerned with their half-staffed specimens than any other and they keep the leopards and sword bodies safe. During the quarrel, Stuart managed to protect his throat from being cut by the liquid-fish bills, but the hand tied his hand to the tiger, growing by Bernard Harman's intelligent scores. The scene ends with Stewart rushing out the door. Hitcot shot by a lion's head consuming slumdade. There are some running gags waiting for some visitors to the London hotel room room, which are waiting to explain some things. <br /> <br /> There are two serious problems that have been lightly touched. Relationship between one Stewart and Day, it should not be considered as a bourgeoisie's ideal as a rose. She has been a stage musical star for several years and is internationally known. And he is given all to make a common man who will be a doc. With a committed career in its own right it is understood by a female or flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star. It is not delved into it, but edginess is not worth it, because it was not in the original version. It reminds me of an exchange between Joe Eggamaji and his next wife, Marilyn Monroe, who returned from the funeral of soldiers in Korea. "Oh, Joe," he gigabyte, "Have you ever seen ten thousand people standing and laughing?" "Sevent thousand thousand", former Yankee Yankee Joe Burst Explosion. <br /> <br /> The second problem is cruelty. Who is the greater social value? Your own little boy? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we keep ourselves or our loved ones at risk for national stability? In the final stage of Albert Hall, the day of disaster is faced with the most difficult form. His solution prefers loyalty to political stability, although his goals are problematic. Did he scream to save the lives of ambassadors, or is he so concerned that he is making pressure on him? (CF: Alake Guinness falls on the detonator at the end of "The Bridge of the River of the River"). Photography is very good and the quiet street settings in a residential neighborhood in London can be very serious. It's midnight, and Stuart is determined and alone, but very scared. Somewhere there is a reflection on the streets of Galway. What is he following? What is the danger of his life? And everyone who lives on this street? Heatco's attention to the details of the situation so much that we can make brick brick tie beside him. <br /> <br /> In the otherwise interviewed book of Director Trophy, there was a rare disagreement with Francois Tr√§fft. Truffut argued that the previous version of "Man Who New to Me Much" was lacking in the next version. Hitako replied, "I think you want me to make films for art house listeners", but eventually agreed that the 1930s was a work of talented amateur and this version was a professional work. There is no argument there. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice near Hitenko near his Geneath.
