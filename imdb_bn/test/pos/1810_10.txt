Can i say This movie has all ... romance, break up, rich kids, punks and preps. This is my favorite movie which I can read line for the line .... I think when it first came out, I was 14 years old and could not come in ... so finally it was on the wire ... I was bound! Go to California and want to be a Valley Girl .. (Hey, I remember the song of Moon Jupiter, did you?) Sometimes the failed soundtrack failed to get ... now you can find it on the Gino Records ....
