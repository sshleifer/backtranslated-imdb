Darr, though some are a copy of Hollywood Flick, one of the best movies I've seen is. It is not only beautifully portrayed but also contains great songs and beautiful scenery. Shahrukh is his usual self. Its expression and voice match its character. I congratulate Sunny Deol. He is somewhat romantic and romantic in film, in contrast to his other characters in his other films. Many times you think that Justice did not complete his character. Sunny wanted to be portrayed as a good person, but eventually she looked like a villain. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbles. He has his usual self. In short, a great love story with passion.
