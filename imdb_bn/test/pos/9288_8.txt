A very interesting look at some of Australia's current affairs and political movements. Chara's boys really seem to have fun with this event and what I enjoy is that they all have the power; Some are impressive to make themselves completely foolhardy (Chas), when Julian can pull the whole "I am interviewing a famous politician and I recommend that he himself be disguised as a pot of jam." <br/> <br /> Their rallies are a great part of Mike's excitement of all types of Australian culture, like our current program shows, our Advorts and Early Source TV programs. Some elements are a bit tired and predictable, but overall it's much fun to watch, and your face will leave you with a smile.
