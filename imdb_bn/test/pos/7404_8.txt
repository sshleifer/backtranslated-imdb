Sometimes the best things can happen is accident. <br /> <br /> I could never hear about "SilverWeing" until the end of 2005 - I was going to break the channels and see some on the Seychelles design, an attack by onion is an addition. . I had no idea what it was, but I was encouraged to stay safe - it was waiting for a commercial, so I could find out what it was called! <br /> <br /> Some of my interest was the bat - first of all, they do not use the current circulation of "extra fingers" for bats, where their thumb birds are supposed to be. Rather, people have their hands on their hands, but the fingers are more and they have skin skin. They also look like humans (in fact, I wonder at one moment if they were once human but were transformed into bat). Usually I do not like it in cartoon animals, but it worked here - the story is human history, although it is about bat and other animals (not against Lion King). <br /> <br /> The last two parts of the "trilogy" I saw on TV. I missed the start of the first one, "Tower Of Fire" (second overall) at the beginning, but in most cases I have seen each of them. However, I was trying to understand myself what was happening, the first part was not and I could not catch it. <br /> <br /> But I saw that it was based on a book by Kenneth Appell. How lucky I had paid attention and wrote - I learned when the series was not available, I was very disappointed! It has not been created recently that it was not possible to understand. <br /> <br /> However, I could not find the book of Silverwing, but I found two sections of sewing and firewing. When I read the first book, I was surprised "What is this?" Everything in this series is not only in that book, but I have not seen the animated version, the Silvervig book (otherwise a good story) does not end as it closes. Only a loose end is tied - the shadow and the meeting with the silver valve colony of Marina Hebronakulam. In fact, Silvoring and Sunning (in my opinion) should be released on single volume because they are created <br /> <br /> Actually, the animated version accepts certain elements of Sunning (for example, Orestes, to see the sun Lifted the ban) and had some original origin. It's not perfect, but it's certainly very enjoyable. I enjoy both versions of Silverwing Saga. <br /> <br /> Because of this I'm happy to be available in June. It's been a long time, and it's worth the wait.
