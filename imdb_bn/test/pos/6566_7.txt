Recently I have seen a number of films from the far-flung ... something was awesome (war royal, hellish thing, I), and some were not very big (verses, triple cross). Then there is something like Uzumaki and Returnner, which I still enjoy. <br /> <br /> There is a mysterious and terrible effect on the basic premises, which is on a community of growing emotions with spiral. Silent sound? Yes, what I was thinking was Firstly, good things. Direction was top notch, definitely not a bit at the top of the place but less interesting and stylish. Secondly, the story was original and very similar to other writers - Esik ... it was interesting. This reminds me the most, but it was at the beginning of Cherniberg; Pictures like shivers and videodrome <br /> <br /> The acting was not great, but it's not very awesome. To be honest I was actually disturbed on some occasions .... I felt especially feeling initially a little slow. My main problem was that it was funny because it was very scary and genuine and still not considered enough as a comedy. * Spokela * Below * <br /> <br /> * Spinner * Some good views (washing machine =)) and I like the final shot / voiceover. At first I thought it was very rarely ended but after about 20 seconds I understood the meaning and loved it last. However, due to the lack of importance of the story, the news published in the school matches the top view of the report, saying that I do not care for letters at all. The final scene was probably supposed to be a little crazy, in fact, I could not take care of the girl or her boyfriend. * Spirir's end * <br /> <br /> Overall, I like this picture, but it disappointed me and I think there was a real possibility in addition to some good scenes. Couple of other points, the main girl is quite beautiful and cute, and ultimately the song that is very good at the game. I rated it 7/10 <br /> <br />
