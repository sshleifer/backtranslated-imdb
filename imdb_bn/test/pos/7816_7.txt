Just Cast tells you that it's a groove on the normal Italian west. Veteran actor Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy team with Alex Cord, who at that time, felt at the edge of the stardom. The result is a movie that is both both off-bits and down-bits, and it will still satisfy more searchers than Westerners than gunfight. Especially interesting here is the character played by Alex Cord. Some hope that "hero" in this West might be sharp and confident, but "Clay McClord" is an extreme example and, surprisingly enough, he often hears in a passive, even weak position. He is afraid of being victimized by his father's instability and at this moment of helplessness he wants to harm those who want to harm him or those who want to help him. To strengthen its passivity, Clay McCord - do you love that name? - is often a little more than being torn from the waist as it is being done on display of an interesting plaything. His nature also has strong macroeconomic strokes, in most cases when used by his enemies as a punch bag and then suspended by his wrist and hanging in the middle of a street. He simply does not fail to protect himself, but McCord is not equally effective to protect the people around him. Almost everyone of his helper died <br /> <br /> "A minute to pray, a second to die" is far from complete success, it is a depth and a tone which makes it different and makes it memorable. It's also a good showcase for Alex Cord, whose career has dropped after this year after some promising years in the mid-1960s. He was about 36 years old when he was a memorable part of his physical mastery - and his view hanging by his wrist, empty chest and sweat, the cinema "Biffake"
