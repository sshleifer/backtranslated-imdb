I think the problem of this event is not really respected that it is after Elin and after friends came after Sinfield. Those three sitcoms were the star show of their time. <br /> <br /> KOQs came to this special time on TV. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Started and was and is a timeless classic. I'm not even more disappointed than Sheffield. But the KOQs came closer to the original. <br /> <br /> To come laughing, I only have to pay second rate to KQQ Segmentfeld. ELR will be the second as the creation and interaction of character is more respectable. <br /> <br /> Anyhow, the Kowki has been ranked as the top ten in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other City Com worth mentioning is two and half men who do not really hold the other four candles, but we're all left.
