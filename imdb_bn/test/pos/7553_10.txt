I first encountered "four friends" of Arthur Pen at the end of one night at HBO. I have never heard of it, I hope very little, but because I saw Penn and script writer Steve Tessich was interested in seeing a creation made by a team. For the next two hours, I sit quietly, see this incredible document and incredibly incredible story they took. In the 1960s, the decade of American landscape change by the arrival of America by following the story of a semi-autobiographical story of young immigrants in America, "four friends" Danilo, Eastern European immigrant (bright Craig Wasan). Danilo was accompanied by his friend Georgia (converted Jodie Thayan, who, sadly, did not have an equal chance), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Hoodleston). "Four friends" have added too much territory to try to explain to me here, but if you have not seen this movie, then I'm requesting you to find a copy (it's just released from the DVD) and see it. You will not be disappointed. Tesicho script is surprisingly mad ?? Funny at times, incredibly sad at times, but always interesting and honest. Pen signifies with a sure hand, and a clear love for the life of the time and the person we are following. The throw is pretty superb. This film must have made a big star out of WASHION, which is really one of the country's most distorted opponents. Not your ideal brainless Hollywood sex clip, Jodie Thallan makes the curtains warm at a performance that makes the audience easily fall in love with the character of the film. The fine acting of Metzler and Huddleston can easily be ignored by their co-star shades, but they are nice and help to film anchor. Danilo's parents also include Mickels Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence, as well as Reed Birny and Lois Smith. I have seen this in HBO many years ago, without a copy of the "four friends" from the very first day. It's now one of my favorite movies for over 20 years now. I do not give enough opportunities and think that if you give it a chance, you will feel the same way.
