I enjoyed the movie, which was the most grapefruit scenery, being Greek, I enjoyed my country and I liked the flattering director's view. For years when Greece was struggling to stand on its own feet through the war of Nazi and tribute, based on a real story. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but times are hard and they have many sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage gives an enthusiastic account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love looking great in a uniform. I love to play Christmas Bell with the husband of the madrassa's husband, he looks very good like Greek, his personality matches with the Greek patriots! There is a true warrior, or what! The movies I want to buy and keep them in my collection ... forever!
