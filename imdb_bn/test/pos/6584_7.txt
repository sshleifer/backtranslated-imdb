The film was watched at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and director Aku Lohimiz launched his film and later became a Q & A. For some reason this film is known as English frozen land, so I do not know how the distributors have been frozen from the pauses. This is a very good film. It is not enough to me that I will make it pure in a nice section but I talked to some viewers who thought it was an extraordinary movie. Louhimies said that the people of Finland loved this movie or hate it and said many people in the theater walked on it. I objected to some violence, oaths, drugs and alcohol abuse and scenes of sex interpretation. This is a very clever story of how these different lives are sifted together because of a devastating effect. These pictures have very interesting and strong characters. I will rate 7.0 in a possible 10 and see it again and carefully recommend it.
