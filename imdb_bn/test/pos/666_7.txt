This Bras Ivy was broadcasted after a national debate about a possible "Sarah Law" after the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Sarah, who was promoted in 2001 (moreover later) by a special Pedo-Gedon complaint. In fact, its schedule was delayed, after taking legal advice from Phil Collins that he made the show's creator fool Chris Morris as foolhardy at the beginning of an operation. <br /> <br /> It is said that this event is likely to be a very bad taste There is more to remember than the content of the content, but I acknowledge that I laugh loudly. The version centers around the pedophile and how society treats both of them and their victims. Chris Morris played the presenter who told the audience that an infamous Pyodiophil started from the place, then admitted that an eight-year-old child was accidentally placed in a capsule as well as a pipophile. Crying for the boy's crying crying. As I said a very tasty taste <br /> <br /> In one of the most discussed discussions of this show, Dr. Fox gave a scientific lecture that the pedophiles shared the same nervous system in crabbs ("nobody knows it but a scientific reality") Labor MP Barbara Net and Kate Thornton warnings give public warnings about Follett's Petrol Pillows to viewers that podphofiles "Who was a shy innocent child and now has a 60-year-old colonel who has sex with the young hunter who can send gas through the internet to a sex hunter with a predator". Morris also sees a police officer in the child protection team that he wants to know whether the pictures are classified as serious. Among the pictures, Barbie was surrounded by a marital assistance, and a composite picture, which was the head of a young boy, a dog's body and an exact penis that belonged only to John Holmes. Hey I never said this program was delicious? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to mention the pedo-gyden, which was surrounded, where politicians, child organizations and police members condemned shouting to make fun of a very serious matter. The show was poor taste despite all the ridicule through me, but it is a satirical mockery. Perhaps the critics should work hard in the mirror, where a liberal nobleman allows conviction to suppress the podophyll's dirt for traveling around the streets of Britain.
