I got this image from ebay because i love gay and i teal Schweiger. However, this is a movie that you see second time, you will never say to yourself, "Hmm, I forgot this annoying part, I'll create popcorn." It's not that part of it. This is a very liquid and continuously attractive film. And, yes, Til Schweiger is not something else, it's worth it. However, it's straight guys even a great movie.
