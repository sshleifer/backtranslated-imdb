After all, almost I wrote this comment, I had already written kitwat 1 about this game and I was confused. This is not a video game and an actual movie. I mean, I'll be picking myself a decent Denior movie or a video game in a day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I get out of my way, can we go? Crawling Tiger's Video Game Adaptation, Hidden Dragon, you can be guessed based on the same name movie. Unknowingly, the movie was released after three years of release. That's because of a slow development or just simple laziness, someone really knows. At least, I do not. <br /> <br /> This game lets the player act as the four main characters of the film: Jane, Shu Leyan, Lee-Mu-Bye, and Dark Cloud (a story which is unlocked for a separate gameplay, hidden bonuses.) These four characters There are fighting styles based on how they fought in the film. However, the real eye candy is an obscene step, which allows each character to protect from the attacks of enemies in the most impossible and seriously defying ways, which are shown in the first movie. <br /> <br /> The story is probably based on the story based on the story. The story of the game is called using CGI film and is said to be a subtitle Mandarin (a nice little touch, I'm considering filming foreign language track on WDD.) The story can expand what happened. During the movie, even in other characters (even after a real surprise, all video game movie adaptations did this) changed the picture of what happened in the movie to make it more effective. I never thought that Z Fox could actually go and go to rented detectives. <br /> <br /> The ability to determine how the actual bonus in the story ends with the game. What happens to Li-Mu-B's all the elements of Jane to take over? Jane did not get her shoulder? If Li-Mu-di did not achieve green fate for the second time? Your actions will determine the consequences of this situation and the fate of this game character. This is really the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> However, it shows some flaws for all its strengths. Enemies often become boring after a while and the camera angle continues to amend the most uncomfortable spots. Even the special features (which are unlocked after losing the game) are not enough to forgive even the pain that is pressurized on the player. <br /> <br /> If you like the movie you can enjoy the game. However, this game is the only way you can immerse yourself in a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you could have chosen a Denino movie instead.
