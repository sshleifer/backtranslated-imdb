<----- Small spools! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman is pregnant, but not by her husband. She develops 'something' inside her, or at least what her husband thinks. They spend a lot of hard times, when they are on the edge of neurological breakdown. The husband communicates with a UFO professor and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with him. <br /> <br /> <----- Small Spools! ----> <br /> <br /> The story may be a little better, or at least expected, but the film is interesting and it enters me and my sister without any problems in the whole movie. The performance is very good, and the filming is much better than usual, if you compare it to your normal B-alien movie. The effect is good, and movies are happening in every second. Characters are really desired, and without a stupid nurse in the scene, they are very very confident in their role. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie, and you can recommend, if you want alien / giant-kidnapping movie! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story may be a little less expected.
