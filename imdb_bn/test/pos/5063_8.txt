Taut, Political Political Thriller, Terrorist suspects by illegal legal process, even tortured, even an overwhelmingly invasive Orwell-Ian phrase (parallel damage, anyone?) For the discovery of controversial US policies, Square target. Inhuman interrogation is run by the Egyptian Chief Police, the goal of a fundamental suicide itself - a bomb plot, thus strengthening the movie's two main plot-lines. Both work well, illustrating the structure of the bomb attack graphic and cold in its realism, its stylish Tarantino-type flashback, and revealing scenes of torture on a innocent person, in their all-glorious account. The film mentions points about the use of torture in the trustworthy ways - gathered against the war against terrorists and against unfinished bureaucracy (here is the introduction of the cold-steeled Merry Strip, as the CIA's Buddhist keeps ordering for imitation) can destroy innocent lives. . Do not imagine Kaffak Kalpana, in 2005, the innocent killed in London in recent memory of the recent murder, Metropolitan Police was still in his job with the head, and nobody tried to kill the poor people. Acting is unusual - two important roles of innocent people and terrorist bombers have played in reality and unknown actors Omar Metwali and Moaya Khaus. Likewise, Iglal Naur's dreadful Chief Police and Zenib Wahkh, as his idealistic boyfriend, is a real lack of support for his performance (at least to me) with the credibility of his character. Among Hollywood's biggest names, Gilhenhal's status has grown with the subsequent films, initially disconnected here but later played a conscience - finally, the hurt and painful government person who finally did the right thing. Witherspoon basically manages his isolated wife in a key, but similarly credible, David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin have shown firmly to self-service senators and their needy who are far away to help you until their career prospects are endangered. There are some plots-based vulnerabilities; A little dramatic need to create "mystery" around El-Ibrahimy's escape, and the character of the strip is probably a bogey-man / woman obviously very clear. Girlfriends Girlfriends of Guilherlal are meaningless only for decoration and a short unexpected love scene. Though full, an engrossing thought - provocative cinematic experience.
