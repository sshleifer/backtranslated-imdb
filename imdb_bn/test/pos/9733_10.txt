First off, I hate sai fi fi stuff, and even though this movie has received fewer fonts, all right, because at least it focuses in André Toulon. At the last 3, André seemed to have mentioned that, but the stories never paid attention to him, which made me crazy. What makes me crazy is the amount of 0 it got the voting chart. Give it a rest man If you have watched this movie and liked it, please vote for it. Please What I like about this movie is that it went back to where it started. When Andrea learned the secret of first life. If you have watched a pop-pet master movie before and liked, then I would recommend renting it. But if this is the first time you see from the Prime Minister's collection, then not renting it, mainly because you can think that all pupils are like "dust" like this.
