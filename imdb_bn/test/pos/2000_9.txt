A ghost story of a typical Turkish high school with beautiful words and visual effects. Taylan biraderler (taylan bhai) had made their first shot a TV show a few years ago, I know. It was like a Turkish x-files, they had a beautiful story but there was a lack of visual effects. This time it seemed necessary and they were well utilized. This film will definitely let you laugh, as well as it may frighten you. It's a nice plot and some young, bright actors have. If you are a high school student in Turkey, you can find a lot about yourself here. There are many sources in the film about her story and the end, at this moment you will understand something, some later understand that the dialogues were written very nicely. So this film makes one of the best Turk films made last year. Do not forget that this movie is its first type in the Turkish film industry.
