I can not honestly believe that this movie is not even more rated. Claude Chabral can be called something like French Alfred Hitchcock, and this film is his second view that I saw (the first is Le Boucher), I already see that this guy is just the special power of these two pictures. The film is co-produced by French and Canadian, and is held in Canada. This cast is made of British and Canadian stars and high quality performance saves well with the rest of the film; Which is the most high quality. The film is about the mystery of the killings and the introduction of a young woman covered with blood to the police station. After being questioned by Inspector Kerla, it emerged that Patricia and her sister Muriel were attacked by a person who killed her sister and allowed Patricia to escape. However, the investigation is going on, Patricia returns to the station to give a new evidence, which reveals a lot of shocking identity to the killer. <br /> <br /> The performance of this photo is excellent. Donald Sutherland is subdued as usual, but he is very well suited to the given role here and I do not hesitate to give his performance name to blood relatives as his very best. This film supports British horse Donald Plusas and David Hemming's supporters, who both go well; Especially happy, how great an actor can be, and Halloween is shameful to ruin himself in the film. The unknown odd laundry gives Patricia its role as a great performance. The movie is very mysterious for the first hours and really keeps visitors hooked. When Inspector Kearla discovered the diagonal of a mural, the film transforms into a play where the last act of the girl is shown; And this section of the film is not as good as it was in the past, it is still interesting and finally takes a great twist! Overall, blood relations are a great film that really looks good. Le Boucher is a well known effort from Chabrol, but my money is at least as good as this! Highly recommended.
