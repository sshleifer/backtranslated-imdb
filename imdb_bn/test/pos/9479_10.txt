If you like Cagney you like this picture. It has the obscurity of American integrity at no cost, personal or social. Cognizance of New York weight and measurement head! Cagan goes against angry politicians, criminal underground, a prominent charity and simple grocers who add up a few ounces of a chicken price. The chicken scene is sunny, where Cagney finds a weight by an uneducated butcher in the cave's cave. In a ridiculous view that controls "the evidence", chickens get around the shop. If you like old telephones, there are interesting views of the dial, phone and even the odd phone ropes. Compared to many movies produced today, it is pure entertainment and it has a mystery with comedy and should be the guidance of honesty on all. In the simplest time it reflects a world we can not find today. Fashion (especially the hats) Outwear and Automobiles all play a prominent visual role in defining this small film.
