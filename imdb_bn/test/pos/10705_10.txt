Producer, Matt Mochary, while Hewlett Foundation traveled to Rio de Janeiro, Anderson Sa (AfroReggae music movement leader), stumbled on the subject of film. Through the story of Cycher, Mouchery was inspired so much that he called his friend, NYC filmmaker Jim Zimbalist, who quit his job and joined the Moucher of Brazil, a document of the Fayalas of Rio and working in the culture of violence. <br /> <br /> In the first part of the film, you show the culture of violence in the Fawlaus of RIO (Shantoutsons where poor live) and disperse the police and attack residents. The footage is graphic and shiny. <br /> <br /> Charismatic Anderson Psi, raised from Fawlaus's negativity, who had gathered the elements of Afro-Brazilian culture and crossed the potential of drug addiction to start the Afro-Agade movement. A rush, safe heavy style of rage, ska, and other elements that have spread to other parts of the world. You can not help but be carried by music, especially when you see local children involved in SA's school, which he established to keep children from drug to children. The rest of the picture follows the rise of Sae Meteor and its positiveity changes the lives of many children in order to find life beyond the ongoing narcotics. Spirir: When filmmakers thought that they were drawing pictures, then there was an incredible life changing event, whose solution should be believed. The film continues and you are finally stuck on your seat. <br /> <br /> This image is "City of God" and a worthy response to it. The great situation illustrated in this film is covered by a real example of how Fawella residents can overcome their terrible situation and how they can use their resources until constructive ends. You will not be able to help and choose Anderson Sa successfully. <br /> <br /> This image is awesome shot, fast, and quite a bit dry. Judging by the overwhelming response to Silverndox screening viewers last night, the film should be released internally in the United States and thumping soundtracks will also be released. Keep an eye on this extraordinary documentary - it's great!
