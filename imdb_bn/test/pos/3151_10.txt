A perfect example of what the reader should look like in a short film. A written story, through very good text conversation, beautifully illustrated images, a score that continuously narrates the way through the story and describes the characters pictured with thought and grace. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie at a festival where other interesting films and ideas are screened. But in one of the other shorts, there was not a great film-making element in a movie that the reader did. The reader directs every festive person to pay attention to the room and takes us to the mental life of the character for 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Dak Rogers has created a beautiful movie and I hope to see more of this from the director it is more shorts or perhaps a feature length film.
