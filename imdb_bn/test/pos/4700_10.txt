"Sister Helen" is a fantastic documentary about a brutal, intolerant, stupid headache, bitter, fan (civil), in an exaggerated surrounding south bronze. However, among the 21 residents, the garter drunk / drug addiction Robert, the only middle-class representative ?? Was he a real work, house, even a BMW ?? Before he could tell him off regrets he died. Why? <br /> <br /> Robert, in six, was in parole. He complained that Helen had kept a huge stick on her and threatened to turn her away if she did not catch her. In an "extra" interview, he said Helen ran at the center to pay compensation for the death of three people in her life? Her husband and her two sons. <br /> <br /> She is an alcoholic, died of a heart attack at the age of 55. A boy dies from heroin overdose and another 15 people die. Helen was left a girl, whom she left to run the center. The girl was not happy. He wanted his mother <br /> <br /> How Helen has changed is so interesting It seems that he has changed the vast ocean. But seeing this annoying video and annoying video several times - once described with the managers - it has become clear that Helen has substituted about 42 men for adultery to replace her three dead men. <br /> <br /> Helen acknowledges that she has ignored her kids and is spending her every day. But at the age of 56, his helplessness, intolerance, and intense tongue did not appear. Living with him was very difficult. Even Robert says he was clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> This picture frustrates a man who wants to live happily with Helen. I think he looks cute on his way. Again, he condemned his "assistant" mail to not refrain from bathing Mela for a year. Then he waves his messy pillowcase in the air. This picture is chock-full of threatening Helen and condemning people. His signature song "My Way" Her favorite phrase, "I'm going to be completely honest with you." Often, people using such phrases can be reversed. <br /> <br /> Residents are really down and outside. Only Robert has no marketing skills beyond pushing a shower. All of them need a roof over their head, and Helen, because she runs her own place, she has the power to acknowledge or deny anyone she wishes. He has no governing board and does not get any public funding. This is his show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in the dog's perspective. That means he can stop eating cold turkey and all that others can do. He blames substance abuse on drugs or alcohol, and the underlying problems that men do not manage to drink and to drink. She is not a therapist, just a zombie, who color her hair, practices habits, and has full control over her tenants, and stops drinking. <br /> <br /> Helen also worked on her prison on the request of urine demand (urre said) for her urine. Twenty major, very hard and respectful long-term old resident - He believed - his test failed. Helen was angry and exile to her. Major said standing in his ground and the result was heroin because he was wrong. Helen did not produce and could not be considered a mistake. He knew the Major for a long time, especially it was annoying. Yet he had left his relationship with her, assuming she was a liar and relied on the entire result. Major eventually appears as an opiate to discover the codein in his cough syrup. Helen does not apologize publicly, but supposedly made up of the chief. <br /> <br /> Helen also achieved very impressive fame around her old surroundings. He was admitted in a rocket, for a tire slash very late at night. The person has wronged him and certainly his tires are slashed. She was not a beautiful woman. So how did he decide the only way to survive the name of the tragedy (his last name)? Since the three men died in the car ?? The Travis Center was started. <br /> <br /> It was a big deal for some residents. They cooperated with Helen and found a cheap, safe, independent and structured place to live in exchange. But one person said he loved prison. Addicts and drunks do not need to be treated like all children. Helen has been appointed the "old school" strategy, which has been denied. However, no one would have to stay in the center and for some, it was certainly a positive experience. The Travis Center is not a treatment center. It's a habit of drunken and dopers who make their lives straight. <br /> <br /> For full sister Helen's experience, check out all the additional interview plus and audio versions where two directors share their experiences with their sisters Helen and her guests.
