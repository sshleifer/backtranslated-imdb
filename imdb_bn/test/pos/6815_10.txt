I absolutely liked this picture ... so much emotion in such a short time. I love to start and how it completely threw off the guard. I love being brought in the story and the deer. I know that when I think of deer I think of innocence, and prosperity. Also, according to Psalm 42: 2 in the Bible it is said, "As a deer pants for the water, so my life is for you, O God". Which can connect at the last moment when the woman says that it will be right. He knows if he is going with God. Perhaps I'm thinking of it a lot. But sometimes it is interesting to see what goes on in the minds of people. Thank you for sharing this Best Composition with Viewers everywhere. I live in Texas and I just play on cable ... I came to know more about this picture and to learn more about this amazing director! I really like the music that is used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a film. It's definitely quite a mood set. Very nice choice! <br /> <br /> Thanks again. <br /> <br /> <br /> Leightea
