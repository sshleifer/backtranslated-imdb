If you ever live in Ukraine, this movie is absolutely fun. With the wearing of a gold chain, watching the hip hop and breaking the dance side, cars and waitresses make the breeze and show the vegetarians, together with a loud shake, loudly loudly bits the bit and pieces of Ukraine into the picture that if you do not know. I was thinking of downing my head in most movies, "Yes, all right." If Russian understands, it's a lot of fun because subtitles do not always judge it. The actor is so trustworthy and Elias Wood does a great job playing a socially inactive Jewish baby. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davies Jr. Jr., the grandfather's "eye dog watching" who is really a psychopathic border collie. Characters are so predominant and desired that you believe that they are real people.
