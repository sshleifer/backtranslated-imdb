Susie Prey A rare and sweet movie that gives you warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but healthy, and it's fun, and captivating characters. At first, I thought the movie would be a movie that would give birth to me after five minutes, but I was wrong. It made me tear repeatedly, and its plot was tempting, making me a good boy. I like the movie, and still remember, after 9 years !! I highly recommend this to anyone and the film is family based, so you do not have to worry about unnecessary content. Indeed, if Disney shows more movies to be equal to Susie's question, it will be the most popular family-based channel in the world. Now only if Disney will show it once more! ^ _ ^ Go Susi Question. !!
