Dark and shimmery sets, thrilling music that is the single (or razor) broadway bridges through your spin, with a perfect cast lead by Greats Henon and Lansbury. This fantastic theater is flawlessly transferred to the small screen. Sandhyhem is one of the most talented songs of our age and Tod's masterpiece, Dark Hottie Act I Final from Ballachin Opening Ball - "A Little Prestige", where Greedy and Todd are fantastic about their victims, not to stop thrill, excited and satisfied with this game. Bitsy Joslin is also better as Johanna, and even dramas seem to be a little crazy. Todd had played as a corrupt judge after Edmund Lindeck Jasmine and Toad's distorting. Lancerby and Henon have ordered this event since only two great actors / stars can do. Other musical highlights include Tod's "Johanna" Lovett's "The Worst Piece in London" and the second opening of the 'God that is good' opening, and a title to describe this production!
