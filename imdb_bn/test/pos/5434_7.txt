Not every line of a comedy is funny. This film comes with serious issues, recognizing voters and keeping it in light while telling jokes about it. If it wants to turn it into a movie, it will be made in the movie The Daily Show. I think Robin Williams is much more fun than Ravi in ​​this movie. And when my wife and I shared some opposition opinion, we became laughable for several parts of this movie. Here the script writer Fox News can give some fair and balanced lessons. Louis Black was right for his part, but was unable to bring his special brand comedy for his role. Christopher Walken was also good, playing his fairly supported role, kept the story alive.
