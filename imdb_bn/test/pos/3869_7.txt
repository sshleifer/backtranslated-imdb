Although Bert the Genius is not one of the first Simpsons episodes, the first general episode of Bert Gen Geneus first or later. Setting it up in any gymnicy or theme is just your typical Simpsons episode. It always seems to me that it is an episode that grows on you. There are some elements that I do not care about, which are basically bloating animations which can be forgiven. But over time I like this story of this uniqueness. <br /> <br /> For example, for this episode it will be very difficult for live-action sit-com in an ideal budget. Various sets of episodes that include Mrs. Mellon's Class, Opera B. Computer BA With my point of view, one of the biggest strengths of Simpsons Animation is to realize. Lack of visible limitations compared to live-action. <br /> <br /> It's pretty intelligent and fresh at the point of writing. The idea is quite unique, and especially facing the problem. Ol 'failed-safe work was very difficult, it was only from his classmates that Bart's social isolation failed (though explosion science experiments could prove otherwise ... which I think is one of the best visible gags. ) The reason for the end is a little different, because Bart travels nude in his house, Homer is already working in the shorts Ray was, but merging and Lisa's little fun to go back there and then do something else. <br /> <br /> This is a very good episode, with many interesting new points in the series, though it is not perfect. <br /> <br /> Oh, and now the name of the name Kwijybo must of course be on the world.
