Well I do not know much about anything, but I like this picture sure. In short, it was creative, ridiculous, easy and hearty. In other words, that was what it was set. <br /> <br /> The story is set on the girl's first love (as the title suggests) and must be cautioned: There is a challenging or exciting subject here. I mean, it is a baby cartoon. This is a really simple story, but it's been well-said, and it keeps your attention well. <br /> <br /> End: It's short, it's funny, it's nice, it's easy, it's good.
