People are saying that this movie is an 'ideal teen horror movie' ... well it's a horror movie with a teenage girl. What do you expect! This is a good movie, when I counted 3 true scripts in the audience, this movie was then and it was a very horrible movie. I was not disturbed at any time in the movie and I was even at one stage at the end of my seat. The only thing that was a little worse was that it tastes slowly and slowly slowly and steadily in a short story, slowly, slowly, slowly, gradually, in the real story. The performance was good, the scene was good and the story was very good, I hope in a few months when 'a stranger will call 2'! Good movie!
