The most fun show on TV, though not everyone is humorous. I realized that it was difficult to keep the show fresh while running, but it is shameful that only six episodes were depicted. The giggles quickly fly up to the buyers quickly, when you think of Drebin and his boss, Ed Hawken being framed in fridge frames, closing credits seem to be rolling, in which the criminal (still running) will look at everyone motionless and try to escape. In another episode, the building collapsed around them because Drebin and Hawken remained in the refrigerator mode. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Haslee Nelson is a ridiculous brightness like Frank Drebin and fit for this show? How he managed to keep a direct face through some of this is beyond me. Because jokes and sight gauges often and quickly arrive, you can see episodes second and third time and catch some that missed the first time. If you're like me, you can keep an eye on them and still laugh at yourself. Even the jokes that were not in any sense or apparently to them, such as "Abraham Lincoln as Rex Hamilton" tag-line announced the first opening, did anyway? Perhaps they were thrown there for that reason. The intelligent 1970s old intelligence / police remained silent in the Coppo show, Police Squad will come back from commercial division with the words "Act Two", which immediately follow the "Yankees One" or some other quip. Was done. In opening credits, episode titles will be displayed on screen, but the announcer will release a completely different title. My favorite joke and lines from this series are on a very high list, but when one of my darling asked Drewbin a down-on-the-fate boxer, who previously fights, "Do you think you can beat the champ?" Boxer responds, "I can blindfold him!" Which response back to the drabbin, "But if he is blindfolded?" One minute later, in reference to the boxer's small, dingy apartment, Dreybin said to her, "I'm going to help you get out of this sewer." The next thing you see, the streets are popping Drebin through a Manhole cover! In another episode, Drebin and Hawken are questioning suspected suspects Alii of bomb attack. Durbin does not believe her, saying, "OK, let's go tell you movie." After a short break, the drebins, hookens and suspects all look at the camera and say together, "You go to the movies." After a few moments, when Drebin was forced to carry out a suspected bomb attack due to lack of evidence, he cried out loud with the storm, "Cut the bomb off!" What is seen later is a police who thumbnails a WWII-style plane on a runway outside the building! Although there were many classic drawback quotes, one was particularly memorable, "Sorry for annoying Mrs. Barz, we used to come before, but your husband did not die." Another classic was, "I'm a lock, and I'm a lock." When a visible shaken kidnap victim Drebin asked, "What do I do?" ?? In the classic Deadpan fashion, Drebin responded, "Well, I understand that you are in the textile business." I said, humor not everyone ?? Many people will not "get" easily. During the show's short run, I remember the reaction is very mixed. Some people thought it was completely messy and one of the most fun things around, others thought it was stupid and irrational. For me, the police squad, even after 20+ years, the most fun thing I ever seen on TV. For young viewers who enjoy this kind of trick but who never saw a police squad because they were very young when they started the series at a very young age, I highly recommend it. I was more fun than the six episode "Nude Gun" films.
