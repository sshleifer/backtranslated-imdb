"Crossfire" was the first name of the three stars "Robert" but it was not so much remembered as one of the first Hollywood movies to deal with so-semitism. <br /> <br /> A man who we can learn later, is a Jew named Joseph Samuels (Sam Leven). Captain Finlay (Robert Young), the police of the pipe smoking, was allocated in this case. A former soldier, Montgomery (Robert Ryan) brought the murder scene and we learn through flashback that he met with Samuels repeatedly with other soldiers who were in the process of departing from the service since WWII. <Br /> <br /> According to Montgomeri, he and Paul Floyd b owers (Steve Brady) followed Samuels and Simplic. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) For Samuels Apartments For Water Montgomery told Finlay that Mitchell had left the first apartment and he is still alive and well after the Floyd magazine. <br /> <br /> Unable to locate Mitchell, Finlay suspects him of murder. He enlists Sgt. Peter Kili (Robert Mitchell) to help him find Mitchell. Mitchell has already been surprised by a dazed state road. She met prostitute Gini (Glorya Glover) in a bar and strikes up a friendship. He gives him a key in his apartment and he goes there to the rest. Unexpectedly looking for a man (Paul Kelly) Guinea. Mitchell, still in a maze, leaves and goes back to meet Keeley and his pals. Kelly kept him from the police and hid in the movie room all night. <br /> <br /> From Mitchell's perspective, we learn that Montgomery hates the Jews and is probably the killer. Finnley began to focus on his investigation in Montgomery to try to prove his crime. He arranged for one of the soldiers, a child named Leroy (William Fipes) set a trap for Mongmerei. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best in the genre of "Film Nayar". In fact, it has received several Academy Award nominations for best supporting actors, including Ryan and the azim. It was made on a decent budget in about three weeks. <br /> <br /> This classic "Film Nair", shadow, low key light, and story is going on for most of the night. The piece "femme fatale" is the Guinean of Grahame who plays a minor role, but still your classic "femme fatale". The characterless character is immortalized by Paul Kelly (great bit) and spit by Gini and will he do the same as Mitchell? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keep them typed. Robert Young makes a good less original spy, but Robert Mitchem does not have anything to do except Mitchell's friend. Cast others are Mitchell's wife Lex Barker (who plays next year "Tarzan") as Finchle's assistant as Mitchell's soldier friend and Richard Powers (who was previously known as Tom Kony). <br/> <br /> Director Edward Demitti will run in front of the House of Non-American Committees like Communist Affiliation and spend several years in jail.
