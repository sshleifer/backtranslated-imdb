OK, that was just brighter. I hope the rest of the season was 1 this powerful. It really needs more episodes like this. <br /> <br /> Everybody was honest in today's days, though Cast worked perfectly. The writing was fantastic and was so edited. Great account of all accounts. <br /> <br /> This episode was thrilling, suspicious and you guessed it till the end. Which tried most of the MOTW episodes, but failed until now. <br /> <br /> The first five stars for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I do not remember being this good. I think it's even better than the great movie 'The Thing'.
