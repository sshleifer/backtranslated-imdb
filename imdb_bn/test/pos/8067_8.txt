Annie Rooney resides in New York slums with her officer father and brother team, where she continues to fight with other neighboring kids. Officer Rooney said, Anne is secretly a crush on Joe Kelly (her younger brother Mickey, the gang chief, Annie is constantly battling). Kelly sponsors a dance, where Tony plans to shoot Kelly so that she seems to be stupid in front of her daughter, but Officer Kelly is seriously injured instead. Tony (part of the Kelly gang) Tony and friend Spiderman said that Kelly shot his father, so he went after revenge. Annie learns about this and closes her brother, if he is in time. This film is a very good mix of humor and heart, although this plot does not begin until the film's 40-minute mark. Piccord is enjoyable (though she's 33 years old a girl not more than 12-13) and really falls into her character. Haines can not make Kelly as hard as possible, but the audience enables her to feel at an emotional level. The scene where the officer called his father's death Annie and the last one really kept a heap of your throat. It is fun to see all kinds of kids mixing throughout the film. Ratings, 8
