For those who like me and used to enjoy and enjoy high budget Hollywood movies, this movie seems so remote to a large screen with surrounding audio. But I was surprised to see how many people I can see this. It is normal that you think that nobody wrote a scene or someone managed it. You are the director and you write the scenario while watching it. For me, the time I spent watching a movie, I'm going to some other world. This film is the first example for me, which shows that millions of dollars of budgeted movies, audio storage is not often required to travel around the world. These movies send you to millions of dollars (or perhaps you can go back to yourself) without any crores of dollars or technical skills. I felt that I was reading El'Atanagar from Cam.
