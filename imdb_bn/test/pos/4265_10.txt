Occasionally, mainstream media seems to be driven by a bunch of brain journalists. They listen to each other and report on what others report. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what is available if something is done to report something about it. <br /> <br /> Real journalism should give different perspectives on some issues that have the right opportunity to create their own opinions. <br /> <br /> This documentary will help you with mainstream media reports. At least for me, it has provided many relevant information related to motivation / motivation behind the worldwide protest today at various political summaries.
