Buster Keaton was controversial at his most enjoyable time when he did 20 minutes of short films, and they were not as lazy as mad madder than this gem. The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix with a wanted felon. This street leads to his wide range of hype about police and fellow passengers to recognize his face from his "Wanted" signs. The goat is a great site with Gog choke-a-block, from the first scene in the bread row, until the wonderful lift chase. A Keton film does not feel like a lack of silence, as you do not need it with the word. His films explain themselves through a wonderful (yet incredibly dangerous) self. He was not as strong as he did in 1921, but it is not difficult to see how influential he was.
