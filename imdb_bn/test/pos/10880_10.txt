This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I first played different players, and I did not like them much, but this game is something that I can not put my finger on, it makes it a great fun. Maybe it's a remarkable story to keep in the game. Maybe it's the fluid movement of letters. Maybe it's a gadget and a weapon. Maybe it's James Bond's Subhash Character Whatever it is, this game is not how old I think it's played.
