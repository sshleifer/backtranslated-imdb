This show is great for an exhibit which sits and watches together adults and children. The story is a little slow for adults but they are still good. There are many children in my family, boys and girls, and it is difficult to understand what they all agree to see, but when they want to see Mystic Nights, they agree with each other. This is a wonderful show and I hope they will continue to do it. All the children in my family think Vincent Walsh is the best among them all. We have seen that he has done many other things and thinks he is doing a great job. We wish the actor, actress, writer, director and producer all good wishes and continue to do good work.
