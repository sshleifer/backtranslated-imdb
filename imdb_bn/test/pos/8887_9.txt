We are living in sad times today, it seems that every comedy movie and TV show is painful, unreasonable and cheap, filthy, or poor laughing. Most people do not know how to laugh at it in a comedy, and these people must "watch the wax from the train". I'm a little hesitant to say that I've seen it sometimes, one in fun is the ending from the beginning of the movie. The comedy is so unexpected and rolls just enough to laugh out across many times. Murder will not be fooled by plot. Concerns about whether the plot is going to take care of us or what is happening is not serious enough. This story involves a young man (Danny Davito) who wants to get rid of his annoying, disgusting mother (Ann Ramsey, who was nominated for the Oscars, was completely shameless to my opinion) and killed Billy Crystal's wife, Crystal to steal his novel Wanted dead. I do not want to spoil jokes and jagas in this movie, but I can say that if you want to laugh then this film must be seen. Quickly and indeed, comedy lovers are a real treat, and the type of image that you can not see today. <br /> <br /> *** ***
