Despite all the hassles of Trouble with the Troubaushaus episode, Terrero's balance can be only the best episode of the series. And, when I always like the firmness of the action because it's so funny, I really have to cast my vote very well as this Romulan episode. <br /> <br /> The picture is interesting enough, it's really like the WWII submarine film, which, after hijacking in the postposts of the Federal Republic, tries to destroy the Roumulan before returning to the empty zones, it lags behind in Rumulan ships and enterprises. In many ways, the program is like this movie - where American Captain (Robert Mitchell) and German Captain (Cart Jurgenses) are shown in the counter-point because they try to make both unexpected - and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the writing was so amazing and the main characters were so well-written and played (as the leader and leader of Mark Leonard Rouulan). Curiously, for the die-hard trackers, they will recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played with Spoke's father. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
