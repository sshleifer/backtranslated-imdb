Fantastic Russian WWII movie. Like most Russian WWII movies, The Usent is incredibly frustrated. It is dense in its symbol. The story follows the two sides, Tatnikov and Rebecc (Boris Platnikov and Vladimir Gostyuchin), who go on to search for food. On their trip, they were targeted by German soldiers, who injured Sotnikov. Sotnikov, instead, kills one of the Germans, which causes problems for both sides and they later run. The place for the greatest success of the film is his lively idea. Russia is frozen and frosty, and it is hard to feel cold to go directly to your own bones. Shepitko puts his shot around the character, examining every shot of his shot. Probably not like this, but the film has been made 1.33: 1, which gives the film a sense of clustrophobia. Although the whole film is a great achievement, I think the first half was stronger than the second. My main complaint about the film is that it is a very irrational Christian metaphor for its measurement. I do not think the symbolism adds further into the proceedings, especially when I was already confused by the debate between the two parties. It's not quite fair. I was weighting professionals and weighing disasters. I started lively towards the perspective of a particular character, and then popped up the director and he told me that Judeas! Despite some heavy interference, it is still a must see.
