The fact that critics feel every negative feeling per show is that the reality is all its own. If you dislike it too, do not see it. <br /> <br /> Some critics say that you will be fooled, slowly, or old, old primitive to enjoy this show. Au Contreer, my friends I'm not claiming that all rivals are smart. There are smart ones, and there are more than fools. But I argue that probably the average high quality IQ of this website is compared to their average critics. All right, I said it. The girls have to say a lot for seducing science. I'm sorry, but please pick up all the sticks of your ass, and you understand the reason for hating these haters that they threaten you. <br /> <br /> Those who are unaware of social science, especially the mother tongue behind science, are going to miss the boat clearly. One thing is clear: Girls are not the only place to meet women. I personally think that not suitable ladies or even clubs, so that they do not hunt men like we see in the show. But what do men like this ???? In addition to those who have stumbled in the games, they are symbols of men. They are men who meet women with the most difficult circumstances. These are men who take ownership of their own sexuality. These men do not ask for their break with their girlfriends, and these men do not say "okay" on the word "ok friendship". <br /> <br /> Well, okay ?? In fact, when you take your special long-term girlfriend to the club, you are very scared. We all. These guys know what women like. (Again, only those who have "play") <br /> <br /> And even those bad ... they are worth a laugh! <br /> <br /> If you go outside of a club and actually interact with people around you, then you have to look for this show entertainment. <br /> <br /> I find so much disgust for this event why I am hurt. My best guess is that it sparks uncertainties among men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or those who believe in women who want to attract their attention to spontaneous creatures. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It's pure entertainment, and all good, its real. It is a very receptive take on a recent sexual sexual psychology. The sexual roles were never different from before, and this show provided its very real view, <br /> <br /> I think there is some intelligence to take positive action from this show. <br /> <br /> This show appeals to the specific target market, and if you're out of it, I think you should not have been protected in the show. We could talk about any other event, is not it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
