This rental, I own the DVD, got it for $ 9.99. Being under a thief is so stolen. Of course, there are good movies. Movies with plot or action low or no holes. BUt I have that problem with this movie. For me, if the movie is genuine, honest and exploitative of its flaws (and virtues, of course!) In the name of entertainment, then it has fulfilled its purpose. I got to take care of, because its manufacturers care. The whole film is boring from the beginning, but its makers took the entire commitment seriously, and I was not too busy taking the movie seriously. And that's true, because I want to take a lot of importance with every movie, oh, many, leave me alone. For all its separatism, this movie is almost perfect, and completely entertaining! What a fun play! It has become very relevant in the light of 9/11 events. In no way do I try to reduce the loss. But this movie will collapse the fall of the WTC, before we happen to never make the film after that incident. <br /> <br /> "... it is good, or is it here." "Do not you agree?"
