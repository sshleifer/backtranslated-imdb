First seen 8/26/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-John Cassettes): The first independent film of the Conservates has launched a style that is a lot different than listening to Hollywood audiences. This film has also released a number of banned topics, especially genuine racism which was probably common throughout the country, but most of the time white-controlled filmmakers did not show it at the time. At this time only the most respected black actors played and displayed a personality such as White's (liberal Sydney Potier). Besides, without ending the film, many filmmakers leave the relationship without really ending the relationship, but actually the viewers realize that life is like this (it is going ...). I like this type of endeavor because it lets you think more about letters and what can happen next, and the decisions are not just for you. When the film follows the human life (voice, some people who have a brief relationship and have been in contrast to the color of the skin), we see what will happen to understand what the white man has done. This is very well done and makes the movie very special. The movie, which is supposedly done improvisationally, makes the movie even more amazing. You can not say if you can say, I liked this movie. You can check out this classic early independent film on it.
