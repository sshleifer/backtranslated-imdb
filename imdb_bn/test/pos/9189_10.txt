I was not sure about getting this movie DVD because 2100 black and white movies really have something against people, but I bought it as well. I still can not understand why it was black and white, but I can see only negative about this film, and sure that it is a perfect example to see the strong emergence of the Brazilian film. Not everyone understands such a movie, but it is completely fruitful for those who do it. Unlike Homo Kui Kopiyeva, this spirituality fits quite well and is better acting than at least, or like other successful Brazilian movies such as Bicho de Sieb Cabasas, Sidad de Deos, Bra Jant Brasili etc. <<br /> <br /> My only hope is that this jewel is not objectionable and rape by violent Hollywood remakes. It is amazing to see how these people spend billions of dollars in dollars and still can not make a movie which is probably 1% as low budget flick. <br /> <br /> Bravo is the whole crew! 10/10
