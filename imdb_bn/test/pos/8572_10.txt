I am describing this film as a curve, in other words, it is not the greatest movie that has ever been created, but it does exactly that. This is a wonderful T & A film. I do not have any idea how much of the film is shown in this film, but I only saw one shot of 16 radio to give an idea. There are camouflaged girls all over. Have a wet T-shirt contest scene. And in Climax, two girls and girls are involved in touching football and wearing a piece of cloth is a piece of touch each time. I do not know why it gets so low rating here. Perhaps those who gave low scores thought of why the citizens are going to see. I love this movie and hope to find more similar ones. If you are looking for good cam and film, I would recommend it.
