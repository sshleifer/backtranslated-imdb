This is an enjoyable movie. It was very realistic in the "wonderful world of music" and I did it. It is perfect for anyone that shows a human component of each character and reality. This amateur singer was not all bad player. The character of Clavon Little, Marshall Tucker, played very well. Marshal himself was a saint. Here he is being paid for doing a job and he is giving a hard time about everything between these people's vans. You do not bite your hand that feed you. A player with jazz experience is hard to believe that he does not know the sounds of Deciland. He does not know there is a tremendous sense of predicting tone changes in tone. Not common, but not neglect both. At the end of the film he sent a real and harsh message when he told the Clintet player, "It is not a religion, devotion is not enough." At that level, he is right, although I think the clinic player could manage the job. He is not that hard to practice his butt and read vocal music music. Very enjoyable movie
