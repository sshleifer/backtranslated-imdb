Keep as easy as possible. This is a very good show. That's good writing, and have a fantastic cast. It is not loaded with blood and guts. And a disgraced police and his ex-wife, his son, his ex-partner (Andr√© Brugier), his childhood friend, is now a priest (George Dzunzda), and finally the person who happens to get into his hack, You can find something like this going on in your city. This is still a good story yes. And despite its flaws, it is nice to see a man pictured as a good father. See one more time (2-3) and you'll see why many of us are hiding in this show. And thanks to David Morse for this character so interesting. Another good job!
