Originally portrayed as a TV pilot in 1999, "Mulholland Dr." Was rejected. The next year David Lynch received the money for a new scene to show the film in the theater. He did so - and made one of the greatest, most bizarre and wonderful films of all time. <br /> <br /> This is not the main character of the film, but if the main character is there, they will be (Naomi). Watts) and Rita (Laura Allen Harring). Betty is a perky blonde who lives in her aunt's apartment when she audition for the part of the movie. She found Rita in her aunt's apartment and decided to help her. Let's see, Rita lost her memory. He has no rhythm. He takes his name, Rita, from a "Gilda" poster in the bathroom. So the two Rita really discovered. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is known for making some weird movies, but this picture is a strange definition. It is seamless, nighttime, and absolute indescribable. It's a dream-like film captured on. In the 100 minute point, the film has become very confusing - but if you keep an eye on it closely, it will turn into a perfect sense. After watching the film and then reading an article on the Internet that refers to a movie, I now fully understand the film. <br /> <br /> acting is very good. Watts horrible Justin thr Rou is very good about the problems of Hollywood's local alliance. Music is excellent Angelo Badulanti provides one of his best scores. And guidance - huh! David Linch was sometimes masterful as a film maker. <br /> <br /> Is this your kind of film? Well, that depends. Before you watch this movie you probably will see more of Lynch's work. You have to be patient with the film, and perhaps it will be the second time that you can see the rest of Linch's signal across the movie. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> "Mulholland Dr." A masterpiece It's brilliant, mysterious, and masterfully shot. I love it
