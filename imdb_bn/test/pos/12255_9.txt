If you do not see the film about the Washington Times news network in the late 80s, but I recommend it. This is a sad commentary in the direction of the news report in this country but with the wit, the story says. The characters are well developed and fabulous performance of Albert Brooks. She distributes all her lines with a little funny comedy. I'm not Albert Brooks fan, so welcome to everyone. A friend of mine who works as a producer for the local news center and he advises that it is near reality, so the filmmaker and director directs them to their research. <br /> <br /> Fun movie network news world insights with many. I recommend the same section 'network' as it is not nearly as dark as another movie.
