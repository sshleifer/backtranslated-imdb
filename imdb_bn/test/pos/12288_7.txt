It's not a movie, cute and diverse and sensitive heart-sensitive movie. It is a preview of a failed relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leaden Campbell) and his genuine Irish girlfriend Grace McKenna. Michael is a documentary replaying his whole relationship down on his fate and deciding what's wrong. He abused Jimmy Nadia (Nadia Djani) in the friendship with his actress, who played Grace. The idea of ​​this photo is very original. Michaels relationship is shown from each point whether it is a high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell pulls you off an excellent performance that wants to help you find him in Grace. Actually pull the great performance of the character without most character. The presence of a coffee shop is still required puzzler for moving the plot with too much surreal feel. Her monologues are often overdrawn and untouched. It is proven when he says, "Out of this chaos, we are all trying to make the order and money out of the order, but in reality, there is no such thing as money." If only this means some meaning then <br /> <br /> This commentary saves this image: The commentary is that the Spinal Tap is distorted and Michael and his brother explain their problems while filming. Michael is a very funny Self-conscious commentary that creates a very good belly smile. <br /> <br /> Overall, I want to give this movie 7/10.
