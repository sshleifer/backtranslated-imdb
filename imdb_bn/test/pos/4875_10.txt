I saw the Dust SEA at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was a festival specialty film and I won the best picture, I think entry of couple couples After guiding the director and a few stars, answer the question. One star, Suzie Lorraine, was more hot than the person in the movie, and she was eye-catching in the movie. <br /> <br /> This picture is free, but it has a lot of movie touches and feels like a quality. It even has an original classical style musical score. <br /> <br /> I'm a Savinie fan and a black-caps star actor, he thinks he is an evil power than a real person. He is using them as a twisted attempted soldier to steal the soul from people and establish his version of the Kingdom of God on earth. In his view, all of Christ was suffering and Savini wanted to suffer all. <br /> <br /> The main story of your interest is about young young man Steven, who is sent to investigate the strange events Savini, in an isolated town. He offered to go to the elite dog's path, but his son Sob asked him to be lost. Then he met with a wonderful possessed but alluring country girl. I think he fell in love with her, but he is trying to kill him, as there are several hot women in the film. <br /> <br /> I found that wooden scenes may be the maximum and maximum. Surrounding with strange people on the street (two young men in the eye scared me from the hell). <br /> <br /> There are so many things in this movie, too much in the list. There are many blood, torture and sores. Boys finger off blood closing hot girls. The explosion of a horrible girl's head. That was unexpected. Throats get slit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and Ingrid Pete, it's interesting to see him in this movie. He closed one of Leeds by plunging a cross on his forehead. Nice The man who played "more than one MiGs" in Lamb's silence is very cool in the woods battle. <br /> <br /> The film is over and over, sure that the events have happened, or if they step down, Stephen's head will be drunk due to his resignation. He returned to revenge and the scene is brutal. <br /> <br /> The director talked about the issue of religion misuse for war and murder. I am sure that the views of Savini religion were scary. <br /> <br /> This was an amazing exceptional movie that features some great stars like Savinie and Pitt, hot babes, some good supporter cast, action, and all the time you are thinking about what you are doing and what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> This is ten great reasons because it is an extraordinary independent film effort, I do not think there was a low budget but it was way less than a big studio budget, and yet they make some really interesting, unique and thought-provoking. Managed.
