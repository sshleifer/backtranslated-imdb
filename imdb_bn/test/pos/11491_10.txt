This is a really great and beautiful movie. The underlying theme of this film is struggling to make his foolish wishes for the innocent child (as Heather Graham Jolien) should explain the world in perfect condition. This is an unhappy movie, though - just the opposite. This is a funny movie, but I think it's so happy to think about the movie. At the beginning of the movie, a nice, weak, Jolien faced an addict who tried to break his mat's car. He is convinced to ask him for help, and initially he gave him 30 dollars. At the end of the film, he released again to come back, explaining that he was dropping off, doing well, and he thanked him. I can hear the crying cry. * Of course * that does not really happen. This movie does not take place in the real world. There are such incidents in the world where we lived. The sad part realized that we do not live there. We are willing people to know the happy part.
