This is one of my favorite movies ... I saw it almost a million times and it will not stop the opportunity to meet again. Actually, I love it so much that I wanted to check out the real resort where it was featured on my upcoming holiday ... does anyone know its name? If so, please email me !!! During the first release, I saw this movie and I was about the age of Nikki and for a long time my father fights for me to take it because I thought the same thing would be mine! It's just such a wonderful setting and such a cute puppy-love story This must be a certain DVD collector!
