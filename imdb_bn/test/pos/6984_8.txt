The effects of other science fiction and thriller films and stories throughout this film are clear. Alien, Alien and Starship Troopers come to mind immediately. The story itself is fairly simple and easy to travel through any space, space, no visible life, and no "landing" geological missions on the planet with a crash landing - when people go out of the light, different people are forced to work together with them. Inter alia, calculates the body count. This movie is always fun, until it works well. I believe pitch black works well. Characters are interesting and you want to know more about them than the movie continues, and I think people will be surprised and do not make it. <br /> <br /> You can see Vinyl Diesel, a murderer past, physical skills, high tolerance for pain, and conveniently see darkness, which is a stereotypical culprit. You know that he is going to finish the right thing at a time in the film because it has been indicated throughout the film that he really can have conscience on some matters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most dueling and firearms he is most brave then. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In an attempt to find out the dead pilot in his sleeping chamber, he tried to capture the ship, which led to the discovery of possible serious errors of his character - fear of being responsible, responsible and leader. In the short time of the story, his character is probably the greatest, because of which he actually takes a certain convincing charge and does not wait to stand by the road at night. He joins some strange ways to the remote human body of Radic, who ultimately endorses him for his choices and sticks with him. <br /> <br /> In some cases you will expect it by acting in this story, but I think you will be disappointed that the characters survive these frustrating experiences. Progressive train-debris to see this movie. See it! <br /> <br />
