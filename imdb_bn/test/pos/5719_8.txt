I did not see the scene of John Leguizamo's stand-up before seeing the Freak, and after seeing it in the HBO Comedy recently, it was even better, more vivid and I did not understand at the age of 14 years ago. Spike Lee has done a great job that holds the visual angle in conformity with LeiGijamo's theatrics and personal story style; It rubbing together substances and styles but unknowingly. We talk about race and sexual relations about Lezuizamo races (bit classic about sex), but many of its family and still no stick in my mind about freshness about her father. While some stories are dark, still fresh or crazy or random, LejeuZamo comes out to laugh and it often works more. If some flat falls (at any rate for me) it can be a tick of his personality here and there. But overall, it's funny stuff which is not funny, but it stings itself so that itself is so true. If you can do it!
