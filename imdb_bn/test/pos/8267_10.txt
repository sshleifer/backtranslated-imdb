When Pricius Bane was broadcast in America, I was surprised to see this beautiful story. All the actors were brilliant; Clive Owen really understood the role he plays. I went directly to a bookstore and pointed out the original novel, which is more beautiful, and after buying the book which went out of print - though I saw it online several times online. I hope to win Genet Macti's Oscar and the huge popularity of Clive Owen, the BBC will naturally get this beautiful production in the DVD ... I can not believe these years later, we still do not have a DVD. The only production produced by the BBC is to be produced, which is not for sale. Come to the BBC - You have money to stop our fans here. Please get this DVD!
