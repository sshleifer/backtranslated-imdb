This is another enjoyable and entertaining hitc movie. Incredible to James Stewart and Doris Day. Bernard Herman feels himself close to Climax. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> had the same setting and they had real location shots. I have heard that Hitcoo has done this occasionally. <br /> <br /> The review for this movie seems to be mixed. I think this is a better one than the hitc movie. Very entertaining and it's a great light playful scene at the end. <br /> <br /> I've rated 8 of the 10 ratings for this image. <br /> <br /> <br />
