I really love watching this movie. I think it's a brilliant, underlying Alfred Hitchcock movie. Everyone is familiar with the famous Statue of Liberty scene, but before that it's really a great movie. Robert Simmons I think his greatest role is, and beautiful Precena Lane shows that he has many talents. But I think Norman Lloyd best performs. Its character, fries, so evil and devious. Although he does not live for a long time, the film will not be the same to him. <br /> <br /> "Sabtur" is a great movie that will see every hitcock fan. I 10 out of 10 out of it !!
