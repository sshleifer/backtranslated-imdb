The fashion has gone more often and beyond the film miniskirt. After winning the postwar era, it was forgotten in the 1970s except for students of the film. In recent times, it has probably started to recognize as the most even handmade representation of soldiers' integration in postwar life (and which certainly includes movies as "Hunter of the Day.") I like it, but my overall assessment is that it is somewhere in the extreme. <br /> <br /> The story is an easy one. Soon after the Second World War (Big Bean!), Three different army members lived in their Midwest town and tried to resume, create civilian life. One has a disability, an ugly job is waiting for him, and there is nothing to do with the other but it is a determination. <br /> <br /> There are some good but unfortunately unbearable performances. Frederick March returns to the job of the local bank who won the best actor Oscar for playing an old sergeant. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserves it for "an extraordinary life", which was eligible for the best picture award, but apparently the film touched a nerve with post-winners. I said, it was fashionable. The march is a fantastic scene, a ridiculous statement that seems to be a few similar cases involving real WWII hero poppy boying, and otherwise it is difficult but unclear. <br /> <br /> I'm going against the grain here, but I think Mirza Liey was acting as a wife in March for ignoring the academy. I detected a crisis of warmth from him. Actually, I was thinking that he was pressuring to bother Frederick March. He identically grimaced them together every time. Something was clearly missing, his helplessness and air of tolerance than joy. I think that all these foolishness is just about being her "perfect wife", if you think a 1950s homeless man is your ideal. You may agree with this, but academy voters obviously did it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is in a relationship with a wife who, for the sake of all war, He was married to him and his future seems silent. But then he's the girl of March's Peggy (Teresa Wright, a fantastic turn), and the possibility of exploding firearms. Both are great, but then again that disparity comes up that this film pervades. Pure soap opera in a few moments, punctuated by the classic line all the time, "I'm going to marry fox!" The romance is raised and reflects a general situation after the war, that the returnees will come back to return to return. <br /> <br /> Upcoming is not saying, now we come to Harald Russell. His performance has its natural quality, or is it illogical, which is true as it is today, since it is no doubt. Taking a dirty view in his condition, he is an inspiration. Her best scene, one of the best of all the films, when she likes to show the girl the truth of her choice in her bedroom. "I'm lucky, there's something like boys on my shoulders." Really great thing <br /> <br /> There are moments in this movie. It has some moments in afternoon afternoon soap. Take good with the bad and see this one for the high points.
