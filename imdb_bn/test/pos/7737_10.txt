Cheers of all the wonderful fans of this movie which not only see and appreciate it, but (based on many educated comments) really get it! I've always considered the name of Paul Magarsky's "Tempest" as a problem on Shakespeare's play by the same name, as mentioned here in several other reviews. On the other hand, if you are looking for an easier adaptation of the game, you will see elsewhere. As a test, however, it is spectacularly successful. Screaming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all that and much more Cast, location, script, music just superb. Cassavetes and Rowland were not good. Susan Sarandan's turn indicates the wonderful work she has in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her film memorable and you just have to love Raul Julia's performance ... she stole the show in different scenes. What's more, always great Cassavetes was confident and assured enough that an actor has given him! If Shakespeare's classic content elements are updated in more "modern times" then in a study, the Majorsky "Tempest" will burn!
