This picture is an interesting singer of pioneering struggle under the leadership of Daniel Boone in the desert of the Kumarland Gap, threatened by attacking Indians. A treacherous Frenchman tried to convince the Indians of all the problems caused by settlers and red men, that pioneers just wanted to build houses and live in peace. The film is a specific appeal because it is not a smooth production, but there are scenes of good action, though it is a bit violent for time. Cast Bb is included in actors but they are all good, especially Lon Chaney as the Indian chief. Bruce Bennett is just as fine as knitting but is said to be a little too clear cut and soft as believable as a frontiersman. The conversation lends itself to the realism of Kentucky backwoods rather intense but visible itself.
