A fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) Falls in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to get secret information from him. For some reason this was attacked by critics and was withdrawn by the public in the 1970s - I can not see why. It has beautiful shots, wonderful costume and interior, and exciting airplane dogfights. Also Andrew is doing a strip tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song - "The Hosting in Dark". There are movie problems. Andrew and Hudson do not get along this shooting time - and it shows up. Their love scene lacks sparks and they have zero sex chemistry. Yet, they're acting okay. The film is a bit tall (even 105 minutes of the director I saw) and finally got a very dark and serious path. Still, attractive price. Try to show the managers ... run for half an hour!
