I think this is one of my favorite movies as a little child and those who said the songs were unforgettable were small, I can still remember them. Ward for word ward is dear to my family and my younger cousins ​​are still addicted, they know this film is very good and a children's enjoyable movie, it's a moral text, so it does not show because it does not look good because it shows that you are lying somewhere Do not fall ill. Ps I like the soundtrack but I like the cante and yes animation. Jokes are ridiculous and the action never stops. This film will be shown in children's film history and in my opinion the only remaining safe film for children.
