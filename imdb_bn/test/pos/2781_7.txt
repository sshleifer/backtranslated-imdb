So we saw the DVD in our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laugh so much that what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean, it was somewhat nice but still true, I know what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> I think I'm more concerned about Javier than the Italian (Italian) because I'm watching more about our team. However, I had a hot roommate like Sicil de France. He watched a cool chick in film and, for the last time, last month I saw him after hosting the Cannes Festival. <br /> <br /> Now I wonder if I want to go to Barcelona next summer to watch this movie. I came to France here shortly that would have to check out the seagulls.
