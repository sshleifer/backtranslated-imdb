Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) started this story in disguise, helping Switzerland steal from Switzerland, the famous physicist "Franz Tobel" (William Post) and the Nazi perspective, who want his bomb sighting plan. Allies obviously want it, and Sherlock is there to help. W. Tobel has invented a device that uses aerial bomb attack correctly. <br /> <br /> Holes and Dr. Tobey returned safely to the unemployed street, but for some mysterious reasons, the scientist was rather alone, although he had promised the British to help them on behalf of the Germans. He is certainly in this promise, but there is a great moment for Holly and the English side. <br /> <br /> This is an entertainment movie and one where our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises. He needs all the help that can stand up against his famous competitor, "Professor Moriarias". One accusation: If Marriata is bad, instead of being open to flee to her, Homs was debated without having an eye-opener batting. It is very sad that when it was very naturally, Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) has been saved from death on some occasions! Yes, there is some credibility in this story, but if you hold your brain several times, it's a fun movie to watch .... and it looks beautiful, thanks to the great recovery work done on this DVD. This makes the old print alive with some wonderful scenes, especially with night shots. Another note: Anyone who made English subtitles here has misinterpreted or misplaced at least half a dozen words. This is a very sloppy job, and I did not encounter it for the first time in seeing the entire series of DVD set recovered.
