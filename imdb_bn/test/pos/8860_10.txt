Classic 1951 "Remake of another World" In Antarctica, there are 12 men completely separated stations. They are attacked by a thing from outer space - it devours and is completely something similar to choose it. It starts as a dog but gets loose - and there is no chance to duplicate men. Soon, no one else believes - they are disconnected - the radio has been destroyed - likewise their helicopters. What are they going to do? <br /> <br /> The 1951 movie was just a big, great human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too much - but the story is different (and more closely based on the source material - "who goes there novelette?") And it's a different scary. The film begins with the very cruel scores of Mike Crowon on the right-hand side and - when Thing attacks - the amount of the film is surprising. Blood and body parts are flying - bites hands, heads separate and most powerful - one person first gets mouth by things. Cow influence Strong and real nightmare elements. I'm not afraid, but when I first saw it in 1982, I had to sleep with the lights. The effects of Rob Botine are simply unbelievable - how I got this rating with a single rating out of it! <br /> <br> It has a very annoying feeling - absolutely, it is very suspicious. You are not sure that the direction and score of the car and the presenter really makes the excitement. One complaint - no one is given the characteristics of any distinctive personality. They face direct to the actors and say their line. It's boring ... but the movie still works. <br /> <br /> This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 - it was "et" and many critics complained about the extent of Gore and there is no female character in the film. It is now considered as the best of John Carpenter. One must definitely see for strong stomaches. Not a date movie! <br /> <br /> A ridiculous note: after it was released, a note with all the prints of Universal film was sent. They advise the theater owners that they run this movie in an auditorium near the rest of the room. They feared that they would become so ill by the violence that they would be closer to the chance to throw!
