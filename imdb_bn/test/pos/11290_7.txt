Although it's not really important in movies, it's a creation myths. God (bloody, bloody person in a chair) drives his organs straight out of the razor and dies with his own smell. Mother Earth grows from her body and gives herself to her own seed, giving birth to man. It's not the first thing you can find out of it after reading a summary but it is not impossible for you, it is not important for you, especially because it is a miraculous art-house imagery thing, all inexperienced, processed black and white . A sick, wild environment is maintained with star photography and the lowest words (mostly water dispersion, cows, scraps, etc.), but each scene becomes very long, and so is the whole movie. It can be great as a small film, and God made himself visible to you very nice and very vague, especially the first thing you can see, but it's hard to be patient while running for a long time and you even know what you are looking for a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Still, a good movie for original style, images, atmosphere and content.
