This is the first (and not expected) Wallace and Gromit features to live up to expectations. A lot of jokes (a little bit sticky) and some great fame in past science fiction films. Through horror and formative film barrels from Hollywood, it's great to see a great movie that it's almost enjoyable. If there is a trial, it will be nominated for the best animation at the box office top and next Oscars. Animation is wonderful; Characters are significantly expressive and their adventures are great fun. This is one of the movies that the whole family can enjoy. Funny, cute, fun and well-made, what is not to enjoy?
