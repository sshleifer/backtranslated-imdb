This is one of the highest rating films of Hitcoak and so is the right. It is a story of two men in exchange for a train and exchange of jokes. One of them (Robert Walker) took it seriously and led Henes (Farley Ganger) to the problem solving problem in this law. Very fast-looking Hitachoich movie with great view (Carousel scene and tennis matches notable). A movie can not be missed - it's a shame that anyone will not republish it with extra load in the DVD - just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is all there is now.
