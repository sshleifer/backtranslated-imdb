The movie is incredible, it is a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. These lines are great in movies, such as "Outrerie Friends to Nothings" and "Time to Collect Charlie During Her Collection". I can see this movie over again and still laugh because the line and action are of one kind. I think when I see this movie, I want to go out and shoot a bad boy, if there is a movie you do not want to miss it. "They killed Giggler people, they killed Giggler" "They had no right to work on that, to take care of it laughing at our turf." Line just keep coming in the movie. Deff. Do not go out and rent but believe in my money money to buy this movie.
