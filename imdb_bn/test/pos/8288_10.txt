When I was a child I loved this movie. I saw in the theater. Randy Edelman has a good essay on the soundtrack. David Seville, Chimmons' father and recording manager. Chimmuns is composed of Alvin, who is well-known for hmonococcus, Simon, who is a bright and studying chipmun and Theodore, who is always the greatest and always hungry There is a woman known as Miss Miller, who oversees Chimmunes and her three daughters, Britannia, Janet and Alanr, all of whom have the same character as Chipmunas. My favorite songs in this soundtrack include "Diamond Dalls", "The Girls of Rock and Roll", and the touching "My Mother." Evin was looking at Europe when Dave had to go for business, chipmans are playing chips. The game is the real thing that they lead to real work for each other.
