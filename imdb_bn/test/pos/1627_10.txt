"Chevaliers de Sangreal" was excited at the opening time to hear the part, but wanted more so I said Hans Zimmer pieces. Perhaps the most inspirational and beautiful 4-minute music written! This movie is a thriller masterpiece, even on religious considerations. You can travel to Vatican and some parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. Opening at the CERN, where the maximum amount of "God particle" or antimatter is created with stunning visuals, is an immediate source that predicts the superiority of this film. Who does not love Hendes? The story and twists of this movie are simply well-stretched to the fantastic and amazingly baked climax. This picture advises compromising content between science and religion, although most of the closed headaches will remain on both sides.
