I saw Thin Blue line and heard it live a life since I have a huge Errol Morris fan. Today, this movie is his best work. <br /> <br /> Mixing of this plot in the book of Stephen Hawking is related to the title of the same man. The story is told by interviewing family, friends and hockey. <br /> <br /> Do not fool yourself; It sounds completely annoying but the whole package is dynamic and excited. Combining the life and theories is uninterrupted and thoroughly entertaining. I was especially impressed with how much I could develop this gifted and knowledgeable human being. Physically powerless, the greatness of Hawking and the shear illumination are encapsulated in a real live man that we are allowed to laugh and awake at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. See it and enjoy it. And if this movie is owned by the studio, then the 15-year anniversary edition will now be perfect ...
