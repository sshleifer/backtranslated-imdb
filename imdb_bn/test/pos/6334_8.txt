This is a good episode, but it is not my favorite. Many people love it and a creative level makes it bright. Most of the episodes have no conversations, which are so great ideas and "Hash" really manage with silence. Plus, this episode represents the star, I like it very much. However, I do not like the relie or the injection or Maggie Walsh, and they think they've got a lot during the "Hash" screen. Plus, I do not think the gentlemen are scary and I'm tired of seeing the sculpture of Sunnydale. I know that I am a minor, but I tend to swiftly move to "Hash". Of course, the other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you are watching the DVD, then I suggest you refer to this episode. This is really a classic. <br /> <br /> "Huss" is almost rolling about losing their voices in the entire city. Skelatal looking demons-guys called Gentlemen to gather seven hearts from the victims of humans, but if they hear a man scream they die. So they steal everyone's voices in the city. Buffy and Scoobies try to determine what's going on, when Initative also starts investigating. Meanwhile, Jandara understands how much money she has to bring to her and her colleague named Willow. In the fight with the gentlemen, Bafi and Reilly face to face. They are surprised at what they both learn ... She is a commando and she is a slayer. Finally Bappy saved that day, but now he will have to face the new knowledge of the secret life of Relie. <br /> <br /> Really, the creativity of "Hash" is not seen in its original layout. It makes the shocking silence of the episode, it's so great. Characters try to communicate in various ways, (white-out boards, pantomimes, porn fingers gestures, etc ...) and it all works well. After a while you forget that there are no conversations because they are very good to express themselves. During the episode "Conversation" sections, there are many references to the importance of "listening" to each other. Anya claims that Xander will not really talk to her. Giles ignored Spike and Junker's protests and insisted that Spike had gone to Xander's apartment. Buffy when he talks with Riely "rapidly" to replace the term "petroleum" immediately option so he does not have to explain his calling. And then at the end, when Buffy and Riely really learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. It's all beautiful. <br /> <br /> There are many good parts of this episode. I love to forget the people that they can talk. Try using both the Buffy and Xander phones. Reilly can not use the voice recognition feature of the lift lift. Try to scream people. It would have been a speech suddenly if basically everyone would have to do. And I think it's a pleasure to go with Spike Zander. (They will share an apartment for seven times during the season.) Fondant and Spike is a fun childhood childhood which is just fun. I also liked the start of her relationship with Willow. She plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are quite beautiful together <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " They just seem to pick around floats and random people to dorms. Also, I do not like Riely. I never liked him, but from "hash" I was waiting for a nice finger to come back to town and started licking him. Finally, what will be next for Olivier? It seems that we just met him, he and Gilse have relationships, everything is going well ... and then he suddenly dropped out. I can not get it <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this episode: Giles "Who Gentleman?" Scoobies lecture. The whole scene is wonderful and the head on it is just as pleasing. She makes Season 7's "first date" flashcard looking for something similar. Most of the time, the gals begin to draw monsters, it will be fun.
