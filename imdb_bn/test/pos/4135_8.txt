When I was about seven years old I saw the first Body Holly Story. I had no idea who was Body Holly and I could not remember that it made me sit in front of television, tune in to HBO and watching this compelling biology. What I thought was actually realization of some real story about somebody who lived in reality. I remember the song, the songs that I still love (I can not believe that Gary Busse had her own songs and songs so well - what a study!), Then it was over. He died. He died scary. I could not believe it. I had no warning, there was no previous knowledge like coming into this film. It teaches me hard lessons about life and it does not follow how most of the movies teach us. I saw the film again tonight and was involved again ... and with a little sadness <br /> <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I'm a little bit biased.
