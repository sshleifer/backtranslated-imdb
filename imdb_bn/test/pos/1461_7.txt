This is a very weird series with Dean Learner. I did not really understand the guest. I knew they were not serious but they were really vague ... I guess I'm just stupid that stupid. I do not know that these classes are as an explosive but the guests are not really in Ali Ji or they are not played by anybody, so I believe. I look serious that he's going to love. On Sunday morning, the program I forgot for Lull was similar to that. I really liked getting suits and stupid things she got. It's quite hot. He has unrestrained qualities which are incredible. I like the way there are sub subsecures in the program. It makes it feel more authentic.
