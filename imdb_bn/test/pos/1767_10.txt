It's a dream about the discovery of an old video of an unknown and forgotten movie. It's a fantastic comic gem, brilliantly funny, wonderful array of characters, a wonderful inventor and funny musical score and a different direction from Montgomery. This is one over and over to visit. A bit part of Montgomery is recruited by its military reserve department who infiltrate the entry into the house of a young debutante to discover the identity of his former bees, a suspected gem thief himself. The premises are rather overwhelming, the results are pleasing. The Montgomery frozen plant, Anne Blayt is a wonderful surprise to act as a comedian in the role of Lilian Randolph in front of a romanticly obscure, horrific beginner beginner and lady actress, Jane Cat's lawyer Mama - all the wonderful. <br /> <br /> It is strange that it only earned an Oscar sample for the sound, when it should be the top for directions, screenplay and musical score. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it - it's the best of Hollywood
