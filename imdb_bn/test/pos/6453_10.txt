I thought that I saw every blink of crime / gangster flick, but the combination of the Garrett-Marcin-Hammet has presented some real thrillers and surprises, because of the innovative strong instructions of Momolian, atmospheric photography of Li Garres, plus significant sharp film editing and flawless special effects. Bright acting helps too. Kop gave one of his most credible performance as a neutral heidade-of-darles bootlegger (he's the kind of progressive character of repeat characters in other roles like Sergeant York). Miss Sydney (illustrated center) is also an eye opener in its first major role. Principals heavily refer to Paul Lucas, Wine Gibson and Stanley Fields and even support Robert Hodgson's hard-and-nail detective. The film has clearly been realized in a comprehensive budget that was brilliantly set in its realistic, crowd-filled sets.
