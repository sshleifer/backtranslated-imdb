I really liked this movie. I saw this on the public broadcasting system yesterday. The part I liked was that they were dealing with issues in the future or in the past or not today. They were originally to take a van or two of some terrorists and rent them out to be a car bomb. I think what the movie showed was different people in different countries at the same time. It showed that England, or any other country, are not ready to attack the circumference they have shown. I have never heard of any actors or actors in the film, so I can not tell the truth because they are not usually their part. After the film, they talked about this panel of experts that it could be something that could happen here in the United States if it is a thought-provoking discussion!
