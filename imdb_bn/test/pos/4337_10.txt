Death Wish 3 should be exactly what a bad movie is. Awesome acting! Miracle scenerios! Wicked death scene! Weird, evil-for-no reason! The last 30 minutes of this movie can sometimes be 30 minutes in the best film, especially in the scenes where honest, hard-working street straps across the street, losing bad bikes and then shooting them, can only join the neighboring children (!!!) in the park. . And can I forget the old woman with the broom? She is sleeping! And if that is not enough, then do not let the birds forget how fast after killing Freak. I just thought about it. <br /> <br /> I love the curse girlfriend's death scene. She just walks away after watching her walk away. This is a small thing that creates three bad movies of death. And I'm not even mentioning the odd soundtrack I watched this movie of Martin Bersham, I very seriously think that it was one of the greatest character actors (and who himself "scum" the scene is sunny) and I went away with a new favorite movie. Thank you, I want to die 3, so give me so much smile <br /> <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention some words: 1. After the cursor is the word "cash!" Time to buy his used car. Haha It's a very bad word. 2. Mandy Focker. Mandy! The author did not find the name of a tough guy? 3. The gangs have a "borrow and lease" thug exchange program: "I need some more people." And that Mandy has a working phone line in a abandoned building. At the end of the film, after beating Curse Fracor: Is it just not me, or do they look like breaking the street gang into a corioagraphy that they are leaving? See how they get synced after the female punk "stop" signal is given. <br /> <br /> I love this picture. Nothing cheats like nothing like 3!
