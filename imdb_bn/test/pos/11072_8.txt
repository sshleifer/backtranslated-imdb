I lived in the area (Habcon and Jersey City) for almost ten years. This film certainly captures the feeling of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is accurate and the circumstances are realistic. Another poster says, it looks almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I like these kids in a human way, probably born in West Westchester, but reading what falls within the kids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said that acting is good all around, so <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It gives some ideas on how the statue is created and how much the ratio exceeds. Hopefully, the New Mayor of Niue has been making progress.
