There is a more bad way to spend in the evening than watching this movie, though it is a predictable one. Drew Barrym did a great job of acting uncensored in this movie - excellent casting choice. It seems a little hard to believe that the popular girls finally accepted him - in my experience there are memories and memories of the crowd, and how was the role of the adrawal draw at the beginning of the school year? Even if their brother's rumor spreads, he keeps them away. (And "Kole Slaw Food" really makes him popular? I suspect it). To be transformed into a journalist for being grown up as a journalist - well, I hope he can bring many stories before the promotion. A bit concreved. All that is being said, it's a cutie piece of fluff that will be entertained until you expect as much.
