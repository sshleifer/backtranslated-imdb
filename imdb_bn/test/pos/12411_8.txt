This "TFTD" episode is a title titled "Answer Answer" which is a nicely completed and memorable episode, and it's a disappointing turn towards the end. On the mountain you have Zin Marsh and wash the actress from LA, who has gone to audition for New York City and she is living in an old friend apartment. Strangely every night he is awake by a ringing phone from the next apartment apartment, but the strange ringing phone that continues, its position is strange, because guests have died for many years. Eventually, he should only follow him and should not answer the phone with a home, because it is bad to wrap one's own life on a phone! Although fairly good episode is about a supernatural phone, it is a strange matter, it is suspense and it is ultimately good.
