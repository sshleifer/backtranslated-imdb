For the first time at the Cannes Film Festival, in NorthFork, many do not like it because they think it's annoying and very slow. Although I agree that it was slowly (one of the slowest movies of the year), it was not boring in any way. Roger Ebert said, "There is no movie like NorthFork." I usually do not agree with Ebert, but once he speaks the truth. Although John Sail's Sunshine State may have some of the same instant themes, but what I've ever seen or known may compare with the interesting originality of Polish Brothers Northfark. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Plot is not some hackneyed, cookie-cutter plot; It's just so strikingly root. A small town named Montana has a dam named Nortorf, which is about to go down. Therefore, the entire city must be evacuated. Some people, however, just do not want to go. On a side plot, a young orphan (Dual Ferns) is very ill and decorated; He took care of Father Harlan (Nick Nolt). The boy thinks of himself as an angel of death, therefore, who helps him during his illness. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is mostly available, some of its runs mean David Linchke. The strange weather patterns, a weird, wooden, huge dog thing, and the symbol that Fellini will be proud of. It's not as confusing as the lint film, but it's still pretty weird. That makes NorthFork so big: it's simple and yet simple and straightforward. Outside of <br /> <br /> NorthFor has a magical feeling: Almost you see something that you are not sure about but you feel entranced by it. As I said earlier, I agree with Ebert because this picture is not different in any other way. However, when he said that it is not 'recreational' then I disagree. He says it's just 'enthralling.' Perhaps he thought he would do a good review because everyone else was there, but instead of how slow it was, I still thought it was very entertaining, some plays now can not do. <br /> <br /> UttarFark can not be the fastest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can go through it and through it, I would be surprised, as I was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> PG-13 for short sex.
