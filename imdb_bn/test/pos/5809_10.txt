A few years ago, with "Ray of Right", Madonna broke through the amazing level of an amazing level of musical instruments, and even then she too exceeded her standards. The production of this concert, its masculine editing, amazing dancing, hallucinatory lighting effects, and trans-stimulus measures, all the previous attempts to break away. Madonna's clear ambition - through music and dance alone can bring world peace - in some cases it may seem modern or irrational. But hell, someone got to do it! Thanks to her great talent for her involvement in this production, her "Confessions Tour Live from London" works at least one of her top ten performers.
