I really like this picture about love in two adults posted in Britain. The high quality of BBC TV is clear in production, and extraordinary lead actors (Claire Bloom and Josh Ackland) make it a great experience. Blum and Auckland have worked together in the theater previously, and their chemistry and interaction are excellent. I recommend this version of Shadowlands in the 1993 film version.
