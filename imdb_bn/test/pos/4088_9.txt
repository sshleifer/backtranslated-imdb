Like some people I know, I've been late to 'Stingers'; Not until 2000. Three years later I will not miss any episodes. The show is really good and, a good word, for example, 'Blue Hiller', in contrast to maintain its honesty. Crime is the thing; There is a personal life but only during the investigation, without the wheel! When Gary was brought sweet, some fans were worried, but she really liked, which did not surprise me. Gary could measure up to any British or American actors in the same series. Cast changes occasionally, but each change brings something new and fresh. Visible Australia's best crew in the scene, the series 'Stingers' will be a continuous drama series.
