Once a wise man of India once said, "At first they will laugh at us, then they will hate us and they will fear us." I know that the budget of this film was a little off, but his story still takes many years with our interest, despite how it looked. But soon it will be known, "Masten thrust" will again be on the big screen. Then he and the new design T-Rex will give you more shocks. It will be afraid for centuries! This image is in the current pre-product and nothing will be like what you have seen before! <br /> <br /> This will be outside the THX format ..... Right 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Fear, be very scared!"
