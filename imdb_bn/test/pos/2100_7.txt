Excellent combination of monster giant and samurai generals. The Angel angel of the mountain is a lazy and forbidden figure which comes as much as the God of the Old Testament, who destroys and punishes those who defile his holy place - but eventually remember what aroused him, rather than condemning the man, rather a condemnation And personal humiliation. It plays beautifully, has a strong acting, a remarkable little figure and a terrific score from the great Akira Ifkubu. Mozin is not 400+ feet like Godzilla - it is 22 to 22 times the normal size, so the evil dutuai falls on the ground and he keeps an eye on his hateful eyes, because he comes down from his fort and shakes with smog. Not additional additional terms, but it is best to rescue the forgotten smallest classics and recover them in digital format.
