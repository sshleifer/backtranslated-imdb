Could this really be a trauma movie? Some scenes almost have an "at" movie look. Actually qualified (both lead and nurses were particularly good and I liked some of the clashes between young Capulites and Queens); The scenes are smoothly edited; The conspiracy is consistent. It's funny It has a hip, original sound track. <br /> <br /> This is the usual trompoà¦¾telas and less humor, but I do not think Shakespeare is so much more focused. Actually, I think he might have got some good smiles. <br /> <br /> This is a good DVD. There is an alternative word track with a very informative commentary through the general collection of directors, many deleted scenes and truma self-extinguishing syllables. <br /> <br /> I'm not telling you that it was a citizen but it was also a few inspired low-budget films.
