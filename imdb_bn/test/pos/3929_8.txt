The WAX ​​cube would never be mistaken for Texas's Chainsweather Mascus or Halvin, it tries to qualify for quality horror films and is ultimately successful. There is enough tension and adequate gestures to please today's young audience, and there is enough clear evidence to make some pilgrims happy. Overall, this is a well-done movie that should be set in DVD. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Looks like a rejected Deilverance sequo and backwoods hicks group taunt. Finally, the group had to break apart the city and half the head to get some car parts. Half of the group is behind the camp and it sets the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> There is much energy in the wax house. First it is a blessing with a very desired cast. Paris Hilton fine his role but he is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt add some penny ache, some credibility and some talent to three very promising actors and their presence in movies. I've never really heard about Chad Michael Murray, only he was impressive with a pin-up type teen. But he has a presence in it. She imbues a feeling of that she seems to translate into her performance She is likable immediately and she has a strong character character. I enjoyed his painting a lot, which I saw and when he was on screen, the film was flowing. <br /> <br /> The question is, "Is this movie a horror movie?" And that answer is a wide yees. As I mentioned above, it is not a night at the Elm Street or LEFT, even the RING even in the same class, but it has comparatively legendary, quite graphic and some very innovative death scenes. It's not about the WAX's house that you have about your parents. The Vincent Prices are not seen anywhere and when you begin to see fingers and warm wax comets covered by the body, then you realize that this film is a little over the edge. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see an unctifier's X-Rated version. I bet that there is a place somewhere that is more violent than this. As it may be, it is very good entry in the horror genre and it is the head and shoulders on the weak films, as I know what you have done with the latest samar and dark water and some. It's certainly a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10
