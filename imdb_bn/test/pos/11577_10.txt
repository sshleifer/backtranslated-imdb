As many other users have already explained the story and commented, I will not do it. <br /> <br /> However, I want to think of Barthem's interpretation as great, like other actors and this actress is the actress. <br /> <br /> I read previous comments that some people criticize the fact that this picture does not point out to the cruelty of cruelty, and that little presence is ridiculed. My honest opinion is far from this truth. <br /> <br /> There are many characters that love Ramon Samadoro and want to stay with him and move towards a gray zone in realizing his desire to die. The most obvious family of those For example, Raman's mother-in-law does not talk about happiness or against. Another such character Jane (social rights activist) who asked Raman again in the last moment. The scene clearly shows that he does not want to die. <br /> <br /> Then there are those letters that are clear against cruelty. Raman's brother is obviously against it, as his father ("one thing is worse than the death of a son, and he has a son who wants to die.") Other users have commented that the discussion between Ramon and the priest is ridiculed and Ramon is good and that the priest is BAD Imagine for remembering us. Well, there is no doubt that the scene is ridiculous, but that does not mean that the priest is a fake or ridiculous. From my perspective, comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to persuade Ramone to live with Ramon's ideas using the fully constrained arguments. The priest's speech goes towards the line of "God gives and God takes", "We are not owners of our own lives, they belong to God" ... and more. Comedy is derived from the fact that Raman is called an atheist and all the priests tell him so stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Make up her own opinion. And above anything else is a chant of freedom.
