I've read Bill Carter's book, which was based on this film many years ago. Books are certainly stronger than movies. It probably makes more detail than what a movie can offer, the end result is that I think the movie looks a bit bit sketch on a few items. However, everything has been considered and given moderate limitation, after the retirement of Johnny Carson in the early 90's by film Jenny Leno and David Letterman, "The Tonight Show" provides a complete entertainment and informative account for hosting. <br /> <br /> The highlight is definitely performance. I am an actor who is still alive and well-known and can feel a more difficult performance for a performance than playing a character on a regular TV. John Michael Higgins nailed perfectly part of Letterman. Seeing him, I saw Litterman really. Daniel Robak tries bravely to J. Lenny, but by no means effectively shut it down. His complete "appearance" was in the mesh, and he does not think the role is natural. In a less central role, Rich Little did not immensely curse the voice of Curson, though the look was a bit far away. In the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably Lenny's agent Helen Kushnik. In the film, Cathy Betts was perfect in the role, although Carter's writings were not out of control as a woman's screenplay. <br /> <br /> <br /> This issue is not important in overall planning of overall content, but it is a fun thing behind a memorable time view of the entertainment industry. 7/10
