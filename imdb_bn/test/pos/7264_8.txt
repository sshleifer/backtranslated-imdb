If you like lock, stock and two smoking barrels, you'll also like it. Although I could lose some of the British jokes (though two London characters Dixon and Winterberg calling for the name of a football player), but it's still cracking the entertainment, which certainly pumps to life. <br /> <br /> Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bringing the depth of their character, and the interaction between the two therapies is always well-judged. In fact, Scott's instructions are very reassuring, this is his first feature film, and it proves that his father's talent is easy for us to bring in unfamiliar environments. <br /> <br /> Hell, I believe in myself. I'm going to see it again!
