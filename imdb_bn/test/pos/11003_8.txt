A proper description by Spock of an omnipotent flop whose clutches fall in the enterprise crew. This place had one sector to avoid our starships: the first salu and the karc only disappeared from the bridge; A landing party follows their unknown planet pages and has been experiencing a seemingly elite male trail in clothing from Earth for many centuries. But he demonstrates some or some power away from people and does not register on McCoy's medical tricorder. Officials managed to escape the ship but like some bad cosmic pennies, Trelane keeps popping up. He continued to play them, some female companions, all brought them back. The hesitation takes on the 'most dangerous game' ingredient in space and there is an exciting, even terrible outlook for the crew's silly helplessness before such extravagant power. <br /> <br /> This is really a great episode what makes the Hasty Performance Memorable by Cambridge Camp memorable but as all wise aliens. His character must have an initial version of the question, which was launched 20 years later for the TNG series. Trelane's collision scene with Spock stands in all the strange drama unfolds. Naturally, despite being quickly joined by Kirk, he started looking for possible weaknesses of his new generosity. What exactly is the trailan or the answer correctly in front of us, so when we learn the truth, then it gives complete knowledge to Campbell's pitch-perfect performance. He is constantly involved, campaigning under some unknown audience, infectious but commenting on things that are not right - we can not pin it at the bottom, but there is nothing missing here. Every few minutes, his voice becomes sinner and the crew now seems to be a serious danger. In a way, you can not close his eyes, always wait to see what he is next. Actor John Day Lancy captured the same voice as a question in this next generation series.
