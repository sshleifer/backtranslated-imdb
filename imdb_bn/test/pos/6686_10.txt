One of the best movies ever, is a double explanation idea we all involved. <br /> <br /> Pretogenetic or ET? (My opinion is no doubt, but to keep the question open ...). Kevin Speacy, the big screen monster, as it should be in the proto game. Let's not forget Jeff Bridges and his great psychologist. <br /> <br /> To the end, a nice work by speaking for yourself. Credits from the beginning and our minds can keep our eyes open even when the movie ends. If you still do not see it, go now! And again, again ...
