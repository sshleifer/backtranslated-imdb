During my visit to a youth leadership forum, I was surfing the channel until I found Tommy Boy in TBS. Since I have never seen this movie before, so I wanted to test it. My roommate, who already saw me, told me, "This movie is classic." After watching the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It was not important. His parents were very disappointed by the way of Iski when his father (Brian Denhey), the rich "Brake Pad King", died on his wedding day due to cardiovascular disease. It goes on to hit Tommy with the help of her barbaric childhood friend Richard (David Spade), selling enough brake pads to save the company. <br/> <br /> <br /> The main reason "Tommy Boy" works is to perform fun from the lead. The most interesting person in this movie, Spade is the second funny person and the third Rob Lowe bad luck as the film's villain. Another funny guy is Dan Ikorid Ray Jalinsky, a well-known auto equipment is awesome. <br /> <br /> Another reason for the movie is Joker, Chris Pharre has a sunny slopstick moment, and David Spade has funny views and one-liner. Thanks to the writer Pig Seagal (Naked Guns 33 1/3), the author Bonnie and Terry Turner, the movie's gag (some deer and an airplane involving the bathroom) are sunny. <br /> <br />> (From the Sun to the 3rd Rock, the 70th Show), and Cast. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is really fun movie, although for most unknown reasons, most movie critics (including Roger Ebert) have found it horrible and weird. (I wonder when their humor dies.) I recommend "Tommy Boy" for those who are great fans of the comedy. Thank you very much, roommate.
