An American American was abducted and she was blown away "somewhere in North Africa" ​​where she was tortured. Because? His cell phone received a call from a known terrorist. The CIA has decided to avoid legal welfare whether phone calls are offense or just a misunderstanding. After watching this movie we can only pray to some terrorists, wrongly can not be hijacked by wrong numbers! <br /> <br /> There are different related side stories as well as changing. One of the key to Intel's head (secret police?), Who is suspecting the suspect and is involved with her boyfriend, who wants to stay in school on suicide bombing night. This story is very surrounded, however, especially when we see its results. Director Audience Hook uses a handsome time-line switcheroo. <br /> <br /> The second story is an attempt to discover what happened to his missing husband by a suspect wife. She gets an old lover to help. He (a silent Saarsgard) gets a Senator (Alda) a helper camp and soon gets cold when he realizes that his work is not worth the true exposure. Witherspoon wasted this role. What she can do is, with a brief harmful attack, pregnant and pregnant. Streep is government as well and is cold and stereotypical. (CIA? NSA? Homeland SEC?) An officer who thinks Cheney is a clone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, the film is furious, if something is stupid, but it adds a little bit to the subject. It definitely does not meet as specific, and it certainly has a latent ank. Like "Kingdom", it is a very complex subject, scratching the page. <br /> <br /> The film strives hard to give ideas about our genius, but it can end only with a buttoned "alert story". The whole point of the competition is not to torture "terrorists" but rather to prevent it from obstructing the legal (hence hurdle) legal (hence hurdle), to avoid it. Torture, of course, can be recruited, especially if the song comes out of our hands - although we are not clearly innocent about this - but this "shadow war" is Intel that can save this life.
