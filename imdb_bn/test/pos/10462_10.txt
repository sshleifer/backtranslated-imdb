This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. ... strong visibility ... isolation ... unknown intelligent people are hiding behind their religion ... a backdrop for some wordpress and sophistication ... acting is completely natural ... but the best thing for me as "food meals" is real Selection and preparation of the festival. I spent my time in Paris and know well with the kitchen ... I do not know whether the caf√© anglies really exist, but I know exactly the same in the establishment and the choice of the menu and wine of the Babat ... and of course where the perfect food, despite themselves, returns to their friendship, only It may end .. It is 10 out of 10 films and it is quite a brain and it is understandable Should be seen by taste
