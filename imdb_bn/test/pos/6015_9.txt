And I think that's a good thing for one. Although I was never a Rosalind Russell fan, the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bete and she was thrilled to make it. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the part, I think it's a little less than the original movie. Originally one of my favorite little characters was Majpa, her scratchy fingernail-on-the-blockboard voice belting "Hey! It takes more than any talent to get from any stropha!" And although I missed it, I was happy to see the producers' courage to not copy a carbon copy. <br /> <br /> I also liked the large sections of this film that if you look at one stage, it gives you a sense of the theater that not just movies. <br /> <br /> I think that my opinion about this product was something else that seemed less frequent that the song "Let me entertain", which is completely annoyed when you hear about 5 times.
