An interesting aspect of immigrant experience, has been called as a novel with some very strange imagery. <br /> <br /> I am dragging this film because it talked about Sicily immigrants who traveled to America. I imagine my grandfather did so much at that time. Traveling to provide a ballast for the ship, I can not imagine that it was very comfortable, shown in this picture. <br /> <br /> Restricted laws of immigrants existed. I would assume that these laws were more stringent than the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants must be free from infectious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film, we see physical and mental examinations, because the low intelligence is intelligent. The single woman could not enter the country, they thought that they would become prostitution, so already the first married single men entered the Alain Island before entering the men. <br /> <br /> This story is arranged by a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsberg), who is married to a poor Sicilian (Vincento Amato). He is trying to find his son silently with a son and a mother (Aurora Quatrochi) who is considered weak. She was fantastic in the role, by the way. <br /> <br /> You will see the character after him, after the character actor, Vincent Schiavelli. I do not know if his last picture is released. She plays a matchmaker, and is very good. <br /> <br /> It was a weird, but enjoyable film. This is not for everyone, I imagine that those who do not have any interest in migrant experience find it slow.
