This is a wonderful movie and I would recommend it to everyone. Mr. Drury is always in the lead and it matches well with other actors in the film. Can not keep any mystery or drama found in the film. Must go to hell to see the movie !!! The plot was very suspenseful. I will watch this movie over again as it contains all the elements of a wonderful western film. It was proven to show how the elements related to this film, including guns, horses and clothing. Soundtrack is enjoyable and adds smell to the movie. James Drury has the right touch while finding a movie involved with. This is another winner of Western custom. !!!!!
