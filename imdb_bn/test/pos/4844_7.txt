A very good movie about anti-communism at the end of WWII. The loudly moving scene of this man's ignorance is the meeting of the church while delivering lecture on "International Monetary Fund and Communists". Adolf Hitler sounds amazingly loud about his people's speech, but none of the participants in the meeting asked to compare it.
