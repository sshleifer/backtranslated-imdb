"It seems your funny nightmare is always funny!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now-and-then increase the tantalizing break tension and give many places for explanation. Good acting and a story which, without using the brain, will leave you confused. You will see it at least twice. The very power lies in its imperfection and, of course, Alan Ricman. Those who love him will love this movie. Conclusion: This is not a standard major movie but it's good!
