Okay, now at first I thought it was going to be another Chess romantic comedy, which returned to the comedy, but it was not. I think this amazing Amanda Bains saw! She was amazing, really amazing and still stunning! The boys were very suitable, a big reason for girls to go! Shakespeare's game was firmly based on the 'Twelfth Night', it was very similar, even a spider named Malvolio, which belonged to the character Malvolio. The script was really good writing and pulled together and it was very prudent. It was amazing football skills, even thinking about playing football! However, to add it, it's a light-hearted film about young romance which is very confusing! Go and see!
