In Crystal City, a group of Mormons led the horse trader Trovis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Junior) as their wagon master in the San Juan River. Aside from the journey, they are Coca Cola At Loxley Hall (Allan Mobile) and prostitution Denver (Joan Drew) and Fluority Fifher (Ruth Clifford) first saw broken wagon without water. Then the rapists decided to join Mormon Caravan for hijacking Patrol under the leadership of Cristal Citizen Sheriff. When Navajos transcends their way, they are invited to visit their bathroom for a dance group. When the wagon train arrives at their destination, then Clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take an attitude. <br /> <br /> "Wagon Master" is one of John Ford's western areas. Sequencing with the Wagon Train over the desert and hills crosses impressive. Mormons Group's adventure is fun and suitable for the plot, despite very entertaining and lyrics. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carvana Dos Bros" ("Bravo Caravan")
