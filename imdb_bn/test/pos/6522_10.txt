Fred was such a great show. It was easy but was very busy anyway. I still remember those days when I wanted to see it on KWW Saturday, but then KWW was unsuccessful. Kids WB became like an old relauncher who works "hip" and "funky fresh". * Disguise * They have become like those who try to do all the cool work, but the attempt is a Chess disaster. I have never seen anything like Coconut Fred's fruit Salad Inland and all the other good shows that in my life (Johnny Test) among the most uninterrupted groups. Only Kebee keeps me showing somebody else that is the old show and anime sometimes in 4 kildes. There was such a big mistake to avoid it. Show off the schedule. This is bringing me back to my first point ... bring it back !!!
