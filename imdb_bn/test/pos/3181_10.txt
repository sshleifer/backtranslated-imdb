It was an excellent show. It returned to PBS back to Chicago and I think Cyndi Heeron (from Envogue) plays a teenage girl. The show dealt with issues such as sex, escort pressure and young girl. It was about a middle-class black family, who had a young girl and a boy, who went from mid-oakland or from somewhere else (I can not remember). I remember a few episodes, but I think his cousin got his time for the first time. I probably saw it 7-8 years ago and I was able to continue the program. It was a great show. I can not remember the name of the boy that played the boy in this show, but I always misled him with Kevin Hook.
