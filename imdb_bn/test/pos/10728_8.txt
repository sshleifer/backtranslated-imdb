I was quite amusing for this film quite a good and heavy film on passion. I agree with the script becoming more sympathetic to the three main characters of another user. I think this picture did well. It was neither Mr or Mrs. Crumar's villainy, and I think, two people must themselves solve this problem and finally see the best thing for the survivors. And, although it was a bit weird, I actually liked the music in this movie. For some reason the music seemed to be suitable for starting three main characters. This movie has flown quite well and did not doodle, as there are some emotional heavy films. It does not deal with a serious situation but take it very seriously. It simply said the story directly to the story and it worked pretty well.
