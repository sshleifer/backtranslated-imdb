I'll say a top sunny thing, I'm not the biggest season of Suzuki fan. I actually saw a number of his works (thanks to the previous feat of the film festival) and I got only one seed of his shades. Jukuja was driven to my taste. So, I went to Princess Racquone with what I'm going to see. Boy! I fell out! 'Raakon' Suzuki's attempt of a musical instrument, using the Japanese opera components mixed with many modern elements (both audio and visual), rangone from start to finish. The main actor, Joe Ogdari, has proved that this role is one of the hottest actors in Japan this day. I would appreciate that Japanese actors still have to take the role played in Japan in feudal Japan, to have a full impact on Samui Gear. The story itself becomes a little confusing, if you do not really follow it, but if you do not, then prepare yourself for the reputation of Princess Racon.
