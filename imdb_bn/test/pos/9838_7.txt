It's not a 'real' James Cagney car because its screen is unusually thin during the time. Frankie Darro is a tough boy like Jimmy Smith, the leader of a street cheat on the street who is sending some of his friends to school with friends in school. Cagney herself is a gang leader, Patsey Gargan, who has given a token position as the deputy commissioner. While finding out the first hand of ruthless behavior at the renovation school, he was forced to make some big changes with the help of reformer nurse (Maja Evans). <br /> <br /> Hell's mayor is fast moving and after all these years still recreational. Cast is well-rounded: Doodle Digges, Arthur Brian, 'Farina' Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
