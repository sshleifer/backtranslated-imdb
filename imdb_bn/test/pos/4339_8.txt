I did not see the original death wish in the Death Dish Wish (film) book. However, Death Weigh 3 was very interested pictures. The well-known vigilant, Paul Curse, tried to see his friend Charlie, but he met him for a few minutes to die, because Charlie Manny did not provide protection to the huge and notorious underground gang under Franker's leadership. After a brief period of his time in prison, Curse came to know that Frankner, who was in prison, had his own agenda, his crime was in New York City Nicholphire (and its impact) to send the offender, everywhere and everyday. Due to the opportunity given by Insp. Richard Sreekar, who knows his profile well and is very much like him. Curses decided to set the battle with Frank and his gang. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that Death Wish III is one of the most straightforward and most violent activities seen from the past. Use this movie to tell the story very straightforward. There was no scholarly storytelling and less unnecessary scenes which were a talent in the movie. In the latter case, violence in the film is widely used. I believed that many of the viewers may prefer the action scene of David Weiss III because it shows crude, extreme and explosion for each minute of the film, especially the climax scene of the film and the death of Manny Franker, which I think was the most action scene. <br /> <br /> For throwing, I think everyone was good and came up with their role. Charles Birston believes that he is still great as Paul Curse. She did not look like "big old cat", but great vigilante. C One O'HareLio did his job very well. The role of his main villain in the film looks nasty and looks like a bad guy. However, the role of the movie Catherine Davis was unfortunate. She does not look like the main character. I thought that only two or three scenes were visible before Frankner and his followers killed him. She may appear to have more role <br /> <br /> For my commentary, Strease Style and Extreme Violence, this action film has been great for extreme action film fans. Look forward to this movie very paced with back and forward style. Nonetheless, this movie had some silly scenes and some plot holes. First, the scene in front of Paul Cursee for the first time in the movie is in front of the scene. It was very confusing because you attacked your party before helping him, like how you wiped some people before you tried to borrow him some money. Ha ha That's like a joke! Insp.Shriker was later shown that when I liked the Plot Twist, he helped Karsey because at the beginning, Mrkee looked very like Vilent due to his work, but when the movie was over everything became clear <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It stops everyone's feelings because it is very easy Has gone. Frank's gang members looked incredible when they knew that Frank was dead, his girlfriend and other followers decided to flee. Finally, before the police caught Inspector, Paul allowed him to fly from his city. I thought this style of the last scene could be found in many canon movies, but I dislike it. For the essence, I'm fine with death 3 because of my explanation I first typed. Throw, and the action was very good and so extreme, even I do not like it in some scenes. Violence and extreme extremism can be the best short description of this film.
