I caught this movie on local TV. I did not expect it at around 4:30 am, but after the first credit, I knew I was good. <br /> <br /> There are some situations that "find" for your explanation is really an original reason for your attention. <br /> <br /> The whole psychological thriller has many ways to deal with the development of character and ways to effect things by the main characters. <br /> <br /> Your sub-science also plays an important part because through events and dialogs, you can make the right interpretation and make a comment. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Actually really good Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and her candy for eyes, though she is mostly in her white cloth. <br /> <br /> The horrible aspect is almost non-existent but there is a lot of mystery and tension in it. <Br /> I will recommend those who enjoy the supernatural and psychological thriller.
