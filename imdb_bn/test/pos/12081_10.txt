I saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in February 1983. I was in the hospital, my first and only child was born. I'll refrain from telling you the amount that was removed. About 23 years later, the memory of this film is enough to remain with me today. Hopefully I'll find a copy of this movie, if such thing is made. Anyone who has seen this movie has to remember it. However, I must admit that it is a bit unclear by me. Thus, it is always a small secret to me and those who will move by it. I did not see Mrs. Margaret perform a good part. Or did I ever play him a stronger role? I will always respect her for taking such a lovely part.
