I agree with a lot of other critics here. This is a great movie and better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I believe the author has died before watching this movie. All the top rates of performance, three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross, and Veronica Hamel) are seemingly made for their role. Both Europe and Israel seem to be very pure, and the length of the 4-hour minute length was just to say this story. Thankfully, I tapped it on television and enjoyed it afterwards. I can say that unhesitatingly hanging up until this day. I gave it a rating 10. If you do not read the book, you must find out a copy. An outstanding movie broadcast in DVD which can easily include cast from interviews.
