In the 90's, many of the movies ... which were created by the words 'death', 'blood' and 'steel' and 'ring', 'fight', '' fight for exchange of money in exchange for kickboxers 'death penalty' Keep the words' and 'cage' and they are in a random generator! Although, Death is a very good entry in the most widely used style, its breathtaking fight scene and its kickboxing cast thanks to the wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> The story expresses concern with two friends - Kickboxing world champion John Larson (Madeline face kickboxing champion Ian Jacqueline, perhaps ring of fire 2) and Nick Wallace (perhaps the best-known villain for a pixel guy Known for terrible performance: The role of sergeor of the road fighter for bleeding 2) The cricketer loads the load on the shipA gunfight with guns and then a discovery of a short war, propping our two heroes unemployed and a LA barber. Judge John Larson decides to look north and find a job; Headstrong Nick Wallace has heard a guy paying good money for fight fighters kickboxing private practice. "Why should things change?" John said, "If you need me, I'll be there." Absolutely enough, Nick is not long before he disappears, and his best friend is trying to lead his absent friend fighting with a deadly 'death ring'. <br /> <br /> Sure enough, there is no prize for originality, but as I said earlier, the strength of these films is to perform their activities, casting real-life fighters and conducting a fairly good performance to jump from them. Ian Jacqueline especially surprised me. Earlier, I just saw him as a bad guy in Ring of Fire 2 and saw in the triangle like a steel ring, and I'm very happy to see how bad an actor is (though a good fighter!). But he is very good in the death match! Given a decent script and a stove, he proved himself quite charismatic leading people! And his friendship with Nick is illustrated very well. Jacqueline and Hill have an excellent chemistry and you really believe these two characters care for each other. To lose one of their jobs, to travel halfway across the country and save others death is at stake - I want to have friends like mine! <br /> <br /> It was great to see Matthias Hughes as a well-known Henchenman with a little more depth than seeing him from the role of 'Vielens Hechenmann'. But he does not fool the person on the cover of the video (he thinks that Michael Bernardo is holding his head on the body from the cover of the shitfighter), he would not be fooled by the fact that he is his star - he is good on screen, but he is <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br>), and the last war is frustrating short, but the whole thing I enjoyed it! Lots of fights, most of them are good. Do we really need martial arts? And of course the eye candy, very beautiful here is the famous form of Amelin Ammann. All in all, a fantastic entertaining kickboxing movie.
