I think this cartoon seems as bad as some might think. Of course, when I came out I was only five. However, I got it very entertaining at the time and if given the opportunity today it will give a look. The voice of Adam West and Bart Ward Batman and Robin were a wonderful touch and it was known for me because I saw the camp's 1960s live action show "Batman" again. This cartoon has forgotten some new twists like I forgot for example "bat-mite". Looking back at it, I'm sure he was boring enough to think, but at that time he did not bother me much. The best I can remember, his voice sounded like a cross between Dumb Donald and Orko. G, why wonder? :) However, if you can make up your own mind and give it a look. You might be surprised.
