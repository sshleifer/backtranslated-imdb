"The Love Letter" is a slightly happy, very original romantic comedy that uses a few words in a mysterious love letter to reveal the secret feeling and long logo of the city's sleeping owls. <Br /> <br /> This is not for all audiences. "Love Letter", I think, benefit from its simple and quiet voice. Most romantic comedy is not deliberately sloppy and dirty like it is weird, picturesque, and comfortable. However, for this same reason, many visitors will get bored and discouraged. <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent. I like to see Tom Seleck again, and in the same way, it plays a low role. And it is hard to believe that this same Kate Capshaw we met 15 years ago "Indiana Jones and Temple Temple". He is quite naturally good here; Improvements in every role that I saw him after jumping on the nerves of India. And is it possible that the age of the capo is very beautiful and loving? (What about Spielberg?) <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not too much; But after the summer silent film, I would probably come back with a short temperament of this light-like-a-feather romance.
