"The summer of my German soldier" was one of the shortest films on the small screen in the 1970s (the others were "Brian's Gun", "Cyber" and "Seeing Someone!"). It is a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) who shares friendship with a German POW (Bruce Davison) in WWII-era Georgia. The movie shows one thing that most of the German soldiers were not Nazis, but only draft was made. Seeing the film, I realized how the right thing would be to be done; I mean, can you imagine a Jew being accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> So, of course, I recommend this movie. I believe that the things illustrated here are always important to show. Sometimes the overacting film keeps to be a full-scale masterpiece, but they are usually pretty good. I hope the movie will finally come out of the DVD. Also starring Ester Ralley and Michael Constantine ("My Big Fat Greek Wedding" Father).
