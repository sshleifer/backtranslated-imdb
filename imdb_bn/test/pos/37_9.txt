This is one of the best living films of recent times. As far as I can put there with Ray and Aviator. This is the story of a young, bisexual boy, who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing Miss Rachel Urkie "Nani". You will fall in love with Nine, a woman who hands over everyone around her. come. Ipatha gives Markersson the character a beautiful life, and other cast members do the same. If I would appreciate every actor to play their role, then everyone in the cast would have to mention me. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < And what's more, this film is actually entertaining. It does not matter to you for a moment! <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to spend at home in the evening to watch the movie is very nice, very entertaining, quality movie.
