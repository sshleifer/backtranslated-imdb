This is a very long movie, indeed. But it's a great example to show why it is beautiful and why the film industry is considered. The easy-to-read story of Les Amnt's Regulier can not be expected, but in each scene, each silence here has more than 100 conversations. Touch, variety, its pictures and soundtracks are perfect, it has shown why the movie has been closer to one of its main features, it has become the greatest invention in a dramatic presentation. Anyone who is used in such movies where everything is called, and the action is always performed, this fatigue will get you. But it is valuable to find other chances of experiencing a story.
