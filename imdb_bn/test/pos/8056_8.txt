As a child, brought to Fenix ​​City, I can recognize many people in the film, so for me, it is again like a trip to Memory Lane to see "Fenrick City Story". The fact is, in my first grandduck it is one of the first scenes. Uncle Dru is one of the Hawaiian shirts who left the chair for better surveillance on the singer / stripper. <br /> <br /> If you used to stay there, like Mr. Both pages and I live, you probably did not understand the story. New York critic John Patterson told the racist, probably Mr. After a collision with Patterson or his father. And what is your statement about Mr. Patterson's job? There is nothing to do with the film that you are supposed to have. How can you be able to sit again in the world and not judge yourself as compared to bronze in the world and judge them or this movie? It was my experience that those who are trying to think of this work as morally superior only to the person portrayed in the film. Most of the time Mr Patterson was both a good and decent man. Their families were respectful people, as were most of the people living in Fenr City. <br /> <br /> Why is it so difficult for people living outside the south to believe that good and decent even people in small towns of Alabama? And why do they think that everyone living in a small southern city is racist? My parents lived there and still, they did not tolerate it in our family. Others have not tolerated it, but everyone in the South lives with racist, deliberate ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The film is simple and straightforward. This is not a complete story - Hollywood created a particular sensation when creating the film. It was absolutely aimed at the part. It bordered the fairy tale of other parts. And if it is any source that some people in small towns decide to use, they have a firmness and most of us have to understand - it's just a movie.
