You got to see it to believe it. The strip in the middle of the ornament is shot in Hollywood, it goes in some 70, this is a cheap flick which must be fully packed in the city's theaters within the day. Then again, I bet it was a week's run. Actually, he's pretty fun. The act is horrific, the aspect is non-existent, but the hair, clothes, insect pre-disco music and laziness in and out of the story are in mind. Sleazy, her very sleazy. Highly Expected (if you can find it)
