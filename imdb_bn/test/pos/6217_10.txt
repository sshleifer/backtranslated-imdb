Every episode was stupid when I was a innocent child. There were some fun dolls called "Mix" which will always discuss childhood issues. This song will be played before the song "Meets" which "Come on Join Meats ..." was a coworker Marx doll who told Jokes. Before the session, this guy is "Hot Fajj! Right On!" Will sing There was a green doll with dots in the name of the semester. We will always see more Seymore. He will crack the joke and sing every episode. There was always a moral in every episode. One episode, a person sings "Lying Lies!" Another episode was that he shared and cared about singing. Seymore said that those two little girls about "Sharon and Karen." The Hot Fawn Holly Molly is doing this strange thing in the Molly part and they played the weird music.
