Dogtown and Z-Boys are a documentary about Jeffer's skateboarding team and their impact on skewboarding. It focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by the original Jeffery team member Stasi Peralta and was a member of Stasi Peralta and Craig Static's team. Documentary is described by members of Zephyr Team and Shane Penn. <br /> <br /> Documentary discussions about how to start skeboarding, and how to develop it from surfing. It talks about the popularity of skeboarding in the late 60s and early 70s, the fall of the 80s and the rebirth in the 90s. Scatterboarding was launched in Dagon, the poor side of Santa Monica, California. Zephyr Team created the first modern skateboard, which originated from Zephyr Surf Shop. The documentary is basically a member of Jeff's team talking about the past, the Safe Team, the competition they won, and their popularity and respect. It focuses on three special members of the group; PÃ¤rlata, Tony Alva and J Adams, three fake skateboarding, and perhaps the best three members. <br /> <br /> Documentary interviews were usually voices on the archive footage from Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. Very rarely do you actually see people in the interview, but when you do, they look black and white, when the archive is in the footage. I think Stacy Parrata has used this technique to show that the documentary is past (such as the glorious day of the Jeffery Team) and not the current. The documentary is fast paced, we often see impressive skrobboarding clips on the era of beat music (such as Jimmy Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews are fast and in dots. Not knowing about skeboarding means I did not even know about traveling straight to the ground. I was surprised that this documentary was so interesting. Because there was more about the Jeffar team than the actual game of this Doco Scrobbing, so I could not relate to skateboarding, I could have been related to the boys' boys. Because it was made by true members of the party, it gives it more deep and authenticity. <br /> <br /> To all, I would say it is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It's not only me in the Jeffar team, but I have completely new insights on the entire Sket Board. For those who like skateboarding, I can only imagine that it should be more interesting. Six out of ten people are in the stars.
