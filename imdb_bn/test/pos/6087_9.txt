'The English patient' can be compared in comparison to the movies of David Linne, whose epic epic like 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Que' certainly inspired director Anthony Minghela. The picture is nicely photographed, and 'Lawrence' is set in North Africa, but during World War II. The story is complicated, but it is warm for the forbidden love between an alleged and often difficult archaeologist run by Ralph Fiennes and Christine Scott Thomas, a married woman. <br /> <br /> Story based on a novel by Michael Ondaisei, Flanboxes in Flanbacks' Count Laszlo de Almasi - The Titanic Character. His name does not imply that his English word plays an important role in expressing it. He's burned badly on the crash of the plane, just as it happened to open the film, and an army nurse run by Juliet Binouch, Hanna is being cared for to return to Europe. This epic makes the epic broadening the space and time, and what makes the development of letters outside of two sick lovers. The film makes it clear that true love and emotions can even lead to valuable, or valuable lives, even with dire consequences. If you are romantic in heart and can praise a movie without the standard Happy ending and simple moral code, you can see that the 'English Patient' speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
