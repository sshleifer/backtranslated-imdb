I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I must admit, I went to see it because only because I had a huge pen Keith Renée fan. And he did not let me down. He rather gave a good performance of an incompatible character and provided the only comic relief in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a 'very bad guy stuck together in the snow storm' story, but it has a couple of twists to keep my guess. Characterizations were strong and the whole throw performed fairly well. I had only problems with Rose McGowan. He was so cold throughout the movie that we did not get any idea of ​​the personality or motivation of his character. Apart from this, there were a few minor issues with success, it was a good writing, well-played thriller.
