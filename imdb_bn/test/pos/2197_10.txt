I also own this video as well as the music version of the music of Paty Lupone and George Henne with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Henry is fantastic like my book, such as Angela Lansbury and Musician Saffenheim. This musical instrument offers optical and composition much cognition in scope. I'm sure this VHS DVD is available !! Audiences' performance is spookily sympathetic. Young women, by playing an exciting role in the role of youngster. I believe that this performance was not in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of Los Angeles, not the Broadway stage, but the lowest set in New York was not sure. But I saw that being dragged on the stage is useful for the "painting" of the congregation in London's streets. I highly recommend this movie.
