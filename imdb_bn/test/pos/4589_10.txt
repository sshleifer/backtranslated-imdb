Most people are fully aware that this movie exists. Fox, who gave the judge to make it, kept it in the cane for several minutes, and then did not spend anything for it. I guess that many people think that this is one of the summer gloves movies. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is a fun and terrible appearance that is not difficult to believe in the future. Basically, the judge leads the idea that fools are deviated from the vast edge of the smartphone. Then this fool becomes more stupid, mostly while watching TV and having sex all the time, which produces more fools. By 2500, a personality of today's intelligent person would seem to be a genius, which says "all ugly". Seriously, this is really hard to believe. Oh sure, this is painful fun and ridiculous stupid in the future, but still valid. Louis Wilson is trying to get a nice, frustrating, more comfortable time during the military visit of the army. Where this story will achieve its tribal status, there is a lot of fun with a fishing, for example, "We can do her family style" and "Hey Man, I'm sitting here!" This is a funny social comment on an American society that seems to be a funny movie and spontaneity with anger, comfort and folly, and I guarantee you that I will buy it on DVD and it comes first and sees it and over.
