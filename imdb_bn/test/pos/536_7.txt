Since I was a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the film. I enjoyed it every minute. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole film, such as Natalie Ma and Susan was a mother. Susan's character is making bad decisions and burned for it. <br /> <br /> I heard that there could be a love scene involving Natalie and some people (she's out in Providence), but Natalie would only accept that if the scene was deleted, And I think that's great. I think a love scene has destroyed the film's voice. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < So, I have no doubt about any film in Natalie Portman. <br /> <br /> A good movie. 7/10
