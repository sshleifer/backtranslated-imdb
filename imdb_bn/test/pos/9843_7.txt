James Cagney (Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) started his career and was able to work as a gangster for a boy renovated school run by corrupt politicians and work as a social worker. The reform school prison was like the little boys unwanted on the streets of New York, "East Side Kidons" who were poor and helpless during the Great Depression. In the final phase, a trial involving a big jump by the corrupt warden of the children's burning torches in the school of reform and a burner set in the fire. I noticed that they went out of the horse's first horse. This picture is often not shown and why I really understand!
