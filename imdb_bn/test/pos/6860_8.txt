When I came out and recently bought the 2003 signal and I saw different types of foreign movies, then surely you have to watch the movies in their original language. Voices not included in actors are not only annoying, but they always seem to be happy, the whole movie is big toothpaste commercial or something. Otherwise, it seems to be a terrible movie, and many of my friends who had to convert were foreign films that are not as good as North American films - they are not "Hollywood's suffix". Also, the translations are never accurate, it is very literally and screws the fold of the film, even if it basically says the same thing. I saw anatomy in Germany in the second week, then with subtitles in my roommate, because he was on his laptop and when he was typing it did not see the subtitles, then he did not want to miss those parts. 30 minutes and he asked me to finish his job and then started filming with subtitles. She likes it! Both movies are awesome as awesome horror films! Kelly
