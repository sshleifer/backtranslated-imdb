From the first 10 seconds of pitch black I was hooked. I went to this movie thinking that it would be another Chess Sci-Fi movie. Instead I found a highly entertaining, thought-provoking action movie on the edge of your seat. The movie goes beyond the flick of your basic special effects. Actor Amazing, Rada Mitchell (High Art, Love and Other ..) Fries are really fun to watch on the screen, when Wide diesel like Reedeke is so fortunate that you hear him speak again and die. <Br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is breathtaking, unlike Blues, Yells and oranges because of three different suns. Nightfall followed by complete darkness. To test this movie I would really recommend Alina Luna or Radha Mitchell (the reason I went to see it). I will definitely see you completely new in the dark.
