Well this is the best comedy movie I've ever seen ... my two dear actors did a good job. Salman Khan and Amir Khan! Approximate will be seen soon with your part 2, hopefully they will be back at Part 2 again. I have requested those who have not seen it yet. Please buy the DVD and you do not feel bored of it. I watched this movie 1 time a week. All other movies were good. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and other songs are also good songs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
