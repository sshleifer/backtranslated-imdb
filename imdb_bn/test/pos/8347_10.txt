Lady and Tramp II: The Adventures of Scamp is a great movie that many kids really can relate to today. This is a well presented story about a child who wants freedom to do his work and how he goes about achieving this independence makes this film interesting. This film, based on the view of the pot, forgets the same-witching disappointments of adults as adults, because only 0.5% or less of the great effect of the movie's audience. Great music, animated acting, gifted animation and instructions, and a powerful storyline tell a story of the difference between the streets of New England and a comfortable home with your family. And do not think of any bad thing, your family and friends are "always there" to help you with a tight spot. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get the soundtrack!
