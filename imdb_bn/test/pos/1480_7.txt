All critics are making a big mistake. This movie was not considered seriously. <br /> <br /> It was made for kids in the late 80's or early 90's and it was actually a film of it. If you hate that time or love the first movie so much that you can not take any joke about it, it's a junk but it is not meant for you. Here are the reasons for the failure of Bustmaster 1 in the low budget and box office (achieved with the budget of nine million). Basically, there was reason to reduce the importance and publish it in the present day. You can complain about stories, dialogs or logic, but once again run it, do not win the race. If the film tries to take it seriously, it will be a total failure, but it is not for a second ("Our" in the world, Dara shows a movie theater which creates the Bestmaster 2 advertising). To portray Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry movie: This movie knows its limitations. It's a comedy / parody then more of the usual adventure. The soundtrack (for the time being) was also great. Actors do not take themselves seriously, even in general, the role of "distorted wealthy brat" (performed well here by the young curry uhurara) becomes better. So, if you're nostalgic for the 80ies / 90ies culture, or you like the first part and do not think of going to any cheese organs but you will have great fun with 90ies (literarly) great This effort to revive This is not really the first one and you will not see it if you like it. <br /> <br /> Question for the question "why not different levels and different times": When in history we have tall winged humidified animals that suck the bone (part 1) from the flash? However, the film ends in a cheap (finance minister) zoo due to an attempt on the big finale. It seems that Dar needs to be the best place to show all his steps (these animals are manipulating).
