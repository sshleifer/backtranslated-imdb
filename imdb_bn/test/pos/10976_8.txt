Manna is a light comedy from heaven that uses the whispering of the people to entertain the audience. Goodness will be expected in every situation throughout the film. As a result, the movie girl sees herself with this stupid green in her own face, with her heart, peace, and high expectations for the people. This movie was the best experience to watch. (I venture say raising experience, but some say that corne !!)
