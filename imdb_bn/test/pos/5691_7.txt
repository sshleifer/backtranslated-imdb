This low budget crocodile movie really delivers the product. The meaning of being inspired by true facts is that if you show a fake spider, bad cigar Or they're harmful with a clear studio setting but it's less. Thankfully, one of the above is related to this great, very realistic movie. Crocodile is real, no CGI No, and location filming takes place in a real Australian swim. Actors are obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performance and they are successful. You can unfortunately set yourself up, which actually proves how it translates as "black water" entertainment. Highly recommended. - Mr.
