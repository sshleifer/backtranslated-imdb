It is not difficult to comment separately in three parts of Kinsulski's triangle, it seems that filmmakers want to do the opposite work: look at them as blue, white and red, and consider them together as a complete job. It is true that they are individual stories with distinct themes: independence, equality, fate, and each of their conspiracy and artistry is enhanced with unique applications. They look independently each good value, but I believe they are seen as a good job. Collectively, I will rate trilogy as a 9; Separately, I keep each of my top ten for 1993 and 1994. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> When the other two letters come in the first advertisement, they double their respective recognition, posting the busy city's intersection as well as making bigger posts from life. This ad is not a major part of the plot of this film, but its image suddenly turns out and I'm a red one known as a'end-pending 'film. It is blue-white-red on the French flag and three parts of its policy, based on Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood, Kinsloski's three trilogy trilogy III The film initially monitors these themes, keeping the basic layers of one, two, or three main characters, the complexity of the plot with each film increases, because the three principles are fundamentally related to individual (Liberty, blue) (white), White (social) (Brotherhood , Red). Red is my favorite of these films, and I give it 9. It stands by itself as a great movie, but for the full impact, the first will be blue and white.
