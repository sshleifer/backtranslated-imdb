There was fun to see a new independent film, "Half Blank". I usually go out of the local film with my husband and think that we are in the final prison, or Hollywood has thrown us out. Was this different and surprisingly ?? Hollywood is so much more entertaining than spending millions of advertisements. When my husband and I go to movies, can we go for entertainment ?? And "half empty" did just this thing and the movie did it in a smart way that I thought was my journey to the movie theater. It's a fun, human, and wonderful musical story sometimes that deliberately entertains its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene with singing 4 men in harmony in the bathrooms. It's almost like an operetta. The special scene reminds me of a scene in "Opera Phantom", when not only 4 actors, as they sang against each other for a friendly revenge. I'm not the brain of a movie, but this film was more enjoyable than any of the biggest studio films I've ever done. It's silly, fun, entertaining and amusing. Completely enjoyable ?? Which I hope from the movie, but rarely they give "half empty" like.
