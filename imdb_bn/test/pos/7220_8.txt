I was not ready for the world for this film. I do not know I was not. I would expect a standard low budget schlock absorption potboiler. Instead, I got the most intelligent recycling of Shakespeare from Peter Greenway's "Prospera Book". This should be Romeo and Juliet's firm film version. It certainly will not be. But that is the loss of the world.
