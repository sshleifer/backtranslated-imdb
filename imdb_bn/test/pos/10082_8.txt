I have seen this movie twice in cinemax twice. This is the first time an unexpected version that is the best in soft-core screen and the second time pruning (all the sex and nudity most cash) versions, which is the way to a typical beach movie version. The obsolete version has an extraordinary sex scene with Nicky Fritz, a dude and a bottle of oil (no intention) outside of this world. Unfortunately, the pruning version is almost completely cut off in that scene, as in other sex scenes. Rated or otherwise it is still trying to see big stars StallBlone (Stallone, Shane, Trivola, etc.). We also got the presence of B-Queen Linna Quigley and Bart Ward (Robin of the old Batman series).
