You can say that the Director is the first offer (who wrote it), but you can also see the possible possibilities of this man. It is a clearly low budget movie of the soul of the Boduk Santas. Of course, this was a few years after the Bodok Santas, so you can see it as a diamond for some polish. Acting was good - if you look for the criminal drama DÃ©rono or Michael Madsen, keep in mind that these young people are trying to be offenders. They're not going to be a supercollo (TM) like a veteran. I watched Justin crazy (Joe - main character) go to create more movies - he was this great. Good movie - 5 out of 3 stars.
