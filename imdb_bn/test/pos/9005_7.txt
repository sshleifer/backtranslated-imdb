As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I think I can answer some questions and confusions which I can answer. I think I have a position to offer some insight into the club and back story. Oh, and this will be a long post, I can already say. <br /> <br /> First off, those who say that the movie does not really show rugby, there is a valid point. The movie tackles bad, people in the wrong place, and much more. If you want to know how to feel like a real rugby game, you will not get the best idea from this movie. But the fact is, there is going to be nothing short and satisfactory to actually sit down and jump to a highlight relay or a game. This is not Hollywood, not ESPN! Actually, what kind of sports movies do you think you are in this game? I did not see that much. I think this movie is important to remember about rugby players, it is much more than rugby. Next, Huka is part of Highland Rugby. It's nothing that they just throw in the film. To be honest, I do not know how tradition starts, but Highland imitates all the blacks in many ways. The identical is all based on black closures as well. The film did not do good to explain about the source of Haka and to be honest, I do not think it's right. But I can tell you that every member of the team is well aware of where it came from and what it means. People of China (?) Said that only one Maori can perform a leak, I would recommend that they keep an eye on All Blacks and if they think they are all Maori Believe it or not, Utah has a very large polynesian community, and a good part of them is like rugby for the local team and play. I, I'm part of Hawaiian. Whenever possible, Haq is headed by a Maori. The team does not do this because they think that they are Maori, they do it because of some things shown in the movie. The concept of unity and "those who have gone before" support a large proportion of HR culture and messages for those who are familiar with it. It is a chant by a chief who thinks he will die (Ka Mate), and those around him who support him, telling him he will be alive (Ka Ora) and promote him. It is not for me to say how appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys, but it is why ideology behind it and why it is done. "Kya Kaha" was also a well-used party ideal, even the actors were hard to say. <br /> <br /> Also, those who question the skills to play rugby in the Highland, I will just remind you that you are not really watching this movie in the Highland sport. There were a lot of other players from Hyland and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, really, what they are doing in Hailand is very well respected and very respected among the international community. Approved, creates a better team than others for some years (what you would expect from a sports team), but do not collect HR's win records exactly like you do. I year after graduation, (1998) Hileland was one of the 12 groups invited to Zimbabwe's World School Rugby Championship. The teams were able to raise their hands around the world and at that time high school rugby talent represented the best. Highland did not clearly win the first place, (New Zealand did that), but they lost their last match to the National champions in the third place in the tournament. And when the American rugby can not reach the talent level of New Zealand or South Africa, the world's third can not hang on your head. Every year in New Zealand, there is a tradition of visiting New Zealand in Highland, and usually brings more victory than damages. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters in this movie are based on real people and real stories. I've seen this movie with my brothers, who also played for the Highland, and among us four, we were fairly sure that we were able to identify each major character. No one knew the white road. Of course it was not a documentary, Hollywood took some freedom, but to speak the truth, as much as you can not remember. The film was perfect for half an hour and a day as well as compulsory personal running and weight training. Sometimes it was really running until you threw. It also showed the activities of the service and other groups (such as Chuck-a-Rum Buut) that were part of several group ties. <br /> <br /> And finally this movie was my (probably very favorable) opinion, it was a pretty good movie. And I think this is because I saw it as an inspirational sports movie. I do not think it will be a pure rugby movie or academy award winning drama. This was an uploading movie about just a rugby team, full of a good level of humor thrown for morality, encouragement, and entertainment. I hope that I have solved some of the human problems with the movie, and hope you can enjoy it for now. <br /> <br /> What is that?
