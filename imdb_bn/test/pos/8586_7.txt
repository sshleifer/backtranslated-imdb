It's always great to see a movie that teaches us about Africa, because it is certainly very few. However, this movie portrays Lumbubba as a political leader who wanted to be like a new independent country like the ancient colonial .... I was relieved to express sympathy for such leadership, but the film is a bit of a tribute to the person. There was very little content, explaining how people began to move in the first place, and the whole issue of Belgium "let them go" Acting and photography are excellent, especially important to see myself in the muputu. I would just love a good political analysis.
