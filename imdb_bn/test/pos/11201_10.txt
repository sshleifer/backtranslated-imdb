This is not a movie that influences you by flashing clothes worried by high budget, high-tech shot, fast camera movement or impressive and hungry director. But it's a director who is a very good photographer who has got a good idea to look at things like humanity, not most of the directors as extraordinary gods. This is not a film where actors and actresses try to give gestures and imitations of their best 'performance' unreasonably or best learned. Rather, it is a movie that they can be as soon as possible. In fact, they are not professional actors at all. The main character, their expression, the dialogues in their feelings are real, they can be in your real life easily. With the same remorse you are telling the same lies about the people around you that you avoid expressing the word. You show the same signs of concern to an unwanted guest. This is the same feeling of isolation to get you the life of a modern city. And it's your chance to see yourself from outside, impersonated by the original characters. I have seen all the pictures of Silen in Nuri Bilge, along with. Thank you to her short film Kojo (Kakun) who has kept on DVD. Many people will compare him with Tarkovsky, Ozu and possibly Bresnan or Bergman, because he's really going to stand firm. And he is sincerely saying that his films have to pay his life without earning money. You will get the kind of sincerity you have in Uzbek.
