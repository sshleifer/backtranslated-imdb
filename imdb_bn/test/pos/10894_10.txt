007 is one of the best N64 releases ever in Golden. <br /> <br /> is better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: The Rag Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Rasore and The Legend of Gelda: Time of Oquina is a great and better game. But I still love Goldenie. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation of the second film adaptation of Star Wars adaptations. The story is perfect. It's like you own movies. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. Movement is very realistic. Artificial intelligence of enemies is the best part of this game. James and Natalia liked to play on the stage at a break from Johns Base, because it was ready to burn in Goldeneye. Escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult. The gameplay has a great way of excluding the camera and controlling your fire. <br /> <br /> I have never played that difficult game. N64 games are usually very simple. Golden One is an exception. I'm still trying to defeat 200 agents at a solid level, but winning a simple level is already a great win. When Alex Travelian asked when I asked: "James James?" I replied, "No, for me!" Right now I pushed him to death. Just like the movie I love accomplishing each purpose. <br /> <br /> Multiplayer gaming is even better. At first I killed every holy second. Now, I know how to win. I forced my players to play the game to play the license. <br /> <br /> Music and sound are wonderful. Looks like an atari next to Super Mario 64. The song I would like to hear was the Golden theme song, which was played at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> After the release of Jalda, I almost forgot that I still got this game. It is still excellent, even if it is already overcome. I hope other 007 games are produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent job royarware! Nintendo was very smart to release this game exclusively at N64. Excellent job Nintendo!
