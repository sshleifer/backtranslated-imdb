This movie was tragic, but it was really fantastic. I did not know anything about the film in the theater, but the friend wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> I got stuck in the high quality guards of the film. I could not make an image of Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance is really an example of his character. This film is an exception and our financial support, unlike many other films. This does not come lightly for me to recommend a movie, but in this case I highly recommend that everyone will see it. <br /> <br /> These movies are indeed exceptions!
