How nice. When I went to the Toronto Film Festival in this movie, I had no idea what I was. This movie takes you to a mental roller-coaster in the best sense of the term. Sigourney Weaver was better than I've seen from her years; Emil Hirish was fantastic and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how it does not make every person's cup of tea, sometimes it works on some pretty harsh things that can happen to the family. Do not make me wrong - it's really funny - the audience in my screen is busy making me laugh again and again. I think if I'm just open to test your own life, the fantastic heroes will warmly touch you. I can not wait until the theater goes out.
