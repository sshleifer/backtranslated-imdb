A dreamy, stunning atmospheric movie was held in a small town in North West, Montana, in 1955. Government officials came to bring the city out of the new hydroelectric dam to set up the climate. There are other visitors in the city, from the angels from another time but they are only seen by a dead son Irvin. A local cleric (calm quiet hearty performance Nick Nolte) took care of the boy. Arvin pleads with the angels to leave the place ... <br /> <br /> There are some strange qualities in the film, some proud and sad sadness when you suddenly feel the inevitable finality - people and their relationships, cities, countries , Civilization, the whole world we know it. There are some common types of death and birth - we go through them through extreme loneliness. <br /> <br /> I've influenced the film in the same way and were deeply influenced by "NorthFark", the film is so beautiful and so humble, so calm and so powerful, hearty and so running. Even now, I've seen several weeks later, when I get tears in my eyes, I only think this. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I had to talk to someone about me. I sent one of my friends to a Prime Minister and I asked, "Please tell me, what did I see?" And my friend answered with these words, "You have just seen one of the best films of modern times, among others these days will see the light."
