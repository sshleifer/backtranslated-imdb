Because I think this movie is imaginary that it has many levels of emotion. From Script and fabulous acting there is a history behind all the feelings that you can tell. You understand why the characters take certain steps and why not others You can feel the sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them together. You see her best and it's the worst humanity. You can relate to letters because you can not see the qualities and faults you see yourself, but you can never live up to them in their proper circumstances. This film makes you amazed at a certain extent but ultimately it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and sense for the characters, not just yourself. I would say that I have never cried so much in my life and I have not found anything. I request you to watch this movie and take its meaning. That's just a true thing and that ... love.
