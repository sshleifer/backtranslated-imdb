Rather than releasing new things from "Pearl Harbor", instead of publishing something new, some real events have been dropped in some individuals, so that the filmmakers can say that they can contribute to the expansion of history, not just a CGI but a sad romantic triangle Fill the blast for. One will see Dark Blue World. <br /> <br /> This movie was held during WWII's historic period, which check pilots leave their home country and instead of throwing their arms, they went to fight for the RAF. Nazi is a part of history that should be called at least once in the outside world. A love triangle takes place in the main character, but one of them is easily Pearl Harbor, but does not die like a sacrifice for true friendship. In addition to the tragedy, the film is not frustrating, even our cat does not get the glory of returning to her country, the return of the love of her current boyfriend, the return of love to her consolidated lover, or even the return of conditionlessness, her life is loved by long pets. She feels completely offensive and no worse off in the Russian labor camp. This type of ending is probably something that can be changed if its script is likely to be <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Overall, an appropriate movie.
