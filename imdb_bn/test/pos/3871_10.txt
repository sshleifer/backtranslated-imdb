Frank Lennon stole my heart in what he did! I love to see him !! I was 10 years old (1979) when I saw him for the first time. I look forward to waiting for everyone and I hope he does whatever he does. One day I can see him personally. She is very hypnotized and mysterious and commanding that voice and strong! She is very attractive, even now 65 she is absolutely stunning !!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor ever! I enjoyed him in "Dracula" (along with many other girls there) and "God made women", "D house", "Jason and Argunts" and more. I thought he was genius !!!!!! "Good night and good luck" can not wait to see him
