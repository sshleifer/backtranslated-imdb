I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival. The title of the movie and, indeed, the framework of this film comes from Robert Graffas' poem beauty problem. John Herbzeck directed a screenplay from Peter Jarvsksky from a story by Henbzez and Zerbovsky. In 2002, when one of the deadly 100-year floods struck, Marceler (Anna Sislerova) and Jarda (Roman Hideaway) and their two children destroyed Cuba (Adam Miskik) and Lusina (Michael Mervikova). Since they now live in Kwaobh asthma, they are threatening life. Marceler's work and Zarda run a chop shop outside the garage beside them. Zardari's incursion made him betray him and became involved with Marcela's victim of his theft. Evgen Benis (Joseph Abraham), a wealthy businessman who shared his time between Italy and Czech Republic, and offered to care for Marcela and her two children. John Brzechova, mother of Marcela, who is living with her general law and order, Uncle Ritchie is directed by Jeremy Schmidger, probably in the best part of the film. Emilya Vassarova is shown as Zarda's mentally retarded mother around this extraordinary castle, which makes any payment to local religious charlatan. There's a lot going on for a small movie and it's a great script and a good story about a lot of comic relief. Alzheimer's Czech singer Ruduza and Irish singer Glenn Hansard give music scores with additional music. There is a lot about this movie and I'll give it 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.
