Like the first movie in this series (Sluhaetter, 1972), I think it would be wrong to label a "blacksplotation film". Sure, the deaf is a tough, gun-piercing, black man, but it is not a picture of a progression, regardless of the color of the leading person or the bad guy - and it's a very good picture picture. <br /> <br />> Second and final time, Jim Brown played the title character. The movie starts with a maximum view that can be remembered in a movie. The deceased and his friends are enjoying a outdoor party, as well as a dual plane comes and the machine guns spread the group with fire! No, the deaf is not so hard that he downs down the plane with him. 357! But the deaf is impressive and no one is sure why this hit happened - but the slaughter is going down! Well, this hit was tried for retaliation for the last moment. In this, mother tongue takes mother tongue and there is a lot of beats in Mexico. Now, in an awesome bungled and clumsy effort, the boys in the plane killed and hit but killed the Butcher. And, because the job was so tightly bound, the boss (Ed McMahon !!) ordered the pilot and the gunman to kill his cruel killer (Don Stroud - a very common role for him). Stroud great - Core scary and nasty, but as the boss Ed McMahon ?! Wow, that's an interesting wrapping! <br /> <br /> He realized that two people were flat, but at that time they reached them, they died. So, to help him with his own vendor, Brock Peters (who played a policeman) told him that the violent people ordered the hit and agreed to help with some illegal activities. So, the Butcher and his pimp friend break into the gangster palace and steal the list of government and police officials' wages. And, naturally, many of these processes have been shooting and bleeding. <br /> <br /> Stroud does not allow the deaf to go away like this and kidnaps the deaf girlfriend. Now it's on a stolen-lock list but if she does not return, then the woman is dead. Being a difficult but brave man, you might be able to guess what might happen next. <br /> <br /> This film is a great work and Jim Brown is frustrated and difficult. The only negative I noticed is that when McMahon plays this dirty boss, he breaks easily - and the fastest way. When the deaf captures him, then Macmahon becomes a quarrel and all the previous addictions disappear - and it is too much of a clich√© and inconsistency. Yet, despite this little softness, it is a compelling film that is not due to all violence and boobs for children.
