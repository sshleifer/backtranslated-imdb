Wow, I think the overall average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There really is no reason to dislike this image. "Michael" is a simple, but fairly original, and easy-to-enjoy romantic comedy. This plot involves a group of journalists / experts to examine the mysterious appearance of a Middle Eastern angel (John Travolta). The angels proved to be less godly and more faithful than her, and that makes it amusement. His interest in women and beetles is that the angel takes a new spin on the item. The romantic aspect of this movie is trying to connect Michael Mandela with Andy McDowell and William Hurt together. Both of them can not have the greatest on-screen chemistry of all time, but they must have enough to work well. Who gave this rating so low rating (5.4 ??), come! The film is not that bad. Actually, I found it quite funny and memorable. Sure, this is not the best thing you can see, but it's still good. This is a film that I think is extraordinarily involved. It is fun, romantic, and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** *** *** ***
