Since growing up in Czechoslovakia, I was following the history of WWII Great Britain's RAF pilots and workers, their stories and war ended sadly in communist fishermen and camps. It is without any doubt except in the dark section of our history, although these brave men are able to go through all this and then recover them. Everyone who wants to see a great movie ... this is one! During the recent visit to the Czech Republic, I have seen this movie three times in three days (they are only playing it for three days ... otherwise I will go see it several times !!! It is suitable for me!) Hope you enjoy it, Background knowledge requires a bit more thought and knowledge, the film is similar to "Kualiya". This is not a simple film because of its deep story, and the way it's probably will cry you ... It worked with me three times a day ... The Zenencker server has always worked as a great script, his son John great movie and cast? Without doubt, all of them were doing a great job, OLDRECH VETCHI, I played the role of Old Cecher and other actors who made this movie look awesome! If it is not an Oscar nomination, then I think there will be a hartal in the city.
