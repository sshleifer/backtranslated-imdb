Do you want to know why the French and Italians love / hate each other? Do you want to run our lifetime which has a glimpse of history? So, look at Veerjir's film (of course) and you can see a great Monica Baluchi who finally talks with her local language at City de Castello (Umbria, border with Tuscany). And the remaining letters are not saying Livornese (lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and all others). Daniel Auteuil definitely his shoes with Napoleon Very interesting, a true Fresco in the landscape of Elba Island, and a picture of political reasons to keep a relief from being killed or alive (always good).
