Dario Argonto is a filmmaker I'm going into slowly, following deep red and Susiei's iconic striving; She is not always a film-maker of direct care about silly things like "intrigue". It can be a minor (but, for me, clear) liability: He does not allow a little thing like common sense to screw his plan for the crisis of his widespread killing, because his killer set up to be of any kind of invisible, said psychologist killer Until the PV tracking shot past the point of the shot. But a filmmaker is thrilled to show such a possibility in any way, a pure Italian aesthetic who travels on the way to the soul of Hitkovian Warp (in fact, as a note of interest, if there were recently a few scenes from Skerson's where he accepted), three pages of an unreleased hitcoch movie, Which was held in the opera, Argentina For years it was frustrated at 0, there is no sense in writing). It has more than 80 motions (CD players and heavy metals and hair, oh my!) And melting it with an irrationality. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: Macbeth is producing an opera, with highly decorated pyrotechnics and trained ravens. At the last moment, the talented up and upcoming star has been replaced, Betty, played by Marcelych. But a murder takes place during the premiere - it does not hinder but by a falling light - and now the murderer Betty later! She can not go to the police (how can she give herself a curse?), But can she face a murderer who will not be disappointed? Someone else has seen scenes played in another Argentine film - the girl is being thrown behind the murderer - but how, like De Palma, Argentines collects and runs their sequence and adds their own tastes to touch the malicious smile. (The next version of the attacking attack for the killer attack, and the follow-up to the lineup), a type of over-stylization, Ala Lyon (through the door, the bullet probably inspired the same shot at Bill Bill 1), and even with Shadow-Mokostic Inspiration Pins in Betey's eyes Pressed, once again! <br /> <br /> Argentina keeps her actress wringer, and it all plays for her, even when things seem to go to 'what-the-hell' areas, when Apu is taking the little girl's secret road down, suddenly We are now in the Alien). And such dark-language elements make Argentina's violence thick and fresh, with relatively tune, which is coming from a speaker of the opera music from the Stereo system, and a painter who can drink a few drinks (and just so!) At some scenes during the shot and a heart -The bite is shaking. It should be considered as a trash, but it has surpassed any limitations of the curve by the bold attitude, despite a stupid last celery compared to what happened before - (and for a little effort) Macbeth curse break, which, unfortunately , Do not seem to happen in real life on the set of opera. 8.5 / 10
