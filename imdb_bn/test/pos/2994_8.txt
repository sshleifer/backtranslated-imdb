First love Teen love We've all enjoyed it even a sweet as it's a dramatic share. "Friends" classic "The Blue Legoon", originally from 1949, and since 1980, may be considered as its remix (the most popular with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a small Mella Jovvich). "Blue Lagoon" places two young lover on two desert islands, "Friends" goes back to the opposite street without any contact with civilization, and it is also sure to be a more real ring and a more difficult movie with sure contemporary visitors. Paul and Michelle, for various reasons, turn them back on families and adults to live together in a small hut in southern France. Only friendship with each other and their childhood, their friendship gradually develops, because they struggle to protect themselves in this sweet arrival story. This picture is even controversial until this day that the actors look at the ages as teenagers and they definitely have the film (15 and 14 1/2) mentioned. This movie contains child abuse, nudity, teenage sexuality and teenage pregnancy screenplay. But not the real debate, but the love of Paul and Michelle is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. Although it has fined another time and lovers trapped in the desert, but they present some complex moral issues in their modern settings. Among the causes of pregnancy and unwanted pregnancies of unwanted teen children are often viewed as the reason for lack of sex education among adolescents, prohibiting sexual intercourse between mother tongue. A movie that can be confronted with children pornography or face-to-face, which can be confronted by our own hypocrisy, it is related to a modern society that does not meet teenage-teenage-teenagers, which clearly defines human nature and hormonal development. Against it is necessary to prevent child abuse? Emotional growth parallel hormone development? This is not a simple question and many of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem. The script is extremely progressive with simplicity, although some happiness, but no panchayet can pull out to convey its message, although according to today's standards, it is a bit slow. Photography is beautiful and it has great beauty scenes. In some scenes played in two characters, the surprisingly harmless and trustworthy among others really turns out to be terrible. Nowadays, pop music is used transparently against most productions, and sometimes the songs speak of the characters' thinking. Overall, it is a delightful piece, even if the moral values ​​are not compatible with your own.
