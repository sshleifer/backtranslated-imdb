Fame, I think, I've never seen the best movie. The way it was fun and dramatic, but that makes a movie. True, it's a few loose ends, actually many, but I still think it's a horror movie. At the beginning of the movie some strange events happened in the audition. I think the girl is laughing when she tries to work with OJ. Simson "The Towing Infony" and Raul / Ralph went to each art department and said that his father was great among everyone. He said that his father danced with rockets and kept Ralph with his tube shoe. As far as I know, rockets are made of women. And tap shoes were regular shoes with bottom bottle caps. It was also interesting to read Juliet's line in Romeo and Juliet. There is just one thing about the movie that just turned me on. I have not heard anything like this !!! My favorite song is "I Love Body Electric" and my second theme song "Fame" itself. Irene Car A has a great voice and is a great actress. I like the film focusing on many ethnic groups. It actually showed all kinds of people known as "La Guardia School of the Performing Arts". This movie has shown the experience of victory and trial of several young actors including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Koko, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. All of them had a difficult time, but it made their own way. This film can be added more than 30-45 minutes (before graduation), but it still does not matter to my favorite movie !!!!
