It seems that many films have been created in the matter, there is no shortage of stories from World War II. The world-wide war will confront the imagination of filmmakers throughout the scale and provide enough material for the foundation of the story. The title of the dark blue world, a film that does not deal with the traditional major wars of war, is not the story of most major figures, and even does not even pay attention to the majority of mainstream movies about the war. Instead of the dark blue world, refugees in the exile for their occupied countries enter the world of refugees. <br /> <br /> This photo does a great job of illustrating the challenges facing the flight pilot under the British Royal Air Force. They both had frustrated the language barrier between them and other flyers, but due to refraining from retaliation for the Germans until they were re-trained. <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> The arena of war film as a story about human relations. A love triangle has two main characters and an English woman, making the teacher-consultant relationship complex of two exiled soldiers complicated. This relationship has played quite well, it is often developing in many points between a father and son relationship. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Tensions and strife in this scene create tension between men in the ground, just as tensions on the ground are felt in the air. <br /> <br /> This can not be a movie for everyone. The Battle of the Battle of the Hard Battle could find some isolation of its relationship, but it is an extraordinary movie regardless of the Belikoz element.
