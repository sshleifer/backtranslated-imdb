There are many people who have tried to make a movie which is like a story, the heart of darkness. Some movies are based on the Heart of Darkness, such as the Apocalypse now. In 1993, Nicholas Disease ran a film exactly like the book. The heart of darkness is almost like a similar book. This movie is full of action and adventure. The Heart of Darkness is a marlow, which carries along the Congo River, to see the super Hebrew trader, Mr. Curz. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and setting as a book. It was held in a boat in the Thames River and Marlow is telling stories to four people in a boat named Nellie. The entire movie is a flashback of Marlow's journey to see Mr Cartesz in the Carlo River. Marlow works for the Belgian company, which deals with elephant teeth along the Congo River. He told about the accounts of his company's office and the maps he saw in the office. <br /> <br /> Marlou sets a steamer in Africa. He comes to the Central Station, where he receives the order of General Manager. Tell the general manager Marto Cartz and elephant stalks Marlow. Marlow soon learned that the general manager did not fall in love with Cartes because Cartes would replace him. Marlough has been waiting around the central station for a few months because his ship has been destroyed, and it is being repaired. When at the Central Station Marlow saw hard work and slavery in Africa. Finally, when the ship was finally repaired, Marlowe, another African character Muffum and other crew members placed seals on Marlow's steam for Mr Cartesz. <br /> <br /> The Wilderness is attacked by African Natives near the Congo River. Marlow's crew attacked by African netizens, they shot and killed Mifumu. Marcelo finally reached the Cartz station, who met Russian who explained the power and glory of the cart. Marlow is then led to the home of Kurtz's station. There, he saw many maps and pictures that illustrated the Koruja. Finally, the courtyard entered the house, and began to tell all that Marlow had done in Africa and talked about his accessories. Marlowe soon wanted to know that Cartes power was insane because the Africans called him God. Marlow is angry with the hardness and slavery he sees in Africa. After Marlow finally met Kurtz, Kurtz began to die. Cartage was at the time of his death, he called Marlow in his house. Kurtz's life started flashing in front of her eyes, and her last word was "Awful, Awful." When Marlow returns to Europe to see Curtace's granddaughter, then Marlow tells him that the last word of the cart was his name, hiding the darkness of Cartage's life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I recommend someone to visit this movie because it is full of actions and mysteries. Slow in the movie, but all, it's really interesting. The heart of darkness will really teach you a lot about how to broaden your mind and explain the different scenes.
