El Antena (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "An Antenna" For the lovers of the festival and the German publisher, Essentially, Fred Lang and Frederick Muranur are working with most of the people. <br /> <br /> 'City without City' 'La Ciudad sin Vaj', ruled by Mr. TV, he took the voice of the residents and All conversations and pictures are in full control, so that everyone can own Mr. TV is not only a monotonous, he is also seen as a symbol of evil and proletariat, as well as selfishness, several times, he secretly works as a hypnotizing device for controlling the mind of all citizens through his television broadcasts. For this purpose, He kidnapped the only plaintiff with voice, a beautiful singer, but a Ti V repairer abduction witness and go to an old TV antenna of mountains to stop the evil plans of Mr. TV. <br /> <br> Stunning with beautiful sets and imagery in production design. Although primarily shot in the silent film's basic language, Esteban Sappi has also added several of his own new strategies, such as the combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone talks to each other through the text balloon (usually floating around their faces), they speak loudly, big letters The texts themselves can push away or push. In the initial order, we see a book, titled "La Antenna", which opened and raised the page from a city paper. There is no mention in Argentina. It is a continuous snowfall, which gives the movie a very non-aragonic feeling, although the very setting suggests any large city of the Norwald hemisphere, only a few songs reveal the Argentine's background. <br /> <br /> The speed is instant and there are many things happening on the screen, it is difficult to hold the cinematic details of the film. Not only to watch, but we have received a few messages about the monopoly, corruption and sovereignty of the media, but they are disappointingly packaged. I have seen several real movies which can be seen in years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image was shown as an IFF Rotterdam 2007 opening film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Camera Osc√∫ --- 9/10
