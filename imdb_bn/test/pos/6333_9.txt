The film was seen many years ago and frustrated by its isolated power, when I heard that it was becoming a TV series, I refused to see it. My best friend immediately became a rabbit fan, and my love for the horror film is intelligent, I can not believe that I will not watch a single episode. I told him that this movie inspired me as much as I was concerned about BFF for life, and he told me that the film was also present. He stressed that I am giving a two-episode shot: "I feel more at all together" and this one <br /> <br /> <br /> I am both of them a lifetime fan. She was right - I was immediately hooked. I did not show the courage to try any part of a conversation beside any conversation, and nothing else could bring it with pure creativity of pan ache and buffy. I think if x files think about it first, it matched it, but I was happy that instead of doing it in the buffet. <br /> <br /> This is a credit for everyone who is involved with you, which is written for the entire hour, sometimes hanging on your seat. And when it was complete, I wanted to know more about each character. So I went out and bought a boxed set of seasons. And the rest is history ... I guarantee you that if you do not see it, if you want to make this episode first, you will want to see more. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give 10 out of 10 because I'm saving the score for "once more ..."
