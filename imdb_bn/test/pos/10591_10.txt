This movie is simply awesome. It's very fun. Even though skating and other montages are played, the comedy is extraordinary. Rab himself and Brandon Decimalo ridiculous. When you can not laugh, the moments are you laughing so hard. Also, there are some scenes that you can see hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the most fun comedy I've ever seen.
