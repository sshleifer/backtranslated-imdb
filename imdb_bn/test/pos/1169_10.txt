I've seen that movie and enjoyed more than any other movie. I first saw it as a kid and loved the drama and great climactic warfare. I'm old, I've enjoyed more or more than ever before, but now because of all the factors that work together to create a real classic. Acting great (especially Kooth T. Roosevelt), cinematography spectacular, the script is full of gems, and pulls the order wonderfully with each other. It relies on an actual event, and it shows in Europe and in a new emerging United States to create 'Cat Old Man' (Ottoman Empire), because it shows that it has broken into a fashion like any other 'historical' film. . Humor, drama, action, love ... all it got and deserved much more praise (many 'The Great Waldo Paper').
