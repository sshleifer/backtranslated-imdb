I originally saw Channel 4 (UK) and it's a fantastic movie that gives a great impression on me. But I recently saw it on Irish TV and there was an additional description of Roy Skider ("We need a big boat!"). This is the destruction of the film for me. Her droning monologue did not add anything to the film, and if some movies seem to be bright. I'm surprised at the new DVD version which has no judgment (legal reason?) To stop people from buying it. Well believe that the film is so good for him! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Damian
