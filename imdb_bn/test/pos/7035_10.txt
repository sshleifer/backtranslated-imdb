This timeless summer love story will not be a classic and date. I can not count how many times I even saw poor dance This is a movie that I can see for a few weeks and still love it. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit of time-consuming. I liked the movie "Blockbuster Love Story" like Prenti Woman and when Harry saw Sally. I think of them up there but there is something about Dirty Dancing that makes it absolutely perfect. Everything about chemistry, film direction, extraordinary dance, warm tropical environment, dirty dance, in character, scope and gray is absolutely perfect. This is an instant classic and I have never seen a movie before or since. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a special element that loves this movie so much but much, much that is mentioned by many critics. The dirty dance has given us a true honest message in conjunction with a nostalgic, lazy, scenery mood, realistic characters, incredible music and dance and the best dance sequence of all time. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on TV and I will look at it as long as it shows it. But I would like to mention that I do not have any interest in seeing "Havana Knights", they have to be alone in this one.
