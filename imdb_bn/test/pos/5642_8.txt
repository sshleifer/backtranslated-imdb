Two World War II films written by fire and shoie Oka and NATO WADA in the plains run by Con Ichikawa, which ultimately do not show the alliance fighting against axis, but the Japanese fought and struggled for their lives in the Philippines. The name of the main character is Tamura, played by Eiji Fanakoshi, and because of his illness he left his regiment and a soldier left. Everything on it has a hand grenade, its gun and some potatoes. In this way, he is trying to go to hospital for treatment of the doctor and for the treatment of the disease. But as the hospital turns away and destroys it, he started a long walk. Throughout the whole film, Tamura is somewhat nasty, but very civil, when the other soldiers use their basic instincts to become more like animals, the thamas are still left to live and they are not frustrated. A scene that has affected me so much for thinking about this movie about the war, when Tamur comes to the Filipino village that is completely emanating. There, he beat a dog and found many bodies of stacked Japanese soldiers in front of a church. This makes Tamura already and he's getting more scared than already. It shows that the soldier is not a brave killer, but one servant is superior and most important of the people. After turning away from the corpse, two Filipinos (couples or brothers and sisters: very close relations) come back to the village to return to the village. The main character of the film wants to be friendly first, though he went to them with his gun, but once he started shouting, the girl was shot. His brother / boyfriend / husband ran away in fear, and after a moment Tamura followed him and shot fiercely in the fleeing Filipino. She does not hurt him. After Tamura lifted the bag of salt, something very valuable, he threw his gun into the river. This gesture is very important for understanding the profiling of Tanu and War Kon Ichikawa / Shaio Oka. This film is not comparatively more common in comparison to the two World War II films. Of course all the heroes of the film are suffering, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He has revealed everything to humans: He is discouraged, he is weak, he is afraid, he has hope. It is ideal for both Japanese World War II films and Japanese society. Since World War II is not a negotiation in Japanese society, Japanese could play the role of Japanese in World War II. This victim is very visual in this movie. One of the examples is Tamur, a kicked organization of Japanese soldiers in front of another church, and another important thing is that while Japanese soldiers are trying to cross the street and Americans are already waiting for them and shooting everyone. Japanese soldiers have bad equipment and they are worse and have no health equipment or other things. In my personal conclusion I would say that it is good to see this movie to see a movie at the other end than usual. It also does not have nationalist propaganda which can be easily made. Once you have seen the movie completely, you will be able to see the full horror of World War II.
