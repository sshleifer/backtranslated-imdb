The greatest compliment to the other commentators in IMDB, who himself asked why this series "did not get stuck" during the much more time like the other series in the 80's. <br /> <br /> If the truth is not, the series will get worse. <br /> <br /> I will post some thoughts of other movie releases at the end of this comment, rather: Robin Hood's legendary effort. <br /> <br /> For the first time, Robert Eddy (Gisborne), you are in us, you are alive forever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The absolutely unique series এবং একই সাথে মিশর, গ্রীস, রোম, কনস্ট্যান্টিনোপেল, গোথ ও বার্বারিয়ানদের মধ্যবর্তী টেরি জোন্সের ইতিহাসের নথির বেশিরভাগ নতুন এবং বিপ্লবী ফলাফলের সাথে একমত হয়েছেন এবং মধ্যযুগ এবং ক্রুসেডগুলি ... (হ্যাঁ, মাসিক পাইথন- টেরি জোন্স) <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John Carpenter's brother "Thing", their third brother made music), wanted to tell us. <br /> <br /> "Dick Turpin", "Catweazle" and the first two seasoned authors "Robert of Sherwood", "Cop" Carpenter, is the owner of my movie. He is better than all those critics of this series ("I can not see") his "sword-and-magic" element or "defect" (taken from Sherwood Webbing), or there are other non-basic criticisms. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> you will hate the third season first. Not only this: I was going through it myself, and on top of that, I took the first two seasons in my deepest heart - the release of this series because Robin's actor Pred released this series. There was a huge success, he was probably given a good paycheck in "The New Advocates of Zeus Verne", a completely ridiculous Canadian series - this title already publishes the entire project. Prade went for money, or for fame, he did not live with his gang and Kinnie, that means I: as actors. <br /> <br /> Actors who are next to us in the famous "true" and Robin-Legend's legendary face and characters. Potential material in this series can be much more fruitful without any humiliating and historic message about current political issues and rebellious accuracy. /> <br /> again forced to talk <br: Sherwood rabinake bharna reconstructed the story of a brutal series priyadera stupid decision was forced by the major role and the story was filmed brightly woven. It's still some disaster. However <br /> <br /> If anyone knew about this, and that's probably kananeri was notified by his father, but seeing all the young kananeri "" I thought how prejudicially first, then enjoy the third season you can do. দুঃখের বিষয় হল যে এই স্ক্রিপ্টটি আর সুপারম্যান কিপ কার্পেন্টারের দ্বারা লিখিত ছিল না, তাই আমাদের আর সেই সমালোচনামূলক এবং মুক্ত চিন্তাশীল ঐতিহাসিক পটভূমি যেমন "এলসডনের জাদুকরী" বা "দ্য কিংস ফুল" তে দুটি পর্ব নেই। The first series that A) is fun, B) historically educated and c) Brightly acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, RoS and shown as a real history, there was more authority than John or others, but it used to fight against Crusades only for his evil ideas and against Normandy in France. He was killed and killed many among the Christians, Muslims and Jews of the "Billy" Crusade, and his soldiers even ate children who were hungry or even poverty. Moreover, krusedase serakenasa (Muslim) After his capture, Britain was submerged for his ransom, 100,000 marks (about 30 billion compared to the 11th century - the current price of $ 30000000000000 .-), to bring him back safely, And then he went to England for a month to return to the Crusades at Normandie (in France, where Norman Invador first went). King's fool "). This is a new crusade for the perhaps his capture revenge Richard liyenaharta again," meaning the country and destroyed "(Clive mentalera mouth quoted from when he rabinake the King with the critical words). Robin Richards of the battlefield anti-government criticism He said to Richard, "The poor are all for redemption What else can you ask them? "- Richard:" Give me your courage and strength, not your words! "... Then, personally, Richard Robin ordered the murder ... <br /> <br So, the Crusaders were really "barbarous." <br /> PS: Already I saw Coster at the age of 91, I got bored, because afterwards, I found in History school history that Richard was the good man Not that "Civie's Prince Shawn Connery was appearing on her face at the end of "The Chibbe." Well, Terry Jones will write it down: It's a false, treacherous lie! "Shane plays comedic and charismatic and works better than expected in the third season of his son" Robin of Sherwood ". Again, Prade, until now, according to my information, Sherwood has left the team for a stupid Verne series with the brain, remember or remember.
