I can not explain why I can not find so lucrative and "leopard"; This may be the reason that attention has been given to the focus on this film, the intimate moments that Wiskanti could do so well. Like that movie, it's a fantastic slow motion, but this time it's not overlong. This is such a movie where nothing will happen but it will pass for twenty minutes. I think that movies work as their own mini story relating to Flashbacks. Like "leopard", it is like a sympathetic leadership, which brings out similar attire - although Bogard's performance is more interested in opening itself as unlikely, especially in the face: he has a real stupid green, which is easy to dislike. It's often pretty cool at quiet moments. This is the magnificence of the movies of Wisconsin, which is glorious in the ball scene, which I feel tired, because they exchanges individual transparency with the transparency of the public. But here, the partner at this point - Gustav surrounds by a visual deity. <br /> <br /> The way Gustav's affection is presented to us is quite brilliant - the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful, feminine featured boy. It's like a sign of Shakespeare's Sonatas, and it does not look like a heavy hand. (The camera does not see Tadijo completely, does not come back and we see its tall, thin legs, we realize that he is not a boy, but a teenager - first we were forced to ask Gustav's attraction unheard of; Visconti must know, and he She is not ashamed of him.) Vicente is very patient with Gustav; We get a sense of human, we know him. This is a mostly silent performance, and when it opens its mouth it is sterile; There is no wonder that he wants to project an angel, open featured boy himself onto the project. There is a difference with Tadijiao (we do not know him, as we have never known about Falunino's groups, but this is because his life is another, its own film), but it is believed that it is not any kind of surprise (this is a view , However, where he twirls around a pole too much). Tazizio is not going to look at him - he is watching him; Vissini just zoom in all. <br /> <br /> The picture does not describe Gustave as gay - Tazijo is not even a man, he's a graceful version of a boy (fine, pale, intelligent, golden) lock that everyone loves (a gorgeous, little older man whose With that he wrestle). As a reference to Gustav's homosexuality, it can be understood that he is the closest, the famous repeated scene, which unveils his fallen vanity. <br /> <br /> It is not completely successful - A waste of the whole section with Alfred can be excised, and people carrying some unnecessary scenes, long shot bags. Some parts are heavy-handed, such as when Gustav's boat is dragged and the boys pass by him - the face of his face is very clear. (But during the same scene, Gustav throws a benchmark, wants a new wind, something unclear that it is made for him.) But there are some scenes - the first touch - which creates an extraordinary, quiet intensity. Togadia repeatedly repeats a piano song, the notes circulating in the air can be the best example of the film's concern. There is a debate between a discussion that I am particularly interested: if it pleases spirituality, can it be spiritual, or should they go outside? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who has predicted both Wisacandi and the value, being the main example of a person leaving beyond sensory sensations.) I think it can manage both. 9/10
