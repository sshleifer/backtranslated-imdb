I had no expectations (never seen the preview of "Mariogold") and enjoyed the character, contemporary music and sharp dance in this light-hearted movie. Although 98% of the conversations English (great thing for me), I want that subtitles can help subtitles quickly for a few moments when it might be difficult to understand the pronunciation of the character. I will not judge this movie against Bollywood movies, but it's on my own ability as a fun entertainer (a musical person). <br /> <br /> I'm in actress Ali Larter. (And Bonus Element in his interview he refers to an excellent person). I have seen this movie several times (it gets better every time).
