For the first time a director's film, it's just an extraordinary little movie, although I must admit that it's hard to see and it will probably blame the sensitivity of sensitive people for viewing, because the film has a strong position to help Suicide. However, what I liked about this movie was that the film was not as long as the film was full till half full and I still hesitated. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent introduction of the subject, I was surprised by the very professional style of film - in a small film I have ever seen some of the best paintings. Plus, this camera work was very well-matched with music and images, which made the film look beautiful. <br /> <br /> I said, this is a controversial film. I struggled with what I was thinking about this debate, but the film was directed by an educated and intelligent way, to create this film, I really have to respect that person.
