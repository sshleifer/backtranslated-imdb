I like this picture because the dialogues and sounds of Kandsey and Jacqueline are amazing. However, I did not know yet, a BATT David Marathon in TNT has seen that this film was a remake of the 1943 Bate Davis Classic, an old Old Aquinantas. Bate co-star with Mitchell Hopkins, who was in a fierce battle during the filming process, because Bate had a relationship with Mary's husband, who led him to a movie before acquiring an old identity. <br /> <br /> However, both observers spend minutes worth of expenditures. If you like the dialog and the drama much, I highly recommend this movie. It is in my opinion, a study of women's psychology and their relationship with each other.
