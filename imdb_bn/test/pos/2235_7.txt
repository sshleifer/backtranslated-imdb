Is this a good movie? No, of course not. But for jolie lovers it must be definitely. Her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scenes please her fans for the upcoming age. The current ratings are however (3.2) very low. The film can have a good story and it is not a great CF-movie, but the performance is good enough (and Jolie's performance has been mentioned before being nice and raw), the film is closed very close-U P. come. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, Van Damme was a very good choice. Most likely, Jolie lovers do not want to see sexual relations with her. This movie has all the chances of becoming a civilized movie.
