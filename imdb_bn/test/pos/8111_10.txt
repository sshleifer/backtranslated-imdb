Great Dictator is a far-flowing movie. Charlie Chaplin has been very successful both to be funny and malicious, and at the same time gives a strong statement in his rebellion against fascism. Finally, Chaplin's Nazi speech is one of the great moments of the film with its values. Throughout this film, I realized that there was some higher intelligence, in fact, out of intelligent intelligent film production.
