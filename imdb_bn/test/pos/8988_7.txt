Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> Although it is a deep flaw (and in some ways stupid), it denies constant expectation, it makes it look great for a brave swim fan. <br /> <br /> Yuppie college student Kevin and lovable frat boy friend seen his gang. As a particularly harmful teen starts as a sex comedy, we pledge to fight and fight their genital bricks, following these bouts of their antics, which are involved in other things. The new sister of Kevin's high school is brutally raped and beaten by a gang of bikes when apparently there is nothing good to do. Kevin promised to take revenge when he was dead in the hospital, his detective for the father's displeasure. <br /> <br /> So far, we've been shaping up from the last cell of the left region, from Porquis's Lights, apparently to be your typical urban vigilante vengeance. However, the screenplay of Kevin and his gang became vaguely sympathetic until they became mad. It is the credit of the movie that it does not glamorize the fascist anti-crime alphabet that Kevin constantly spouts, even though it still understands that he will think his way. <br /> <br /> The mood goes from lighthearted to very fast and frustrating, and ultimately it is so much drying and that it leaves you incredible. And this is the power of this energy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the ridiculous situation and rather the pitfish dialogue, cardboard cutouts have played badly in most cases, it will not be the top of any list of forgotten classics at any time. I got a kick out of it though, and I'm sure that someone reading it is up for it.
