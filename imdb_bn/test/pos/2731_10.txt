I just saw the film "15 Park Avenue", which was the first night film presentation of the Human Rights Film Festival of the Asia Society of New York. The subject matter of this movie has really been removed and "Mithi" is the only one word to read the comment to Chief Minister Kankona Sen Sharma, to get a copy of this gem and see it. My sincere thanks to director Aparna Sen who again did a wonderful job. It once came to a blue moon and I was lucky enough to watch this movie on the screen and took part in the North session with film discussion / question-answer post and Conkona Sen Sharma "A wonderful experience.
