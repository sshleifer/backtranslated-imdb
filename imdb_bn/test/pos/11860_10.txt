I first saw this movie at the premier party of Mr. Javart's City of Frederick. There, I laugh and smile among the director, musician and other Norwegian celebrities ... I just could not stop. If you like a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and nice acting - it's a glimpse of your watch! Combine "true romance" with "wedding singer" and add "mad about yourself"! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
