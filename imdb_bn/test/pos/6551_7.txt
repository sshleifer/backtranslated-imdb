To be honest, I will be a Japanese drama in this movie. I was wrong. This movie is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. This is the story of a city that was cursed by English or Ugly or Spiral. Residents of the cities became a little slow and became violent enough to do something with spiral, and some residents started to become realistic realities, which is actually a kind of snack among them. <br /> <br /> The movie was a giant, random, acid trip romance and drama. Like a sort ?? twisted Drama What makes this movie so annoying is that some people are obsessed with Spiral. For example: There is a garage in the grandmother which has a garage attached to the spiral of them, a girl has taken her long hair and a mad man spreads in a style like a spiral, a child gradually becomes a human graduate, a man The body can drag into the spiral shape, a woman's ears open to get a cochil Tried to spend and a teenager ran on himself so that he could surround the vehicle's tire and a child could tear himself into the wash so that he could become. A spiral <br /> <br /> This very syndicated is a very annoying aspect of atmospheric tone and style which was shot in this movie. The camera angle adds psychological and stomach stories, in other words, a very good cinematography. The overall color of these pictures makes for a slightly abstract story. The color is a mixture of green, yellow and little orange and some special effects on the sprigs are outstanding. <br /> <br /> However, like many Japanese movies, it has a domination of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. However, it is difficult to keep up with the relationship of two teenagers teens with all the spirals and weird events across the city. But, in some ways it is very irrelevant, like a second-story story that has nothing to do with the real story of the spiral covered city. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would recommend to anyone who likes this movie, and it is very different and strange foreign films. It's just enough pain and madness, it's my touch.
