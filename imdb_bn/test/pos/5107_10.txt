When it opened in London during the Christmas season of 1969, this musical version of James Hilton's famous story was sank by critics. In the United States openly welcomed the same reception, MGM withdrew its "Roadshow" status and spent almost all the songs. What is wrong After a few years, when the world itself became trending in the 60's and 70's, this version of Goodbye, MRCPPS, is also happy. After all, as "chipping", Peter O'Brien gave one of his greatest performances. A man is finally able to see the color of the world (after the fall of the musical star Catherine Brisquet and after marriage) to see a genius in the work to turn him from hated, cold, passionate Latin teacher to the boy's boarding school. (If you can, come back again for the Arabia law, Winter lion, my favorite year and a few weeks or weeks, then you will see what a really great actor O'Woole is and how great he is at CHIPS. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story fits perfectly, when Herbert Ross's instruction makes life shocking. <Br /> <br /> Well, this picture can be very romantic for some people, but do not look any further for those who love acting, singing and directing love stories. (If you have a laser disc wide screen version in your hands But better, I'm waiting for the chips debut in DVD.)
