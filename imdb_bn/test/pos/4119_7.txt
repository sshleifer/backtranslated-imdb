George Sanders is a fraud that steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing a guard in this process. Months later, one of his associates is selling book fraud for huge amounts. One fraud is sold to a man working for one Nazi. The Nazi Frontman was not happy with not being encouraged to get his money back, as well as an investigator working for another tired client. Medieval women began to play all sides against each other by trying to keep themselves safe and set up a meeting among the various parties in New York's public library, although people died, the library closed and more were killed (and probably some rare book Larceny) It seems to be Complex Hani Mystery is a great little thriller with a great casting (Sandra Richard Denning and strong supporters are joining a cast) If there is any flaws, Plot is very complex with plots and everyone is very beautiful for themselves. . The level of conspiracy during theft, fraud, murder and warfare (it was 1942) is much more than the 70-minute running time. Still, it is an enjoyable little film with the dark and the feeling of incompetence of some characters that clearly marked one of the first silent movies. Until we see Denning, we walk among some charming thieves, whom we like, probably more than the hero, but it becomes clear from the word and work, it will not be completely happy and they do not even know, even if they fight. The price to find out that is a good little film.
