About 6 months ago when I saw this movie, I think it is interesting, but more. But it stuck with me. The interest that grew up and I was surprised that my initial disappointment and reaction would actually do with the actual VHS quality instead of the film. I bought the standard DVD box set, and it turned out that I was right second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great movie. It's frustrating, and I'm sure it has succeeded in its main goal: Campaign against the Germans. <br /> <br /> This is against the movie and the most common criticism against Einstein, it's just a preacher and nothing else. It's untrue. He was an amazing film artist, who was the most important of the living. At this moment, the world is far away from Joseph Stalin as far as the industry is able to see Eisenstein's film.
