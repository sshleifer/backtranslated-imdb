I knew this book at the age of 11 and after the love, I was scared for it as a movie - if they made it a terrible mess? I do not need to worry about the event at all. Everyone was very well cast and the act was extremely awesome, it followed the story very well without the strange addition of the story, which did not add anything to me. But this is really the most beautiful love story and I am very happy that I did the video so I can see it again and again. My only glitch is - why did not they give Kestor a green westcot, which made him such a personality? It's so easy, when they get so much trouble in everything else. If you get the chance, see, it's nice.
