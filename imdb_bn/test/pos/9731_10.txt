This series is great to see a new batch of dolls made of ruins. I found this section a lot of fun In fact, it will be my second favorite of the series. This film has very little violence and has only been rated PG-13. It is notable from other R-rated doll master movies which were loaded with grave and violent glory. Although lack of violence does not reduce fun though. This series has a significant impact on the end of the series. Well
