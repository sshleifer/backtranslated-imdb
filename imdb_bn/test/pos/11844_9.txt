I grabbed this movie on the movie channel the other night and I did not laugh so hard for a long time. It was so funny that I went out and bought the next day. I love this kind of comedy. It seems so realistic how the actors react different situations here. I was a rollin. I did not even even hear about it and the title "Looking at other people" headlines just started to see. The title gives me a shot because it is and I'm glad I did I get so much trouble that it hurts. Now it's part of my collection I definitely recommend them to those who enjoy the type of comedy smart ass. I would be watching one over over.
