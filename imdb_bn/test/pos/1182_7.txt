A comedy full of smiles for fans of Jack Lemon and Walter Matthew. I think this film was made for the recipients of two gramy old men movies, because these friendly parties seem to have spotted the two of them interesting. The idea is a sure flame: Maitu, a stupid gamble of thousands of dollars of debt, who knows his helpless friend Lemon with a free cruise with whom he can meet old ladies; It is believed that they were signed as Dance Host and Mattho could not dance. <br /> <br /> Saya is a funny movie, and all Chocolate Lemon is not available and Matthau. I found Brent Spinner (best known as Star Tray: Next Generation Data), it is very ridiculous as a Shi Ball-Boosting Dance Coordinator. As the two adult actor prissy boss, he managed to match them with laughs section. Although the film is not really needed, there is a love story or two, in which Dian Canon (who looks beautiful in his years) is involved.
