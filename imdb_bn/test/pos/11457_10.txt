I think in my mind that this movie was seen as a child and I was completely horrified, I could not take my eyes off the television. This movie has all it's for awesome fans! This movie was not at all a fun moment, by Stuig (who was my favorite character in the film), a few lines from Liner thought that Kevin Tenny had directed this jewelery and did a wonderful job with low budget, I thought the last thing could be the only thing that could stop them to stay the night. Suddenly the killing machine! The effects made by Steve Johnson are fantastic, I would recommend this movie for love for the worst budget films because the old says that they do not make it this way anymore. The cakes were very good, but the original is not as good as well. It must be a horrible collection, but if you find it, do not be frustrated
