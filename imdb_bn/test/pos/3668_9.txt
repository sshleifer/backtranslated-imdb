Impossible love is surprisingly entertaining. Although the plot is closed on most orders, it is made for an excessive film, but it never fails in brightness and spontaneity. Shilali offers Valentine's warmly memorable platlines, lots of smiles, laughter, knowledge and softness. It should not be done at all, and sometimes it obstructs along with it, but forgive her inconsistencies, sit back and have a good time. This is a charming!
