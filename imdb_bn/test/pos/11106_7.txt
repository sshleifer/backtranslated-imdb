On the last night of BBC 1, I had to go to bed, but the contemporary set was in Curiosity Pix in Irish film, so I waited for a few minutes and then stayed there. I acknowledge that the main attraction was the only English actress, Kelly Riley, who wanted to see. <br /> <br /> It is billed as a black comedy, the hardest thing to draw. . It should be a perfect mix of horror and horrible sunshine so that you do not know why laughing at the end - the best example for me after Martin Scorsese (1985). The bodies are more black than comedians, but the conspiracy becomes more dynamic and becomes even more black. I did not spot the final twists in the story as some other poster here, so I was appropriately surprised. <br /> <br /> As in snapshots of the Irish film industry, it all seems rather worthwhile; It does not look like it was too expensive to build, so it had the opportunity to refund it. The script was quite sharp but the act was very good. I'm happy, I saw it, errors and all, I do not think today I learned a lot about Ireland, especially their police system!
