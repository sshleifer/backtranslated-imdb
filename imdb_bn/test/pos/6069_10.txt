I chose "English Patient" for the extra credit of history. I think this movie will be incredibly annoying. Instead, it has turned into my favorite one. It accurately represents life in WWII and the story of love is amazing. The story of love has made so many incredible movies. I felt this interesting feeling of feeling or something. This is what I want to see again over the movie. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors and the amazing way they play their characters. Together with the wonderful look and love actually began to be. I recommend this movie for retirement or for any assignment to find a movie.
