I do not like anime cartoon (such as Pokemon, Dragon Z Z, Naruto), but Zach Bell is different in my opinion. Zach Bell has more exciting, better characters, and does not focus on a kind of surgery or momodo as much as I have seen, such as Episodes "Big Brother Canch", "Zach vs Kimo". Zach Bell really focuses on the life of miracle jac, The Smart Kyo, The Cleveless Suzie, and Wyedd Pogin. Jach Bale is probably Faw Cartoon for me now, but I encourage others to see one of these episodes, you probably like it! <br /> <br /> - Robbie H. Vectorman)
