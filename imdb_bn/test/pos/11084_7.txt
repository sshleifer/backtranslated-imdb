I'm not a fan of San Pen, but as opposed to my German colleague, whose review is being seen here, I think that he has acted perfectly as a neurotic, addictive character in this movie. He had a similar taste at every "perfect chemistry" of those who perfected perfect and reminded me of many memories. 10-15 years ago I saw this movie, but it was the only part of the time that I was writing uncertainly in my mind. I do not say too often, but in this case I will: Bravo, Shan Pen! For the story line, well, this is actually based, and thus, it is a tragedy that the enemy will sell the secret of their country. Again, Pen shows you what you can do if you disagree with the administration. Use the given freedom for blood; Do not break the law.
