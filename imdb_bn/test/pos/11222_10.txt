I've recently joined Sundance because I've often worked with the past and were treated with little joy in the little Indies, shining dark comedy and predictable images of illness. But then I saw Mark and Michael 'Northfork' from Polish and I think why I love so much in the first movies. 'NorthFork' became daring to dream of dreaming across the screen and came back to the original primary work of Terrence's owner and Antoninio's existing natural scenes. It is a simple film that is one of its many strengths. It is enough to tell an adult fairy tale with lots of meaning carefully level level. It revives my imagination and I see this year a whole printed shadow on all the other films. It is not seen in most American films, delicate impressive and stylish writing. In my neighborhood theater, I plan to revisit this movie several times. It is a beguiling piece of magic and mystery, a hunting act where angels can find and rotate the plain of Montana into the nature of heaven and earth. The cast fosters this illumination piece especially with James Woods and Nick Nolt, who reminds the nervous and courageous people who appear throughout our career. Perhaps 'NorthFork' will help us find new waves of American movies, where art and industry excellence will be more ideal than the exception. When it comes to your way and brings your friends to the questions, you will see many and your anxiety and feelings will be encouraged by seeing the 'northfork', and once you see your past, the memories of a great movie awake and now it is expected that its coming back with Polish Bros.
