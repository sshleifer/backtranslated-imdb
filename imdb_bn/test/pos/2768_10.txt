This movie is very good and the whole family will enjoy watching it. When Susi falls in love with her big night, she is drunk and dies in a fierce car crash in the way she gets promoted by high children. Susie's house is sold and a family goes to her who loves her. Now the boy who lives in the house can see Susie and the only one who can. The two teams try to save their little sister together and save Susie's parents. Being broken. Amy Joe Johnson to be named as Susie's question. This movie will fall into your heart with comedy, sadness and laughter. I hope you will see this movie because it is very good. However, it does not seem to have a DVD or VA and it does not exist. And does not come on TV.
