I am sure that all Canadian Canadian content of IMDB is very familiar, and how much of it ... Well, we will say, unthinkable. There are some Canadian shows that are actually worth seeing, but it must be one of them. <br /> <br /> Available. With some guidelines and rules, add some malicious and clever commentary to two of the surprisingly recognized spontaneous "alpha male" groups, and you have some of your own entertaining programming. Each episode is difficult. If "players" are sub-par, there are some annoying moments and they have some modest fun. If "players" are good, then it leads to a moment that should stand in front of you and be appreciated and some charming praise is enjoyed by them. <br /> <br /> The courtyard is frustrating, I know, and people who are generally proud that I have raised myself from a simple, terrible reality television, this event is actually fun and enjoyable. I have a lot to accept. <br /> <br /> One thing is that trick networks should indicate how this show has done an awesome job of marketing. For a long time, I did not even know the court, and what I knew was that there was a shirtless man who "loved Cooper". However, after actually watching the show, I was surprised to wonder how the Canadian content looks amazing (despite a beautiful order opening credit sequence). So give it a chance. I still could not find any target demographic (18-30 year old male) who actually saw the show (and not just boring commercial) who did not like it. <br /> <br /> Get it back for the third season, the comedy network. This is actually a good compound, because you have encountered some other Canadian shots (cough * girls' girls * cough). I usually save 10/10 ratings for "work of art", but I found it very fun to see this show and I think that many of my rights have been judged, which I had to do.
