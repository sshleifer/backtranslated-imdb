Well, I said, I had the chance to see this event in Philadelphia, sometimes on 06 June of Ph. And I really like it. My favorite favorite Madonna was the 1990 era of the Bloode ambition tour. This is not to me "Madona" Now she is the mother of 3 mother She needs to make some changes to her motherhood. And I totally agree. This is a classic Madonna concert. I want to "live to know" not edited. We have seen that the body is falling from the building. At 911, we can see a woman in a cross ... in any way I'm waiting for the release of this tour on DVD and I hope it is full show and with a bunch of bonus footage. It's an artist all the time. From there to the best ... and still going to the top and strong. Madonna long!
