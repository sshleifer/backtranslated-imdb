This movie has been shown to be great because of how well cartoons are displayed in 80 times, the animators were not as idle as today, the cartoon has so much detail with the little resources they have with us today. If more people request these cartoons to revolt then perhaps 80 cartoons will be shown on television again, so to finish my sentence I just want to say that this is a cartoon that I grew up and really want it to be on TV again.
