If Walter Huston gives a lot of copper type, Zeus Dashin has a debt of gratitude, who was before his time and was greatly troubled by his blacklisting, when Edward Demitr was accused of being a communist. The end of his American career was the last word of Mr Dasin, but moving to Europe proved that he contributed to the death of his huolivid was even greater. <br /> <br /> "Riffey" Thanks to an elegant Mr. Dasin's approach, all of the rights material comes together. She decided to adapt to LeBreton's novel August because she saw the possibility of making it a mere film that became an instant classic. In Paris, when Zeus Dasin was going to serve as the city's background, he discovered. Roads are always wet due to bad weather and there should not be much to show them on the street. <br /> <br /> When we first met Tony, he was playing the card. Tony looks bad health; He is always coughing and sweating profusely. After losing all his money, he went to Sweden's Joe, Sweden, who told him about the possibility of robbery of the fancy jewelry store and the web in a Tony department in Paris. They pass the idea through Mario, who is an expert, advised by the safe cracker Cesar, Milanese. <br /> <br /> Tony, who recently came out of prison, came to know that Mado, his former lover, now owns a night club with Gitter, Instead of fighting with the mat, instead of love, he thinks that he insulted and the meetings ended and he threw him out of his place. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the day comes, the gang is able to reach the second floor of the apartment building, there is no love for Tony on the top right. Jewelery store, owner's life, but he is away Everything goes well and gets away with gang jewels. Caesar, Milnejes, took a ring as a souvenir of a common woman, who turned around and gave chansus to the Knight Club in Grover. This tactic mistake is the inspiration of the excellent thinking plan that Spark has developed. <br /> <br /> Gene Surrey has created an excellent Tony. He showed a tired person who probably did the last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and director Jules Dasin, Joey, Mario and Caesar, are seen as quartz jewelry thieves. Marie Saborite playing Mado. Marcel Lupovci plays Grutter with a low quality intensity. Robert Hussain, who will later go straight to the movies, produces an impression with Remi√©, one of the gramater's. <br /> <br /> The film's best asset, Phillip Agagostini's great camera work, which kept the atmosphere Paris and locals work from these criminals. George Erick's music plays well with the film. Zeiss Dasin was extraordinary in his choice of films, and, unfortunately, it was our loss because this person was originally a genius with "nude city", "night and city" and "rififf".
