After more than a decade I saw the bandit queen through a lot of controversy in India. It may be more frustrating at the time to become more familiar with fantasy films in Indian cinema, by language, star-care and natural acting (by relatively unknown cast of that time). Film, Cast, and Shekhar Kapoor, are eligible for this effort. <br /> <br /> This plot is not different from a common revenge drama made in India in various forms. In fact, this particular story itself has several legendary accounts. Why it is standing is that it is supposed to be the first person account of a person who actually went through all this, and there are so many things not found on the screen, and survived the story. At least enough alive to see her story in a movie. After the release of prison in 1994, Phulan Devi did not live much longer. <br /> <br /> The picture has increased in numbers. Cinematography bright. Music is appropriate. Cast, many of whom later became more familiar names, very good. But the screen is patchy. Things move very quickly and in shim at times. Although it is worth understanding, because there are so many strands that need to be combined to combine it. Or maybe I thought that I read Mala Sen's book, which is more detailed and better, though not visible at all, accounts of Phoolan Devi's travels, and which is considered as one of the main sources of film. <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some practical ambiguities. According to Phulan Devi, he was not present during the Bihmai massacre, and despite claiming himself as a fixed account by Phulan, he witnessed taking part and actually started genocide. Then, the final surrender of Phulan surrendered him to the Chief Minister's position, but in reality he surrendered to Mahatma Gandhi's portrait. The symbolic value is not only, but shows that living in Phulan, do not want to show the slavery of ordinary person. Chief Minister was happy to conform to Arjun Singh, who was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 80 years ago, the final Masta was best known for the film - Mr India.
