I like this movie because it is a good method of Buddhism, for example, how Buddhists use all living things in a care, mixes in some fancy and realistic situations; In some parts photography is very good and many messages about freedom, such as Haq episode, always concentrating at every moment even at the difficult moment. It's a fun situation like Swan's birthday and both of the academy awards, his performance shows us how people living in such culture are trying to behave in the way of Miyagi taking him to Buddhist temple, and how, gradually, changes his mind. And, of course, Pat Murita has always been great
