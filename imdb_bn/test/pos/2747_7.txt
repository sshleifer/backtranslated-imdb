Many of the previous comments are accurate, but some, well, not much. It's rarely 'B' movie ... It's well-produced, live streaming sequences are really fantastic, and the first rate of model sequence This is not "cheap". <br /> <br /> Ricard Barthelems is pretty good at this, and it makes an excellent companion piece for "Only Angels Wings". <br /> <br /> If you want to spot John Wayne, spot J. Carroll is the first to be destroyed, they end up together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It makes its character even less credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Grand Central Airport" will fit very nicely in "Hi and The Mighty" ... just Regis Tumi ... and a Imagine 1955 Buick.
