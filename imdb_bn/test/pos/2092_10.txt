I would not go to roughly 9 souls to be honest, even after hip recited on the pillar of praise, I wondered after that, suddenly I completely blown away. <Br /> <br /> The original plot is as simple as it is, not in real, but in search of fraud hidden in the tenth gaile for the escape of several murderers from a prison inmate of nine inmates and a secret secret search. The prisoners were trapped in prison and soon they were dragged by the guards before fleeing them, but director Tashihaki Toyoda took this simple story, which is so brilliant and completely full of drama, comedy and violence, which is actually not seen in Asian cinema fans but ordinary movies. <br /> <br /> Actually acting, emotionally, funny, fierce and sometimes very real this is all there is a movie.
