Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004) takes a small cautious approach towards the end of a well-crafted film that needs to be careful to enjoy. From reverse natural scenes, to live close to the protagonist close to the world, we enter the director and we are regulated from the moment of access to the hotel. We, like the hero, will not run away from his criminal, the terrible intensity of the mafia world and the inconsistent unity. The film prevents the mafia stereotype when reveling in them makes it all more successful. Concrete burial, inevitable brutal execution and overwhelming maleness are bare and exposed for what they do. Just clutches and business, and more. Life is a part of corporate life, not about organized crime and love or living for self, family or others. Our hero was indeed a hero, that he had left his life for touching the beautiful Barmaiyas, to solve the pain of the hotel's only neighbors and to escape from prison for his decoration. The consequences of love are actually beautiful and brutal at the same time. See it !!
