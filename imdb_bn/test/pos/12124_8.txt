First of all I say that it is probably one of the 10 most underground movies I think. It came in 72. I absolutely love this movie, it's very urban, diverse, no real Hollywood glam added. You actually feel here for all the characters, I love lots of blood here only splattering. Joe Pesci was quite good here, but I think he was outdone by the original character Joe Cortese, now I do not know anything about him, but the son can really work. I believe this movie is probably true because New Jersey lives, Filly lived around, you are here to do this kind of thing all the time. I think if the movie is in a big budget and Robert Deenro is called as a boss, you will have a perfect movie, but hey, I'm going to argue, I was so mad by this movie that I remember it, with St. Road. I want to go back to the great exhibition of this urban, filmmaking of Hollywood: it will be served very well for them. This movie is a great drama with great actors. And I highly recommend it to anyone
