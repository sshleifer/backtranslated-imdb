The movie was surprisingly surprising, especially considering the last episode. The third was dark, and semi-interesting but it was not nearly as fun or enjoyable. It is filled with Marla Stewart, the anatomy of dolls, comedic lines about masturbation, and it has been effectively effective during the times of great and annoying images. The film was not awesome or suspicious and I'm sure it was not a direct motive. It was fun because, Jennifer Tilly tops and sexy performance. The doll's doll was very well operated, movement of the face, lips, tears in the eye, chest knife, and dresses. Dolls were just wonderful and made terrible death more enoyable considering that it is done by a great cat. The look of the new shoe was great and Tiffany was very tricky. Hugging a few scenes with Tiffany people tiffany even smile my dad. Jesse and Z were wonderful - very interesting and special effects were cool. The ending was so uncertain and they could make others better, which is fairly unlikely. It might not be as suspicious as the movie like the Halloween H2O or the Urban Legend, but it's certainly more fun !!!!
