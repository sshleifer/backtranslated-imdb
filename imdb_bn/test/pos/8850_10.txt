John Carpenter's "Things" is one of the most awesome films ever made. Sadly, with most cartridge films, it is one of the most underworldly films directed by critics, which are very soon after it's released almost annoying. It seems that people were frustrated with the idea of ​​"good" tribes at that time. An idea arising after "IT" success. And very thought that a film dealing with the aliens could be deviated from the idea is considered heresy. Human ignorance is really terrible thing, people do not want what they want, they need to judge films. <br /> <br /> "Thing" itself is an interesting study of human pano. The American Antarctic base enables an alien presence (only included in the "item" film), to imitate any form of life. We do not know who can or may not be animals, each character responds to the situation. No mass violence or panic is slow and gradually descendants of unrest, not as many people become ... Most people are not. <br /> <br /> <br /> Carbenter has succeeded in making this film even better. Compared to your average sci-fi / horror No "what's behind you?" Jumping at the moment Without any thanks to the effect of Rob Botine's impressive creatures, depending on some of the beautiful balanced moments of visual terrorism and the intense atmosphere of pre-mysterious depression, he gave us an experience that did not match many other horror movies. <br /> <br /> Instead of throwing elements and plot elements from our mouth, the carpenter offers us a much more slowly and subtle approach. By understanding the feeling of mystery, the audience gives enough freedom to understand what has happened in certain scenes, giving enough plots to those who do not like it very much to explain in movies <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > Mikrion's score works in all ways. It's easy and sad words perfectly fits the overall tone of the movie. Although I am always wondering how the carpenter (he has been known to compose his film OSTs in addition to him) has been done? Thanks to the special performance of characters yet, until the development is deeply developed, especially Kurt Russell, who is a "down-out" indifferent helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady How to convert through its character movies is worth its worth. At the beginning of the "do not start" attitude from his ignorant, "thing" as a leader and leader of the group of men trying to fight. But as it has been said here, there is no false heroism, there is no "smile face to face" and there is certainly no humorous relief, the film maintains its environment from the first scene to the last scene. . It is not saying that here again the carpenter keeps his tradition of making a strong end. <br /> <br /> One-fourth quarter of the Liberation War does not feel the "things" date. With increasingly annoying use of computer-generated effects, it seems to be more powerful because it is not a work of life and a dedication to computers. It gives a lot more reason for analyzing its open-ended viewers to see it as a second or third or fourth or ... time. An excellent piece of terrorism that will never be forgotten.
