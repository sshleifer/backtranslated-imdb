A disgusting watch, but one of Bergman's best movies. It is interesting to compare it with The Hour of the Hour, because both of the same artists (or an artist and his wife) have been anointed on the same island. In the previous movie it is mainly the inner monster that can break Von Sedo's personality (at least how do I read it), though it's a lot of situation outside its control here. <br /> <br /> A lot of characters have been written about the disrespectful center, especially Von Sydow. For me, there is a good (flawed) guy's flash at the beginning of the movie, but which is dangerously difficult to deal with. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many in the same position. And then there is a dream sequence ...
