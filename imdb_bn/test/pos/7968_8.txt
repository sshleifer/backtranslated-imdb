Once you are sitting to watch the movie "The Canon for Cordoba", you feel that it's going to be a great one. Because? This movie started with an enthusiastic score from the protective composer Elmer Bernstein, who gave us a memorable theme as 'The Great Account and the Magnificent Seven'. In fact, when you read the title of the title of the custom title, none other than George Paper is like a Captain Rod Douglas, you know that it has an action and there are a lot of it. Additionally you actor John Russell General John J. Watching Parsing, you know that you are for a heroic saga. The story is derived from the history of the Mexican Revolution, and in the early 1900s, the US involved in the conflict in the border city with Mexican bandits crossing the Rio Grande. Among the most cruel leaders in the rebel General Cordova (Raf Vallone) With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacked Parsing, killed his people, and stole some valuable artillery pieces. Since the US military can not legally enter Mexico, Captain Douglas is sent to the Suicide Mission, without the help and without any assistance for parsing. His mission was to rescue the gun, destroy a rebel fortress and bring Cordova alive back. By selecting the most harsh, hard, most experienced, most of the most obscene men, Douglas enters Mexico and attacks almost impossible fortresses. Following dramatic action, as a lot of explosive tension. If someone asks for criticism, I will say heavy heavy choices. Vallone and John Larch are not very annoying. Not so with those of Peppard as well. Pet Duel and Don Gordon (Fantastic K) However, this movie is recommended to look good. ****
