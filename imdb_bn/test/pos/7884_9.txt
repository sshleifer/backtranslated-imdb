About 4 years ago I saw this movie, even though I started to comment on IMDB, I have decided to review it now, which was already unusual for me, since I have reviewed some times before I often see it. Can i say Well, the best performance is like the character of late Peter Boyle, who asked for a person's narcotics to kill the killers of his daughter, though she is a Madison Avenue executive who has nothing to do with her very low-class conservative Joe. Actually, Joe has lots of fun scenes while commenting on smart Alexi in this guy's party. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress who is seeing the girl that after overdosing on any girls disappears from the hospital after searching, there is no other than Susan Saran! It was a great hard-hitting movie during the time of creation (mostly in the '60s, early in' 70s) and the scriptor Norman Wexler (later Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avilden (later save tiger, rocky, and karate children). Of course, in these last years, a wallpaper pack is ultimately up to the end! That's peculiar for counterculture over time that highly recommend for anyone. Recently, one of the cultural artifacts described here is a raggie anne puppet, a box of rage crackers, a hinch ketchup bottle and unique for an era, a nixon poster asks, "Would you buy a car used by this man?"
