This film is undoubtedly one of the best landmarks in cinema history. Seeing this picture, we can only see archaeologically that in the 1950s there was a completely human drama of world film, such as a strong and adequate use of sound-film montage, and almost religious praise of the moral choices of human life. The movie was not the only form of art. It was much more than ordinary life, and as a result, many people hoped to live after a tragic war. It is said that even Picasso was removed and screamed that such a work of art would be seen once in 100 years! The audience was different at that time. I read that after the first publication of Kurosawa's "Ekiru (Live)", the young couple quietly told each other, "This is a good movie, is not it?" I think, contemporary movies, although technically new dramatic perspectives have been created and opened, the reliability of the audience has lost the most important. Sienma is actually one of the most popular art and modern fine art and contrary to contemporary music, millions of people are hopeful and ideal. From this perspective, "Lathe zhuravli" will certainly be in the pantheon of the classics all the time, as "City of Light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
