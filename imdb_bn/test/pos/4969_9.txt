I have been around 50 years watching "Jennifer" for the first and only time. I do not know the name of this movie until I look at it on this web site, but how many people (especially my grandchildren) say movies to include graphic details to keep you frightened and strong. The story skillfully presents you with ideas that really keep Ed Lupino very dangerous. When Miss Lupino invents a new "truth", then he attracts the viewer with his confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This movie has such an impact on me that even after almost 50 years I still listed it as the most scary movie that I have ever seen. Still, there is no blood and grave in this movie which has become very popular after this film. It's a good story and great actors can impress what's dominant.
