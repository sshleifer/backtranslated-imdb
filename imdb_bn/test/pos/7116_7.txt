The Hack of Dracula works on the same basic premises as the Frankenstein House since the same year; Universal three famous monsters; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man are appearing in the movie together. Naturally, the film is rather rather dirty, but enough to make sure that these three monsters are not usually becoming annoying for 60 minutes of this movie. It is clear that the idea of ​​creating another giant torch came to the author's head before the actual plot, as we provided yarn without the hole. Plot saw Count Dracula. Edelman arrived at home and requested for his treatment of vampiriseries. Then, just about anything can be described, look at the Lawrence tabbut, AKA Wolf Man asked for his grief! It proves that Dracula is in the guard of Adelman's daughter, but Talabot is really serious. When it turns out that she can not be prevented from escaping from the wolf, then Wolf Man puts himself in the sea ... where he searches for Frankenstein's comments. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is as good as' Frankenstein's previous house. The 1944 film has made its plot better than the series's entry, because the plot does not give equal time to every universal giant. Dracula's plot is the first largest, but soon the resurrection only fizzles only. Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never develops, and this is just another version of the plot that he has always found within himself. Franklin's comments are given by the coldest hand, just as he is only seen as a title in the film, and a clear excuse for sure that it appears in a three monster movie. Together with the three, the story of the doctor is the most interesting, but it is a cause of disappointment, why not people see this movie. Actor is good enough, John Carradine shows his horrific aspects and again ensures Lone Chaney Jr. that his character is lost in tragedy. Glenn Strange has nothing to do, and Onoslaw Stevens said. Edelman proved to be a real highlight. After all, this film will not do much for anyone who is not a universal fanatic; But go as a stupid giant movie, Dracula's house is valuable to see.
