I've never seen the best cinematography ?? Considering the year of making the film, I was completely amazed and completely impressed with the amount of attention that was given in the scene and what it really looked like. Although I do not specifically buff a Western movie ?? Every single scene has been given a lot of detail, and it's hunting. There is a sincere connection with nature. Occasionally I am amazed at the amount of temporary work done through the scenes, but I will never be bored. I think I'm really peering on a time machine and looking back to the old west. I recommend this movie to anyone who is studying for set design, location planning, and general subject photography. For an experience with this view of the digital touch-up, it can be a humble film that we now feel.
