This is probably the most horrific and annoying from all the Vietnam War movies, and it's really telling many things about the spectacular issue that has come out. It's this freakish to remember it. The movie is so chaotic that it scares you. It does not show much different things than other Vietnam War movies. What is such a high level push? <br /> <br /> The instructions here were spectacular. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his last epic film. Unlike other directors, he makes you think as you fight. Most others just show up and show you the fear of war. Though Coppola makes you confused, frustrated and scared. These feelings of war are usually called from one of our movies or stories. This is one of the things that I have had a very short period of time while watching a movie. The writing was definitely amazing. It brought you to enter the middle of the movie. It does not disturb me and this movie is about three hours. Cinematography goes hand-in-hand, which adds much to the fear of seeing this movie, which shows all the chaos around you. <br /> <br /> The acting was bone-dry. Just Marlon Brando is playing his miserable role in the terrible Colonel with his last great performance. Whenever I think of a crazy gone soldier, I think Malone Brando is now on Apocalypse. Brando N. You do not want to see his eyes with this image. She was lazy because she liked the movie. To me, it is a memorable act that he gave as the godfather. Martin Shane gave a very strong performance and probably saw the best one of his career, seeing what he saw in his eyes, and still want to achieve his goal. It is amazing why these two were not nominated for the Oscars. Robert Duval has been able to show part of the frenzy with his playful fighting tactics, who are telling the enemy that they are coming to talk about them. Also, the character of Duval was asking a soldier to surf in the middle of the war, it was just frustrating but believable. Another great supporter performance was provided by a young Lawrence Fishbarn, Sam Bottoms and Frederick Forrest, who all narrowed the attitude of many soldiers at that time. Together with Dennis Hooper and Harrison Ford, I used to have a good kaymoke together for love. <br /> <br /> I must definitely recommend this movie to the people. It has a message and it involves everyone involved in their best. I can not ask for more of this movie with its great acting, direction, writing, cinematography and great completion. See and you will see why it remains apocalpyse title now.
