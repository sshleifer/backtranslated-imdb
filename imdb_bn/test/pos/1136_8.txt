When I first heard about "Greek", I thought I would see it because it seemed ridiculous. The ABC family is one of the worst-to-the-best shows But by tune with a friend from the college, we enjoyed the pilot episode, much more than expected. <br /> <br /> As a member of Greek society, I can say that many stereotypes are brought here that almost every time people start talking about sororities and fraternities on the campus. And only play with own is very fun, let alone to watch on a TV screen. The opening scene has become somewhat similar to the only small-dramatic version of the traditional ray preparation and it continues from it. <br /> <br /> This is not a show for highly sensitive Greeks. If you are even jokes about anything extraordinary about Greek life, even if you are unhappy, you would be the first episode and perhaps many other cringing and screaming. But everyone else will have a ton of fun fun to watch it. It's nothing new, but it never comes to college.
