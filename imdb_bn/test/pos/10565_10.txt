How nice! Where to start <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (I can never read seriously), But the book is as effective as the movie! Or will I say this book is as effective as the book? I just love this story !!!!! However, I've been watching this three-hour long movie (2 parts series, TV / 3-part series of DVDs) for almost a year and a half. It's not that easy to look attractive ... BOY I was so wrong! <br /> <br /> I immediately submerged the rich and suspicious plot ... completely submerged! Just like the book, you can not stop watching / reading. It attracts your attention for the whole 3 hours ... and when it ends ... you do not want to do it. <br /> <br /> The story flows so nicely and you will think that the time is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > The parts I love most are the subtle face expression and sight / eye contact between the two letters. You really feel their desire to each other and yet they can not work on it ..... until they certainly <br /> <br /> I can say that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, of course, a real unexpected love story in the heart of the movie, but it certainly is not about movies. This story makes me so unique and playful for me. I've read or heard something like this. Sarah Waters Pure Genius! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My hands ran out to my bed, with every wonderful plot twist and I even screamed many times ("Oh my God, no way! What happened it does not happen!") ... I never do that! <Br> <br /> The negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I want to add more from the book. But obviously the time of adaptation may be limited, I could not add what they liked. Even though it is terrible ... I think now I'm not only cruelly selfish ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> Looks like it took 20 minutes. However, you only see the movie and keep all the important bits without choosing to read the book which you will be satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> Actors are just superhero! Even the brilliant! Sally Hawkins (Mama) and Yale Cassidy (Mood) Steve your television set up so well that the screen chemistry is so cool Just electric! Emotions ... frustration ... everyone who experiences the struggle, is unexpectedly expressed by these wonderful talented actors. Such bad guys play Rupert Evans Gentleman. I was finding myself while coming to the screen, but I love it because she is very appealing and since you want to shake her neck however, charming despite it. Emelda Staunton gives another fantastic performance as Mrs. Sucksby. He is such a warm acting actress who can not help you but loves him ... even when he plays the character, he is still not happy. Cast everyone else was perfect! They were really just as good as the characters represent and I imagine them after reading the book. <br /> <br /> It must be seen for a film buff! Indeed, anyone and everyone will see this movie and read the book! Chances are you will not be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars from me! I only have four other films given the same rating. It is very rare for me that in fact I enjoy a film so that I give it 10/10. This is one of those movies Fingersmith is a really excellent composition!
