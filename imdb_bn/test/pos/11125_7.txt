This movie is well done, but it seems to me occasionally very few. It will certainly see as the show shows the ongoing agreement for workers to make this a struggle for anyone considering the trade. The soundtrack was definitely calm and acting and dancing nicely praised. Some of the student's attitude was somewhat like Larayes, because I was sure that someone kicked immediately to refuse to read and if it was a real high school for performing arts. Cacao screen test With weak stomach there is hard for anyone to keep an eye on, please take care of me. Although it is very ridiculous I know what is happening is true, so in this case the film is correct. Overall, it is entertaining and in most parts stretches a lot but it quickly goes away. <br /> <br /> The final group: <br /> <br />: It seems to have been omitted. <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: I do not want to see anything again. <br /> <br /> Rent: Rent at least once in your life!
