Riffey (Jules Dasin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> I think Jules Dasin's classic rififf in 1955 seems to be a very risky idea to try a Hollywood-remake. In 2007, it was planned to be released, Al Pacino apparently took the lead, playing Tony Le Stefanos. Risky business ... how do they stop it? Ironically, Desin was blacklisted in Hollywood and went ahead to try his luck in France and created this little masterpiece, which is called "all caper's grandddady- and heist movies". In my opinion, this is a kind of classic, which is one of the most memorable endings in the film, which is beautifully illustrated. Any opinion of the film. <br /> <br /> In the last few years, the rifai has become dangerously dangerous. Nevertheless, this French should not be forgotten silent-classic. Take a look, before the remake goes out, there are some ammunition to compare two. <br /> <br /> Camera Asphuara --- 9/10
