The world's largest online 2016 survey of the top 100 favorite animated television series, directed by TV Asahi, has kept the series in fourth place. That tells everything you need to know. So go and see it.) I will not comment on the story because I do not want to destroy anything. After I saw only the first episode you requested to keep watching. Animation is really good and above average on TV. Good thing about this series, there are some new things to the end. I do not mean groundbreaking it but still it offers a new concept and desired letter. <br /> <br /> and the movie will be the best thing coming soon.
