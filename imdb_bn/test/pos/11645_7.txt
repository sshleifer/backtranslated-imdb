Before watching this movie, I propose that viewers will be treated equal to the expectations of any of the criminals expected of the crime. There have been many movies about the victims of crime. About this one killer. <br /> <br /> Finding realism in the simplicity of "Dead Man Walking" story: There is no cracking lawyer to change William Poncelett and any dramatic story. The film does not try to keep him in good light; He is guilty, he is responsible for repugnant, a racist, and serious murder. Given all of this, we are asked to do some hard work: see him as a man despite his crimes. In this way, the film challenges the idea that death sentence "justice" provides. If you are questioning whether the death penalty is against or not, the film can find the freedom of the film, the inequality of the judicial system and the suitability of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Both Susan Sarandan have great acting and Shan Pen. In particular, the last moment of the film shows the true depth of the power of the pen.
