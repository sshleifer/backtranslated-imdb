I'm looking forward to watching this movie since catching the first trailer, and now I am very happy with it. It's really a wonderful film. Actor spanking, fresh and real writing, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James MacAye like this, and in December this movie can not wait to see "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrub". Romola Garai is very surprising. I'd like to test him in my favorite two films, "I Capture The Castle" or "Nicolas Nichlaly". Overall, I think I liked this movie because it was not out of chickens. It's a difficult thing to tell a story about, in which you can disassemble or engage a lot of people and make it some extra-sensitive-sweet-sweet love festival. But they have completely avoided it and instead created a movie that is true, honest, and touching, yes, but sometimes not at the top. Have done very well. Amazing work well Go out and see it, and you just say what I would say.
