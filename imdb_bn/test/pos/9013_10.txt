Original movie lovers can really love this show, if they just stop the complaint all the time. <br /> <br /> The emperor's new school has brought some old jokes from the film, such as the legend to drag the lever to Ijma Lab and Kujko. But as it is a kids show, it's just classic and in their proper place. Although the style is a lot easier, the animation and the characters keep their personality very good and it really makes me wonder. Arthie Kuit Eugma and J. P. Playing a nice voice for the manx, instead of David Spade, did an excellent job for Kujorko's voice, who played Kujko in the film. The Great Plot, Sunny Moments and Kuzco's amazing appearance makes this show worth the price. (Just stop complaining about everything!)
