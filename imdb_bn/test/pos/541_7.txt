I was influenced by this movie because of the drama and scriptful message of this movie. Susan Sarandan plays a flight, unreasonable and dictatorial clay, who has constantly asked her daughter to gather the message. He removed his daughter from a helpless but loving family in Indiana to continue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The girl is suspicious, but she does not have any choice - the bonding with the clay is rock solidly strong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The feet on the ground He is walking on a hill to his mother who is a beautiful, seductive person who likes 'M and Place'. He sees that mother does not get it. So how can he see his mother for guidance? <br /> <br /> The mother tries the girl in a play and sees that the girl works part of the soil in such a way that a sad painful mirror fly-by-night mother is captured. It has become a cause of frustrating times and the girl is afraid of the effects of the mother and asks for forgiveness, but retains the text. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And finally the girl is persuaded to go. It is a sensitive scene and a valuable lesson, which parents are emotionally dependent, should let the child be released and be a separate person.
