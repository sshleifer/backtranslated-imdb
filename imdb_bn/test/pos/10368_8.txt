Although I definitely read this specific Agathie Christie book sometime, but I did not remember anything about it except the name "Abnithi". Which is a good thing, because soon after knowing this story or how it will work, Agaga allows Christie's perfect junkie to be more appreciated: The way she misleads you and then opens the hole below your feet, the main reason is her success and For timelessness In addition to his story, the excellent production value, beautiful location, wonderful music, top congratulatory acting, elegant instruction etc. are the reasons for success and uninterrupted series - and these qualities "after the funeral". A word of advice: Be careful from the beginning - even in open sequences, the signal has decreased throughout the place! There are also several correct moments, in contrast to the peacefully shown English-rural location, and some small touch of laughter. Must be a mystery buffs, and generally a very good film. (***)
