Do not give 5.9 ratings (like this writing on 12-8-02) Make you fooled, this is a nice movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how much rating it has received so hard to consider. At all levels. Direction, acting, cinematography - all good. The story is interesting and original and my ratings are the only reason why this rating can be understood, it is true that this is probably the type of movie that the viewers usually do not see. <br /> <br /> I am playing it modern rock for an 80 year old. You can be young, raise it and love it, but he or she is not as a product of another time and taste - do not care about it. <br /> <br /> If you want you can manage movies and manage films based on genuine people, including stupid actions, extraordinary budgeting and medieval talent, try this next time you see it. <br /> <br />
