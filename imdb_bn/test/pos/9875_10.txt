Wow, "Curse of Michael Mayers" is a great movie. Suspenseful, entertaining, creative and I am a clever plot that Many hate the idea of ​​'Thorn', I love it. I think it gives some plot to the Halloween series. Marianne Hagen is an extraordinary actress, and especially for her first film, and Paul Rudd and Donald Plus have done a great role. My only complaint is why did not Jimmy like Daniel Harris in this film? He wanted to return, but the producers did not say. I thought j Who Brandy was great, but I love Daniel Harris. Still, I love Halloween: The Curse of Michael Maywers. I think Shep's mask is the best look of this film and George P. Wilbur's best-ever Michael Mayer Incredibly obscure and suspenseful, the rules of Halloween 6! <br /> <br /> I enjoy this very scary, but extremely enjoyable movie. Halloween horror series - up to the best of the generals. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
