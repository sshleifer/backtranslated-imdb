When I was hiring a DVD, I heard the first day and I was interested in being a member of the LDS Church. I found this picture very hearty and in some cases it is crying to me. The reason is that many years ago I knew a young man who had played on Harry (played by Steve Sandhus) on Letter Day, but unlike Aaron, this beloved young man did not survive aggressively. He finished his life after the church, his friend, and his family homosexual because he was gay. There are many people who do not think that what has been shown in the movie will actually happen in this day and age, but they are doing tragic and tragic things. For those of you gay and young them out you need to watch this movie and if you are a gay Mormon you really need to watch this movie. Plus if you get a DVD then you have support for it listed in the DVD. The teenager's suicide in the gay world is very annoying and the movie touches it, but that part is hidden in the degree. Acting and music are excellent This movie has sold every movie house shown, but it is shown only in major cities and for very limited publication, so I would recommend DVD releases for those who want to watch this movie. The only man I know that does not like the film is a member of my own church and they did not see the movie due to the GAY and LDS Church on topics. Watch the movie, enjoy the story, and feel the emotions shown in this movie that you will not be disappointed with.
