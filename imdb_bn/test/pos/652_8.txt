Released when a notorious big budget flop. This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and a occasionally inspired cast. Although its focus may be lost for a long time, there are enough fun moments that will ultimately keep an eye on the observers. If you're a fan of character actor and actress, it will be a treat for you; You can recognize such awesome little known actors throughout this movie (you do not know their names, but you know their faces), even by making a Christmas story a small part of the child. If you rent this from Netflix, I bet you will enjoy it.
