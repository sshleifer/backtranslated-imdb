This movie is an all time favorite of me. I am sorry that the IMDB is not more positive about it. I hope it does not keep those who are not experienced from watching it. <br /> <br /> I always liked this movie. I have seen it almost once a year and are always delighted with the film, and especially through star cast performance by whole cast. <br /> <br /> I am always surprised that the tongue Stapton is actually the last dance with the trolver ??? ? If someone knows this quarter piece, please comment. <br /> <br /> Thanks and enjoy!
