I've seen three animated episodes, and it's all my favorite. The second revival already provides a flimsy back story in the flimsy universe. The program was a stylistically impressive number, it just felt kind of stupid. I guess it gives a special touch to Shinchiro Vitanabe, the director of the very popular (and good reasons) series Cowboy Babe. It has some of the best elements of Bob's: Chatting, science-criminal courage, a nonsense, a neutral hero is working for renting, a monster-head (more or less), and a Chase scene, all beautifully covered film-noir packaging. Watanabe's tarantino-style slickness comes through full throttle here.
