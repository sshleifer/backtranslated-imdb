People! I remember this event with Nostalgic ... I really dug Breaster because he was not a conventional hero. He was more than a future Texas cowboy. The man was a bear's firmness, a knee's eye, and its mobility ... I could not remember it. <br /> <br /> The action sequence was great! I think that Brakest would always use his big name Sarzuwan (translated in Spanish) when he was in big trouble. <br /> <br /> This was a quality cartoon. I like letters, dialogue, music, and of course, opening credit sequence! Bravestarr! Long life to him My opinion is a classic classic and a must see.
