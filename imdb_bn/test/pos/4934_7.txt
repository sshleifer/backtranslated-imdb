This is a great flick! It's even fun, fun for everyone. We got Jason Bhurihs / Leatherface as the killer, as well as other vicky letters. Very fun flick for kids of all ages, too. Every time we rent it when we went to the video store! Buster and Babs will make a good pair, and duck love. He is probably my favorite character! I was never big at the TV show but this movie has given so great memories. For the family, fans of the show, or anyone else will see! Enjoyable, no matter how old or how old you are! Rent it now at your local video store! <br /> <br /> PSS requires a DVD release!
