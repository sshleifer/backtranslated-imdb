Well, I've been late for a few days, but what ....! However, the word "see no evil" best describes my reaction .... Seperes The film is actually quite good. Undoubtedly, there is enough amount of blood, gore and action in mysterious quantities. By the end of the 70's and early 80's, it returned to dry wools' slash days. Remember "Madman" fills the Leatherface with Normann Bates dash and you get a good feeling for this flickr. Although thin (mostly horror movies) on the SNE Plot pages, it is designed for violence / killing, gossip, confidentiality, and why the very controversial Jacobs did a great job to play the good night. The title of this picture is really with the help of his finger, he takes the eyes of the victims and stores it in a big jersey. Why ?? You just have to see it and see (pun intended). Most notable psycho, TCM, and other horror films from Madman have been produced from specific films, but they are not ambiguous. Finally, SNE does not really go to areas where we have not seen long ago and approved, SNE is not a "Pissocho" or "TCM 74", but it can certainly meet an appearance IMO. <br /> <br /> Recommendation by Bloodstones: The rating of Blackstone: Go to a matinee showing "No No Evil": 7.5 / 10
