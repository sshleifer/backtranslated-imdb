I have enjoyed, appreciated, and will watch this movie again because I'm sure there is the opposite that I missed. Wonderfully played, played or any on Clich√© performance or intrigue. Using a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships, how do the people involved in each relationship (or disconnect) and the perceptions of life, in each of the relationships in life, take a position and how do they deal with confusion, joy, hurt and despair? Discovery is not the thing that they perceived them. At first I thought "observer" and "observed", but in this case we are not connected to each other and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. I recommend the film to everyone, especially those who teach, social work, religious advice and other people with breathing.
