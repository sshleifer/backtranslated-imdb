This movie is a fantastic curiosity, which initially takes place in an old school, but it does not look like a stupid medical school environment. Very Gothic and Atmospheric. For the film, okay, all right, the premier is a little too far, but hey, so we watch movies, is not it? And this is less distant than those garbage, which is out of these days, it is sure to make sure. Medical students are experimenting with 'short-term' death, because they allow themselves to die for a short period of time so that they can enjoy what the next life is like. It's pretty cool, in some cases, its parts come back with volcanoes and start mediating in their socio-social life. I have not seen this movie on DVD for years and I have forgotten how good it was. And it hit me that Julia Roberts is looking really good in this movie, not like today's actresses, which are supposedly decorated and decorated like a fantastic hooker Ah, good old days. However, this is not a great glimpse, perhaps fundamentalist Christians, but many can enjoy it. 8 out of 10.
