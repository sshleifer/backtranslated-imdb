Specify the style of Bollywood with a little introduction to the style and generally the illustrated images are durable, making the top musical numbers expensive, which makes Vegas think of a conservative basement. This perception does not help with the intensity of the condensation that exceeds the majority of movies that reach Bollywood from an outsider's perspective. Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Merigold, however, takes a different piece. This innocent man and his stupid antics do not look like a lazy wings-wing, but his heartfelt sense of loneliness, irrationality and lack of self-consciousness in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the director has deep reverence and respect for Bollywood, as well as his Kishoreganj aspects. And if you are familiar with Bollywood, you can understand what he is doing here to compile the real hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions. One of the opening shots, the movie of the movie Salman, the flashback of the character of Salman, his grandmother (played by Helen! - How many Salman movies starts at the same premises?), In the Flashback sequence of Marigold and love films, anyone who has enough Bollywood movies They can recognize these references. The story itself includes trying and true conference from both Hollywood and Bollywood ?? Outside the water, the fish fills the duties-to-one-family for personal supplementary expenses. The second half of the film's structure to move to more dramatic resolution followed the ideal half-hearted setup of the ideal Bollywood plot line. Still, the sensitivity of this movie is Hollywood, its short, gentle humor and the story of a woman who is learning to trust herself, to surrender. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There were no musical numbers and this movie is not frustrating with them seven. Unlike Bollywood, songs do not pop from anywhere, and their characters do not move to the European Locale or Goenge beaches; They are a musical number, which is part of a movie being made, reminds us how the music score was justified as part of a stage show in Busby Barclay. Or do they come out of a situation where music is already there? A sexy nightclub scene where love teaches to perform marigold dance or perform a beach scene where musicians (playback singers, including a camio from Shaan). All movies reflect the key condition of the key at that time. Often the music will take a conventional song from a genre and make a wrapping it from another. So in a highlights of Marigold's own film, the song script is fairly common in its genre ?? Female star singer and dance in a line of women ?? But in this case, it is a completely natural Bollywood film star, such as Ali Larter, such as emoticons in Hindi songs with a subtitle and lips like compressed lips. <br /> <br /> Also, Bollywood's equally spectacular scene and Morigold have nicely filled that view. Thanks to some of the top talent in Bollywood today. Screenwriter Anil Mehta, who was the film painter of Jhalan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Her Dil De Chuk Sanam and Devdas, both the birivi merchants and producer designer Nitin Desai's dance form. Do you really see the effect of De Chuk Saanam in this movie? In fact, an enlightened floor of the numbers was mainly washed away, which in brief contained an embedded Merigold pattern. <br /> <br /> Carroll is clearly a trend by playing through the heart as proven as the acting talent for Cast ?? One of Angelina Jolie and Rayan Filipp's first films And in this film he again identified Ali Larter. The main reasons for the film are Larter. She is a bitchy, unappealing character sympathetic and makes her next transformation credible and she is smart, funny, and sexy because she is smart and funny. He and Salman shared excellent chemistry and it is one of the biggest strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan played the role of Prince Charging, filmed with love his iconic role. This old school love, however, expects a calm, subdued Salman - who can use her normal stripping avatar to be frustrated ?? Or release! This is only serious by its weak signals in English lines, sincere and sensitive performance from her. <br /> <br /> With a lack of romantic love and a lack of laziness, the film is a love letter from Bollywood and Hollywood movies. Before that
