Various footwear proves again that he is working without any doubt in Bombay, the best actor. His recent films were involved in shouting his lines, which did not get well enough for the theatrical-trained Thespian. One wonders why he is not always given his accolades during the award season. <br /> <br /> "Energy-power" was one of his flicks that was a complete disapointment along with Kohram (with a Miss Oppurtunity Amitabh Bachchan made in screen magic). <br /> <br /> But Patkar made a quiet peace by joking a policeman on a peaceful trial in this movie. Riding on the streets of Bombay underworld in fake encounters, Patekars takes control of character screen (and attention of the viewer) and never lets go. The edit is hardly imagined and there is no annoying song for confusion from the story. <br /> <br /> In addition to the same line as the classic "company" of the modern day culture, the film should be well played, directed and a long shelf life in the DVD <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> final Not ten minutes and the main villain's conversation with her offshore is bound to be part of the Hindi movie classics. These police and robbery will not be dissapointed with the flick.
