It seems to be a strong film that Joe McCarthy is not resurrected after the time of censorship. It influenced me as a Jewish youth who had friends of different colors, and in the second quarter of the twentieth century, their father's family suffered under the fascist regime of Europe. Like the next rap-off, "On Waterfront", which adopts the same themes, and turns them around to fit Hollywood's political accuracy for that time, it directly talks about its stories and characters respect and reality. It is imaginarily reflected. It was "close to the wind", "birth of a nation", "victory of will" and many other glorious preventive measures of hatred and violence. I'll install it in recent German films (also virtually hidden in the United States) as well, "Rosenthal." <br /> <br /> I think the black version of the TV version, layout and story was black and went out of the station because the black hero's wife appeared white. As a young citizen's rights activist, it created a conflict for me because on one hand I was opposed to smoking cigarettes and the other opposed the boycott of TV shows sponsored by Georgia, a big tobacco company (I do not remember anymore). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .
