We saw and saw La Spatite at the Siracusa International Film and Video Festival. <br /> <br /> This picture is scared of us all. Fear of rejection, fear of self-confidence and, most importantly, fear of our own inadequacy. <br /> <br /> Three main actors, Barbara Boulouga Valeria, Brigat Killian Flavia, Andrea Range Massimo, their role are well-matched. Nice <br /> <br /> I believe Barbara Bublio has a stand out. I hope we will see more of him in the next few years. <br /> <br /> This picture is not easy to find. Thumbs up the Italian team who put this film together. Highly recommended.
