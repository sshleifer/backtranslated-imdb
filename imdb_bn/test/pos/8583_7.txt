The English are very bad, the Scottish little more <br /> <br /> Heroic. Conversations are occasionally dramatic, and <br /> <br /> Transitions in scenes may be easier. However, "Bruce" has a feeling of real feeling, if that is unclear, <br /> <br /> history ... even if it is something important <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> Bruce <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, they are still <br /> <br /> marshalled an impressive crowd for English and Scottish soldiers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A few failures and errors, film still <br /> <br /> A strong screenplay.
