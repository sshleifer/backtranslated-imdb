If you have not seen your 80-year-old child and this film, you have failed to be the real child of 80. How do you love those great chipmunks (do not forget about chips), lines, and songs. After years I can still sing every song every song. The story line is great for movies and much better then movies for kids today. It's just pure fun and worth renting, even if you all become big.
