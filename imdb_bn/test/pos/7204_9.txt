I was lucky to see this sign before I came, because I'm not sure if I could see my true reality, I would come out of my way to see it. I have found "Mission Cleopat" predecessor over its predecessor, but the main is: It is about one word adaptation, which is not an amalgam like the first movie. Particularly bad guy (whose name is escaping to me, but he is another architect), some of their animated possessions were very funny similar to physical characters. I do not know how this movie was played in English; My first language was French so I did not have that problem ... I imagine that some messengers were not easy to translate. I've learned something for years, better than watching movies with subtitles, you probably do not understand than dubbing, but you do not lose the punch and I think it's also important. I would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "Asterix and Ob√©lix".
