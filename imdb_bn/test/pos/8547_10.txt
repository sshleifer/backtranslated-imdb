I saw this movie years ago and I have not forgotten it. The theme is very timely. This morning was on TCM and I wonder why this wonderful movie is not on VHS or DVD. I've searched extensively for this movie but can not find it. I believe enough people will request it if the movie ends in the DVD. It makes me amazed that such stunning performance from Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available for the public. Today, the world of ethnic cleansing in different parts of the world will see the same as the teacher and the students. This movie is a great teaching tool in many ways from the past as contemporary as "crash". From the previous comment I can see that this film has made a deep impression on everyone. Again, very bad it is not available for sale.
