Leigh Claudius (Claudio Casilli) and some of his gunfighters were washed off on an island owned by Edmund Rakham (Richard Johnson). After the death of some random prisoners, the Rackham Cloud and his two remaining prisoners were taken away. Fortunately for everyone, Barbara may be on the island of Bach! Curiously, some crazy fishing people prefer to kill people who are there. <br /> <br /> This Italian-produced drying seems to all it - the touch of DR mixtures from Black Legs. MOREAU with a dash of white zombie voodoo and Atlantis stuff. Despite some jungle looking fishmen's costume, the film is benefited from some nice location photography and a nice twist through half. The actor pops up as well as an old biologist, all well and Joseph Cotton. Director Sergio Martino himself managed quite a lot because there are arrangements for 10 minutes or more. Her embarrassment can not be said for followup the Fisherman and the Queen (1995), one of the most surprising and most off-of-base basics from Hylander II.
