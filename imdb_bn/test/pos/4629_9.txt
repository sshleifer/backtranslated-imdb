Well ... what do you say <br /> <br /> I think I'll begin with confession. I've cried four times in my life. Once my father died, a friend of high school for the double and the end of this film. This movie deals with the real face-to-face issues of 6 school kids, which makes them open to the world freely. I have never seen a movie which is related to human emotion and related to it. Everything from disaffection to unrest is covered here and I suspect that many people from the sting of contacts with at least a few scenes are safe. <br /> <br /> It starts with suicide. At 2:37 pm Then if you could not tell who died, the story starts from the beginning of the story. It follows 6:37 children's lives of 6 kids It is commutable, and edited with the private interviews of 6 teenagers, you know all about their life. Their love, hatred, dreams, wishes, secrets, shame, false self-confidence, suicide, corruption and pride. Trying to discover the identity of suicide at the end of the film, which is the overall result "Hudunat" I would not let you know anything except spoiled. Do not feel cheated by the end. This is a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> and now an alert. This film is definitely not for the heart of bored. I saw when many people actually find halfway through the movie. Hate by some of its contents. Or perhaps it's sometimes hard to truly encounter the cold hard fact. What is this high school for many people? I'm sure most of the majority will agree.
