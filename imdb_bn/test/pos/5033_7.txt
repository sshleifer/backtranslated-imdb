Continuing his return, John Trouvalta played a gentle rolled angel in "Michael". He can be a messenger of God, but he is not the best person, inventor Andy McDowell and William Hart discover. When I first saw this movie, I started watching "All In the Family", so I did not recognize Gene Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now I have recognized him in this way, I am trying to imagine that Aachari is graduating on him to provide shelter to an angel (whom he probably will be next to black, jew, etc.). <br /> <br /> I know, it's not really about movie related. But I just want to add things like that. However, this is a beautifully interesting movie. Also, Bob Hossin, The Girl and Richard Shif have played. <br /> <br /> What does Mr. and Paul say ...
