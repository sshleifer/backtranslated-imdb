I went to the cinema to watch this movie when I was a little scared. Indeed, making a movie from comics is always difficult and the first episode of French two space literature was good but not fantastic. Finally, it is very funny from the unwanted gags, some cartoon scenery, no timings, great fx, a great throw, great landscapes, starting with everything great! However, I wonder how they will be able to translate all French names in English or German, because it is certainly funny in French but how can it be in another language ???
