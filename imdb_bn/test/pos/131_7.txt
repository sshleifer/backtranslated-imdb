Some of India's growing middle class classes have a fairly attractive look. Although India is fast modernizing, its culture is not available. This film involves patriarchal society, where women are still not real citizens. Managed marriage is a land, men who are fairly guilty and deliberately deal with ownership, and these expectant women will eventually become small. I was very good with Nandita Das, who was very attractive, and with her sincerity, played her character. But I was more impressed with Shabana Ajmi, who says Bollywood's long-standing scenes His cool beauty and less original emotional pain were excellent. The lesbian theorem of this film was not particularly erotic and not titled. (Darn!) A look price for those who are interested in huge different cultures.
