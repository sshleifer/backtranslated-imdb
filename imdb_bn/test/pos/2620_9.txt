Everything in this episode of poetry has changed! The program is moving towards the end of the third phase, and all of these episodes are breaking into hell. Excellent people. Saves a innocent person named Griffith from Shakes to the Minister, the source brings the killers. When he attacked the attack, he exploded as a tornado and then corporealizes his giant skin. He threw Pru a wall in the blast which beat him completely and actually killed him. Then the explosion piper gave the rest of the wall. The phoebe comes from ATIC, and after the death of Shakes Doctor, the winner is spellbinding. But one power is, it only wounds him. Comes to heal other sisters and Pru wants to look for her and wants to destroy her for real. In the meantime, there are underworlds to try to find out Phoebe. When Pru and Piper came out on the streets in the street, the ghost found him. After their war, the magicians realized that the camera was caught! After trying to fight with the media with the minarear and after defeating Shack, a trick called Khipun Piper went away. Pru uses his telecommunications to get people out of the way so that he can go to the hospital. But they got late and died piper. And when Pru is going to take a shot, then they said to the man. The time came when Greifiths came up with. Shue and blasts push between Pru and Piper. But Foob is still under-the-under, so Shakes Doctor and Mani kill the blast. When Leo finally comes, he can not cure Prue. Pru is dead and so is the strength of three. For now. Personally This episode was sad. Pru was strong at all of them. I'd like to have his telenesis power. I do not really think he'll go to the underworld because he would not kill Shack Prue if he did not. But Paige brought the power three together again and I am happy with the show's progress
