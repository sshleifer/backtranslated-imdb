I'm watching Queens King from the beginning, and it seems to have been ignored on the award show. The best humor of this event is, you can identify with letters, we talk about a lot about it, because I work in many companies (DHL) and we just like Timster plugin !! Kerry is my hero, he's the best, he just keeps it there, the matter does not matter. What would Arthur say well? He just cracks up to you, and really keeps a spin on things. Doug, well he's just so lovable, and fun, three characters, plus all the friends just make the show complete. The best comedy on this TV !! I'll talk to Safefield in there, oh, there's nothing wrong with that .... Excellente !! Doug would say.
