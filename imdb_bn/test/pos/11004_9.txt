This is a beautifully illustrated film which questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially the mischief tribes. Focusing on the Salmonans of Tibet, the film moves at a pace that can make some western viewers uncomfortable. For some people, life still earns at the same pace for thousands of years. The film follows a group of tribes in their annual two-month quest to get salt. Their tribes live their lives traditionally (gradually through modern standards) and always count their many gods. This is an extraordinary movie, which, unfortunately, will save a piece that can become history. Well worth the time. Do not have to be a storm when you see it.
