Anyone who likes to play with Jacqueline Hayd is not able to play with critics and undoubtedly lends more criticism than a romantic romp. From the title only, it is clear that the horror comedy of this low budget is not taken seriously ... it's the tongue of Enmophoto's french kisses and as the title. Women cast members are all great and fun to see. Check it out, Ralph Kenneszczyk, the soft-core junket princess. Most soft-core horoscope is unlike Flickr, it is entertaining in all ways through charismatic and exceptionally attractive actors. This film does not try to follow the story of Robert Louis Stevenson classic, but instead of creating a changing perspective and sexual situations, it could potentially find out. Blythe Metz, Jacqueline's sexier, femme fatale, who painted the homicidal side, is a real knockout. See and enjoy!
