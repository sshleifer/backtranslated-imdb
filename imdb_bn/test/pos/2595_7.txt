... and there were several of these. <br /> <br /> I do not like this cartoon as much as others, partly it was created during its time. I like cartoons for fifteen years or more with duffies and bugs. Many people will like it, especially those who are always violent, funny, cartoon or not found. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is a well known well known for Lonnie Tunes: Elmer finds the victim, takes Defe to the bugs and ends up being replaced by Daffy instead. Also inserted is quite tricky and very entertaining joke (does not improve some episodes), ugly shooting and animation which is slightly medium. The plot is mainly made by Jokes - every joke keeps on running. This method of plot is not great in Looney Tunes (of course if you are most lonely tune bofin or - or interested in me - you may already know it). <br /> <br /> For everything to love about Lonny Tune and Duffy Duck, and just like the words I said about it, enjoy the "Rabbit Season"! <br /> <br /> half of half of ten
