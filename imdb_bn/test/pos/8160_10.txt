A small film that came back in 1982, McKay threatened the audiences with an open and open screenplay of a romantic love story of greed, which has only two men. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for many years in fashioned romance between two men; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, it's very nice, beautiful, clean-ridden, and quite a bit. That makes it so wonderful. There is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the term. <br /> <br /> Regarding religion, sorry people, but these things happen and people are going to gay now even now. It is not just Mormon Church denying gay homosexuals. People of every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. This is a perfect mix of fantasy-romance that is grounded in the real life of character. If I could give ten stars more. The good love story style does not go out; Great love story like the lottery day is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's almost time!
