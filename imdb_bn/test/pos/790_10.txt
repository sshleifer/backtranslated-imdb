There is a running thread in the movie comedy that all great comics are summarizing the law or going to jail. One Faisal Wayne conman conman of WCFilds, or Max Brothers' opera one night, or Chaplin's wife in West West, thinks he's wrong. The law of skating is inevitable, and when they stand beside the law, the results are still unfavorable among the law-enforcement and comedy. Lloyd remembers his first conversant, Valkomie Danger, who is trying to help San Francisco police department "criminal waves" and want to kill police sergeant Edgar Kennedy. Think of Laurel and Hardy as the unfortunate police of the Mediaite Patrol. I have found so much hatred in these comedies (and their colleagues) comedy that this is a fake title for a movie with it. Jerry Seffield thinks of creating three short stages of a series in a series, SwapiPoppy, where boys are electrocuted to kill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Butster Keaton often has his opponents of lawmakers in his comedies. See the stemble bill, JR, where he tried to spring his father from a Calaboos. But in his short article he had more contradiction from the police force. The convict who was escaped to CONVICT 13 was misled and taken to jail. Cops (the perfect title - if you see it, you can understand) a big city police force repeatedly searches for Keaton, which has made a mistake to terrorists). And in Goa he is unable to avoid the police for most movies. <br /> <br /> Looking for food for Keton trumps. But he was completely miserable. When he leaves a stranger on his shoulder with a lucky horse (which Katyon had previously ignored) and then found a full wallet full of money, Keaton tried the same thing and hit a policeman on the head. The police fled and Caiton (as it would be fate) went to other police, tried to do normal work, but put someone else in the first place. Soon three police fired on him. Shortly shaking them, he walks through a window in a local prison where local killer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm Saint Clair *) is photographed. Going back to the inactive windows, the stupid and straight-looking keton are closed. This picture gives frustration and duck notes if you take it. When the dead shot carries the police, then it was the keton's face on all the wanted posters. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> (* St. Clair will eventually be a successful manager of silent and early comedy, though his next biography was a program in 20th Century Fox, where his work with Lorele and Hardy was the same.) <br /> < Keaton escaped to another city by train (people and lorry cut off the passenger cars of his followers). These pictures (by the way) have two famous Keaton jokes. His arrival in Lokmot is made in a remote shot, it is approaching closer and closer, and suddenly the visitors see Keaton sitting on the couch. <br /> <br /> The second famous sequence goes on (and may affect Chaplin's city lightly). Keaton had an accidental objection to a man who was arguing very violently with a beautiful woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). When he thinks the poster is a murderer, he thinks he killed that person. He is being pursued by a suspect major police (Joe Roberts) in this town, and passing Roberts in passing cars. A statue made of "Man of War" is being made and the sculpture is unveiling the clay model of the horse). Keaton was seen sitting on the ground trying to maintain his dignity at the beginning of the weight reduction of the horse's foot. Keaton managed to show the beautiful Max Fox, who invited her to the house for dinner. Only he can not understand his father Roberts. Keaton ran away for the last five minutes of the film, and while avoiding Roberts, he and Fox went together. <br /> <br /> This is a fun comedy, and best example of Keaton's best work.
