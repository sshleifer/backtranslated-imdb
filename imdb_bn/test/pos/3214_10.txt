This is a really great series. I love to mourn and I am not yet happy that it was not canceled. It really shows good humor and realistic ties between a young mother and her daughter. Yes, yes for Gilmour girls! It's very awesome. They are such a satirical bunch. They do everything together just like my mother. Um for Gilmour girls, I'm going out of line. But how do I love shaping up the relationship of Luc and Larryy finally. They need to be together And I absolutely love Sookie Saint James! He is so awesome And the show will not be anywhere without Michael. The whole show is dry humor, quiz, and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other .... Especially Gilmour Girls
