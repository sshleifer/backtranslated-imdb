You do not see the meaning of the title long enough, but in the first few minutes you get its point. Wenne / Nad 'Little Ned' Lift, the Golden Globe nomination (actor) Danny Davito's first debut on this debut was a hatcheck-like film about hatred for his wife's book (he stole it), and one of the hates for his mother. Basically, Owen wants to be a good writer, such as her teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and she is inspired by the story of the assassination. Larry suggests that he saw Hitkoc's film a bit ironic, and Wauen had the idea of ​​killing Leni's ex-wife Margaret (Star Trek Viegar's Kate Malgue). Inspired by Oven 'Stranger on a Train', Larry would have to kill Owen's awesome Mom (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Anna Ramsey). Larry was believed to have killed Oven Margaret and he wanted to kill Oven's mother, but I was very happy to get both books from both Larry and Owen, Mom died naturally and they were Beth Ryan (Kim Grist). Joel and Oprah have played Rob Reiner as Winfrey. With a sunny moments, a great director / actor and his support, this is a must see comedy. Very very good
