Acting, adaptation and direction - perhaps it's probably the most perfect film I've ever seen. It is spontaneous and one kind, so it is not saying that it is better or worse than other great movies, only it can stand by yourself as the perfect work of art. <br /> <br /> And getting fun it was getting awful fans and walking out!
