After 30 years of the 1939 classic film, Robert Donat won an Oscar and made Garar Gerson a star, "album, Mr. Chips" passed many problems before going to the screen in this musical version. The original star Rex Harrison and Samantha Igar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remix, who were thanked for the Heavy-Ho instead - thanks - Peter O'Toole and Petul Clark. Andr√© Pribhin's score was canceled and finally it was used - unfortunately - Leslie Bricks For the first time, Herbert Ross was the author of a simple love story - for his wife and students - the memorandum of transferring a big budget expulsion was handed over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> was educated. Intrinsically and socially inactive, he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them. Prior to the summer holidays, a former student took him to London Music Hall, where he starred in the Catherine Bridge, which he hoped would be the young woman he wanted to marry. Post-performance meetings are stalled for everyone, and chips - as he is commonly known - set out to explore the ancient ruins of Italy. Unexpectedly, he went to Catherine, who booked a failed metropolitan crew while in mourning and considering Mediterranean cruises to consider his career. The time they spend together, they discover a kind and gentle man under the intelligent outdoors, and sincerely follow him after returning to London. When the fall expires, Chips returned to Brookfield with his bride, and lived in two quiet domestic life. While the aspects of Catherine's past page are complex, again around her life during World War II, Chips are inspired by her wife's support, and her new available confidence makes her dear among the students. <br /> <br /> - In addition to some musical intimacy, the funniest music production number "London London" and Catherine's love announcement, "you and me" - most of the briquettes, many of them have acted as voice-over because the characters search for them Emotions, easily forgettable and in any way enhance the film. Completely delete the score, and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" works quite well as a play. Terrence Rattigan's script extends on it and it retains the original elements for several decades as it updates. He has created a number of scenes between Chips and Catherine, which beautifully portrays their devotion to each other, and the real life wife of Katharine's friend and sister, less prominent actress Ursul Moushank (played by Sien Phillips, O'Howell). He lives in a British public school - also equivalent to a private academy - captures life with the perfection of livelihood. <br /> <br /> Ross is the first time director, breathtakingly liberating the film with the film, when the erection of the moment-opening credit sequence, when echoing the school singles in the huge stone hallways in the school school, the film is completely set to tone. The dress and set duration is true. Students, who represent Brunfield as part of their small supporting role, are represented by non-professionals registered in school. <br /> <br /> The highest role played in Peter O'Toole and Petalha Clark's main roles O'Toole was long established as a first-class dramatic actor, so his Academy Award nominated performance came as a surprise here. Clarke, a dozen dozen B-movies in the UK and a senior of the previous year's "Finnish Rainbow", is completely brilliant as the compromise of music, who left a dramatic career for his wife as a school teacher. His golden voice enriches his songs and often lets them ignore how obscure they are, and they are together more than Mill O'Waul in their dramatic scene. Chemistry between two is obvious and it leaves us without any doubt that it is a couple in love. <br /> <br /> This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not as classic as its predecessor, but it is rarely released when disaster is described by many critics. Ignoring the scores, concentrating on performance, and revel in atmosphere Ross has kept on the screen. A great way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
