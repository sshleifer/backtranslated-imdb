First of all, I must say that I love this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw director Mitchell Hannek that the first movie was and I was very good that the side was so good! <br /> <br> Heinck surely knows how to direct the actors. I found intresting what Haneke's scenario is. Initially, you see a woman who is very straightforward and a good piano teacher and loved her and feels her neighbor honored from all. Then you realize that she has a mother who is a control freak and is very much present in her life. Now you know that he is scared, he has mental problems, but you just do not know exactly what. And then you fall beside her dark side, but her dark side is expressed only when a student sentenly falls in love with her. She can not control herself anymore. <br /> <br /> The role is very complex and difficult to play, but Isabell Huppert's role is extraordinary and he was eligible for his recognition at the Cannes Festival. The Benet Magnil is very strong, but slightly different by Hupper's performance. <br /> <br /> There is a strange thing in this scenario that how Maggile's character is not credible. He is very talented! A person is a piano virtual, but it is very rare to pass most of the time for hockey and study ... It seems to be a weak point, but only a small error. <br /> <br /> I have seen the movie once, so I can not do a full critic, because I did not film the film. I liked what I saw! So I'm a film 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, Hanake showed that he really wanted to disappoint his audience. A movie which does not seem necessary for making movies, but with Henke's style and precision, her film for her is better than for example Baise-Moi. <br /> <br /> Vince
