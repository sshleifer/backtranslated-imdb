Warning - Possible Speakler! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is one of the hard rock movies I've ever seen. The original concept of this script focuses on a young singer of the 80's, which manages a respected band of the most famous hard rock band of this time. He is not just playing his music on the note, but his statue is alive life. When his friends expose him in tribute band, in search of some basicity, destiny gives him a good turn and the statue is rented to replace the band's lead singer. Has a dream come true? Well around During the start of a famous life story with drug and sexual orientation in the rock scene of the '80s, he must face problems related to his friendly girlfriend and finally to answer the questions of creativity and tell a song in the band's song. <br /> <br /> I like this picture, because it's a realistic way for the first time that it shows the life and music of Hard Metal Rock Band. Supporters of the music series will be satisfied by the soundtrack. The overall concept is original, and how an artist revives his life and how his art is transformed into an intelligent and balanced way. Actually, I was better than most of Mark Wahlberg's other activities, I saw him a long time ago, and Jennifer Anthony is pretty-girl-aware-much-protected about life-roles. More problematic ends, which can be quite common, and frustrating. After quoting the big and famous band, it seems like the original character found its creative way. However, in a satirical turn he ended up playing the club, the music was the worst movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale However, expecting a high dose exposure to metal - the value seen. If you do not like this kind of music then you can choose to avoid this movie.
