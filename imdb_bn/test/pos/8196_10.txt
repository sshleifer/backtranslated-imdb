After watching the film several times, I found a lot of touch and passion in dialogue. Jing K, Assasin has become one of the best movie characters ever. These exquisite Chinese actors say more with his eyes and words and his economy of movement then no big screen American actor today. King, Emperor, Bright, because the audience moves to believe in kindness in his heart, to reveal the most cruel acts only on people around him. The promise he makes with incredible passion and isolated with an evil fist. Gong Li, I've almost never met him as almost every movie, simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
