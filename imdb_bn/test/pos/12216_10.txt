Surface One of the best shows that I have ever seen. NBC is so stupid to cancel a great show like this and all the bad leave it only half left. It can be done so that NBC or someone else has to give at least one season to the Surface. As NBC lets you read a book and gives halfway through it, they decide that it will take you away from it and then you can not find the last one. I just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly, see what happens to Nim. I can safely say this about Surface fans, we think we want to save Nemo! Neem has taken away all our hearts and then NBC has just cut two. Come NBC, Surface is one more day!
