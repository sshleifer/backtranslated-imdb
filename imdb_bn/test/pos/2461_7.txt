This image easily competes with the psychological power, dramatic effect and top-achievement of "12 Angry Man". I hired it in a jolt and amazed that I did not hear it before. <br /> <br /> I do not know it's the first episode of Emilio Estevez's director debut, but along with the development of pissing, interplay and characters, as well as an impressive camera act, all of Atevez's plays suggest a natural eye. <br /> <br /> The interplay between Mart√≠n and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry with Martin and Charlie at Walt Street. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her character's subtle frustration and escapism; A diversity on his characters "to play in the fields of Lord". He is boring and can still sympathize with one at the same time. In a few moments I think that this plot reduces the touch and moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend are almost another film, Estevez all come together as another character. But those small allegations. <br /> <br /> This image must be based on a true story or written by someone living with this experience. I find it a solid 10 out 8. <br /> <br />
