I actually flipped the Lifetime Channel incorrectly, just as the movie started, and finally saw it. <br /> <br /> It certainly deals with a serious problem that we probably do not understand is that in the context of such an attack of a young fellow colleague, who thinks he is above the system, and, unfortunately, often Is. <br /> <br /> Here the shield is trustworthy, and the performance is reliable. Canadian / Lifetime Flickr is mostly "over-the-top". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was less than 96 minutes long, and it seemed to be much faster than it was, and it The effect was like a small film, before it reached the unexpected and anticipated conclusion - over over was over over. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, despite the criticism of this picture, compelling characters and performances make it even better than average movies like this. <br /> <br /> And often after measuring these "milk", it can give it a bit more detail and length.
