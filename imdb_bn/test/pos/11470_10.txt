I liked this movie, I liked the plots, I liked the shoot scenes, except for some, they did not need it and I used to enjoy the character of the soil, I liked it. I chose the actors in this gangster movie because sometimes some actors do not just play the role. Although I hate to say it, but ultimately I hated, as if it had moved on the other side. It was better with some more detail, it was based on a true story but there was a lot of information left but it was even better. If you enjoy movies on past gangsters, then you will enjoy this movie.
