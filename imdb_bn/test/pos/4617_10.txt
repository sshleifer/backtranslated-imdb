I have to admit that I fall into this treacherous trap that Australians can not play dramas until it cries a lot, and I'm an Australian Sorry, right? This movie is crying, it does not cry dramatically, its honest emotions are shining. <br /> <br /> This film is also known as the Whindint. I knew how this final outcome was seen, so I tried to guess who would do it. I miss by a mile <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I found the director, Murali Thuluri was only 21 years old when he was making the film. I love her hands flakes. She knows how to make a movie. I hope he's coming too. <br /> <br /> One of the letters we fill before the main title credits (about 12 minutes) is a hero anti-hero Each of them looked at their own way and they all became selfish as the next. Even when they are sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The most tragic scene in the movie, and the difficulties in seeing something) is the final scene where we officially introduced the original original character and we call their nephew. That scene is crying to me. <br /> <br /> I believe in the Australian play has been restored. We master at the comedy, but I was getting bored with the comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
