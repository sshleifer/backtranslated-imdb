I never expected to see the Persian Episode. I was extremely premier and "premier" satisfied. After seeing it again, I have several errors that I initially missed. "Premiere" is not a great fanfare, but it is able to successfully and effectively get the credit for setting up a plot and giving many basic back storys of regular characters. <br /> <br /> This episode starts with John Crichton (Ben Border), an astronaut and scientist, ready to move to the forums module, a small space ship perfected by Crichton and his friend D. Crutchon made an open conversation with his father Jack Crichton, and then started his test flight in space. Of course, everything goes wrong and crickon "sings with a worm" and "a remote part of the galaxy" flows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From here, the Persian alphabet and story lines are presented in an entertaining way to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Regular letters are correctly presented in the first half of this episode. Of course, there's Crichton, Ben Broder played well. He is provided with a sympathetic character identifying the audience. He lost and did not have any idea how to do anything. "Premiere", Christen has been chosen to join prisoners or peacekeepers. He did not know anything on both sides, but to help Erin (the prisoner of peacekeeping pilot) it was certain that he wanted to help peacekeepers. Announcing Christine as the murderer of his brother, he could not possibly end up with the prisoners if he was not for peacekeeping careers. It keeps Crichton in an interesting situation: He is stuck with the strange, violent fleeing prisoners of distant galaxies, which he does not know about. The total lack of knowledge of the world's foremost knowledge of the phospha shows him as a particularly attractive character during the first season of Farsk. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is very compulsory. Junk, a blue-delvian and former prisoner. He is quiet and reasonable, fellow detainee D'Argo, opposing a strong and hard-headed fighter. Virginia Hei is completely blue makeup, allowing Jhang to express his character cool and firmly. D'Argo's mega-makeup, contrast, bottom-par. She looks kind of stupid with her giant tentacles and weird nose, and something extraordinary about her eyes. They see if they have some allergic reaction to her makeup. Farsack Season 1 will make some improvements in her makeup, but the overall costume will be at least a problem for Season 2 for me. <br /> <br /> The dolls and pilot dolls / digital letters are, it's simply, nice. Rygel is a small Hynerian Dominican who floats around some sort of hypercroft. Some good conversations are given to "Premiere", but nothing else. The pilot steals as much as a connection between the living ships, Moai and Maida passengers. Even in the first episode, the pilot lets look off as a real, living alien; He does not seem to be a giant, expensive machine at the sound. <br /> <br /> The peacekeeping character introduced is quite interesting. Peacekeepers are made up of a nation known as Sebastius, who look like people. The main competitor is presented as Captain Crayes in "Premiere", who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In fact, the death of Crease's brother only caused a crash due to a collision with Crichton's ship. Arin SÃ¡n, a pilot who helped Crickton to escape, explained that death was an accident, but Crease claimed that he was "overwhelmingly contaminated" and refused to change his mind. Crease emotions for revenge, no emphasis or not (it should be clear to the crease that Crichton is not responsible), "premiere" is mysterious, but later it will be explained in the season. Aeryn gives herself a very attractive character. By being forced to leave the peacekeepers, he changes his whole life and about the situation in the same (though less serious) situation as Crichton. <br /> <br /> The actual episode mentioned earlier seems to have been a bit shaky. Not so much time is spent that enough time. Also, D'Argo (for now) continues to be stupid to try to face her middle dress. Still, "premiere" hard entertainment Special effects (such as Starburst order) are impressive. Most of the dresses and set originals of the flour board. Despite its flaws, one must definitely watch for "premier" fanscape fans. 3/4
