Luis Bunuel was always a filmmaker whose work was unclear to me. My first experience with him was the wise skin of the bourgeoisie, often considered his greatest work, which made me frustrated and frustrated that I finally closed the tape. Likewise, Bell De D'Jar, which is certainly considered to be his best known film and generally his most famous artist, did not give me much interest. I hate it like knowing, but I do not like it. Third, I saw L'oz d'Or. Finally, I got anywhere. Fourth, Los Olvidados, good. Still, L'oz d'Or not Los Olividados did not blow me up. Great movie, but not superiority. <br /> <br /> Najrin is my fifth Bunuwail, and I like it more than the other two. It is currently refusing to live in Mexico, a Spanish priest who lived in a luxury neighborhood where most of the priests lived. He wants to be more like Jesus, which makes life vivid possible. He is willing to forgive everyone and willing to suffer without protest. I'm not convinced that Bunuel is sympathetic to the character, and sees him as selfish. However, I only guess that because of my knowledge about the director, whose most famous quotation is "Thank God, I'm still an atheist," which he said in an interview with this very movie (I received this information from John Bex) if you are interested in Bunuel Book). Those who pulled the word from the mouth of Bauel must have been confused about Nazrarian. Who believed in religious conviction, who does not know anything about Bunuel, might see the priest as a heroic figure. This is particularly true if the audience of organized audiences has its own criticism. The priest may be somewhat self-righteous, but he seems to be essentially a good man. When he keeps a violent prostitute in his room to protect his room (and, perhaps, in order to save his soul), people start to seek out and their relationship is sexual. His high officials assume the same and punish him for this. Later, he suffered even worse punishment from clerics.
