So you think that every Mafia movie you've ever seen! Nobody here can be heard. It is a low budget, quickie b-movie - shot in jersey's swamps. For us movie-movie fans, it was a little - sex, violence, curse, and wise people acting like "Gaffon". Violence affects this movie, though I smile in any familiar scenes seen in Soprans and Goodfellas. Find the 1977 version of "Buddabong Girls" at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> All our favorite mobile stereoipes were featured here. And, as a reality, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was fantastic, illustrating classic cute guy character as we have seen him many times over many years. This was probably his first shot, and it was a jewel. Pesci fans should run this flick out of the video store. You have to look carefully for it because it goes by different names. My copy is called "Family Enforcer". Here it is known as "Death Collector". But whatever the name under it, it should say - a winner.
