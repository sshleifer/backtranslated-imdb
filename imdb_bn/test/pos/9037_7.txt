Get in touch with the prison as well. They do not look extra Hollywood. In Oxford, Mississippi, somebody was really smart because you can not get the authenticity of the studio backlit. The narrow dusty roads, the low frozen earth and the skeletal plants are very little hanging. No wonder those face face difficult and unforgiving; They're just reflecting the soil from that spring. The Old Man Lucas (Hern√°ndez) feared well for his life, but then he springs from the same difficult earth. <br /> <br /> The film works because it is a good story that does not promote and even does not even give sensitivity and even some mysteries. Old Man Lucas is not very favorite. He is a victim and we are sympathetic, but he is violent and immoral. Cute, the script refuses to sweeten him. In this way we are obliged to accept the effect of racism and injustice as less sympathetic. This script wisely avoids behaving wisely and directly with racism, since it continues to be promotive and less effective. Instead, we have demonstrated how easily an innocent person can be held guilty and can condemn him in terrible death. Thus, the effects of ethnic racism are exposed, it is a more effective way to show justice as through our general engagement. It can understand the activities of the sheriff and the lawyer because otherwise it is part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> This film does not attack how isolation. It is doubtful that the old guy Lucas, however, wants to mix up with Sadaad and there is no indication that the lawyer Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the color line in addition to seeing justice. No, the possibility of reunion is considered false in the future, symbolized by children (Jarman), whose head is not yet filled with "concept". He is not exactly a friend with Lucas, but he looks at the general humanity of friendship after falling into frozen drought. The last line of the dialogue shows him his uncle, the lawyer instead of his more hidden parents (dinner table view is important and easily ignored). The lawyer may not join the civil rights march in the future, but may be the child. <br /> <br /> This brief 3 year time, 1949-51, (The Well, Nay Way Out, Brave Home, Lost Boundary) was a series of racist theme films. . Even the most famous MGM merged with this little gem. Unfortunately, Hollywood's McCarthy projects have ended the "problem" movies, which could not end the war of Shawl War. Even so, each of them is not just for a good quality film but also 60 years and Jim Crowe is still relevant as well.
