Look at three Gayshus, who look at the path of their main path. Now they are looking back towards love for their animals and bored in their presence. Kin (acting by Floating Weed 'Haruko Sugimura) sworn off the men and lived a life as a money holder; Everyone owes his block on the block. The other two, Noboo and Tamim, they want to give birth to their husbands, but they are not too stupid to believe. Meanwhile, their children - there is one son and one girl - both are to be married (not to each other). Copper is very annoyed with how her daughter has become so beautiful, and trying to marry man to marry her. Noku's concerns about his son are more legitimate in nature, but they are self-served (understandable). After leaving his son, he would be alone. A bit in the movie, Kinn's former client has come for her search, a man is so worried about him that he tried to try her double suicide for her second suicide. Unfortunately, he does not come for his love, for his love. The way I described the film vaguely sounds frustrating, but it's not really. Sorry, but not so fatally. It's more bittersweet Unfortunately, I only slightly prefer Christenshom's. The story sounds good when I look back, but it is very slow and dust. I actually stopped the film twice, and I was not tired before I started. This is such a movie that I can appreciate more than that; This reminds me of my reaction to some of the more famous ojura movies. 7/10
