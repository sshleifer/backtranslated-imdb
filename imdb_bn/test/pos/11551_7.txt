Leois Caracas has made three great films: Meet with the boys' girls, Movies Tsang, Les Amants du Pont Pont. Actually, these movies were not so big, but it was the youth's violence, the beauty of the children's desert. Carcass was aware of the film in these three films, but he tried to create his own vision of the industry, without thinking of all that he saw, but using it and wasting it in his time. Pola X is a very different movie because Caracas Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a monstruosity of $ 20 million, has created a film which has destroyed everything in its way. After such a movie you will not be able to do another one from the same perspective. So had to change Leo's Caracas, and he did. The movie is not as beautiful as its first, it is more reasonable, and not a studio, Paris is no longer a dream, Caracas has entered the last reality. It's not clear, it's not poetic characters. Carax has turned it into a romantic in German sense.
