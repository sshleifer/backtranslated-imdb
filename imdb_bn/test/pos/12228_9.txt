I came across this movie while surfing the channel; And decided to give it a chance. To my surprise I enjoyed this darkhorse movie. I felt some genuine chemistry between Challenge Cats and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a light and warm film that I felt excited after it ended. Of course, this movie was expected from the very beginning, but when I was about to finish it, I gave it high marks. I must admit that I have never seen the challenge catches, but I think he can certainly work. When you combine its good acting with its beautiful face and striking images. She has at least makings becoming one of the well-known stars.
