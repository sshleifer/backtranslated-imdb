"Baid the Clouds" is a leading artists group on four vignettes, which sparks from the spark of the relationship of women related to each man. Although the film offers extraordinary cinematography, some delicate visual beauty and a cast of delicate actors, but this split work has a little meat in the bones. A taste of the relationship can not provide it with fullness and offers tolerance that can be completed in more than four hours with another story. Yet, despite the pastoral, stacked and lacked substances for the "outside the clouds" for the dillitants, there is a visual festival for everyone.
