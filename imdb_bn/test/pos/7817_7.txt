There are quite a few reviews of this movie's cast comment. It is enough to say that Alex Cord played a strong lead against Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. My concern is that many of you are not aware of the two versions of this movie (at least). In the US version, Claire McCord got the reminder of Governor Lem Carter and then released from the city. I agree that the last satisfaction is less than that. However, in the original Italian cut, Clay McClord came out of the city (as unprofessional as he turned his pistol governor) and was gradually subdued by hunter-gatherers who gradually destroyed Escodino City. Bauati killers are excited to share their $ 10,000 reward, but Macduff is disappointed to find Amnesty agreement in body pockets. When they move away, they hear a comment, "If this is necessary, then I'll start hunting hunters!" . This takes a minute to pray alone ... to die for a second and puts it even on a playground with movies like Keoma and Big Gundown. At the end the credit says in Italian cut "fine".
