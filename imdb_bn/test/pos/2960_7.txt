One deadly Tonto stood alone to protect three innocent lives. A terrible woman masterminding a deadly plot. Racial tension Smart Indians <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This TV series is never seen in the series, but this movie mixes them all. This is mostly the Lone Ranger film, it only mixes enough with the formula that the series is tired and will still enjoy it. Definitely recommend for any fan.
