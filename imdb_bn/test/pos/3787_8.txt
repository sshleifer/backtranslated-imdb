Spliler below <br /> <br /> 'A dog's life' was most remarkable for his excellent comic timing. Since 1918, in Charlie Chaplin's other films, 'Shoulder Arms', silent film genius has focused on a completely different mood of humor. His war comedy is a supernatural, excessive collector set piece, which shows Chaplin's unprecedented creativity and composition mastery. When a soldier's bunker gets flood, the water level reaches exactly the height so that Chaplin can successfully achieve his successes. In the next scene, the soldier creates a tree-like dress, which falsely fills Chaplin's loftiness and stupidity. Naturally, when the enemy invents his silver, the soldier directly darts for the forest. Next Chase is a visual wondrous thing: Chaplin does not hide the soldier from the Germans, but he uses the forest to unmask the soldiers' masks from the viewers, such as the camouflaged soldier is trapped in the middle of the frame but still invisible. When we felt our little hero was running fast on the German army; Our joy, fun is also on us. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 8
