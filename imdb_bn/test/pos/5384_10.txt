Boena Dewil is the first large studio, complete length feature featured entirely in 3D process. Proponent Obloya went to Africa to shoot a different movie for O'Balla, but hearing about the story of two food lions, the terrorists of the railway terrorists took this decision. This is a good story, almost like Hemingway; Fear, release, great white hunter and all. This is the story of the story that seems to be dragging, in a new way, the filming was very important for the crew. The action scene is strict, almost too staged. But these technical issues are displayed in a small way in the light of the dramatic conclusion of the film.
