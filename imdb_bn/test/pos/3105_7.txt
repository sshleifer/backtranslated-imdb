In the decade decade-decade decade decade-decade decade-decade-decade decade-decade-decade-decade-decade-decade At the end of the decade of the decade, he was cast in renowned films. Obeats And since the horror films were very popular in those years, enjoying the horrifying elements of the plot, enjoying the mystery of murder films in the last decade earned almost similar popularity (in which the first film was produced). For the creation of the horror films of 1933, Warner Bros was selected to make film with Frank R. Strayer, the independent filmmaker, Max of the Max, "Max of the Max", after his three plays "The Max Works", and " The Lost Walks ". <br /> <br /> In" The Lost Walks ", John Millen plays the role of a young playwright Priscot Ames. With his new game, he wants to topple the famous Broadway producer of Harmon Wood (Richard Karl). Aimee Woods and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) take home in his home, but his car stops mud during a horrible storm. Three men ask refugees in the old palace, which may be the property of one of the oldest acquaintances, inside the house, Wood and Homer Ames and homeowners testify to the strange relationship, but these plans have been speculated to print wood: everyone in the house is playing the role of mystery. Unfortunately, the murder is done for real, and Wood and Homer feel that it is all fake After discovering Ames's original plan), Caste knows that inside the house someone is a real murderer. Expected, Charles Bilden's screenplay of "The Lost Walks" highlights the classic elements of the story of the mystery stories of the murder, because in our old dark room the stormy night, suspected suspect groups and comedians are touching. However, what is interesting about here is that this movie actually made this movie a real fool, with the many twists he has played in his story to play with the mysterious play of the film. The dialogues are full of excellent, intelligent and light-hearted charm, and when the plot ultimately loses immense amount of vapor (it follows the mystery of the killings), it never blesses interesting and entertaining for its smart twists and especially its quirky characters. Interestingly, there is a clear gay theorem that it is never denied at the time of stereootic and it is actually a fun thing. <br /> <br /> Director Frank R. of 1934. Straire was already an experienced craftsman in the industry's poverty line. , But his partnership with writer Charles Belenen would give him some of his interesting films, and "The Lost Walks" was one of them. Clearly, while finishing the ideal production costs of a shoe budget and its independent movie, Sterer managed to take advantage of his set and creates an atmospheric film that fits the mood of the story and the voice. Pansing was slow, but Streier knew that the power of his film was in Belden's script, and most of his cast was able to maximize his characters with excellent results. Surely the death penalty is a bit ideological and irrational, but Stewart does an effective job in this movie. <br /> <br /> As the text above, the screen is filled with a great line that brightens playful characters and luckily, most of their cast with this advantage. Veteran actor Richard Karl Crankie, as a producer, Harmon Wood, added a lot of fun to his character, especially in his view with Janani Arthur, who played promising secretary Homer. Arthur gets the best view, and he gives as cowardly yet wicked assistant and gives delightful performance. John Millen is as effective as Prosecute Amos, nothing is not surprising, but it's not really bad, and it can be said about June Colerie Glorro Shaw (compulsive love interest), which is just fine. However, Donald Kirk is really enjoyable as the harmful Terry Show and it's embarrassing that he did not get more screen time. <br /> <br /> Frank R. Naturally, the low budget hurts the film with stereo movies. Whenever the Stereo makes the best of it, the film seems to be occasionally flat. However, the main problem is a very slow problem, even when the movie is full of surprising moments of wonderful dialogs, it moves at a pace, so that it can be annoying and tedious for the moments. It must be said that Milan and Colear are much more interesting than Arthur and Carl, and more than the comedic tide that they attract more than the main couples. Finally, not to the high quality of the writing, such as the weak and the first and the middle parts of the end, even though the credit must ultimately go to Belenne to maintain the spirit of creative conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Some might say that Charles Belden is an extraordinary hero of the mystery of the killings. Among the deer and mystery films, "The Poirotti Row", the best of the B movie studios known as "The Lost Walks". In addition to the flaws of Streier's earlier pictures, "The Vympaya Bat"). And even when it is not the best composition of the genre, it's a great way to enjoy a great road that makes it fun as the mystery of the killings in its own zeal. If you like the style a very recommendable film. 7/10
