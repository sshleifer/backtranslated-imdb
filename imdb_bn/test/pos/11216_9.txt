In this episode, Lock and Echo "?" The symbol that we saw during a previous episode lock-down. Michael, Ana Lucia and Libby were shot dead, Lucky Inches struggled with his actions. <br /> <br /> This episode (I think) is the most interesting thing. Commercial break time The plane was found in search of a Bay of Lakes and Eco sea, which was killed in Boone during the season and ended with a new training video "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989". In the following commercial breaks, rather than a malicious and nondescript crypt ad, "The Hanso Foundation" (a commercial plantation), and the advertised website (www.sublymonal.com) leads the audience to the world through information about life outside the story of LOST. One must watch for all the fans!
