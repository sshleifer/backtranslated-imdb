They love him and turned into a horny toad! God, that gets me every time. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. From the memorable line, "Thank you God for giving birth to your mother; She saw that she was ashamed" "I do not understand, Big Dane". Great scenes, from the scene of an open train (I smile heavily) in Bluegras <br /> <br /> <br /> See this. It's good, it's cool, it's fun, and it's based on a famous story. Your time is valuable, I believe. If you have a weak bladder, do not see it, because you must wipe your pants to laugh.
