See the last episode, No. 32, (although the site only spoke about 30 episodes) and I must have done this series very well and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the crime / copy of the story. It is to be noted that at the end of every episode of court sentences issued on criminals of 32 criminals, information was actually based on information, I was brave that it was sometimes a great, good acting, credible and brave series. Denmark's powers have decided to break the unit, that their work was so incredibly incredible and at least in the series, "to get their people" failed! This is a certain 10/10 for me.
