The classic plot line is one of the most classic, monk-ninja flicks of all time. Being in the plot that this woman's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit. I want to be honest if I could gain the power to occupy it. In addition, in the 80's and in this particular decade, Nija's view was much more obvious, and despite that, Enzai 3 was able to keep its control original from American Nyanja Cookie Cutter Mullah, which is so harmless for the 80's so long. This chick is clearly on the steroids of Michael Dudicoff .... I want to say the first American ninja was superb but the real people will find it is not the perfect 3.
