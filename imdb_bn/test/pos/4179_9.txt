This image is flopped at the box office and for today's recognition it struggles for struggle, it is a great tragedy - yet which is appropriate. This film is produced by Mankesh's commercial suicide depicting metaphorical suicide on-screen. Harmfully, Beattles, as an alternative alternative to Beatles as a substitute alternative to destroying their carefully created image, is brave at the point of rape, as in the entertaining entertainment industry (literally, in the film literally) artificiality The series of the Monkeys television series was not in circulation, but the HEAD was completely uncontrollable ... although in the end it actually has some kind of round logic. Unrestrained by a real story, the surreal series of events is by hateful and rather annoying. The greatest ridicule is that, when they reached their artistic peak, Monkas signed their death penalty effectively as a commercial death. His search in Psychedelia reached his Gene with Head Soundtrack (all the songs are memorable in the movies), one of the 'sixties landmark albums. After the box office failure of the film, the monks were cut off, but Head worked as a noble succession.
