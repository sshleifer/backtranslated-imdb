Claire Booth's "The Women" shows a relationship with a man from a woman's point of view (and the 1939 film also plays the interest of Joan Crawford: a character that may be Amanda Farrow 20 years ago). Here we see a bunch of male letters and what they do. They use women like toys and throw them away, leaving women suffer. Surprisingly, the "women" women, which we probably see, is shown as "beautiful" one, (Narma Shear), "birds" growing, light, and less than planned. The end "Best of all" We see men for the cad, when women are mostly innocent and weak. They <br /> <br /> <br /> Diane Baker jumps from a car, (probably the most unreasonable scene in movie history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls from a fire escape. Women in the film are running at work, at the same time looking for success and love. Women will jump in the future and in the next decade, this kind of soap opera will leave. But in the 80's and 90's, they will be back in the novels such as Sydney Sheldon and Judith Krantz (though their trashy works are not that good). <br /> <br /> This image shows the way. I love the 50's and 60's shiny cinemaspope movies. We look a lot better than pixel-challenged home movies, especially when we look at the TV in the Letterbox version and in the DVD, the picture with the picture is so clear that you can walk in it. The beaver appearance of young beauties in it is also memorable. This film is probably more beautiful women than any other. This is a supermodel, a beautiful queen, (Mourina Hansen, who did not Miss Missa in 1951, Ronna Jeff told the DVD commentator, but according to IMDB, Miss America 1953: But so what), and a player player, (June Blair , From January 1957). My vote suji, is always one of the wonderful beauties. Here his performance is not so terrible that people pretend: They are reacting just as man tried to work in Supermodel's view (first, really). Nobody cared well for the better. Her role, apparently, is the world's most dangerous woman, it is the most complex of the bunch and it's all right. <br /> <br /> The most sensitive thing in the film now increases in age of women. Hopefully they printed this picture in the spring of 1979. Dian Baker was 20. Susie Parker is 26 years old. Hopefully, Grace Kelly's successor saw, it did not really grow up and made Mrs. Muir harm on television and, in IMDB's report, it was important to live in a house with "pieces of coffee table" because she died in 2003 at the age of 72 Spent money. This image can be very remote and irrelevant memories by him. . Unemployed, always a welcome face on the 60's TV, (especially to Richard Kimble), and still active as actress and acting coach, 67 years old. "Best of all" was found with Bradford Dealman 40 years before Parker died at age 70. Lange did the same year. But here they are young, beautiful and aspiring for success, like their character.
