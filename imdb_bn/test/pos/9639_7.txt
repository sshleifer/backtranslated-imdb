The first war ships and planes of the first world war were added to Adriatic in this wonderful war drama. Walter Houston is excellent as a commanding officer who knows about his position and there is no room for personal feeling in it. Ship safety and mission must always come first. Robert Montgomery Lieutenant who is still not able to play a role in a fight. He made a wrong decision, endangered the submarine and his crew, but eventually after the court martial and dismissed from the navy eventually became "real man". Robert Young plays a Lieutenant Junior Grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook. The triangle of equal battle wars between the daughter of Parallel Hawton of the war drama and the sadly injured pilot wife Montgomari and Maja Evans. Recommended.
