Chuck Jones's 'Rabbit Seasoning', the second of the most favorite hunter triangle, is often considered as the best of three. Though it seems almost impossible to choose between these three cartoon cartoons, I must admit that 'Rabbit seasoning' is the most modest honorable script. Here, bugs and defics are emphasized as a language through a series of intricate dialogues of Abbott and Castello's 'Who's Next Routine' grand supremacy. As a long-term Duffy fan, I was always delighted by the hunter triangle because it consistently got Duffy, who got all the best lines (the famous "Pronoun hardship" is one of the best classics of all time) and most work. When bugs play the role of cold manipulator, Elmer, always intelligent dup. The hunting trilogy which makes so much fun is that Duffy and Elmer Bagg's so little threat that he basically kicked back and got some simple smiles. Elmer falls into every trap for him, but it is bad poor Daffy who returns to the worst position, face repeatedly, his bak ends in a more ridiculous position. It's all inevitable climatic announcement "you're upset" to build. As an example of the overwhelming period of Chuck Jones, you will come across, 'Rebut Seasoning' is a real classic.
