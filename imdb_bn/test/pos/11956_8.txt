If I ever wrote or made movies, I'd like one of them to be like this. I enjoy the sense of lingerie and sense of lingerie in the fool ball. Like this movie it's not a stupid thing without it. Places and names are invaluable, Generic New York High School, Squid Calimarii (George's sister), etc. ... Genius. I have seen this movie many times because it was just the staple status of the cable when it grew up, of course I did not get all the joke, but it was still funny. This movie is less classic with time.
