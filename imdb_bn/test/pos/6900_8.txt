OK. Finally, a horrible film that worked well. As soon as I heard the song, I knew that whatever I think was a good effort to create a nice composition of the ol'horror. Zombies, whores, booze, grave robberies and much more A great cast, well played, well guided, good writing --- there was an error. Even the Irish / English languages, American actors pulled it. I thought the actor Larry Fessenden looked familiar to me. It was absent teeth that it was. Finally, I realized that this man was headed by "Habit", a film about New York's vampire. I was excellent in that role. Now I wonder if he is an American His pronunciation "I Sell" was so believable that I felt that he grew up in Panna Island, not in America. Obviously he was born and raised in New York. A great actor - really made his role in this movie. In the early 19th century, like Europe (like Hammer Flix) does not hit a horrible flick set. I would like to get a great time to see this movie encouraging anyone.
