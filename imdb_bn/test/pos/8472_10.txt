Ray is a movie that pauses you. You are really thinking about what you have heard or think about what you read about this person and it does not even stop. During the first watch of Ray, I forgot that I was watching a movie, I thought like a PEOPLE TEAM, I see this guy through the window. This movie is so compulsive that you are dragged into it, and you cross each emotion of your emotional roller-coaster, and when it's on you do not want to hurry it because it has emotional punch that lacks other movies. Jamie Foxx has given her Oscars as a good maker and has earned her performance well and should be kept as standard for any biological photo she wants at any time. This image deserves both classic and legend title title as well.
