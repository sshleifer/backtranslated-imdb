I like this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl in the heart. There are no movies for young children. I like this one because it was the worst thing when one of the boys said "fool". I appreciate them for stepping out and making a true family movie. We've seen it and are looking to buy for adding to our collection, rent it for the first time. My daughter can not stop talking about it. It goes along with our lifestyle. We live in eastern Texas I hope to see more family films like this. He is also known as a "hockey po kine" of our calf! I can not say enough about this movie. I look forward to many more photos like this.
