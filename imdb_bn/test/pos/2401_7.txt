I saw the movie with tears and alternatively smile. After a 12-day bombing, there was a lot of tension in Honey's ruins. And now my parents, who have lived in Saigon for 50 years, living in the country, I realized that we are very good now, and if America did not fight here it would have been better. When I saw the film, I learned the various types of war planned in Vietnam in America, and they created a disaster. <br /> <br /> This series works well in interview with real people. But I do not like it that some people only give general opinion, as the analyst at the end of the series, I forgot his name. <br /> <br /> There should be more documentary pictures, such as life in South Vietnam military camps, and north (if possible). There has been a sudden change from 1972 to 1975 (I'm not sure if the sensor has been censored, because I saw this series on TV).
