It is not a story of two sisters to discuss some details of the small plot, so if you have not seen this movie then I would not recommend you to read this review because it is completely done <br/> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story itself (especially calling the "rubber reality" aspect of Brend Sponsler's description) Fight Club (Lead K Memorable movies of the recorder making their minds, the Mulholland Drive (the character creates a mansonic phagay alternative reality), as well as the films of the Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladders and the mental illness associated with every film under the sun, along with Amanabar films (others, Abre Los Ozos), Memento (especially the abusive of memory is real Related), and so on. Fortunately, these matches do not cease the overall emotional impact of the film, and personally I experience a story of two sisters with an impressive and rewarding experience. <br /> <br /> Many people comment on the nature of "confusing". Descriptive, but I personally think the story is fairly self-explanatory, even if it is represented in a non-serial approach. The story only becomes confusing for some, because the intermediary story through the last third is completely transferred from the intellectual setting (ie the realization of Sau-m's realization) to a spontaneous form. -Mair nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. The emphasis is to force some people to be removed from the guard, but structurally I thought it was a bit of a mention of the Mulholland Drive mentioned (although we are not working on the realization of reality through the dream of a character but rather its own schizophrenic tendencies - whatever, then, I have another lynch film , Remembers Lost Highway). To be honest, I do not really regard a story of two sons, such as a horror movie, rather an emotional story of a family breakdown and an honest look of a character's mental illness (and I'm going to love this picture of quick sequel to the fans who add that fan). Meanwhile, cinematography is incredible in a story of two sisters, and apparently it is one of the most beautiful beautiful movies I have seen on this side of the wing of K. Y. 2046. Performance is fantastic without exception, and I have four more lead in the future. I hope to see the actor; Not to mention music, but East Asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be very few and far between these days. <br /> <br /> This is probably likely to look at the fine artistic view of some people. It is dismissed as two sisters and simply "yet another Asian horror movie", its aesthetic beauty and sensual psychoanalytical approach to the senses. But then each of their own. If you can ignore some parts of the film and it is only the heart that will accept it. A very tragic, heart-broken story, then I see no reason to recommend it.
