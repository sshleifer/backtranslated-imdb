Of course the price is hired! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 years old (and I) loved it. Their captain is on the edge of their seat. I recommend to sit with parents of these little kids, because it may be quite suspicious for them. It's often that you can not find movies that you can see with your children, and so it's a rare search. Some acting / realism is sometimes not at a time, or maybe a little bit, but do not feel like children's goals or care, they love it. Parts are predictable, but the other part is not like - those who are good guys and those bad guys who try to think about. The film does not have any terrible / vague elements and so I suspect it will give children nightmares. It inspires children to dream, which is what encourages us and encourages our children to grow even more. Rent and be happy!
