This movie is very funny - the character of my mom is coming back to me during the movie and time! I can not get her dried lines ... when she told her son Owen that she will bury her girlfriend before she's roasting her girlfriend ... and she suspects that Oven is trying to kill her with unfinished nut! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> This is a great, impressive smile ... must be seen!
