I did not know much about a subject and made it exciting, why not? It was in 1979, director Robert Oatman said that he did not believe that he had ever made a real movie, and he hoped that these kids would walk around Skate board - if he did not break his throat - he would make the first movie. Well, I did not expect such a hope at Stasi Peralta, but he was a skateboarder who made a good film. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film made to use the existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archive footage exists. Parla is not like her former colleagues today-well-edited together with your usual conversation shots. Full effect post-modern with the best sense, but it has been done. Altman's prediction is not quite true. However, what Paratatta did, they keep an eye on the energy of most days, which we can realize to be what it is like to invent Z-old's modern skateboarding. This is all good. I'm very "Dogtown." Recommend
