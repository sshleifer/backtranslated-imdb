Known as the blood brain Abdul Aamir (Reid Haddle), a leader known as the Kahlid is near death due to cancer, but if she dies, then she will separate herself without leading anyone, so Dr. Robert Nigariyan (Grant Williams) and one Amir's fan Mohammed (Jandora Varkov) plans to take Amir's body in America's America, where the mad Scientist said. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will put his brain in the new body and do not conform to plastic surgery. He knew he was even dead. Things should not be done according to the plan, but when the time comes to replace Amir's brain, Trenton's Freak Asist Gar (John Bloom) brings a dead body that comes from a balcony, the trent requires a strong fit liver body, and no longer has the cow's body used as a temporary stop-gap Time can not be found another suitable. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in his new body, he is not very happy with what he sees, because you find that you were inside a badly burned inner inside of your brain? <br /> <br /> <br /> It is also known as brain damage, brain, revenge and the dimming brain, this cheap absorption flick is managed solely by the Al Adamsan and Was conducted and I was sadly sorry that the blood circulation of blood contains 1.5 IMDb in the brain, personally I think it is a very bad fun it is the best sort of way. Kain W. Lin and Joe Von Rogers's extremely entertaining script is lupine and stupid, because they are brain-replicating from the bloody bird, from mad mad scientist, 7 feet tall tall Acid Square Freaks, from the four-foot tall midgut medical assistant, from basement dingion to smoothing the roof From the incident of car accidents, Ragina Carr   লের চুল-চুল থেকে ছোটো মেয়েদের চিত্কার করতে অপহরণ করে, যা খোলার সময় রক্তের ভিতর কারাগারে কারাগারে কারাগারে কারাগারে কারাগারে কারাগারে হাজির হওয়ার কথা উল্লেখ করে অশান্ত হাসিখুশি শেষ যা কিছু গভীর অর্থপূর্ণ বক্তৃতা অন্তর্ভুক্ত! It's all here & blood-stamped quality cheese on all of the brain, if you flicks with a fan's fun ideas if you absorb less bad budget, then this film should 'see' definitely at the top of your list. Despite being less than 1.5, I am proud to admit that I liked the blood's brain, I thought it was a perfect hot look, eventually slowly moving slowly gradually, slowly moving slowly, but at the point that it It was removed like a rocket, it was relatively small compared to just 85 minutes, guess the second solid plot And I think it also loads of fun kyampi. <br /> <br /> It was created by director Adamson's best composition where I was associated with Dracula v Frankenstein (1971), which he created a year ago. Those who have previously seen the Edson movies do not know about any existing production standards, cheap special effects and cardboard sets, and it adds all the fun, the film is designed to make a memorable sighting experience and to impose fines in seriousness. I love the opening of the Kahliids, which is clearly a statue of a picture of Taj Mahal in India! Regina Carroll's hair seems to be a separate entity on her own, it seems to change styles between shots and is really awful, I can not start her makeup so she can apply it with a paint sprayer! Aamir's body has been sent to America, when we see how ordinary tin foil is feeling, why do I ask myself? The effect is variable, there is a terrible looking mesh spider, Gor's burnt make-up work is quite bad though it's quite amazing to remove a brain brain which is actually quite impressive. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The production was low, the music was taken from another film, "Of The Bust of Blood" (1971), and the act was horrific but there was a way to have fun in the camp. <br/> <br /> <br /> The blood may have the best title for the brain, sometimes a absorbing film and as far as I'm concerned it was a very entertaining piece of surprise that I was watching a great time and smile. It is impossible to recommend that they just do not / can not, to find good movies, but bad movie lovers should enjoy it. I like it, but then again I'm weird.
