If you do not see the winner as "ghilili", "guilley" or "ghili". Go watch it. How nice. Her devastatingly ridiculous. I do not know whether Dhani (bright director) is serious or not. There are lots of people in this area, look for the call "Mala". One with brilliantly warm, bright braids. His teeth are as good as well. Victory rock. Trisha burrows every 5 seconds. It's very deep. See it, you will not regret it. This one has some great smiles. If you do not speak Tamil, learn it. Then you will get jokes inside of all. It is one of the whole family, except for the fierce bit should be dropped. I have seen this movie about 11 times ... and counting it <br /> <br /> Wow!
