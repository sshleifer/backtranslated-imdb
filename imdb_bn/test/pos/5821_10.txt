The best show ever until the Oz creator televisions. Better than Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Worrying, brave, and completely boring yet deeply moving. Oz took any of our films to prison, someone who was ever involved in television. Tom Fontana did a brilliant job with really writing. No matter banned. Rape, drugs, kill Oz just proved how good the TV could be. It follows the letters of all the different backgrounds and all the different nations, but always comes back to your publicist Tobias Becker, who is in prison for transportation. We do not want to see what we want to see, pain, death, wounds. Oz will bother you, make you cringe, you look away, but most of you will have to remember it. The oz see is really a real television production view
