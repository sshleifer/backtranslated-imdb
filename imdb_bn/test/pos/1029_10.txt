Awesome mini series has been created. <br /> <br /> I saw most of it while showing PBS American playhouse. Widely spread in time. I believe it can be one of the very shortest series outside of the Masterpiece Theater series at PSB. <br /> <br /> Full-length production was shown, I believe once during its first broadcast. There were a total of 6-8 hours. This length was slightly edited down to 6 hours. Some interesting, but gradually cut scenes. <br /> <br /> I am very much hopeful that people who hold their current rights follow and retrieve it without completing the edited version in DVD. At this moment there is no cost to create a VHS version. <br /> <br /> It will be very good in the continuation of the mini series or dramatic history.
