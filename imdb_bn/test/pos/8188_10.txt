This film is beautiful in many ways: plot, character depth, stunning photography and acting, colossal-like scenery of warfare (there are no computer graphics, thousands of people). Someone said there is something in the story with Shakespeare's tragedy. I found some connection with the traditions of the Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> The emperor, who played remarkably well, struggled in strength and love, but he forced (for the will of his ancestors) choose strength (and the loneliness, hatred of his subjects and daughters) as his fate. He, like Creon in Antigone, was a good guy before becoming emperor. After achieving power, the innocent and cruel (innocent children, his mother, father, etc.) must be in order to protect and expand the empire. He became a monster entrapped by power. Overall, King Emperor is a magnificent Greek tragedy figure. <br /> <br /> The assassin moves from the assassin to the opposite direction and morality. Even this character is forced by love and towards his fate by his new morality. This character is really unforgettable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> He's morality against power, like Antigone anyway. His hypocrisy (against the emperor and against him) always has a moral rationale. <br /> <br /> Conclusion, an amazing movie. If you love movies and you want to try Chinese movies then you can start here.
