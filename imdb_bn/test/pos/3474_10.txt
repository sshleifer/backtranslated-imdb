Damian O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he sensitively manages a very subtle subject, but does not move the film to become a schmalz. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie, it's tragic. Bits and it makes you look things differently. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This movie will change in the way that you see people with disabilities and the movie also provides you with a very entertaining night. I can not wait to find out the DVD
