It's been a long time I saw one of the diverse movies. Generally if they are odd, I will get bail early and rarely regret it. Thankfully, I held for this one. Although I can not say it's a great movie (not it), I can say that it looks like a good acid trip - just a few moments of horror and the rest are filled "I really saw that?" Laughing loudly loudly A great story of the characters with Meridith Eton is outstanding as a dwarf daughter with an attitude. Keep the mind open.
