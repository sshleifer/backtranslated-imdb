My wife and kids are still the best comedy series on TV. I've really enjoyed it and you're still seeing recaps. Wayans bros All should be organized together in one comedy show. My wife and kids were a comedy that the whole family could see and you often do not get it. Can not we do anything to do it again ?? There is something again in the comedy show that we want! 1 Damon Wayans should come back! I really like to star Damon Weinens with the help of the whole Wain's family or to make any other comedy. When I finally finished it, I was very sorry and I hope they will come further in the future. Hope you play comedy nice things! Your really, DezMo
