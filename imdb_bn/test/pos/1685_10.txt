Everything was about Top "Drawer", especially the scripts and highly skilled work done by 21-year-old director, writer, producer Luke Eberle. . . A talented young man from whom to expect great things. All the acting was credible, the dialogue is smart, the theme is important. Loving it !!! It's much more than just an upcoming film - this child can learn hard, hearty lessons about faith, politics and "systems" - things really work for a strong position personal agenda. <br /> <br /> I will recommend this movie to anyone with a brain.
