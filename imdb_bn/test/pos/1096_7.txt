I enjoyed the movie wooden camera too. I think it is a little affected by the Brazilian film "God's Town", but following the social surroundings (crime and art), this parallel is a reality in two tracks. <br /> <br /> I think the pictures Made in Madiba are really beautiful. I do not think that it shoots such good movies, since there are many artists who have no education and can be really gifted. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed many soundtracks. It is compatible with the photo. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie ... It's good to show how a social neighborhood can be.
