I'm a fan of Rachel since the start of 30 mm from the food network, so I've picked him up for years to grow. Minutes to meet with Oprah, I predicted that this event will happen because I have seen that Oprah was with her, and for good reason: she came across very normal and agreed to laugh herself, which is very compelling. The set is interesting, and there are some new ideas (I love lazy Susan to sit on the audience). There's just enough of a celebrity segment, and he's away from the debate and debate (enough of the day's TV). The show is a lightly escaped turn, and he did not move away from his energy (cooking), which is a very good plan. I know his people hate him and hate him. All right, you can not please everyone. And somehow, I think Rachel knows and accepts it. So just launch the channel; I do not think he thinks.
