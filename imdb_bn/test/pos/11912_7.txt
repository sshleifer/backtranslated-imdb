I'm sure this movie has some reasonable gaps, but I'm so worried that I do not really care about it. The movie has been joined with Showergenegger-Action Flick like a fun, light-hearted teen rump. It is packed with action packed with tensions, and there are some fun moments as well. Shane is watching Aston, and I did not see Louis Gossett, Jr. because I saw "Digstown" in the theater. She is a fine, underlying actor and I love watching him on screen. I just wonder what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he is acting on Flickr on many direct videos. Hopefully, my guess is wrong. However, this is a fun, off-off-seater thriller and I definitely suggest you check it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
