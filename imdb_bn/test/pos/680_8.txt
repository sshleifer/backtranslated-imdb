I can see that the film ratings are not high for this movie, so I would like to be a minor to choose this movie. Well, I'm fine and everyone else is wrong (just having fun). I think I like it because I'm a psychologist and I really liked the character of Brudge acting by Ryan. Although he is really dangerous and very fatal, you can not hate him because he is definitely mentally ill and probably due to brain injury. And wow, this guy has done a really good job by portraying Ryan! He felt for Ida Lopino himself because he had destroyed his life. So with so much intense acting and hazard, why is the movie rates relatively low? Well, maybe this is not trustworthy because ... but the boy is entertaining and creative. Try it and do not believe in scores of 6.4 - it's much better than that!
