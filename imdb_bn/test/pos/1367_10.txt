The story involves the release of the ancient monster on a small town on Halloween night. In my lifetime, I have never seen such a Chess film, but it is ** ** entertaining that you can forgive her bad acting, influence, direction and script. This is the best movie made for the Halloween season from Halloween. And when they introduced the character of Linna Quigley for the first time, she gets naked in the shower for 5 minutes. Goodness they are not even better than this. Rush and buy this tape directly. 5/10
