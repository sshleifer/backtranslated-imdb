I was 13 years old when I saw this awesome humorous movie at Adams Theater at the Andam√©k's Endem Theater, I bought the program, and then bought the soundtrack ... I still have both ... I'm 55 years old now. And it's probably not seen once (in the 1960s on network TV, once seen ???) Always unified, great score and production, let other generations see this great movie ... This was my opera role, and with the help of my understanding of tolerance .. Please Gerswhins or Premingers families, soon released this classic !!
