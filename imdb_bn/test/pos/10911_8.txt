Although tragic and funny for gay viewers, Frank Oz is a former student of "O & Out" who has been sanitized on national television for ex-television broadcasters, and sponsored by the sponsor "The Bird Cage" to appeal to the larger and more profitable direct audience. Although the audience may have turned away from themselves despite being tolerant and generous to watch the film, the film revolves around Kevin Kline's Howard bracket, which is a roughly gay gay man. The film claims that the trend to dance disco music, acting in Barbara Streisand, and the dress properly refers to her sexual orientation. Like "Queen I", this movie actually takes a backhand slip straight to the men and their shortage, gentle deviation and lack of taste and culture. All right, so "In and Out" is just a comedy, but even the comedies send messages that can hit. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is some cruel character in the center of comedy. Howard's middle-aged, deeply closed or self-denial, and apparently did not have a sexual life. The three-year relationship with a female teacher in the school where she works is described as a series of sun sets, long discussions and "fun lady". Fortunately, Emily played Montgomery, for the purpose of Juan Cusack Howard, and she stole the whole show. The most fun moments in the film include him, though an effort to tune the dance during an instruction tapes on butter's behavior is pleasing. He is a gifted physical actor, but the film gives him a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon stands as a student actor, and the clip from his Oscar nominated film about a gay soldier is shallow. However, despite the gay theme of the film, boy-girl-boy romance, and only male-to-male kisses, and that smoke "Godfather II" in the love of Michael and Frédé Corleone as a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Although well-motivated, "In and Out" it fails to address the stated injustices and predictions. Howard is fired from his teaching work in spite of his outstanding performance and credentials, yet a little distraction is expressed. Howard's self-realization, which takes place overnight, and most of the characters are more annoyed about the marriage of cancellation than its sudden and unjustified dismissal. Surprisingly, Howard's parents, Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brylinie are heartily pictured, and their students support him. However, the sweet final audience was embarrassed as the audience as it was apparently on the film in the Hood Bracket. The film would become more immediate, if it wandered around a man dressed like a slab, had a great fan of football, ran a station wagon, listened to local music and lived in fast food. In spite of some good performance and fun situations, "in and out" stereotypes should be set and stereotypes should be kept in the dust of social history, whether they are positive or negative.
