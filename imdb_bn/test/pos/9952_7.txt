William Shakespeare's Venice traders illustrate the 16th century Venice Al Pacino played Shylock, a shadow of Jewish debt that took a vengeance against Catholic revenge. In the beginning of the film, slow moving plot that builds up to two plus hours. The film gives a very good and believes in its character, especially Pacino look. When a pasino plays a Jew, he will hear that it does not work to see the role of casino's previous gangster type film. Even though it works very well, film costume designers and directors must give credit. The appearance of all the characters fits with the time of the game. Clothing looks like Renaissance, that it can be. <br /> <br /> The film looks very anti-Semitic. From the first minute to the end it is shown how Catholics try to take advantage of the Jews, which they can do, even lock them in "Gates" and not allow them to do regular tasks. Compared to The Passion of the Christ, another recent movie, which people believe is very anti-Semitic, creates a Venice trader's Jewish holiday. The film shows that the Jews, or at least Shaykh wanted to retaliate for abuse of the Jews. Location shots seem very timely and the scenery sometimes depends on the look of a very beautiful or very ugly film, making it more realistic. Showing beautiful and ugly can be seen as anti-semitism because ugly is often seen around the Jews and the Catholics are beautiful around. <br /> <br /> While filming definitely strives to make certain parts of a serious ure do not add a bit of humor. Through such a serious trial among Sialk and Antonio (Iran), Portia (Collins) and Neris (Golden Horsh) came into trial and decided who would be the winner and the defeated. That may not be fun at all, but they found that women were wearing clothes in disguise because it might be very nice to men. The cross-dressing scene, compulsory for it, was perhaps more memorable that the artist and director of the show Michael Radford noticed that these two women still feel like women and can be easily accepted. The director also noticed that men are speaking through their regular voices instead of hearing words like them, which apparently went away but did not kill it completely. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film gets 7 out of 10
