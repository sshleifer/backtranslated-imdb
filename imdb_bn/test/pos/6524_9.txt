Supporters of the apocalyptic movie will enjoy this low budget thriller, which is essentially a revival of the 1951 George Pal Classic's "Remax Collapse" rebuilding. A comet is directed to a clash around the world and when his fellow scientists ignore the warning of his anger, then scientist Peter Croft (Dennis Hooper) secretly collects a group of private investors to build an underground shelter. <br /> <br /> The story is published by the eyes of muscle-bound Gulf War veteran Jack Looye (Peter Unani), who unknowingly discovered the hidden refuge of Crowford and then decided that Crownford was wrong to hide the rest of the project from the rest of humanity. As a comet's perspective, what makes a living and who will die will make it interesting for theater. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not the same as in Spesberg's war. World, because I think this playplay is good. Some of the scientific reality needs to be postponed, but it is appropriate for the development of a good story. I highly recommend this film to continuous fans.
