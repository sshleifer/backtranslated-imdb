I was listening to this movie and played it on almost every drive in Toronto-Theater. This is a group that is not accepted by other intellectuals in their college, so they start by themselves and of course it calls on HOTS. This is a funny movie, which is just running with Nostalgia Drive! Lots of fully admired T-shirts, vans, wars, and a football game showdown like no other! It has been compared to "Aluminum House", which is a good movie in my own right, but I can not compare it with HOSS. It's funny and has its own brand of character. If you are looking for a classic TNA film, see more because H.O.T.S. Girls Rescue, Bombs-Boom Shorts and All!
