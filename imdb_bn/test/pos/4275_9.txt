As a local actor, I think that "Grace" shows what Broadway producers are looking for, and it shows a small part of the acting population. Although my loved ones did not win (but came second), I compared myself with them and saw what I liked and where I could improve as an actor. <br /> <br /> They brought Olivia Newton-John because she had a clear link between Broadway production and television viewers. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from this movie ("Happy Devoated," etc.) because these songs will be included in the new generation. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that B'Aw cast seems so old, but you should remember that these people are on Broadway and they have their tail in there. If the whole cast is green and fresh, I believe that the casting process compromises which producers select their talents.
