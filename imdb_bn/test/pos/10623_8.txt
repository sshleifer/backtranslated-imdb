Reading through the comments, La Pianiste seems too meaningless about mental abnormalities. I make it difficult to understand the outstanding performance of Isabella Hoopert. Huppat Chhatkana - He directed the woman to spontaneously reveal the spontaneity and confusion. <br /> <br /> The picture is surprisingly judged and judged. It would be so easy to draw lead as a ridiculous figure - for example, consider the porn store scene. Somehow, Hooper is able to carry it partially due to his remarkable performance, but because the director makes his real life real and recognizable. <br /> <br /> Do not ignore this picture. This is one of the most amazing and compelling movies I've ever seen (and performance). <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
