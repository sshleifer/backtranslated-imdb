** Spirir ** A "hero of war" is not only a person killed for his country but also a person who does not even think about how to be a "hero of war" at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film, with Norman Rockwell painting, Home Home Front's WWII The story of love has been nicely photographed. That is not continually drummed into his head for himself and for the war campaign. The Marine Corps Merion "Headg" headgear, John Michael-Vincent, was taken out of Washington by the boot camp five weeks later and forced to keep a baby's blue marine uniform, which shows that he did not have the corpses. Before leaving for St. Louis, he was frustrated and amazed at where he went, and His father, who told his family to the Marine Corps of the WIE, would think he could not "cut off" the US Marines. . <br /> <br /> Heig is trapped in a bar and after sitting beside him, a Marine member of the futile and deadly Marine Riders Richard Gere, whose praised hedges buy a beer. He is surprised to see Richard Hedge discussing that he is only going to the Pacific Theater after all the war wars and after being confronted with the medal, he is being sent back, but after finding the gray-haired gray hair and thirty-fifth explorer Richard 21 months later! What is the Marine Corps and the WWII! To buy hedge, Richard drags out the drunken baby blue and releases his children out of blues and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with some money to hedge. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge Richard's uniform puts it perfectly, he faces this big drunk US Paratrooper, who thinks himself as a cement-head in a boxing fight with Marine Ryder. Cement-head can do everything hedges in order to force them to belt, after capping two beer bottles on cement-head, Marine, Hedge and Paratropper, Cement-Head. Hedge buffoon head led a big cement incredibly knocking out with a sink! "I think this technique is not hurt at the top of his head". Hennaz laughed at him, cement head, colleague G. Eye. <br /> <br /> Hit the hiking at this small town, Beadwell hedge notice, for the United States military operation camp that is there for Japanese-Americans because they had a threat to US security. Later, Hedge has shown to everyone that he really is an actual hero, the city's people think that he has made his life at stake, to save a despicable "Japs" who has left his two friends together. The interim camp, where they thought they were going? Japan's Americans have made the hedge risky due to the horrific drops in the city dangerously drifting out of the city. Bidwai's people were taught in his activities that "japs", even those American citizens, do not scream like bad and treacherous forests like suicide kamikaze, as they thought they were thinking when they were thinking about magazines and movies. <br /> <br /> Hedge local diner Rose Huddins talks with Glennis O'Connor's very intelligent and beautiful waitresses who have just become crazy about him that Hedge first thought that this is not his uniform. Affect him. Later, when Hedge acknowledged Rose and her parents, she was a US Marine Rider, she was a Rose, and she knew so well the sweet and cherished reservoir so well that it did not matter to her what she was supposed to be , A marine paratrooper or a post office worker, was inside his heart that was actually counted. <br /> <br /> There are several touchs and beautiful scenes in this picture, Hedge and Rose, which shows how movies and films that were made many years ago, which we see and hear in movies today, which are both together with each other. Involved in love <br /> <br /> The film correctly shows the real feelings of the average Americans, not Fony Balen, then in 1943, it was generally not possible to fight about war, and especially to Japanese, more authentic and accurate and good taste. "Baby Blue Marine", it is not good to be seen politically correct to show the hero or leading actors and actresses in return for similar feelings and ideas during WWII, because most people now have a three-dollar bill as it is historically and important when watching the film. From time to time those people are watching the movie.
