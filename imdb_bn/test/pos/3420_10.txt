What was the title of Archbishop Tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? This movie was very annoying in the thought that it was a real story and it seemed that humanity has become so cruel that all these years make me ashamed <br /> <br /> Everyone has the right to save everyone and everyone <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Should be shown As far as being awesome in filming, true facts should be expected more openly that everything will soon be changed.
