He said frustrated viewers who seemingly missing the point here here. This is a fantastic movie, long before Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, excellent and realistic illustration of a middle-class Jewish family. Nuances were perfect and the welding of everyone I felt was superior. I especially saw Judith Aiv's acting, especially talking to her daughter when she comes home one night in the night. That scene was worthy of Oscar. But, really, all the acting was fine. I recommend this movie It's a fun, family movie and a lot of fun before seeing how middle-class families lived in Brooklyn. See it and you will be happy. Some very funny lines and Eugene is a real comedian character - very funny.
