Compared to the competition, soul is one of the 3 games of Calibu; However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the latest ambitious in the nominal higher slash m-up series - the attempts to improve its perfection are not quite successful. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the new method and the changes in the game to try to make the series a new height - but they just make some complicated. Example? Well, the character creation mode is a great idea of ​​theory, but there is no limit to the limitations of reality and for example there is no way to customize the WWW games. Sword mode history sounds fun and exciting for a while, but finally drags and actually feels like making money instead of fun games. Also, the story of the soul mode, which is largely felt gradually with the help of a small dot in the unknown mode and with the help of the Shenmu style mobile phone mode. <br /> <br /> "OMG !!! Do not Do Who You White? SaYng" Perhaps you are thinking more overzealous, but do not roll it-I do not hate this game-this game is great! It is still playing classic games (although some letter moves have been necessarily changed), the epic soundtrack that is known for the most amazing graphics and games. And things as well as new letters (especially Jasamel), who are cool in their own way (besides SatuKa - yes I know I'm nipping). <br /> <br /> It seems relatively similar to the caliber of calibur 1 and 2 it is actually trying to do a lot more than it is. This does not mean that it is not a classic, it only falls within a short period of time compared to its own high quality, even though more characters are better than before and even better graphics. <br /> <br /> Yet the soul Calibu 3 erases the floor with 95% of games - and that does count! Oh and those who marked this review as "helpless" clearly blamed that I insulted their beloved. Good Fanbie / Girl Listen: She is not true! And if she was, she would not even be caught dead with you.
