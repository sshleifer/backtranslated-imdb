"The Kite Runner" is one of the most controversial films of the year, and it is not one of the only controversial controversies to sell tickets to PR people. No, this is a film that was actually pulled from release because the producers started to fear the fear of their actors. Which will give you some sensitive and temporary elements. "The Kite Runner" is an important film for our modern world, because now much more than ever before, we must show the reality of a war that is not just a war, it is not just an acting film, which strengthens the violence. It was adapted from the best-selling book, and some critics have complained that something went missing in the translation, but if you do not bring the novel's luggage to screenings, you'll be very moved.
