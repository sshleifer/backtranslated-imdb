Where do we go from here? That's the question of overriding this photo. There is nothing wrong with director John Johnson's 2003 effort, 'mainly ETC.', It asks a lot more questions than the answer, but not such a ruthless or powerful. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < However, one of the many beauty of this movie is that we are rarely answered. The question is raised ?? From everything to glory ?? But Jansen skillfully compelled his audience to test and answer these audiences, with little help from the letters. <br /> <br /> As well as introducing us to the non-linear parts, the increasing complex and beautiful orchestral arrangement, along with the edges are 1 open. Main character April 8, 1994 morning we meet them ?? The day's Cobain committed suicide. And it is the death of Cobain, and two days later, his journey to Seattle, which acts as a movie retreat. In search of Cobain's life, music, and death, the characters try to try - with different degrees of success - understanding and coming to terms with their own lives. There are some aspects of the movie that you can expect from a low-budget indie film: Performance with a strong performance from the middle to the best, Jessica Scott (Holly) and Blue Wood (Daniel); Some of the conversations are strict but not completely inappropriate; And there are some tiny sound problems, especially once we reach the street, it makes it difficult to follow the verb on screen. <br /> <br /> Despite its flaws, 'mainly ETC.' A solid, deeply influenced movie piece. At the moment of ridiculously humorous sunny, sunny daylight and intimate instability, Johnson embraces all the thread threads and impresses their own struggle and at the same time makes them accessible and engaging for us. And because we can see one or more reflections in these characters, we can identify with the questions and problems that we are fighting with them, and we can look back and see where we were in that day in 1994, many people in the world have changed. <br /> <br /> When Johnson gets credit for the film's writing, editing, and direction, the curry must also be photographed. A tremendous eye and great power of capture and characters to draw us in every of the world, after the Johnson shots shot after shots then managed to produce shots that long after the credit stuck with me. <br /> <br /> and no review this image will be complete without a node of amazing soundtracks. The music in this movie is used in amazing effects; Occasionally, at the time of acceptance at the central level, underscoring the workspace, but sometimes misleading or kitsky music videos do not deteriorate. Soundtrack played as the ultimate greatest hit, although I suspect that the label might not be sitting very well with the manager. <br /> <br /> The new Double DVD archive version has some deleted scenes, trailers, music videos and a Cobain Documentary. Deleted scenes give some insight into filmmaking through ordering and closing options, and it is certainly a behavior of rare and beautiful rain video types. Cobain Documentary Fines, Worse for Wear, and of course, are available for more extensive documentary hardcore fans. A director is obviously missing comments, and I can not help wondering, but if Jensen plans to republish this delicious point at any time connected it then <br /> <br /> The next time you're saying ' Looking for a strong piece of work from the manufacturers, I recommend you get on board.
