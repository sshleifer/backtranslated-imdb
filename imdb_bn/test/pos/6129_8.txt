Like those who hear radio reports about Pearl Harbor attacks, anyone who saw Pink Flamingos can tell you where they saw the first - and after almost 30 years, the film is still the most unsatisfactory, rude, objectionable, annoying, and ridiculously funny movies ever, in celluloid, strong Stomach and hard bones are guaranteed to be tested. Movies are made closely with zero budgets, and some minor artists almost pin down Pin about Flamnis's family stories, which compete for the headline titled "The Filthought People's Alive". How dense they can be? Lots: This movie includes everything from sex to chickens, which I can only describe as a fantastic display of rectal control to help dog toe hopping, and I'm sure that you do not want to eat eggs for at least a few weeks. See it. The star, of course, the Divine ... and the biggest drag queen on earth will be the yearly understatement to describe the Divine. He's a big creator given big eye makeup, big orange hair, and big expressions - whether he's a Charlotte Haston of Drug, and whether he is reducing the awakening, some of the front lunches pauses on the bathroom or moving around the Baltimore's highway, the real-life buyers are amazing, He is both inevitable and illogical fun. Cast among others includes Mary Vivien Pierce, Danny Mills, and family members of the Divine family, forever scary Edith Masses; And Minac Stol and David Lochyi are the white-maid, the couple who sells the baby, challenge the status of the Divine. <br /> <br /> It must be obvious that Pins do not have a movie that is appealing to everyone, and viewers who will be directed by John Watchers only a major quarrel with subsequent films such as Hysperia and Cribbby. But if you want to see something that is totally different, even Monty Python could not even imagine it, it's a movie for you. Just do not forget to eat before you just see it, because you probably do not want to eat - and you just want to keep a barf bag simple in case <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The GFT, Amazon Reviewer
