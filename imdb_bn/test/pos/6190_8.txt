To be completely honest, I fully plan with the idea of ​​'sleeper cell'. After watching the best part of the FX Channel (UK) series, My Sky broke down, which means I miss important endings. But I saw what I saw, it was a big story line, well played and I did not see '24', I thought it was fantastic and it was confirmed for the second season ... <br /> <br /> I saw the best One of the TV programs. Much more realistic and trustworthy "24." Excellent character development and plot lines Islam does not bind, but rather offers a thoughtful and thoughtful approach, which shows the difference between fundamentalist terrorism and true Islam. Everyone will see this show! <br /> <br /> String XX
