This movie takes the voice of terrorism and makes it even better. Hollis is protecting an inventor in Switzerland and is looking for the path of Professor Marrieta, who has become a Nazi. This is a good version of Holmes in a WWII world. Rathbone does a great job with Holmes as a spy and a detective. See this if you like the voice of terrorism.
