The movie was good. The only reason I really saw it was Alan Rickman. Which he did not stretch the southern pronunciation, but he did well with it. Find out that Emma Thompson was really good, she definitely pulled the southern accent. I do not like all the characters in my opinion, one of them is not bad, the other thing is I have notice. I have read all these comments and one person has commented Alan 5 0 Shadow Shadow Which looks better to him and he was mostly one of the whole movie through. I'll give 9 out of 10 out of 10 movies. The film will be even better if I have no other sex in my opinion. Still it was OK. While loving the scene, he said "Aw sh * t" when he was sitting in his car and saw in his mirror.
