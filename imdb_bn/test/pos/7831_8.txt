Ladies and gentlemen, we really got myself a winner here. Actually we do not, but boy this movie is a sunny and always a stinker terrible hootarious entertaining. Poor Alma (returning Julia Ruise) is suffering from an ancient Mayan curse that increases the lethal poisonous snake inside her body. Alma and her disgraced Shaman Hussein Brazzo (Albie Castro, who forcibly insists with the rolling intensity of the eye-rolling) stowaway on a train bound for Los Angeles. Naturally, a group of deadly respiratory can lose a batch so that they can terrorize the filling of passengers. Malachi Brothers, who are working from Iris Fossberg's unreasonable script, directly deals with the ridiculously firmness, which makes the campi cheese curiously a piece of pieces. Cranky CGI effects, patrically ignored general guardar snakes (scary words will be added to the scary rattlnake, which may otherwise be associated with an obscure feeling of irrational damage), plugging speed, total lack of tension or speed, clear train set on rickety platform, and especially Just wondering "You must be kiddin!" The above-mentioned preposterous ends are all honest awesome drops of horror in their jaws. Even better, we do not have a name-cast (if lam), delicious unwanted female nudity, a terrific humn'shiver score of a beautiful smidgen and lots of gross and diverse makeup f / x Bonus points are the token boring little girl that can be consumed by a big reptile and for stoner engineers who smoke from the ollow light bulb (!?). A kitsch halvaar is an absolute gut-up stutter.
