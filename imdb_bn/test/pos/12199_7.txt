Again, government agencies do not bar any public knowledge about some harmful events. In this case, the discovery of new water species that could threaten planet ecosystems. Although no ET animals He thinks, a young man who protects him at all costs, does not understand that he is a child of the species and is getting bigger? And badder this 2005 series had a lot to do for it. It is a family drama, science-fi, some thriller comrades' moments. Characters are credible, well-played and good photography. The show attracts attention. Of course, through any science, suspension should be achieved. And I think it's here. Alas, the series has crashed after series, so we do not get any resolution. Forced .. Here's a general comment that I think is valuable here. Many TV networks and / or movie distribution companies, quite deliberately, seemingly fantastic TV series canceled ?? Especially intelligent sci-fi ones. Now there may be some great reason for this, although the audience is treated with extreme dissatisfaction and rarely called the reasons. This is itself annoying. Really got my goats that the series is canceled, as far as possible, in a clear endeavor to milk the cash cow's milk, the DVD is available, until the issue is issue. The series is good for the audience, but they know what they do ?? A lot of this unfinished series ended up on a cliffhanger. Immediately comes to mind that there are two "Surface" and "ODC 5". If you've heard something good about the series and do not see you go and buy the blasting DVD and end up having an unresolved plot problem? It makes me angry too !! I've enjoyed the "Surface" very much and do not realize that the poor character will be completely in a situation that looks completely unstable? And we do not know what happened next. I believe that these types of DVD articles should have a prominent notice, which is incomplete. Nowadays, I look at buying a TV series (IMDB is an amazing start point) to find out if there is a complete 'complete' series. Buyer beware.
