I remember seeing the truth for the first time. I was completely contaminated away. Here was a movie that I saw different from other gangster movies. So realistic, so Mumbai and so trustworthy. Despite the "company" (which was a very good endeavor) and "Vastav" (focused more on nearby theatrical journey), no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya. <br /> <br /> When I first saw Ab Tak 56, I said to myself, "Indian police now have their own 'true.' At the beginning Nietzsche's quote tells you that this is not a normal movie, about" face-to-face "at the beginning of the movie. It is a cold and scary feeling because you understand that it is part of their routines. <br /> <br /> Abu Taal 56 is a good practice. Whether or not the lash or corrupt police is tired of all legitimate ways to get rid of criminals, with simple shots and camera angles, director Shimim Amin preserves the essence of the character and gives a realistic and rough feeling to the film.Edit is unincorporated and so effective It seems that the music is also impressive and after the hunting and movie hall leave it <br /> <br /> But for me, what the cake really looks like is the conversation and the performer from each letter.Sandav Shrivastav has done a wonderful job as a conversation writer. If I start to list my favorite conversations , But I think I'll finish writing the entire script again. <br /> <br /> This movie talks about some starred activities. Yash Pal Sharma is depicted as deputy inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and similarly life is made like a joint commissioner. Revathi, Rishi Bhatta, Mohon Agashee and Kunal Vijayakaran have a small role that they can play in perfection. Zakin Shukla Nakul Void is an unliktan. The scene where he suddenly shoots the gangster injured ?? O god! He teaches under the teachings of Sadhu Awghesh and firmly believes in him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The original jewelery of her dialogue dialogue with Sadaqa Before any Indian movie, there was no such a picture between a police and a police super. <br /> <br /> I am not a fan of Nan Patekar before this photo, but this picture is a fan of a fan. Like the Inspector Sadasu Agash, the performance of the whole life and the best in what I saw in Hindi cinema. The way he talks about his expression, he is going to press his tea with his cigarette from the way ?? If almost nan can not make mistakes He is teaching Jatin about how police forces work, especially when he is his best in every scene. Its cool and compiled method to do something scary from time to time. His conversation delivery and physical language believed me that he was one of the best actors in the country. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An industry that is accustomed to ill-health and presenting stories, Amin accepts an original script and brings life with a beautiful treatment. I hope he will continue to do great work and can not give Bollywood a miss! If he can do that, I am sure he will be able to calculate in the next few years.
