After the end of the long running 'Happy Hour Ever', his characters were resurrected for 'Terry and June Fluchcher' long running and more popular Siegel- 'Terry and June', although their titles were changed from Flachter to Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry got a new job and as a result, he and June went to Perl, where they ended up with all kinds of scraps - unexpected guests fall into a problem, the boss himself invites himself to dinner and Terry DIY. Trying to try the opportunity but cocking it every time. A collaborative IMDB user branded this event as 'not cute' and 'not well written'. Fair enough, it was not tricky, but that was the whole point. 'Not good writing' - I had to admit that one episode was very poor, but overall I got it very well written, very funny and very good acting. <br /> <br /> This warm heart was sloppy, not unlike next up to BBC sitcom's 'Keep Ups'. Eight different authors contributed to the nine series by showcasing the show. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he did 'Hugh and I', 'Carrier on', and certainly proved in the productions here! June Whitfield likewise had a comedy legend in his own words. <br /> <br /> I enjoy some modern shows - such as 'Steel Games', 'Catherine Tate Show', 'Legit' and 'Empty'. I enjoyed the 'Alternative Comedy' - 'Nude Video', 'The Young Ones' and 'The Comic Strip Presentes' but I'm more interested in the Vintage Comedy. When you feel you do not need to worry about the humor and want to upload yourself. For the record, 'Terry and June' was an extraordinary stuff. Very nice to catch the mood of the show, which should be made to tune interesting theme in special notes!
