I am surprised to like this movie because I "Check my brain at the door and make fun" the school watching the movie. However, this picture touches my heart. I have friends like Emily mentally disturbed. I have unsocialized eve-like friends. And I was in EVA shoes, moving away from fear and fear of others. <br /> <br /> Amy Madigan's frustration among her girls was almost clear on the screen and she tried to bridge the annoying moment she tried to bridge the gap with EVA was raw and painful. And probably I'm most frequent, but I did not see the turn with the coming of EV's father. Usually I make those things faster than <br /> <br /> My reservation is similar to others posted here. I thought Christopher Lloyd's wonderful, sympathetic character (a different role for him, I thought) was unused. What happened to the poem, what happened to him? Will he try again like James? Secondly, like the end, it does not seem to be thought of or done something like that. I hope that I do not have to bite into pieces and all the ends were beautifully tied up, but I felt that I left the oddity with the letters, there was no real effort to cure or cure it here. <br /> Otherwise, fine and songwriter and annoying and some, too, very true.
