I saw this picture on Christmas, and it was a great movie! Postgraduate time and later Cast Story from Westpoint (played by Errol Flin). Although I have heard that this film is not very historically correct (not Hollywood) but I still enjoyed it because I knew little about the incident. <br /> <br /> I thought that Ehrl was brilliant like the Flintster and since I became my favorite actor! Along with Olivia de Havilland, her performance was brilliant and the end was fantastic! Me and Nad Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) rushed towards their death on a big horn. <br /> <br /> I always knew that Iral Flein was a brilliant actor because he was my father's favorite actor. , And I grew up watching her movie as a big one. But I did not see this movie until I actually realized how big he really was. <br /> <br /> I will give 10 out of 10 of this picture !!
