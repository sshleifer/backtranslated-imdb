I'm not fond of musical instruments, but I'm a huge fan of Jean Renoir and Gene Gabin. I hired a scandal in this movie and the hope of greatness from the classic director was even pleasantly surprised. This movie is beautiful. Shots are like speed with oil, some director but struggles for Renoir Master. I can not reveal how much I can overcome this movie ... it's not actually a musical, it only has few safe musical numbers and a grand dance ending. But there is something special about this movie that you feel at the time of seeing it. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of foreign artist film, but I am a musical who loves dye hard and die hard. Schwarzenegger movie I'm very happy or very easy to stop by "La la Land", but this movie has a lot of positive power which is absolutely inevitable - not every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good, 10 out of 10
