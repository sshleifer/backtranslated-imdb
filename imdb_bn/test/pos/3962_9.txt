This is a fun, cute movie and well worth your time. My opinion is better than American pie and similar movies, which are always frustrating. I have not heard of this picture, so I think it did not get much pressure, which is shameful. It does not accept itself very seriously, simultaneously sending serious messages to people about life and life experiences and important issues ... opposing a movie about a bunch of great movies and trying to kick them for the first time. And a baby sticking her ** ** into a pie, but eventually everyone hired and hello-de-dou ... one thing that influenced me was the soundtrack, the superb and normal Chess American pop-punk ... They are really like the Ramones, the actual pank from the previous day ... that itself made the film better! I did not expect much from this film to be honest and I was amazed to see how well the joke was.
