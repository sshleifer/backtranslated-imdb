I saw at the 12th International Film Festival of Athens ("September 2006"), "9 Spirit", where director of film Toshiki Tiada was present and answered many questions to the audience. This road movie is about 9 fugitives, all very different characters from each other. They decided to stay together with their red vans throughout Japan. Every time the van is closed, we see these 9 fianchers are trying to flee from their past so that they can build new life or fulfill their dreams. However, how hard they try, it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to final destruction. <br /> <br /> Although very frustrating film, it is not a dark movie. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful pictures, surreal elements and elegant humorous. The protagonist of the Teodoos could not escape from their "prison" and they face a divine (?) Punishment for their "crimes". They are a small piece of beautiful painting, where the Tokyo Tower lure towards a reverse contrast as a huge knife!
