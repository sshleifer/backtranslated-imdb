About the reality of this movie, the submarine war in WW2 was not a clear precise science. No computer provides accurate details of the enemy, there was no specific instrument in the sub 100% control. All crew went to fight with a song on their heart, and a smile on their dial. <br /> <br /> The people expected to see a "beautiful war" in this movie will be very disappointed, ... ........... good, they deserve to be frustrated, they put the reality into their mouth Qualified. <br /> <br /> Battle is rare, in the right song. It is survival, cold / burning, hungry, despondent people agree to do something to survive. "<br /> <br />" We're Dive on Dawn "is a great example that describes the situations needed for a frustrating situation.
