I always like the old movie but it's one of my best ten darling ... it's all the glasses, the fine of 1940, and the good old fashion romance and it's fun, to boot! Barbara Stanwick is an independent single woman who wrote cooking / home life article for the famous magazine ... on condition that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this confusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by the gifted Dennis Morgan) just to find a roof off along with his friend. He has written so strongly for his easy desire to stay in Homi and relax with his famous home cooked meals. She has now found a way to preserve her jobs and fame ... Add this to the knot that does not help her drunk quickly. Cheerful in fun fantastic and leading characters is a lot of fun. Actor known as character actor "Koodles" (who fits this name perfectly) becomes even more adorable. It has become a must-see movie that I insert with a cup of cocoa in each Christmas season. To enjoy a wonderful, enjoyable movie Christmastime or anytime!
