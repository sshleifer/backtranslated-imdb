I could not agree more than the comments of "cold refinery" and how this film has been kept as an excellent work. I've never seen a movie that flashed my Aidrenlinin, and it happened most of the time when Branson came out with a flame like M-60 and frustrated like 20 young men from a gang, it's gifted. Most likely the best action movie has been made (there is no excessive gap), it can be the best action movie actually made. From the beginning, someone can tell you; When the police let the bronze go, something sweet and say to them, tell them to clear them. Again, the genius. And again in Branson a bad ass. Perhaps John McClelen or TÃ¼rminator is more likely to cool Paul, too cool, even he's just a bad ass. And what's more amazing is that he is a nice guy and an ice cream buyer and he helps everyone in the old couple before killing some Scam bags. Talent Highly recommended, if you hate this movie you are crazy.
