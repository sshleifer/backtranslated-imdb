Strange but wonderful original movie. In fact, terrible horrible, equally fit and ridiculous. A high-rise red brick apartment setting is a perfect backdrop for hunting activities. The idea of ​​secret seal room at such a place is good enough, but when the lead naturally started to clear the old bed, they found it in this room, the scene was set for some classic winter. Cast is excellent. Tania Dampesi actually chewed some scenes after depressing in other full moon films. Joe Estevez proven why brother Shane is so big in Hollywood - while making the bed scene, its rolling eyes are really delightful. Charles Band co-produced with Stuart Gordon and it is truly an exceptional flower moon / DarkWave release. Danny Drave also ordered Helle Asylum along with Dellpse.
