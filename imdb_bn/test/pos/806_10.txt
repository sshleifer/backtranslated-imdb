I might give this if this movie deserves 20/10. "Hollow" is a great cartoon novel and ultimately the fool of most people. I am very happy that this novel was completely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was in the earlier story in the Pyrootte novel. The acting was fantastic, and music as usual, was amazing quality! David Sauchat is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast both perfect their respective roles. I have seen so much that the pirot has been portrayed so beautifully in a movie! Producers shut off - they've made a movie that I will take a lot of time to come along with many!
