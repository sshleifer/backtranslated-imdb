The first child play was a real and functional little horror movie. Although it is hoped, these two awesome signals were spelled out for this franchise. <br /> <br /> Well, when I heard that they were creating the fourth named "Shiny bride", then I just pulled my eyes and "... when will they know." <br /> <br /> <br /> When I heard that they got a great director, he was interested in Ronnie Yew and the strong fiction that Jennifer Tilly was involved with in my interest. <br /> <br /> This image is very well done. It's a humorous, high-style graphic violence, great painter and stunningly sexy Jennifer Toli has a great sense of strutting her most impressive elements during the first half. (I should add that he is also a superb actress.) <br /> <br /> It keeps his tongue firmly in the cheek, without veering it into the camp area. Dolls effect is great and verbal interplay between them is invaluable. It is a horror / comedy more directly than horror but humor is welcomed and well-integrated. <br /> <br /> I have heard that they are planning a boy in Chakir. If they match the quality of this film, then perhaps this franchise has returned a legitimate one. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 8.5
