"Balance of Terror" is one of the best Star Trek episodes still made. It was inspired during the Second World War, in a film about two cats and a mouse game about "Anne Belo" (Robert Mitchell acting). In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play the same game with the Romulan ship. This is a ceremony that represents the famous war-famine romantics, those of Remote Relatives of Volcano. This is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly built for maximum effect. It's interesting to see how the episode contains a series of mistresses, which adds an extra layer of story. Mark Lennard made his star track as Captain, for the first time (later he would speak with his father Ambassador Sir). A must see episode!
