The Man with Golden Arms was one of the four great films at the same time that had to deal with drug addiction. The other two were monkeys behind me and the rain was a hatring. But I think the best of these three. <br /> <br /> Instead of shooting this item in real Chicago's real Chicago, this picture might have been better instead of those explicit studio sets. Who knows, maybe Premeder can not get enough money to pay for the position. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, while in prison, he took healing and wanted new life as a jazz drummer. But many people are plotting against him. <br /> <br /> The first Bob Strauss who wanted to deal with him, especially because some heavyweights came to the gambling town. He used some underhird methods to get the services of Sinatara. Secondly, Darren McGuin is a local DOP dealer who makes Sinatake better and re-employed as a customer. And finally, Allan Parker is his clinging wife who is using a cons game to beat everyone, just keep him away. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was nominated for best actor for this film, but Marty Ernest lost to Burgenne. If the supporter can not win from the East Asian side a few years ago, Senator can win for this, and in the same year, Marty was such a well acclaimed film. Locking up at Kim Novak's apartment will reduce his scenes to you. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker is not getting enough credit for his role. She is actually the wife of some crazy skymings, who would spend a little bit on the way she wants to integrate Sinatra. If he is not nominated for the break-up Melody, he may be nominated for it. 1955 marks the high point of his career. <br /> <br /> Dren McGavin got her first real notice as a very spiral drug drug. Its performance is sure to crawl your meat. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein's impressive Chicago has contributed a great jazz score to strengthen the general realism of the neighborhood. Your family does not want to bring you to any place.
