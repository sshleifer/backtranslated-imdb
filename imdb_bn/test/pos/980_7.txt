I saw this movie from Philly on my flight to Denver. The screen is three rows in front of me and about 12 "x 10". So I'm not really going to see it. But I like Malcolm in the middle, so I thought I would look a few minutes. The next thing I know is that I've been sucked for a long time, and how happy it was and how much time was spent time getting satisfied. I agree with this level of performance that is very good for entertainment. Being one of the older children's boomers, I could see Lee Mazar as a role in the movie, as well as some of the famous "Yesterday" (Jamil?) Are doing fun outside some actors and spotlights. <br /> <br /> <br /> Your basic "child is wrong, the child gets (and then some), and everyone enjoys themselves in this process." No heavy thinking, no great analysis needed. Just a good fun way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> 5.
