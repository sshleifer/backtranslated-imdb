I pick 1 dvd 1 ?? Discount, there is no idea about it (but at that price I can not resist). In short: I was positively surprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did a lot of research. German DVD (3 series 2 part), episodes have been reviewed in 85 minutes and according to sequence. Here are the results of the list of Wikipedia's episodes: <br /> <br /> "Duneded" In My Boot + The Voice (Final Part). <br /> <br /> "Machine warfare" is Hell and High Water (1, 2) + Pod Audience + Jogron Out. <br /> <br /> Okay, what can I say? Intrinsic girls are certainly interesting for older men. I have never seen Charlie's Angels, so I can not compare, but as much as I have seen, I see less for bikini tops and their supplements. Instead, the letters (both M and F) became more interesting. I can imagine that feminists also have fun with this. All in all, probably a guilty pleasure, but there was a pleasure: ^)
