Based on Khaled Hossain's best-selling novel, The Kite Rana's story of friendship, betrayal and freedom of struggle. Before the Soviet invasion of 1979, and all subsequent elements of the Taliban regime were present for the great drama, but in the direction of Mark Forster (Nevarland Finding), there is no such sensitive emotional impact in the film, although it creates a memorable experience, Better acting and moving occasionally. <br /> <br /> Because of the dangers of Afghanistan, set in Kashgar in China in 1978, friendship is a very real film between two open boys, though they are miles away in social and economic situations. The 12-year-old Amir (Zeekaria Ibrahimi) lives in the house with his wealthy and educated father, played by the great Homoyun Ershadi, though his wealth seems to be a little obscure among the world's poorest countries. Although the father is a loving father, he has admitted to his friend and business partner Rahim Khan (Shaun Tawb) that Amir is very soft and "something missing with the boy" There is a servant of the family, Ali (the Prophet Tanah) who focuses on each of his needs and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmudzada) is the best friend of the Ameer. <br /> <br /> Both are not only by class but also by ethnicity. Amir, a strong writer, Pashtun majority member and Hasan Hajra, minority community (10% of the population). Although we learn a little about their heritage or social status, they combine the flying love of the stomach, a popular game of Kabul and Amir's illiterate Hassan by reading stories from the Afghan people. Annual Kite-Flying Competition towards Boys is a big event in their lives and CGI effects are exciting. Kite strings are covered with glass particles and a winner whose wrist string can cut other wrists in the sky. Hassan sleeper runner, who brought Amir as a trophy and a trophy to identify fallen pitches. After the victory of Amir's important competition, tragedy happens that will attract the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> The old woman, who led the old Assaf (Elham Ehsas) who later appeared as a ruthless Taliban leader, attacks Hasan, because he rides a thousand and brutally (stopped the camera), but Amir is also trying to Be afraid. Failure to deal with his perceived lack of courage (although someone would have to think about what he could do to help Hasan), his relationship with Hasan Hassan became criminal power and his friendship became frustrating. In one incident, Amir hugged him by giving it to him, giving him punishment for his inferiority by returning to pursue him, but Hassan would not be loyal despite his friend's adolescence. When Amir called for his father to dismiss his servant and blamed the smoker for stealing his watch, Hasan tried to steal, even though he was innocent. Finally, the situation forced Ali and Hasan to go out of shame. When the Russians attacked Afghanistan, Baba and Aamir fled Pakistan and then moved to Framant, California, where the story came a few years later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Baba has to work at the gas station and sell it. In an open air market, Amir (Abdul Salam Yusufzai) was passing through the living motion, the local community studied to become a writer in college. After falling in love with Kauiyyul's daughter Souya (Atoso Lenny), Ameer finally released his first novel, Season of Ashes, and things seem very positive. When Aamir called Rahim Khan, he went to Pakistan and asked him, "There is a way to be good again", seeing the criminal that he hated his whole life, Amir must go home. He returned to Pakistan and returned to Afghanistan with a great risk and is now regulated by the Taliban to face his past ghosts and discovered a striking secret information in this process. <br /> <br /> Kite Runner comes from a sensitive movie which is related to internal pain that you do not know the truth about your best feelings and allows for a new level of responsibility to overcome shame. It does not hide the pain caused by Afghanistan by war and revolution, it is a pain that is represented by damaged laughs. Unfortunately, it reduces the complex situations of complex people and the level of villain and distorts what has actually happened, in the United States, a US citizen involved in anti-government campaign against the liability of more than 100,000 people for any responsibility of destructive war. Millions more inactive. Although we are inspired by outstanding child actors and represented by PET flight, by independence, Kite Runner abandons his power while attempting to replace melodrama for history.
