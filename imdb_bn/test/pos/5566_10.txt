This series is widely underrated After the series was canceled, I came to Farssa like many. Season 1 was bought and amazed at finding a smartly written drama infused with seasonal buying, romance, intelligence and, of course, a balanced mix of science-fi. For our first series or film, our bats are properly satisfied with our batsmen - and every foreigner with whom he communicates - speaks in English! Okay, some skirts have skirt this problem, but it's the best in Farsca. The point is, the authors pay attention to as much as possible to show as credible as possible. <br /> <br /> Through such a bad programming, it's a shameful that there is not a conservative series like thesaurus, such as the Fransics, to get enough exposure and recognition to stay productive. We enjoy four seasons and thank you, four hours of miniseries, we may create enough words to keep the producers under the show.
