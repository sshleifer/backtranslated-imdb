This has always been a favorite movie of mine. I own a VHS copy, and a few months ago I found a DVD release which is part of my video collection I could also be a big baseball fan and as part of my off-season readings, I highlighted a copy of Robert White's wonderful book "You Gotta Ho Wai", which profiles Japanese baseball ins and out of profiles and challenges. Foreign players who have been playing in Japan. Yesterday I started to read, it forced me to think of this movie, because it appears that the playlist was often operative on this book. Parallel is weird. The Jack Eliot character is closely related to Bob Horner, like an old MLB slugger whose best day was behind him. Hong Kong's classmate Leon Leo, an expert in Japanese league, featured Max "Hammer" Dubsky, who maintained her peace with the disappointment of the Japan Games and her colleagues. Eliot's character goes through the same sequence as Hornner, from the signing of the big fan, the initial success has already reduced the fierce sports media's fuel and subsequent frustration, which is the team's co-workers, fans and separation from the media, the desire to return to the United States. The only difference is that the film adds interest to love and happy touching Hollywood's touch. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about love, I'm sure many visitors have come to this site (as I've done) that the actor who played Hiroko (Beautiful Ayya Takshashi) and saw any other work done it. It's only this movie list. Based on the article I read, it can be seen that this film has a short love scene with Tom Seleck (foreigners) (light by our standards - mainly because they kiss in the bath and they wear a towel) Japanese people (special They do not play any role in any movie or television). This is a real shame, because he (this) is quite talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie for baseball ingredients and cultural differences - then you can find a copy of Robert Whinging's "Gotta WA WA". A well read and a great companion book in this movie.
