My Santa Lucia Koir was elected to be in this movie. All 100 plus When the movie comes at the time of the movie, I was asked to choose only 10. Hello my goodness We were a little girl who went very quickly to get her tonsils because she wanted to stay in the movie. It was hard to choose. Georgetown people are as beautiful as people who are shown in the movie. Kind, kind, believer The city annually annually an annual Christmas Market sponsor in the two weekend sponsors. I was this year and it was wonderful. The city is lovely and people work hard to witch it. When the movie is made it appears as the movie today. With a lot of hard work in maintaining historical values, a lot of credit goes away to historical societies. The award was given to the Principal of the school converted to a charter school by the Colorado Governor for Volunteers.
