An excellent plain movie with a simple message from Hoot. Looks like this movie was for kids, but I know adults will love this movie. The storyline is quite simple. A child moved to Florida will help to turn a football joke and a devious fireplace from the construction of a pancake house. This photo message is especially big for animal workers and lovers. To save the endangered animals in the message you can all about. These pictures are cool acting. Seeing three children was good chemistry. Music is not too shabby. I liked Jimmy Buffet's song in this movie. Overall it is a good family film. I think this film is a 9/10 rate.
