People watch movies for a variety of reasons. This movie does not have a big budget, no special effects, no carriage and no explosion. Indeed, reality is not both of these. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a very real movie about real people, not perfect in any way, but they are put together in a position where they can learn to explore and accept something different, and that is why they are out of chaos. I am not ready to limit the possibility of parasailology, because I am not an expert and do not use the full range of my own brain. <br /> <br /> So look for this picture for the characters. It's full of a complete casting of the wonderful quirky guy's chic. <br /> <br /> In the first three minutes, Kiefer Sothreland reveals the life of Michael Hayden, and he keeps the character throughout the film. Nice acting, very credible. <br /> <br /> Henry Carnary can not be thrown better, and the relation between his 'Harvey' and Keefer's 'Mickey' increases his character's discrimination. <br /> <br /> I totally enjoyed the landmark landlady. , 'Mrs. Ramsay', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There are many hosts in this host, but here the space is limited, so watch the movie and enjoy them.
