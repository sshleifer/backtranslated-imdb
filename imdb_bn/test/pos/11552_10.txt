I saw the Pola X because Scott Walker wrote the score and I greatly appreciate his music. Actually, I hope some provocative and possibly inconsistent French films. I was roasted. The film scene quickly began to fully focus on my attention - starting with the sequence in the beginning, black and white footage of the military airplane and Scott Wakar's beautiful voice threw bombs in the graves. The image is contrary to Pierre's identity crisis (Gillium Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and its consequent (self) destruction. The story is divided into two parts ?? The first illustrates the unintended life of Pierre in a beautiful home in the French countryside, and the second follows his personal personal separation to leave everything with his official half-sister to leave for Paris. Both parts contain some amazing stunning photography ?? The first is very colorful and brighter, secondly submerged and almost mysterious - adding up to a true aesthetic source. Polo X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.
