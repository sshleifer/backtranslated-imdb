I can not agree with the previous comment that "Driving lessons" are more than a little smaller, but a person's accusation is approved by others, I think. In my book, this picture is a pure charm, not a small achievement. <br /> <br /> I could not help but the story was a little less common, how much it was in the genius, but by the end of the plot it seems like a backdrop for character interaction. Julie Walters's Dame Eve and Glory on Hill Actress Although EV did not work steady for years, he did not visit for the last time (if Edina is 65 years old, she is absolutely ready to take her kit-factor at one stage). Some may find its annoying, but I think the emphasis on how much the Ben (Reserve Green) buttons poured in to force him from his shell. Ben has been isolated separately from reality, has kept his whole life under his dependent head, which is a perfect one-dimensional character (despite being tolerant of the old religious mother) some breath of life. I was influenced more than Rupert Grint, who found me very honest and credible performance (not to mention all the sweet mention), I can not think of many teen actors today for whom I can say. <Br/> <br /> The movie's heart was struck by the clashes between Ben and Eve. At first, Ben realized, but also intrigued because the exact opposite of what EVA knows. In the combination of Evie's firmness and the helpful nature of Ben, a real sweetness developed among them, which was filled with unforeseen road trips, which gave Ben the first real taste of independence. <br /> <br /> A few short vowel bits of the tone, but still there was a resounding emotional amount, the main actor a credit Above all I would say that if you want to sit back and want yourself to be impressive by some nice performances, do not be disappointed with "Driving lessons". However, if your picture is not "intelligent" in the vocabulary, then the best to stay away. <br /> <br /> Another small note, touching Soundtrack Sophon Steven's special touching music, is a wonderful touch.
