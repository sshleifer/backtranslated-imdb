I really love the action / adventure films and this is the best one. Of course, we love this genre, Bruce Willis, Sally Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and everyone else, but his story really counts. The best ones are somewhat effective, but we can tolerate those who are slightly "above" as comic book styles. More twists and turns, more frustrating moments between heroes more dire circumstances and film; We also have more action / adventure fans to enjoy them. "The Line of Fire" contains all the elements needed for a Rip-Girling Action Thriller. It is a retired Secret Service agent near Clint Eastwood, whose failure is a bad moment for him. This is one of John Malkovich's worst evil, hateful mental villains, that you can not wait to see him, his "get his qualifications". It's 'love interest' as 'Ren Rousseau'. It turns twists and turns, a shock occasionally and even has a touch of warmth and humor. It is very well paced by the director Wellfeng Petersen and also has a score by the great Ennio Morricone. This one is a real roller coaster journey to a thriller! Do not miss it!
