I do not understand why everyone hates Barney on this. If you hate this event, you will not see it! Her idiots are changing the son "I love you", "I hate you". If you do not like it, fine. However, that's your opinion. But there is no reason to despair Shoke, when it is not bad. OK, so its corny, and yes, it has its flaws, but it's a kids show. Children do not want to be sad and sad, they want to be happy. And Barney helps that. Even at the show, sadness and anger etc, moments and yes, Barney uses magic. But see Barney as a figment of kids imagination. Kids need a escape escape to express themselves. The earth is a sad and difficult place. We all need a place to express ourselves, and be happy. Barney does this to us. This show is great. I saw Barney when I was small. Yes, some people find it stupid. But I saw it, and I was above my class. It may not necessarily make you smart, but that's not the point. I believe Barney's point will provide a place where children can be children and express their childhood attitude. Where the imagination lives. Now many teenagers are unaware and afraid to express themselves. That helps encourage Barney. Barney feared me and helped me to show myself to show. I am now a crystal in high school, an AP student of 4.0, a play student of love for theater and industry, and a new cousin who loves Barney. I see it with her and enjoy it and sing along with it. Yes, its corny and silly, and whatever, but its great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who does not have fun? I love a baby and I love Barney. Great for kids and for those who are from their heart for a child. <br /> <br /> This is a great show for kids and kids. So close the hatred. Say that you do not like it, but turn it off "Do not show anymore" or "Barnes Load of Bal" or whatever. Keep you in A cold pill or whatever. Here are some things: I did not like Street. But you do not see me go: "Grover's burden of a calf" or "cookie must die" or whatever. I hate the ball ** ** that people like books or movies like barley or twilight. If you hate it, okay, whatever. Nobody cares. Do not go to tell me the thing about hate, cuz you can just insult someone.
