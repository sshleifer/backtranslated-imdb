I am a sucker for a modest superhero movie. (I'm not counting the super bug budget, there is no story of Batman) <br /> <br /> Some of my favorite phantom and a budget film known as The Demolitionist. Black Scorpions can be added to that collection. <br /> <br /> Get this movie if you have seen the Demolitionist. It is basically a copy of that heroine. (Even it makes the same person bigger in both movies) <br /> <br /> If you do not, then explain to me ... a policeman is killed and he wants to take revenge. He laces up the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, a skimpy team that looks absolutely great on the Joan Severance) and goes out to kick anything booty. <br /> <br /> This is a fun, action packed movie, remember that you may not have children see it ... without seeing it, to see if you have seen it in the beautiful graphic sex scene. In my opinion, there was a bonus (well, this is an extra star <grin>)
