Critics claim that this film is one of the worst movies ever. Viewers have the same claim. But that currency is on a flip side. They're wrong, too wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A story that reflexes in the real world. This image is like a mirror. People see you in a different way. In order to truly understand the attitude of the directors, you should see it another time ... <br /> <br /> When you see this movie ... try to understand the story (and see the background) ... Listen to the song lyrics. And industrial blanket ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is of one type. You'll hate it (most people do), or you like it (and it can fully understand) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I agree with the second part.
