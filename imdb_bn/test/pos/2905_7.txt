"Egyptians" was the time of the reign of the most impressive figure of the ancient world, Pharaoh Akhtinton, who tried to introduce an Egyptian religion, eutenicism, ancient Egypt in the one hundred centuries before Christ. The main character, however, is not Akhenaton, but senior fiction. As a child, Xinhu is secretly found floating in a basket in the Nile River and passed by physician Senamut and his wife. When he proceeded to masculinity, he followed his adopted father in medical profession, initially working in the poor (as his father) in the city, but he and his friend, after protecting the aspiring young soldier Horamehave, got specialty. When Pharaoh's life was a hunting expedition in the desert. Sindh is appointed court physician, but the courtesy of the Babylonians becomes upset with Nefah. Sindhu does not destroy himself for failing to win his love, but neglect of his duty means that he is unable to save Akhtar's daughter. Sinhu went into exile, where he succeeded as a healing neighbor, but when he was attacked by a plot of plot, he returned to Egypt. Although Akhnnatan had forgiven him for his previous crime, even then Xinhua found the country unsettled. As a result of the efforts of Pharaoh's new religion, there has been a housewife among his followers and priests of old faith, and he is very calm by nature to take action to deal with Hittite's threat. Xinhua Horemheb, now the General of the Egyptian army and Prince of Akhtar, tied a plot of Bakatitan and overthrew Pharaoh and replaced him with a more effective princess. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses of the film are mostly two romantic subplots. In the film, Xinhua was released as a long-lost son of Pharaoh and half-brother of Akhtar and Bakataton. Therefore, it makes a modern audience wonder that he may love her; Marriage between brothers and sisters was not considered illogical by the criteria of the Egyptian Empire, but in the 1950s film audiences were less liberal at this stage. In any case, the love triangle of Harembeb-Baktuman-Sineh stops an unnecessary complexity and the role of absconding in the film, which is cold eyes, the fear of the realpolyak voices. <br /> <br /> Nefer Subplut, which takes most of the film's first hours, is overwritten and too melodramatic. Nefer is a morality but interesting, and role requires great dramatic skills for a great actress and its credible, especially Nefer acting as a Jean Simmons, as a woman achieves difficult work to win away from Sinuhe (who plays the Matite, competing with each other towards Sindh's love) . It is unfortunate that the actor went to an actress as playwright as Darby, whose only competence was that she was the concubine of the producer, Darryl F. Junkook. Darby was not just a wood actress, but also spoke with a fat foreign accent, which is more unavailable with a lisp. He was not particularly attractive as compared to Hollywood's two legends, Simmons and Jean Terny Buckatman. <br /> <br /> While filming it on the main political and religious themes, the film is good. Other actors are better than Darvir, although Peter Ustinov, like a servant of Sinha, did the same mistake in "Spartacus", which does not need to try to bring a comic refresh to any movie. His voice, however, was a lot more Patrick for a "comic servant" role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He dealt with the challenges of reflecting the character of Xinhu, the unimaginable idealist, the lover of the fool, the spectacular view of the final scene, with the challenge of reflecting cruelty. Victor was not the greatest publisher of mature actors, but he is right for the role of herme, it is real, low world people. He has been better than "Demetrius and the Gladiators" than his other epics since 1954. Brightly beautiful as Simmons Merit. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding (now known as my second Elizabeth Taylor) concludes Akhnautan as a holy fool by becoming a philosopher king. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an inappropriate ruler, but there is a prophetic view of his peace and justice, which maintains much more moral glory than he expects of replacing him with a throne. Although the Old Testament was common with the highest spirits of controversies than Jehovah or Trinity Christian God, Yet a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between Atenism and Christianity. In the movie, the "symbol" of the film was selected as suspected of a cross, but in reality it was not unique to primogeniture, it was a common Egyptian hieroglyph for life. Aknatan's language often has a biblical ring; John Baptist remembers "the voice of crying on the thighs" (the headline of this review) by comparing himself with "the wind storm in the desert". Seeks parallel to the story of Moses in the Old Testament under the Indus River. <br /> <br /> At the end of Sindhu movie, who inherited Akhenatan's soul, he earned his own moral magnificence. The film's message is, if our workers like Horemheb need a real need, we also need those dreamers and thinkers who are ready to ask, "Why?" For all its blame, "Egyptian" is a film that is idealistic and human in both religion and politics. 7/10
