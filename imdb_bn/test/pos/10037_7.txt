This movie is good for entertainment, but not historically reliable. If you are looking for a movie and think yourself 'Oh I want to know more about the life of the cast and his last stand,' they 'die on their boots' and not rent. However, if you want to watch a movie for the benefit of an old western movie, with a little romance and a good story, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the first day's castle (Iral Flein) in Western Point. Everyone loves her charming personality, which lets her move away from most things. Following his career from the film West Point and his many battles, including his war in civil war. Little Big Horn completes the movie with her last stand. In the battle scenes, he found love and marriage with Lively (Olivia de Havilland). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Their chemistry on the screen you believe in their romance. Acting was impressive, especially Katie's comedic role (though stereototype) was played by Hattie McDaniel. His character must laugh at you. <br /> <br /> There was a tension in the war of heroic warfare. Set of beautiful clothing era. This script was mostly for a while, although the movie was still enjoyable. Director Castor's screenplay as a hero and shows history is controversial. Someone will watch this movie and see the cast as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn to hate him. <br /> <br /> This is a thaw for the western film of 1942.
