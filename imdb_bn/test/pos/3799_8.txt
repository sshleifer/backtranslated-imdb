30 years ago I saw this movie on the late night TV outside Buffalo and I'm going to die before seeing it again ... well .. you know. After the tiger, interacting between the main characters (Eli Walch), his hunter (Anne Jackson) "captives" is absolutely ridiculous to attempt a missing abduction. Charles Nelson Rally is a Neuroticaic University Dean (?) Or head of the division's screenplay Amulya. How many films can you nominate, which is able to enlighten the meaning of humanism and the fulfillment of the struggles from the beginning to the end? This movie reminds us that we are in the same struggle regardless of class, race, gender or religion. And the owner of the suburban home owner will forget and attack some small weed of knee, which dares to show his manicure lawn overnight!
