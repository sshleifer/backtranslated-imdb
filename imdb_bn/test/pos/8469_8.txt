In 1891, the Scottish inventor William K. L. Dixon surprised Thomas, his boss, Thomas Alva Edison with his extraordinary work for the development of the film. After many tests, Dixon was able to capture the real life scenes with his camera and his inventions were able to reproduce them through kinetoscopes, such as a division during celluloid. Soon, Dixon's ketotoscope would be a huge success as a new way of entertainment, many people were interested in nickel cutting, which enabled Acrobat to perform the stunts for people to be able to dance or through the "pypso" of the conescope. However, the discovery was not complete, to illustrate real life, we know that the term was needed in the film. So continue the Dixon experiment and this short test, Kinetofon's first film was the result. <br /> <br /> This study has only been coded as "Dixon Experimental Sound Film", directed by William K. L. Dixon is standing in front of recording cone for a waddler cylinder (the first method to record the word), playing the song "Song of the Kevin Boy" with his violin. The camera was recorded on the cylinder at the same time recording its movements. To show a motion picture, Edison decided to dance in front of two "Black Maria" laboratory cameras. Writer Vito Russo has claimed in his book "The Celluloid Clot", that this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, because it is probably a reference to the lob's loneliness environment, which was dedicated to the "song" cabin boy "just like the sailors alone The title Rosho said, "gay brothers" were actually "gay" in the late 1890s). <br /> <br /> Sorry, Dixon Unable to produce desired effects, and Kinitophon could never produce synchronized audio with images, the image had cylinders with the word and celluloid, but the synchronization of the two components was not effective, and the sudden appearance of the simmatography of August and Louis Lumia was made by the Edison team to focus on the projecting system. Inspired and remains for Dixon left the company. Fortunately, Dickson's cylinders were rebuilt with the film in 1998 and it was reinstated as the purpose of the film editor Walter Mo. Finally, "Dixon Experimental Sound Film" is heard with synchronized sound, as it was intended for its creative innovator . It was not a successful endeavor, a reciprocity of the father's vast talent of this outstanding film Kinetoscope. 8/10
