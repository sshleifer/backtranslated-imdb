I caught this movie late in one night and did not know what hit me. This is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen, yet must wait to see what was on the edge of my seat. Alan Rickman is a wonderful "bad guy" but this character beats all others. I have not been so impressed by the movie! It has been 6 years and I still can not forget the "Close Land".
