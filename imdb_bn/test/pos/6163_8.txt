A nicely romantic war story that should have got more exposure. The Czech pilot who plays the piano gives little touch to the story. Flying footage was not enough to fly like me, but again, it's not actually an action movie. There is nothing in common with James Salter's novel "The Hunters", but the Korean War of F86 sub-pilots became the film, Dark Blue World had similar feelings, but romantic elements were more. Some ways better than Britain's war is that it does not depend on the big name actor. Recommend this check with some check beer and dendlene (span) with some check dumpling.
