I think it is one of the top five movies of Burts, Deliverance, Smoky and Bandit, Boogie Night and City Hits. He pointed out that he had a talent for him like Clint Eastwood. I've made more films than Strawky S. or Canonball Run II or have created a signal for the circus machine. It's a tough, great catch thriller and with Reynolds at the top of his game. Having a beautiful Rachel Ward in Thorn Bird fame too helped. Henry Silva is a bad guy and he always does that a good job. The film also has a great soundtrack. I highly recommend, it was in the UK DVD, an audio commentary from Reynolds would be as good as well. *** 7/10 ***
