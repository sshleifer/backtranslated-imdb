I must admit that I'm the fan of Chess '80's cartoon, but it's the best. Reno Bright and Star Steele Rainbow Bright is one of the most spectacular and entertaining cartoons and it's much better than the TV series. I particularly like the relationship between Rainbow and Dario and it seems very interesting. My favorite character is Starlight, which must be "the great horse of the universe"! <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Bright: New Beginnings, which tells how Rainbolland happened. Have a Rainbow Day!
