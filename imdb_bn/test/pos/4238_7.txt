It improves 100% on a third movie's draw and it's a hell of a good time. It fills a John Hughes film The Devils Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands as the Savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly really did a good job, and Brad Dariff, who has been around the chunky shoes, really made the film really bright. In fact they are the only good part of the movie. I was rather upset with the scenes of Kathryn Higgel and Nick Stable. It seems like they ran out of a sidetrack and someone could save that day. But Chuckie and Tiffani were nice to see and I really like it black humor. I have made it stand out more in the movie. If you want a hell of a good time then do not forget to check this out. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
