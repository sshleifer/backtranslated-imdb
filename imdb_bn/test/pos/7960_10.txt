A photographer from South Korea's small town Gulan said that he had a terminal illness but showed seriousness to his family and friends. We could never find the nature of this disease, but in August, the main focus of his first movie Christmas is not his illness. It is the grace that he presides over his life - his life can be preserved without any remorse, the ability to accept it. Sadly, before the death of cinematographer Yu Yong-Keel, it was the final film, and this film was dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> is played by photographer, Jung-win, Han Suk-Q, once, Korea's most popular star In the first decade of her decade with an infectious smile, a handsome man, she is so warm and lively, that at the end of her life it is difficult to portray. A small photography shop owner and father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji-Hye) live in the house with a hard-to-hear voice, how the films can be played in VCR and his father is teaching to write instructions for accepting him. If he dies in his shop. Jung-Jeit wrote about his growing day-night business of activities, a meter reader Dar-Im (Shim In-ha) came to his shop with an urgent request for some photographic expansion. <Br /> <br /> <br /> She is behaving with dishonor but apologies later and she becomes a regular customer. Without expressing the romantic feelings overt, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not what they say or what they are. It is their place to land, where they come from. To save Dar-Im from sorrow, Jung-win did not tell him that he has only a short time to live, but this situation is not easy for him. Inevitably, his excess absence from the shop gave him tremors and pushed him to despair, where he threw a rock through the window of the shop. Although the decision to prevent his illness from Dara-im is open for decision-making, it seems biological for his character in the film, and it is not only used as a plot device or "playing around" for the character. <br /> <br / > One of the most sensitive sequences in the photo is when an old woman comes back to take a photograph of her own memorial in her studio. The picture is right picture, it will soon recognize that he will take a picture of his memoir.Christmas in August is a neutral film that does not resume the melodrama to create his point of view. It is about the pleasure of a normal moment: running a bicycle, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, Feeling thoughtful and considerate and happy about what life will offer. This is a love story where Love seems to be sorry for you, although there are many movies in the process of death, but in August Christmas encourages a new trend and in this process, an unforgettable commentary on the condition of human beings is impossible, this film is a very joyous experience about death.
