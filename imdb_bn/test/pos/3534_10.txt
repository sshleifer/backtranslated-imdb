The 1981's Just Dickon Dawn is one of the top stories on the street. It is one of the best artists of the 80s and it is easily fascinated by the films The Final Terror, Do Goon in the Woods, or Pre Out of Water. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The mountain has bought one of the teams that come out of the property check out. But they are not alone in the wild. A violent in-beta murderer, who seems to be at two places at once, he hates the secret and apparently the criminals. <br /> <br /> Director Laberman, who gave us such big Big Films Squame (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), did a great job with this smart thriller. The film is nicely atmospheric, exciting and with great sense of some strong mystery. This picture makes even the deserted feel terrible claustrophobic even in the open. The location of Oregon is well captured by beautiful and captivating cinematography. Music score is a true real and awesome contrast with visual visualization. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson was created for a great leadership, his attendance was concentrated. Greg made some good performances like Henry Benson's boyfriend and Chris Lemon. Supporting cast, especially the veteran actor Kennedy, works very well. <br /> <br /> Slashara is a true jewel of the genre, for which there is no need to thrill. Looking good for equally good slashher fans and awesome buffs is a good value. See it! <br /> <br /> *** *** *** *** ****
