One day I was surfing through IMDB, when I stood across the "Curiosity Adventures of Mr. Wanderer". It's unclear how to inform, I decided to set it off. Thanks to DGVu, it did not take me long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I returned home, I saw it, even though I would say, I was quite impressed. /> <br /> A picture of three of the king's apartment <br, a shepherd, a chimney needle, and a self-portrait of the king (who, as the King himself as selfish and pessimist) comes to life at night to sleep. The shepherd and the chimney escaped when the couple called the police to catch the couple. Thankfully for the couple, Mr. Wanderers come for their help, often mocking the police and the king. <br /> <br /> ডিভিডি কেসের পেছনে এই ছবিটি "একটি অতি দৃশ্যমান চাক্ষুষ আনন্দ এবং একটি অন্তর্নিহিত এন্ট্রি হিসাবে বর্ণনা করেছে। ক্লাসিক অ্যানিমেশন ইতিহাস। " বেশিরভাগ ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ডগুলি বরং অদ্ভুত মনে করে, আমি এর সাথে আরও একমত হতে পারিনি, এবং অনেকগুলি অক্ষর Strange, in which one of the underground cities is hungry and hungry lions, which are cooled down by the music of blind people ( Any kind of look like Andy Warhol), Mr. Wanderers himself a bit brighter. The film is very creative and is mostly fun to watch, and its only error is that it can run slowly. But overall, this movie was great, and it is really recommended by you. <br /> <br /> Grade: B + (Awesome)
