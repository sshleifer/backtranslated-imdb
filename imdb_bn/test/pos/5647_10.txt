Kon Ichikawa lived two times in World War I and saw what it was like to have influence on the Japanese people. But novel writer Shohi Oka, whose book was inspired by Ichikaware's film, Fires on the Plain. It is a movie about men fighting this war, or perhaps in public war, who lose their humanity. These fields of the Philippines and the soldiers who ran through this story through the jungle are not completely without full hope. It looks like a picnic in Stone's Platoon: at least they had some food, such as after meals. <br /> <br /> They do not have any reserve or ammunition, no back-up, no one understands that they are going on their way to this war that they have been penetrated. If they do not care properly, they can not walk or lose their organs (for example, if you have TB, you are on your way). But in reality, in the case of a soldier's prism, a private tambourine, which we have found complete conception of the futility of the war, both of its worst scenes and annoyances and losses and blurring of intense and cruel violence. <Br /> <br /> Tamura just wants to get some medical services in the film. It was right at the beginning, and his senior official told him - he was already looking through his eyes and an exhausted expression by the war of years - he died without getting into the hospital. He is not really, but ends up with some soldiers: first, with a platoon that seems to work together, but it is actually driven by a power-hungry semen, who want to lick only Tamarra salt, and then two later A group of people with road soldiers who attacked the road at night. <br /> <br /> The story is not completely straight line, but it is not necessary. Tumura's path in front of the fire is said to be in Vengate, when he came to the enemy village where he seemed to be small stories. Two of the population comes back to get some supplies, and the mangoes are torn on them. This is an inspiring scene, since we did not see him with some wrong * with him, but he did this in this scenario, not fearing more than evil but also fearing and frustrating (besides this, spoiling it, how he got a stomach of salt). The little scenes have evolved with brilliant and destructive, easy to find walking shoe shoes, which does not seem like any. Or later, when Tamura discovered that her tooth is being isolated and the lack of total health is coming out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It can be said that it is a terribly appreciable from Ichikawa Films that shot in a black and white scene of the field and forest, the cinematography is full of everything we see in black and white white white. Ichikwa also ensures that everything from its actors is authentic, not only emotionally but also shows their own embarrassment and frustration over them. Ichikwa must have all of them alive and also living characters in the wild; By the wild, by the way, I mean cancerism. This shock is two times; The first is that the soldiers are half-humorous about the other soldiers' eating of tomour, whether it is true and it is only responded so that the word of caution is "not asked" and the second is the cancer itself, from the crazy hungry man of the mountain, who came out of his shell And our hero was saying directly, "When you die you will eat me." <br /> <br /> When it comes to the small 'action' scene, it becomes especially more brutal when the filming director comes in. In this, I will argue, more cruel, totally random killings than 'private ryan' in the depiction of violence in war. A sequence in which I will point out and there is only one shot which is excited to see, when we see a group of about 20 soldiers walking slowly from a higher angle, then there is a hail of gunfights that only four or five, but it is very Quickly, and the soldiers keep walking along the same crawl. It is shown that it is not the only shot of horrific killings - when it needs to be bloody, there is something like a full-fledged Macbar on the screen throughout the screen - but it runs the whole point. <br /> <br /> The actress is frustrating (Fanakoshi, who is most often monitored with peace and most of the time, thinks that what she is seeing is the most horrific), all the main set-pieces have terrible experience to provide something else And this is the final question with a war film: How can people fight and fight in this kind of war? It is almost boring to enter the words, and so itchwawa pushing our nostrils into flesh, filth, and blood, and demanding it for us, so maybe it will not happen for some time, and it will never happen again. Or this can expect this, at the end of such a bleak and great film.
