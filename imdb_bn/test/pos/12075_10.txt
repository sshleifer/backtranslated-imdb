This film is based on the real story of Iowa Housewife Lucile Frau, who received breast cancer after her 10th child was born. She encourages the children of the state to take her child away from her ineffective, alcoholic husband, and she encourages her to find a new home for every child in the last year of travel around the state. A horrific script - it's been kept 20 years after the first creation.
