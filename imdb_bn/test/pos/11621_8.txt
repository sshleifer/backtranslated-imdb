Based on the book Thomas Rivera, the film "... and the Earth the Deed Get Himim," is an open-ended film for most people. It discusses the exploitation that immigrant farm workers talk about for survival. <br /> <br /> Service also used printing techniques to illustrate the story of Perez Rivera. He used Siena and gray scale effects to illustrate some scenes, and in the 1950s, he used certain photographic techniques to show scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie to see because it shows how recently the migrant farmers live, how to entertain and their beliefs.
