I've enjoyed Arkan and Stefan? A cool and fast story that does not bogged down in detail. Those two guys are great to see and always come up with new ideas. The film supports much of the high quality and cut movies. <br /> <br /> Erkan and Stefan have shown that the German film industry is able to transfer successful Hollywood ideas to local cinema in our movies.
