Simply say, two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes fell. First, when he was set to wash the toilet, but when drinking water in the toilet was finished, the hot director gave him golden shower! (I smiled so hard!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, where he tried to prove to be a trainer of swimming school. He looked like a pro diving, but as expected, he could not swim (at least ^^). But this interesting part finally ended and said "how was" or something. That was so sunny, I could not laugh. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to watch this anime series, I strongly recommend it. I saw the best one. <br /> <br /> Surely fun!
