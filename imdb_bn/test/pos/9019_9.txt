Well, I'm watching movies for one of three reasons. Unfortunately, this movie does not have any transformers, so I can only recommend it to the comedy price and beautiful women (to read girls) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's funny, I know the number of these people have had regular smiles throughout the movie . Personally, I like it for Laura Fraser, who fits IMHO!
