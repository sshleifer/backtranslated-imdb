On September 30, 2006, I saw the movie a second time and thought that it was better than it was for the first time. I've enjoyed acting perfectly, especially "Uncle Beni". I thought Fred Carpenter did a great job writing and managing this picture. The storyline certainly interests you and I hope this movie is at the top of the list. I think it has moved very smoothly between scenes and surprising points, okay, just tell me I do not see it coming. I thought Craig played "Eddie Monroe", the actor has done a great job and I hope this movie will help him move forward in his acting career. From the beginning to the end I have enjoyed it perfectly.
