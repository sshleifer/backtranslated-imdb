I love dogs, and the most striking character in this movie is a Golden Retriever. She is smarter, looking better and more interesting than human characters. Like many other contributors, I did not read the book, but I doubt that this work will change my movie's opinion. It is predictable from the first five minutes. No surprises. Crazy scientists create a monster that gets loose and a teenage boy and his amazing dogs help to destroy it. All the dogs in all the movies But I said, I love dogs and so give this movie a rating of 7/10. It comes to the TV but see if you are bored you are not rented and the other does not hold your eye but do not buy it if it is not special.
