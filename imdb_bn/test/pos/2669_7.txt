Frank Sinatra has played in this simple little time, which is now in the public domain. The film almost ended in the war and it is a wonderful application for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Stage Geyin in Sainatra. After leaving the stage, he goes to the mall and finds a group of kids to find another group because of his religion. Instead of screaming to the boys (or to help them), Sainat teaches a great citizen on religious dynamics and equates discrimination with fascism. The children get the lesson but then outside of the blue, Sinatra starts singing, what is the truth? (It?), The kids hated, She had a lovely voice but unfortunately I think the children excused from the excellent message about tolerance of children. It's a good message with a lot of singing a lawsuit - even if the guy sings Frank Sinatra. This is an interesting quo - also a wonderful historical part which is often overlooked ... plus it sounds a bit prudent, but it touches it.
