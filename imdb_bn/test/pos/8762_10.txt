Beautifully constructed, "traffic" tells of narrative uses and trade related stories from multiple perspectives. From a policing standpoint, from a politician's perspective, from addiction scene, from a smuggling scene and from the peasant's viewpoint. In a carefully created storyline, how does everything impress with the heart. In Pakistan, there is a great measure of use of narcotics in places of spots in poppy areas in Pakistan, from Karachi to the suburbs, to the suburbs, Frankfurt and London, where the smugglery took place.
