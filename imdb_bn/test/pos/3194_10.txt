I could say as a new transition as well. I borrowed the DVD from my local library. Since watching 'Samur Samurai' I was interested in Samui. He told my father that he saw Shintro in his childhood. He said that it was quite good. We have until series 3. I love it absolutely. It takes a little to be used in English spoken words dipped on Japanese-speaking characters, but I really enjoy it the same. They themselves are thrown in letters and a little strange to see the little break when they stick in a tree or wall. I did not use this but I now have But I think they had this technology in the 60's. I noticed that santro is kind, friendly, willing to help the needy, he is very modest, most of the time he does not feel himself bigger (he only says that he is better than the enemy ninja). I appreciate Shintaro for these qualities Swordsmanship that has Koichi Ose is really interesting to see. It's awesome. For those who are interested in this series.
