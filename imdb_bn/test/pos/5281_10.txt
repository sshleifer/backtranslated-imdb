A relief from Geek No U. Ponyo to create a beautiful animated movie and many heartless Soulless CGI movies. Pastel and colored pencil backgrounds are astonishing after Sen. After being colonized with a comic (Chilean) and Hawo's Ughoka's Moving Castle (style of Hawl's Moving Castle). The style works well for film and works very well. This effort is highly appreciated for animating time and effort because it gives life to characters so much, its details and care makes the film even better. There are several great scenes throughout the film which have many movements and steps. When I was the eldest of my daughters, when the sisters went upstairs they were transformed into a huge wave like a fish. The story is simple but fairly well written and played out. The plot focused on the nature of the character around and it was also great, despite not having to play the Toneri Totoro (Toy Neighbor of My Nevada). I felt every character had a fair amount of screen like a spirited invisible, which was so jammed with different characters that it might have expanded throughout the series. (Mood spirit. There was another complete movie!) My only real problem with the movie ended. The way it has been said in the English version, at least it seems that there is going to be a great test given to Sosuke, who will admit to Pinoo that he will love Paiano. While thinking more about this, I think that translation can not be true to the true meaning of true commitment and it carries its meaning deeply. Although the movie seems to be a sudden end. Another movie that was great and I highly recommend it
