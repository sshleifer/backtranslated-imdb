With the attack of "Slashar" film in the early 1980s, it can be expected that some good players can slip through a crack. It was a great "rare" film by Jeff Lieberman, who insured his memorable 1970s film "Schemes" and "Blue Sunshine" in exchange for his rituals. <br /> <br /> Five young people are walking on the Oregon Hills (this movie was actually located in some places for camping) and tried to grab some lands. Long ago, they would be terrified by a heavy killer with an incredibly horrible horse's laughing smile. <br /> <br /> "Just Door" is significantly more ambitious, intelligent than "arty" and some slasher film. Laberman actually eliminates letters - well, two, no matter what - the 90-minute long film will allow him as much. This movie has real moments of suspicion and excitement, and in reality the graphic remains unchanged, initially stored for killing one. <br /> <br /> There is an above-average cast including Oscar winner George Kennedy. A forest render who has gone a little flaky to stay alone in the desert for too long. Jack Lemon's son Chris, future Brian de Palma is regular Greg Henry, blonde lead Debarah Benson (it's not that he is not a more known actor, he's judged here by his work), Ralph Semur ("Ghawli"), Mike Kellin ("Slipway Camp "), and Jamie Rose (" Jeepite Own Chipper Chicks "). Some shots are interesting, and Brad Fiddle's first music score (now known for his "Terminator" theme) is hunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> It is worth loading an important plot in an hour's sign, although the heroine and a tree are about 75 minutes involved and the killer is almost ridiculous; It could actually remind a viewer of a cartoon! The most shiny touch is the ultimate sender of a killer, which I have never seen before a horror movie and probably will not be able to see it again. <br /> <br /> I could not give it 10 more 10 because I can not tell the truth that I was scared. Still, it is an attractive slashher that is worthy of re-discovering. <br /> <br /> "Deed means nothing, son, who can not be read in the hills." <br /> <br /> 9/10
