Although I'm very familiar with the poet Dylan Thomas, I do not know anything about his life. Anyway, in his life and especially his marriage, I would imagine that Love Edge (depending on the novel) is a bit useful, but unless you are a historian or a poet, who carries. <br /> <br /> The movie is less about Thomas and his life focused on two most important women. One is his wife, Catherine, and the other sheep is his first love. Like a youth, a romantic night on the beach is something that both of them have tried to throw behind them but they can not do it, now they are big friends. I have mentioned that this war has been set during Captain Will was involved in the murder of Killing, who was pregnant and left for war. When he was away, the sheep began to read again for Thomas, and Kathrine fell in love with her. She is carrying the child of another human being. When Captain Kilig comes back, it becomes more emotionally complicated <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is a very soap operating plot, and it takes a sprint in classical slow motion, perhaps a very remorse dialogue. But not all still lost. For the production of non-Hollywood, I think that Love Edge is like a stylish picture that one can get. It must be 90% of contemporary romance, more productive or more creative than Hollywood or not. Some of it should be set during the war, which establishes a mental conflict, which is more believable and less artificial, as it is a bit tempting. This is Joe Wright's Oscar nominee featuring the same genius and portrayal of the film, but it requires a lot of stable pacing and progress. Things are OK at the beginning and end, but the middle part where your attention can be examined, unless you are deeply and deeply rooted in the story. <br /> <br /> If I suspect that love will have such impact on the audience, then it is a good film to test it. It could even make a good date night movie, it is considered that dogs are forced to endure today, much smarter than the chick flicks.
