It's a tough movie to review, because there are several things to consider. Let's filter more judges. Okay, are you interested in Jeffrey Carnatic serial killer information? Can you bear an independent, low budget film? Are you just enough to not hate the movie due to lack of star or professional looks? Yes, if you say yes, you should have a handle so that it can be managed. This image is about 100% correct drama and dramatic story of Dahmer's adult life, and it is written as an autobiography. This is not a glamorized, unrealistic account which was unfortunately the theatrical film "Dahmar" (2001). The film began with Dahmer, with Karl Cruz acting very firmly, while attacking the police station while sitting in the car. His thinking about what he has in him has been presented to us in the past, described in style, which correctly explains Dahmara's psychology and intentions, which led him to kill 20 times. We know about the character as well as the surrounding characters in the middle of normal life. It is not a crime, but at the age of 17, Dahmar was killed, but because of being a criminal psychologist student, I was more than happy to represent him in this film more than just his animalistic representation. You are trying to show her a loving relationship with her grandmother and to find a company, but of course we testify on her side that everyone remembers. It should be noted that most of the screening of violence on screen is often seen as a screen-like shot or blooded screen. I remember remembering two deaths, a bloody throat slash and another man living in Acid's Barrels. Although you do not see some graphic, this ruthlessness and the crew and its victims both have a strong acting and it creates an annoying scene. And when the actual screen transmission is low, you will see the results. There is an edge hand and a head or two, but it does not seem to be disturbing the viewer and to be absorbing. As well, this is the fake physiological piece where budget constraints are visible. While acceptable, they are not too annoying to look enough like mesh. The film ended in 1994, after the death of Dahmor, because it was released a year or two ago. This is the only big difference from the real story, and the information that remains, as I said, the truth is the truth. Film quality can be good, conversations often become very quiet and the acting of different characters is a bit hummy, but it is not overboard. In my opinion, it's a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look in America's most memorable serial killers. I think it's safe to think that the protected movie is safe, and I respectfully appreciate it to exceed its limitations in order to provide the story, it helps the wonderful Karl Krau like Darmas.
