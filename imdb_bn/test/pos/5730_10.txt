Many of us read at high school, probably without a physics course - I do not know if I do not. But after watching this show, I really want to. <br /> <br /> This documentary 'The Holy Grail of Physics' - All the basic forces of the universe, a 'Master equation', scattered Einstein in the last years of his life. University of Columbia Professor Brian Green reveals us in this wonderful universe in a wonderful simple way and introduces us with more understanding than the one we live in. <br /> <br /> We start with the possibility of tantellingiasing a 'master equation' which can unify and explain ... * everything! * In this universe, there are four fundamental forces that we know exist: electromagnetism, strong nuclear power, weak nuclear energy and gravity. Green discusses how our attention to the universe is reflected in our Newton, Einstein work and later on the revolution of quantum level physics. <br /> <br /> At this time we are running a problem that has hit physicist for many years, and no one has been able to solve it yet. How can we unite all these forces together? We find, because Green resolves the problem continuously - that the answer to this confusing problem can be the theory of the string. However, if we can describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very high value for payment. It destroys the mathematical equations of string theory beyond the mind, which, as a result, we see that we can probably live in a filled universe, not just the level 3 that you and I see every day (for the time being), rather Rather we can actually live in a universe * 11 * levels. But the theory that comes from mathematics does not stop there - the possibility exists that in fact parallel can be universal; Some of them are just beside me and mine! Can we possibly adopt a theory that focuses on such a consequence? Green points out; We still could not find it completely, but we know that the mathematics that appeared from these equations has already shown us that the universe still has a lot to show us. <br /> <br /> For those who fear you, you will not be able to understand the concept in this program - do not fear. Professor has done a wonderful job to overcome the difficult conceptions of green mathematics and physics, and instead concentrates more on the concept * - which has removed all maths from it, becomes incredibly simple from a monster, and green continuously indicates, 'Elegant' concept. Viewers of this program need no background in science; The concepts are so simple that even a child can understand them. <br /> <br /> When you finish this program, you will really understand how we live in a wonderful and mysterious universe.
