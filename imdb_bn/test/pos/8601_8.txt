It was clear until the film was created in 1989, since it was a clear achievement, since all of its production was made in the 1960s - all of the acting, character, set and props were an aesthetic from the past. <Br> <br /> Before the bomb exploded in Hiroshima and how this tragedy affects a family, the opening of the film opens the moment: a young girl, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white colors and special effects that are completely primitive, practical and effective by modern standards, but images of instant bombs are very awesome. Family members became strangers to each other, others roamed the streets and drifted into the streets with shocks. <br /> <br /> This title fell very soon after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ash and which caught Yasook. During the bomb blasts, Yasuko's events in Hiroshima influenced the possibility of his marriage, and later came to know that black rains are causing illness. This picture is not only concerned with the physical impact of the bombs on Japanese but also due to social and emotional harm. <br /> <br /> I am pleased with this movie and find an interesting journey among a unique culture. Though the film is mainly concerned about the pain felt by a family, the mild political message of the film is relevant today and probably all the time - there are dire consequences of war and should not be entered until absolutely necessary. It is said that history repeats itself, and current leaders of 'Building of Wing' have not learned anything. The nuclear war zone has not been revived since 1945, but has had other deadly effects. This picture is bound to see.
