This is an amazingly diverse drama, detailing the different aspects of international heroin drug-trade-detail - from the mountains of North Pakistan, where the cultivated farming of Amy-Poppy is widely used; In Germany and England, "Euro-Trash" arranges multi-kilo smuggling to import processed heroin in jetting; End users are caught in the crime of being involved in supporting the web of addiction and their growing practice; And eventually corruption and hypocrisy of police efforts to control all the "drug problems" of all drug levels in the international drug market --- this play has been deeply spherical characters, completely drawn plot and excellent character. And location shooting. <br /> <br /> It puts Hollywood epics like "French connection" in their place! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Contrary to many "crime dramas" circulating around drugs, traffic displays socially * causes * that firmly slides into drug narcotics. Like a letter puts it "... unless we, as a society, develop a world that wants to flee from people, instead of trying to escape, we can not prevent people from taking drugs ... <br /> < This is an impressive and fully provocative drama. I highly recommend it!
