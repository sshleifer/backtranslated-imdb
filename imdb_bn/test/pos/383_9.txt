This is a classic, one of the most respected and studying films of Hitakoos, which does not take any casings to see it again. Yet you think: What is the big (and tricky, and amazing) strategy of plot that can hold it even after a surprise? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the beginning, a deep beautiful and impressive story of the true story, its meaning. Two taxi, two men are shown with their shoes, walking onto each train, sitting from each other, and, oh, a mistake, a little nudge, and start the conversation, and we see men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> Here the tone hits Hitakoos, because it is very awful and suspicious - funny and light. We know that the film must be entered, but this will not happen, so we are already worried. After all, what's wrong? <br /> <br /> lot In fact, Hitco's fashion, it is a perfect innocent person (almost always a man) who faces injustice, in which circumstances he is most valuable is threatened. In this case innocent tennis player Guy Hens is betrayed, which is believable - in his first philosophy, his classmate colonialism, for example, as he realizes that another person is a little kaku, as well as you or I too. The non-innocent man played full brightness of self-absorbed and intelligent intelligent disadvantaged children, Bruno Anthony, Robert Walker. (This extraordinary performance is similar to another hitcoo, like Waiko, played by Anthony Parkins in Syco.) From the scene, on the train (and the train is really fantastic!), We have two leads and we remember - from Patricia High's first novel, . Ripley wrote books behind the film, it is blurry and absolutely simple and ultimately destructive plot. And it does not hurt that Raymond Chadler himself wrote the screenplay, who knows something about economics and clever dialogue. And crime. <br /> <br /> And certainly much more than the first scene. Remember what? Well, the daughter of a senator (I thought it was horrible), Patricia, daughter of Hittkoke, who is still with us (until 2009, she also played psycho role). And there is a landmark location for the main scene of the movie - the Hampton Tennis Court, which is known to us as the US Open's site. The ultimate ending scene with Carozele is the only place, where Hitcock moves towards the slow and stagnant Montage, making it quick to suspend. Fear gets fattening positively with sunny children and old people crawling it at the bottom And when it breaks into a crash - it's all backpaid in a set, one of the more natural uses by a director, which is not worried about the reality behind its projection. <br /> <br /> The photography is so stunning that it is stylish to be stunning Hollywood (like some silent films) that it is an object in its own right. See again in the first scene, or Hines' shooting (and editing) is entering the room, which the viewers think is a murder. This sophisticated construction When we are not surprised that it is on the bedroom of Bruno, it only proves that the director has our fingers on our toes. Some unexpected are always expected. <br /> <br /> What glitches do there? Who knows? It can take you as beautiful style (or hug) depending on what kind of false type. While Bruno is joking an old girl in a party, she is brilliantly hit by a bright (women, played by Narma Warden, a betrayal that can breathe you) and see the Senator's daughter. Trans by its glasses, and its similarity to its preceding hunting. This is based on the efforts of Hitakoos in the mid-20th Century concept of psychology. (Psycho End, For Beginners.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia article focuses on killing victims of the main character and continuing to double the Senator's daughter in film. In these little ways - two men take him to the tennis court, taking two people along with the music park and thus It can be made abundantly, but it provides an aesthetic integrity above and below our consciousness. Do not forget, the two murders mean that - the second murder is lacking, in that case the doubling of the problem, which could open Bruno. <br /> <br /> Actor Walker was a psychological problem and the film was institutionally established a year before it was shot, and still, he died of a drug response to calm his brain. Although he appeared in other films, train trains are easily his tour forces Farley Granger had a long career that did not break him into the real StarDome, though his style is really amazing nervous sweetness, which really works, especially with Night Live. <br /> <br /> And if you look at it for the first time or the third time, then find a cool and ridiculous scene in a tennis match where the heads of the crowd are gathered together - without Bruno. She is staring out directly without moving our head. As a trailer for the movie, after this film, you will not talk to "strangers on the train".
