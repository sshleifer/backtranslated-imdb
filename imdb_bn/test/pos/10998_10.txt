When I first saw the movie, I thought it was sweet - a family movie. Between the rest of the day and the next few days, the clever moments and funny lines were going back to my thoughts and our conversations ... a lot of things are going on, first classical elements, good character acting, and Windy Malick's story line is just messy. It seems to be labeling a "feelable movie" label and magic - it's more like a "wonderful life" than it is.
