Notorious Hat Katie Actor, Anthony Wang for once (Well ... not really once - he was the shorthand of the Darkness film and some were a policeman ...) Psychotic nightmare psychopathic is not weird.

More serious films in the series. More comparable to the intermediate isolation in Asia - more "illogical" CATIII entries that supply lots of nudity and abundance in terms of cow, even not too ridiculous. Of course, the price of a look, especially style enthusiasts. 8/10
