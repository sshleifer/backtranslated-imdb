So writing about something wonderful is absolutely difficult. In fact, it is almost impossible to describe the features of this film. It's an amazing story about gender and gender, and it's almost unbelievable that we could not deal with sexual abuse. It seems that this movie has been created for people who can think, and just feel, life in all complexities in a complex, easy way. We look at it, and some feel like our mind starts even growing inside our hearts: it is a pure poem. I've seen some "gay" movies, and I'm really annoyed with sexual unnecessary scenes because I do not like sexual scenes, but usually they are so pornographic that I have to think that the director or producer or script writer thinks homosexuality means distortion. Nagisa nor Shindobaddo is completely different from them. Three main characters Our IT, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl are a diverse love triangle. IoTo likes his best friend Yoshida, Yishida likes Aihara and Ihara likes IT. Imagine what this unprepared hand might have turned on? But on the contrary, Hashiguichi creates an extraordinary story that goes deep into the philosophy of life, adds a question to me that thinks, wonders, at the end of the movie: Why? And that's why my brain stretches multiple questions inside and inside my heart. The scenes, in fact, sometimes have to be boring, are the most joyful poems of the moment that we can feel, but unable to fully write in words. And because of that, we did not understand the question at the end of the movie. I'm not sure that this movie was made to discuss each of our pieces? Some people want to understand a film about it isolated. Others are generally used in "American gay" movies which can not appreciate the true value of this master-piece. See it, close your eyes to credit and think, think everything, think yourself, feel wonderful songs. All this and many, much more, I'm not one. And I can not give ten, because ten ten perfection. But I admit I've almost done it.
