And with the words a conclusion of a great movie campaign campaign came. 'Garbo Talks' and he uttered those words in his first sound film, Eugene O'Neill starred Anna Cristy. <br /> <br /> Unlike some other players and other studios, MGM has taken great care to find suitable vehicles for Garuda Garbo. Many players fined between silent movies will lose their career due to the ticking. Their heavy negative accent will get the way, some do not know English. <br /> <br /> It was no accident that Ana Chris was chosen for Garbo. It is one of the leading writers of America, it is the property of literature that appeals to her. Secondly the title role was someone who was Swedish, the pronunciation can be interpreted. Finally, while the anti-Chris was still using the title card, many early Tokyo movies were finished. <br /> <br /> It's a very small, but long and deep characterization, as much as O'Neil's job. The story was held in New York's Waterfront where Garbo came to live with his father, George Marian. Marine years ago Marin escaped to the sea when Anna was a child and Marion abandoned his wife. Anna had to do what he had to do to survive in adulthood and has prostitution. <br /> <br /> Marion was delighted to see him, he also found out Mary Dresler, he lived with the old wetwater croon for years with his meat and blood for years. Of course, both Marion and Garbo are in line with each other, when they provide shelter to a mariner of Charles Bamford, they are not easily made, who are fond of Garbo. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Main Broadway production. Anna was played on the stage by Pauline Lord. Anna Crusty ran for 177 performances in the 1921-22 season at Broadway. It's O'Neil's best known work and one of the frequent reviving. <br /> <br /> Surely Garbo's performance was complimented with the correct speech with Swedish pronunciation and its future was confirmed in sound films. Greta Garbo received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and William Daniels was nominated for cinematography. For the way he photographed the waterfront scenes, Daniels will especially get a lot of kudos. And set the Brown Brand image where the mood around the Waterfront creates. <br /> <br /> The work of Eugene O'Neill has ceased to exist, so Anna Christie did not even have the date of many films, even with many touches in the initial film, not of that era. Gaurbo also says that he has gained the necessary skills to work in the sound medium. Ana Cristie is a classic, almost all the way.
