This documentary was my first role in the theory of Peak Oil. This is an interesting concept that has many terrible consequences if it seems right. I had no idea that the effects of oil reduction would come so fast, it literally took my breath. This film is likely to keep your eyes open as the way America lives on "abundant oil abundance" - a term used throughout the film. Most of the topics are general knowledge, and they do not penetrate deep into any topic. But you probably did not put all the pieces like this movie together. Interview with writers and energy experts are all very interesting. I do not think this picture means to fear people. It is meant to tell people about what to expect in just a few years, and perhaps you can encourage you to think twice about traveling around 100 million and leaving your lights in daylight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was not able to look at zooming car and bus by roughly the same. Great documentary, everyone will see it.
