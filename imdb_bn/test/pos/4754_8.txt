This movie has a great chat scene, if you hear the soundtrack while chasing each other, but it sounds like a movie bullet soundtrack, you will hear 4-speed transit and they will show the break pedal in the Ray Schneider, an automatic brake pedal! , I think one of the funiest moments of the movie is when Kha Richard Lynch disobedient men in the car looked at the driver as he nuts! The crew, who runs the garage, was also the man who was the first rocky movie, Rocky Messe. good picture! Even if the door explodes, you see the guy sitting in the car opening the door, a man who helps get out of the car, does not seem to see Mr Brady from the Brady bunch?
