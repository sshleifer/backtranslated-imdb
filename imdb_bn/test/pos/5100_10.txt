In 1969, at the age of 9 I saw it in the theater and immediately fell in love with it. I'm sorry that Sony did not see fit to free it on DVD ("but one day, one day ..."). I recently received a VHS copy of it in ebay and I was sitting to see it after 39 years. I'm happy to report it still stands the test of time. Acting spot-on, John Williams' strings are colorful and memorable of Leslie Bricks's song ("When I'm Old," "You and I," "Field the World View Love", "London E London", only a few Peter O'Weill, Petul Clark , Michael Redgrave and Michael Bryant's performance can not be said enough. Terrence Rattigan has achieved the + one's ability to update the story of James Hilton. Nothing to like the person. It is a good cheerleader-up-up to the election. Glyada many as the soundtrack to the original soundtrack was released three CD set. I hope to do the same thing with the Sony quick haste, and film.
