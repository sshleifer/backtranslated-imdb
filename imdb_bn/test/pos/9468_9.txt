I saw this film in a special screening. At first I thought the movie would be like an ideal Amanda Bains movie, but I was wrong. This film based on Shakespeare's book "The Twilight Night" of this movie tells the story of a girl who lives in football. When the girls' team is cut, then in order to take revenge for the arrogant team players in her old school, she has to go to big teams to attend another school. On his way he was caught on a long camouflaged web of love, lies, and cheating. These movies are average girls this year. I think it shows some great new actors power and there are some big star stars defiantly featured in this movie.
