I can not tell the source of this movie, but it is one of my favorite films of Paul Magarsky (director and co-authors). This Shakespeare "comedy" is a retake, but is sufficiently removed from the stage. Without a lot of text, Majorsky and Star Cosvets make the middle-life crisis of passion and purpose visible. Encouraged to re-center itself, the cassette goes back to the distant Greek island - where local and island itself creates a little magic. This is an adult fantasy with Raul Julia, especially Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, which is emotionally satisfying and apparently fantastic. And funny It was not a big box office hit, but whenever it comes to the DVD, it will be sold.
