Before I saw it I read all the complaints about this movie, I was still interested in the preview. I do not know, because I was expecting a bomb or, but I really enjoyed the movie. Until the second half of the film I was not very scared, even then it was not too bad. I think most views and false alarms were realistic, if very little narrow but the story needs to be moved along. I think the house and the surrounding area are the perfect setting for this type of film, it's beautiful and huge, but still the same qualities are getting interesting. I also think the light system works very well because they did not start the entry, but there was no way to keep them, so the room was dark outside the walls of the jail. <br /> <br /> While talking about Jill, I thought that his part was performed well, initially it is not credible, but after some phone calls it was fine. Actually he is afraid to watch where the scene is perfectly played. And, finally, someone got the right to fire the pests. I do not tell you how many times I hear a word in my room, I grabbed the fire insects, and it was a nice touch for him, though he forgot that he needed it most for the most. <Br> <br /> About the plot hole, the movie is not perfect, but almost every hole can be explained, and how he got the secret part ... how long did he see him? How did he go out to kill his friend? And just when the gardener dies? Overall, I've enjoyed it and I'm surprised how fast it's gone. It keeps my attention, and I wanted to see it finish, though the finishing was very short and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint, other than the end, was the lack of character development. They could add him and his friends or ten more minutes with him, so that we can make his situation worse, give us a taste of our personality and how he can predict the situation (for example, where he will go back for the kids Whether it is debating about it, it seems that some scenes were missing at the beginning, only about themselves or something Talked about).
