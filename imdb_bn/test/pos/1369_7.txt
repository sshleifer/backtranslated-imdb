My friends and I saw a selection of "bad" movies on most Saturday evenings. We found that among the flicks, the most powerful competitor (for quality bad-movie rentals) was easily jack-o. Films in "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are listed on the following 100 IMDBs. These are definitely bad movies, but they do not belong below 100. They are looting "Jack" - "O", and "Time of the Copper", etc., Bad Movie Greatness, etc., they are so valuable. <br /> <br /> So Jack makes Jack so big (Bad movie For the beginning, director Steve Latas decided to cast his son Ryan Latoso as Shan Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latosaw was dangerously out-activated by the wooden block The child, seriously, has no power to emotise anything. The end result: strange comic gold.The child heard a joke, or just a few minutes away to tear his head, and his expression is one of the "emotionlessness." <br /> < br /> We can see the other side of the movie as "double dream" is the perfect number of sequences, what is a double dream? Well, when a character wakes up from a nightmare, Equally something happens at night, and then woke up again the character. Basically, they wake up from a nightmare dream, wake up. Glossy device, do not you? I believe Shan Kelly's character is less than 3 double-vision is decreasing. <br /> <br /> Let's see what else? And well! Thousands of these movies have a genuine cast. It is really wonderful to see how many roles have played throughout the film. Best of all: There is nothing to do with almost any character story. They killed Jack O, or they are not serving any purpose. <br /> <br /> Jack and himself are pretty sweet. Like most B-movie monsters, Jack-O has tremendous power, apparently, to provide a teleport on a distant distance. He hangs out at all, anywhere in the background, whenever you're dealing with a major character. However, it is a little confusing that when he actually took someone behind, he went on a dizzying / stumbling speed and still he is able to stay with those who are frustrated. <br /> <br /> This is for now. Turn off the comments: If you are looking for an unwittingly ridiculous bad movie, you can not make the mistake by renting this beast. <br /> <br /> Bad movie score: 7/10 Good movie score: 3.5 / 10
