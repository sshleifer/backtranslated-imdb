"Caribbean" is not a great composition of any aspect of his story. However, it delivers a completely enjoyable story with an extraordinary cinematography. The narrative structure is placed in about two letters axis, one connecting between them, each contains elements that are related to nice harmony and co-existent. The story does not lose the right pacing, and it shows a very good mix of human nature's natural environment (which is a character in itself). Acting great, and for this we gave credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ram√≠rez. In addition, the letters are very well written and complicated in skill; So, once you become familiar with them, you can understand their opinions and even say something. I can not say that it liked this campaign because of all the campaigns created in Costa Rica, but as a way to showcase an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with the balance of human life. Hopefully, the Caribbean will set a reference for future projects in Korea, because it is a good example of making excellent films.
