Life Force is certainly one of Tov Hooper's best films. It's a lot of great special effects and nudity, so it seems like a common horror fan's dream. Although the film is released creative, I think it's due to Dan O'Bannon and Dawn Jacobby's script. Excellent cinematography and a good weird atmosphere make it a solid film.
