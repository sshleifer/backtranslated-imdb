Although it is made for HBO's cable film, it's an enjoyable film and television back-stabbing and a striking look in the double-dealing world. View Lenny and David Letterman are allowed to watch behind the scenes of war on the so-called late night talk show contestants in the contest for the lavish position as Tonight's host of shows. Bravo's performance like Helen Kushnik, Mercury manager of Kathy Bates Lane, and Leno / Letterman may feel sympathy for what they have to endure for the sake of television officials. It is now time to consider the recent incidents in the failed attempt to replace the nightline with Letterman. I have not seen how often I've seen this movie, even though it was first publicly broadcasted, I am very happy to see it. If it should never be released on DVD, then I must add it to my collection.
