Little Moody's little journey into the dirty mental water that runs the Dark Harb extremely deep. It is essentially a 3-piece piece, which combines the performance of fine-tuning with the best rickman of all time, polio walker and Norman Randas (also excellent) forming the other two aspects of this strange triangle. A perfect late night wire film, with a surprise at the end of the boot.
