My fourth review of a Charlie Chan film, according to the growing series of series on these series. This is my first comment that I have seen before, even after 24 years, so I did not remember a lot of it. In this case, Honolulu's detective is investigating a spying ring that was initially tracked by the Scotland's former Scotland's tradesman, which has disappeared in the Big Apple ... I have seen up to this chain entries with every needle connected to the memory (though, of course, I'm in a close examination with them Look, although there may still be some holes, I'm no longer there Dhikara can not remember). And "No. 2" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is a bit of a time of help, when he first discovered the poison that happened at the beginning of some assassination, but, of course, he made a mistake later. Chance Chan's latest Chan film- Max's Museum, which came back from Charlie Chan-Juan Valerie, John John G., like Jr. Preston and Stanley Blaststen. Called a lost chan as a fingerprint specialist called Church Chance Chance. Especially nice conspiracy with an exciting climax on a bomber plane. Oh, and watch a police line up for a particular Stooge ...
