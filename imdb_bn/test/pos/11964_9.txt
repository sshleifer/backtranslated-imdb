When I think of Soviet cinema, Egeenstein's propaganda masterpacks or Tarkovsky's people usually feel the attention. They sure are great movies, but usually it is not the most entertaining element here. However, far within the country of Iron Curtain, the countries enjoyed their indigenous music as far as the state. Indeed, from 1930 to the 70's, this song and dance were released in the context of more than forty public outgoing. However, they are completely neglected in the West, so this documentary tries to amend this situation. It does a great job of showing these movies and keeping them in their proper cultural context. In fact, I'm not passionate about musical instruments, I have seen this document fully compulsory from the beginning to the end. It turns out that it does not matter how many films you can manage in your living, you just keep an eye on what surfaces there are there. <br /> <br /> Since the movies themselves clips, they are very entertaining. Although some musicals are a frustrating campaign that shows how much they love to work under the regime, the singer shows that some films (especially later) are fully completed from the point of view of production. Plus, how many aliens they are due to my western eyes are due to camp very much. There are some similarities between them and the American music that I have used, but the presence of a harsh application of a harsh government gives them a stylish edge. They certainly do not resemble the musical made in the west. This documentary is one of the most vicious and entertaining movies I've ever seen in recent memory, and of course, for both of these movies, of course it must be seen. (9/10)
