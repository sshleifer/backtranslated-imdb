I was disappointed with this small film after IMDB's many sponsored Canadian "Showcase Network" appeared. I, as many of you, also sucked the whole film and watched. First of all, I was rich through literary dialogue and because of the humorous intelligence. I was very easily coastal in the dark, when the movie "Kevin Smith murdered movie" really lowered down, he searched half the way up to the road and with more details ... with a intensely dark and more grim edge. After stepping away from the experience, I was brought more. This is not the best movie and obviously there will be no universal appeal ... so I understand some of its negative reactions. But I bought it ... and I enjoyed it very much. The "flashback" pattern was useful in chronological order, the letters were well understood and the issues raised were human, accessible (for my experience) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the ability of sweet, funny and entertaining film, although I did not move away from controversial issues and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. It's a great expression for many of the films that have entered the diverse / clever romantic genre. Brigitte Jones is a man for the literary community. Take 2 hours from your busy schedule and enter the world of Warrior ... or you can rent "Received Mail", if you are appealed then you do not like it! We should be right on your side for those of us who like it ...
