This will be one of the most horrible title movies of all time. A title that destroys a movie because it does not reveal the plot or characters. A title like this creates a movie flow, even the French title is not even better. Very bad - Truffaut and Deneuve have enough to sell it. <br /> <br /> It's a long film, but basically it's worth it. Definitely influenced by the hit, we have an inter-continental story about a private advertising bridal, her wealthy husband, a theft, a tract switch, and emotional love. The plot here is very good, and an unexpected trip takes us away. <br /> <br /> Focusing on the relationship between the subject and the subject that works against the film. How to develop a "real-life relationship" with these two plans is an interesting study. Unfortunately, this film does bogs down, and it finally makes it unhappy. We really like the movies in the final, and it is absent here. <br /> <br /> For most of his movies, Denuves became canvas for managers to run his fiction, and this does not work well at this time. The messy here, the director obviously just wanted to take his top off Danube several times. Denove is an actress who always feels very deliberate and thoughtful, so her efforts to feel that feelings are similar are similar. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < But Trophaut does not rob, does not it? So - it wanders a bit, but remains interesting.
