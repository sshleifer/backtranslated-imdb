I am afraid that my long list of people in the long list should add my name that this movie is not yet released on DVD (September 2007). This is one of the mysteries that binds the mind, especially when you consider the amount of DVD available, which is the preferred element before today. I still have a nice digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nikam Stereo, so my ability to see the movie can be more than just a frustrating policy. The film itself, it's a wonderful all-rounder that feels good picture quality, more than a satisfactory soundtrack, vivid conspiracy, passion, sadness, frustration, good and exotic surroundings (for Europeans). I do not understand the reality of the film in reality in Burma, in fact, it is less important, important is entertainment-science, it is a success. One is soon connected to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-river scene. It is shameful that we can hear a lot about countries like Burma, and this movie gives some insights to the country at least. Has the situation changed since 1995? Events that occur later this month can answer the word "no" in response to this question and always rule out cruelty, even the life of the beggar, not only limit women or children!
