This movie is very long, but the whole price divided into several nights. This is an all star star, and if you have a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart throbbing! :-) My mother is a civil war buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we see this movie (we have turned off the TV), on several nights, we do not get the whole thing. We had every line in memory of the movie, lol. Some popcorn pops, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance. This is a great film for them, for action, war, blood and emptiness, but for the soft, romantic side too. The women wearing clothes were big! Occasionally I think I was born in a wrong age, lol.
