Despite a lot of negative user reviews this is a great show. The purpose of this show is to make you entertained by making you laugh. The two boys compete against each other to get the girls' phone numbers. Easy. Two men in this show are trying to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> Some people hate showers for various reasons, but I think they misunderstood as a "educational" show about how to choose a girl. Well it's not, it's a comedy show, and its whole point laughing at you, you're not taught anything. If you do not like the show, because it does not teach you anything, but do not see it. If you do not like the whole clubbing thing, do not see it. If you do not like socialization, you will not see it. This show is a ridiculous show. If you look for someone else to pick up girls, it does not let you laugh, so do not see it. If you do not have the ability to see this show and "pick up" yourself then you are so disappointed in yourself but there is no reason to hate Shock, just do not see it!
