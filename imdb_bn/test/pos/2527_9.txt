This is probably the best movie from Director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that hunt all Latin American countries, poverty and survival in the world. In this fact, the most affected children generally leave orphans or are abandoned by their poor parents, because they often fall into crime, prostitution, and crime in the society "dogs eating dogs". With very good acting and a "no-frills" approach, this movie can be reached to you, great story plot, some must have a collection movie. Acting role Fernando Ramos went to The Silva, a young boy who was killed by a criminal, died a few years later in robbery. I want to see the movie, "Pixot kicked off?" So you can have more of the life-depth concept of these characters. Other characters from the film were the same fate, some died and others were in jail. Not less this movie will last for a long time in your memory
