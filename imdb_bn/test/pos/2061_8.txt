"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is a delightful and very good action thriller and a career success for Gina Davies. The plot is very familiar with Borne Identity but what is so War scenes are a real treat for eye and the platinum is powerful enough to keep you in for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> This is managed by an artistic sensation and avoids the maximum number of actions. Geena Davis is great as a action chick and her natural "good wife" role gets past. Samuel L. Jackson Supersonic Player is as usual as usual. Although the film's badness is extremely cheesy, you can tell what you are going to do. <br /> <br /> It prevents normal run-of-the-mill action such as the Commando and the Deadly Ground, and it is one of the best employees within a few years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment 7.4 / 10
