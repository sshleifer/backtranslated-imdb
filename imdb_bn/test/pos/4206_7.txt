Another delightful Warner Flick I really liked John Garfield, though I wonder why Cagan is not playing this role. Perhaps it was very similar to the Angels with darts fax? I mean, this is the story of another Dead and Kid, but I really appreciate them here and this movie has a lot of beautiful sunny touch with some good plays. Great work with boys Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole "swim" scene that started without warning, but the wind came as soon as the catastrophe came. <br /> <br /> One negative comment: Cloud Renaissance was fairly wrong. As a detective, the fine actor here takes place as a nun in place as a nun.
