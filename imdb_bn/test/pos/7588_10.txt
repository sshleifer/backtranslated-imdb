As already mentioned, short films "Every Sunday" (1936) may be considered as the first music video. This is a happy accident that is due to the MGM requirements for opening several small films to show its feature length content. They had some new singing talent (Judy Garland and Deba Durbin) and in the Park Setting, Norman Rockwell concerted together the mix of music styles together. <br /> <br /> Who had dreamed that they would capture the best collection of pictures from Eisenstein's "Odessa Step" sequence. <br /> <br /> It's some unexpected people sitting around a small wooden band shell on Sunday Park and strauss play with tired eyes. The shows were unveiled and the next Sunday Judy and Dina saved this day. The operatic Diana song follows the song "Il BÃ©cheo" (The Kiss) and the song "Watched a Swing" opposite the Garland song. Climax mixes two styles nicely in a pair of "America". <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I'm just a child.
