I place Opera as one of the best Argentine films. Plot holes and inconsistencies? Of course, but I do not think they would harm the movie as much as any other critic. Many of the Argentine films contain lots of elements of "off the wall", but it is part of the paintings of his films. <br /> <br /> Short Story: Cyco Opera New Lady. Usually Argentine twists and turns ensue, leading up to a decent payoff in a measure. Argentina is not the best, but I'm still dragging it from time to time. If you like her other stuff, definitely enjoy her look - just do not mix it with the artificial paintings of Argentina, which is really terrible ... 8/10
