It's always one of my most favorite movies. Very kind to tell you? Well, yes it is. But Chris is incredibly incredible, fun. His brutal brilliance is more than any other film in this film. Look at the scenes of the motley, when the spade is caught under its jeep, and the other: "For God's love go away !!!"
