Well, do not expect some high culture ... .. bad acting, the story fails, but it still looks good movie. Why? Because it is dark, somewhat stupid, unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to see. Do not expect anything, just as I said, just look at it for yourself and I know what you mean. <br /> <br /> This is a movie, without a plot or memorable performance, but enough scenery that will make you smile, cry or at least pregnant to make it look ... <br /> <br /> < br />
