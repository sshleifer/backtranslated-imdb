An important part of the "Confirmed Dead" series, because it presents four new characters: Laaki rescues Naomi from the rescue team before getting a knife behind him. However, according to my one-line summary quote, the true purpose of being on the island can be completely something else. All new characters are confusing (especially Miles, some types of psychological / extrinsic), but at this point it is still too early to make a difficult decision. I felt that this episode was just a step away from "The Beginning of the End" (there is no flash-forward right now, instead of short-term flashbacks), but it still shows its stunning moments and steam at the end. *** Out 4
