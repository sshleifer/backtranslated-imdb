If you are even interested in fighting in the United States even silently, then this film is valuable. It's not saying great historical stories. There is no flashing, no cavity, no murder - only the story of the unfortunate group of Union soldiers is falling on the farm of a conformed woman and her son and they take their captain's conscience as much as possible. The incident took place that the incident unfolded by affecting his feelings of humanity in clash with the conflict of his duty to his people and his causes. Finally, he reached a compromise that any of us would be harsh. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historic spirit of the Kentucky War, a slave state that tried to be neutral, but eventually decided to stay in the union under the mysterious political situation of detaining some lawmakers. Nearly half of the soldiers from Kentucky fought for the opponent, but at that time there was not much treatment for what they were living there. This image only makes a great contribution to the "look and feel" of the time and place.
