I saw this image as a baby and loved it. I like Nikki how tough and full power, and how he destroys Louden's perfect Yuppie life and corrupts him and launches him in his crazy way. As a child of the 80's, I showed New York exactly like the domain of Madagasar's character, and the wild animals were walking behind the terrible and disgusting men. Now as an adult I love movies because of the same reason, and much more so that the story of love is nicknamed Nick Niche Finn's crazy antics. Although I still want to go anywhere and want to find a indoor atrium like this movie. Pure beauty and genius.
