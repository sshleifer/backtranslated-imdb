Father Hood is an unwitting father of an entertaining story that certainly hood! Patrick Swayz Jack always hid Charles to make a "big score", which is going to keep him in the simple street. He was in prison when his wife died and his two children were cared for in cattle. When he "came out" he was probably better than feather care? Yet he still had to score his fate. Her daughter Catherine Charles (who performed marvelously by Sabrina Lloyd) abuses children and refrains from a Foster Care organization that is misusing money spent on children. He hunts his father; How bad the place was and his brother Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsal) told him that "the only 7 year old child" is being transferred to the organization that he has been abducted from his father, kidnapped him. Starting an adventure across three countries, Jack is telling herself that she has to get rid of kids! Patrick Soze is really good in this comedy, playing the "Hood" (perhaps the least shortage for this criminal character), which is similar to Johnny Castle character of the Walt Disney dance, in this astronomy Jack is apt and more optimistic than Johnny Kassel. Swayze is funny and the assembly is not quite a good comedy! Hal Berry starred Catherine Mareser, who is a reporter, who is trying to get the Foster Care system to become Swar's partner.
