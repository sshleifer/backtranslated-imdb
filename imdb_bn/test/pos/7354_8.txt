I did not have too much hope for the horror film of the three films of this low budget, returning "horror movies" (not scary to Scramble!). But I became astonished! People are scary !!! The first 2 stories are just brilliant. The first one about driving a new wed couple into a dark forest with their RV, when they bump into an awesome ........ (see movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl, who lives alone for one night .... I know this is not a special word but it's scary. I promise you The last story is scary but not least bad. It's about a biker and a ghosthouse. The stories are actually based on real urban legends (I think Kevin Williamson can steal ideas). Make this movie better !!! I said, the most horrific stories I've made are three short stories-horror movies!
