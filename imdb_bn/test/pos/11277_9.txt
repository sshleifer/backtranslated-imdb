I absolutely love this film. It's not very entertaining, but it's a festival of diverse and stunning images! There are no conversations, only some background sounds and words. If you are completely different and original, and enjoy blurred and bizarre ... then you might like this art. Aiki was created like the first movie that made the first camera, at a time when people like weird people live and they have a malicious habit. God killed himself with a razor and gave birth to Mother Earth. After the fall of the maternal world's abstraction, it inspired itself, and gave birth to a son "flesh on the bone". We do not know inhuman torture, rape and murder inhuman acts for what is followed ... or are we?
