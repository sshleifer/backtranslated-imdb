Have you ever watched yourself a movie or documentary and want to keep yourself from things that shout "Do not do it!"? Any? Well, you've done the time and undoubtedly you have to start the Deep Water to get you started. <br /> <br /> This story is based on Donald Crowhurst and based on the first round-the-world Yacht Race by people in 1968. This word "person" is important, because these suicide survivors are scared alone. <br /> <br /> Most people are well-known in the feather communities of England (where they start from), but among them there was an "unknown dark horse" and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Struggling financially, Crowhurst enlists a bakery who can take everything from her at least in the race should fail to try it through a large part of the race. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You lose all your own (it was important to have Crohor's wife and several children). You will notice the word "unclear captain" there. He was not just exposed, he was never out on the open sea! Did I mention suicide? The archives of the Eastern and Next Nations fly into the footage, and among the friends, family and today's contacts of the Crowhurst, Deepwater merged with efficiency. Originally seen as a poor soap that gave up on his head, the film gradually shows you limited choices of water in Crowhurst months and months after. Leak his ship. Equipment break Psyche stretches breaking points (and beyond). Crowhurst finds herself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way. It is also interesting that it is interesting to see the mental breaks of other racers, as they deal with their monopoly settlement in their own boat. <br /> <br /> Wave-like emotions, such as you can see, this wonderful documentary can make you a little sick (without trying to foot in your foot). And you probably will be frustrated to choose; Like the proud Mr. Crowhurst like the depression <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, that this shameful thinking will erode the nation and feel the feeling of moving around. <br /> <br /> Unbelievably.
