August Day / Die d'Aagst Mark Racka has given us a sun-satellary Catalan documentary-style street film, which in most cases is a deadly reformative meditation on the brotherhood and the recovery of the dead. Beautiful, sometimes large, rich atmospheric 35 mm. Landscape images, beautiful soundtracks and animated as a mood piece of Catalan-language description, if someone is content with a speed, which does not lead to many speeds and especially does not lead anywhere. The filmmaker Mark Ratcha and his non-identical couple are David Starr and their younger sister's story is pronounced. Mark Ramon Barnes (1940-2001), who was a family friend, the socialist editor is looking for life. He felt he was involved with the information and had to take a break. This film breaks, which wants to capture the mood of interview with Barnes' associates, the Spanish Civil War, the drought that they were enjoying in the season, the scary landscapes, the brotherly love for each other, swimming and snand nudity, and the characters they wrote in their van From the camp ran out as It is a giant catfish pursuit and one of the brothers to find temporary disappearance. Eventually, David will have to go back to Barcelona to stay with his daughter and Mark will return to his project, and it will end there. I was fascinated to hear an extended description in the Catalan language with a mix of Spanish and French-word words (probably linked to Provenceals). This is not a major film, but it is a transparent visual and sensual with the beauty of the audience, and the fresh and thought-provoking way of fiction and documentary autobiography and style with an autobiography film festival. <br /> <br /> The official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at the Lincoln Center.
