Disney is itself the first Disney animated film to be involved, this story is not particularly original or interesting (I believe, the only animated Disney movie since 1940, which is not the same as before) books or other works, but rather an original story). As others have mentioned, this plot is primarily a cross between the Lady and the Tram and 101 Dalmatian kidnappings / travel stories. <br /> <br /> To overcome this error, filmmakers have successfully used many of the most features of the past 10-15 years of Disney Animated films: Phil Harris (The Jungle Book) One of the main characters, the voice of one of the previous films Here's another scamman crossover with Louis Premieu following his Duet. The visual appearance of this film is displayed with "Dalmatians" (with excellent rhythm French Impressions), and here villen (Butler) strongly reminds Henchenmen in that film. (Perhaps it is one of Disney's least memorable villains.) The main story goes back to the cats, and Batler's ongoing problem is with two dogs in rural areas (Pat Batman and George "Gubber" performs great voice in Lindsey). The same is known to animals who have also seen "Tramp" and "Dalmatian" at the same time. The owner of the cats, when the sleeping beauty shows a striking visuality with the evil parents, then it does not have any ugly traits of character, and it is very warm and generous. <br /> <br /> The real power of film is voice work; Firstly, after going to the use of most known actors of The Jungle Book, the strategy with Disney veterans Harris is firmly running. Starring Holly and Eva Gabor from The Jungle Book (very similar character in the next film The Rescuers), as well as Crohther's and Nancy Coolp. Everyone here is nice, especially Harris and Gabo. Echo-like emotions are excellent, showing different emotions. <br /> <br /> Children can be disturbed by a few brief episodes (fleeing from a speeding train route, one of the nearly drowning children), but it is not presented in a particularly scary or dark manner and is very fast . Overall, there are very few of the more awesome scenes found in many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> A fun curiosity is a visual aspect of the 60's culture, which was painted in 1910 by jazz-performing cats; No one can help, but because of the surprise this story is not set firmly because most of the Parisian intermediary time has changed. It really has more sense in that way. <br /> <br /> The song is not particularly memorable, it is fun and sometimes performed very enjoyable. However, common strength is applied here, excellent voice work and fine animations contribute to overcome all the relatively low and minor vulnerabilities. Not as far away from the glory of the classic "10" as Pinoccio or Alladin, and "9" can not be mostly sleeping beauty or 101 dalmatians, it is probably 8 fewer than 10; Probably a 7
