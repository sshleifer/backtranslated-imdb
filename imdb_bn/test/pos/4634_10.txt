If you are "the child of eight children" like me, then perhaps you remember this 1981 Disney movie - one of Disney's first PG-rated movies, and Michael J. FOX Screen Abhishek When I was in Middle School, I remembered seeing the film over over in HBA, and Disney recently got old copies, since Disney has stopped making the film several years ago. Not saying, it's a real fun movie to watch. Five college teams started Daisifier in an evening competition around Los Angeles, eventually trying to reach the finish line. See for the cameras from Paul Robesz. From the Chess Music to Disco, the Fat Twin is visible, it's the 1980's funny movie that you love.
