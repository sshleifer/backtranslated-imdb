You've seen this movie ... I saw it at my first 13-year-old theater, ... fast forward for 20 years and now gay (thanks a lot of dark knights! Yes, yes!). This movie has moved away from me as a child (the grave still works!), But not as an adult in this romance story, but it keeps violent smiles ... highlights sounds, teens call each other, "Nerdelbrain "(My personal favorite) to" turkey " Also, tear your eyes for the scene where Carroll (blonde, head sister) tries to leak his phone on the soda cane (can not believe that they do not restart it!) ... Other highlights include the additional dramatic explosion of Adam West and gooey Body. If you are really awful fans, I would only recommend this picture because it is almost a parody of horror for me. There's a difference. A vague factor and plot is good, but if you want to be afraid of your wits (if you are 10 years old or not) do not see it.
