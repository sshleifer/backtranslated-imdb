Ok i did not read the book ???? And maybe the book was good ???? WHO knows ??? // But I like the movie. It was entertaining, a little boring, enjoyable and most of all the heart-wrenching. Friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children play so well, especially the son of the slave. O my God, who is facing the world, such as the shape of God. Interest: he steals our heart so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* friend to another man and his confusion and frustration can be understood as a child. But when he was abandoned by his friends when he was angry when he ignores the need of comfort. However, he was just a kid and a bit lively. I hope that poor children, the old version of the movie. It hurts to think it ends. This movie is sad. I felt horribly last time. Tears down my eyes. Yes background score is fantastic, the view is WOW. Kite scenes are interesting. And the better it gets a bit of an adventure in the middle. Wonderful acting and thrown nicely. The kids played so well. Great guideline Why does this movie critics do not know the WOOO has failed. But it sure did me wo. 10/10 must be seen ??????
