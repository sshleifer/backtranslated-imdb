Entertainment art forms and / or references People or things or even brand of products are usually the mainstay of such shorts but this is not used in the quantity here. Most of the individual gags are rather generic. As I am going to give examples, there will be spoilers below: <br /> <br /> Just three (well, technically four - one too quickly at the end of the cartoon) Characteristics which I saw, which are less for such kind of short, though one is a perfect Featured character with quantity activity. They are Jack Benny (Jack Bunny), Leopold Stovosczky and Indemnity Naked Sparks (as a potential Crab, it is very good that a Crab was involved with Warner Brothers in the early 1930s, Ned Sparks). Billy Rose's reference to the Accraquead and the reference to a radio show named "Henry Aldrich" (Kunming, Ma!), A game of Superman (here Supermeo) and an Off Off in Klein "King Kong". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The tomato soup cans are doing "Can Can", the gingerbread men become parrotopers, Using tissues for parasuits and so much more Gags are great and this is a great example of a Bob Clampett cartoon. There is nothing to tear the director at this moment and when it is not close to its best work. This brief can be found at Lonny Tune's Golden Collection, Volume 3, which I highly recommend which is a wonderful set. It is itself recommended.
