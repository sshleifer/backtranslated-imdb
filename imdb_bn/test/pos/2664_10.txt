I spent many nights after watching 2001. Not because of emotional horror (a wonderful creation of only 2001), but because of some clarity of it (the unstable soul) that I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very deep way. And after reading the novel (Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself inspired by the imagination level (as a writer). <br /> <br /> Space ODC is not just anyone who can "and see". Be prepared for one, or it can not be understood. Actually, I do not think it can be understood at all times, at least not always at all. It's infinite and then its philosophical journey, an excellent composition of its genre, and technically powerful from all aspects of the powerful musical soundtrack featuring Richard Strauss of Johan Strauss and 'Blue Dunnub''s 'Sprint Jarathstra', after 32 years. Take all the time <br /> <br /> But at the end you will see this picture. If it can bring some command and burden to the struggling artist's universe, it can certainly do it for you. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I'm just crazy ...
