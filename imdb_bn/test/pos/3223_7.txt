Every time I see this show, I just want to curse manufacturers to shut it down and to waste my time week after week. Conversation, or monologues, rather than being endlessly rants about everything, everyone is becoming just so tired. For example, the episode I saw yesterday was probably an unusual dishwashing about an extraordinary dish (which I forgot, forgot the pasta with the flesh), it always guided Gilmour's family to turn dinner into an all-out war. And this was just a few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> It seems all the time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use should definitely be huge. <br /> <br /> But every time something happens. Babbling stops and suddenly there is this wonderful silent, emotional moments. For example, this week it was the breakdown of the estate agent's Lorelai. I thought it was the best part of the TV that I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Almost everything makes it worthwhile.
