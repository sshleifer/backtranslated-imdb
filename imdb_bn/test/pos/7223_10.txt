Romeo and Juliet have been interpreted in many ways, but the versions rarely have the importance of playing it. Many people can remember that the spirit of romance was actually inside the nail, in the story on the west side and trombone tromso and Juliet. At first glance, this is another mere splatterfest, and many feel that the Shakespearean classmates disappoint. However, there is a honest feel about the film's. Today's sick mind has been updated to appeal to young people, but not without qualification. Yes, frequent isolation, body piercings, car crashes, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and brutality are in bad taste, but what is the harm if there is such sweet love story as the basis? Most of the film's acting is (I mean, it is tromba at all), there are some real chemistry between two leads, it is much more theoretical than the big budget nudity and the Star Wars Episode. Modernization has a great deal, but most of the text is tectonics, especially when Tromso and Juliet are together. Juliet is a great scene where "sharing is so sweet sorrow", and Trumo quickly follows in the 90's Grunge Fashion, "Yes, it sucks completely." I think it's really unfortunate that this movie will not be recognized for recognition or individual expression. I hope that those video stores see it on the shelf, they will not be fairly close to the movie, because they are missing out on most of the lost experiences.
