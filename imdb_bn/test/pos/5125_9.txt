The story is unbelievable, it starts with a new baby in the city of Ray, when on a bus in the school, he sees a child running with a shoe, and on that day he is trying to fight with a big stupid nose. . Roy soon discovered that the child had escaped, and he and his sister sister are trying to surround a construction scene, which could kill all the beautiful villagers living there. Ray decides to help them fight there, they are smart but leftist Dave Delinco (Luke Lynn Wilson) could win this fight before Stambl to them. An enjoyable movie, fun and adventure. I appreciate Luke Wilson for taking this role. I do not think his brother Oven will also play this role.
