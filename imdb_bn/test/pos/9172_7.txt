Although the "late doctor" concept is one thing that preserves this film with an ideal romantic comedy genre, I see it quite enjoyable to increase my opinion, so I liked it a lot more than just a lot of twists The medieval plot was more than that. Smith will always act as a hit, who dedicates his life to advising people how and how women do not win ... from their failed attempts to keep a college girlfriend He has lots of smiles as his latest patient, overweight, Gaqui affirmative Albert Bermanman (Kevin James) has successfully tried to help court in the beautiful colleague Allegra Kole (Amber Valetta) court. Also, when he decides to save a woman, he meets in Turkey's bar, who does not think he is surrounded by him, he attracts himself (Eve Mendes) - it seems to be a big deal for him, so I From college he assumes that he does not actually practice his own rules on himself. Unfortunately, Sarah is a Gossip columnist who is interested in "Date Doctor", who got an Alberta's apparently darkish man like Albert - especially the player / Joker Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) the heart of his best friend (Julie N Emery) and when he did not see that he When he refused to see him, he did not realize that the doctor he had seen had hated him . Still, following the problem and stuck to the left of the hit what to do with his own relationship, although Albert did not have any major help when he tried to determine what else to do. Good acting, humor with money and some other fine points are there. The character of the hit is diverse and intelligent, sometimes managed to be both simultaneously. Truly, a misunderstood woman's misunderstanding where people do not really work (why do they always show it?) Seem to be generally and annoying - guess if it's not the first time, nor the 5th time. I saw the IT - but the rest were completely new. I just love this movie more than once - I think it was time to see 3/5 at once, when it was played on a restaurant TV - but I still approve. It is certainly worth the money for its curvature.
