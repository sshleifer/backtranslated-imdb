Someone has it clearly for the wind and I can not believe what I saw on the screen. I have a better and more firm film than most of the freedom around the year. Cinematography demonstrates a genuine love and expertise and casting was just right. I would like to see these people especially JK Rippies. <br /> <br /> As far as story and script, I'm not sure the negative comments before this post have been made knowing about someone else about the movie. The long-drawn knight-picashing post that took a few hours to compile, and the only criticism left for any movie on this site by critics, is the obvious slander in the film's producers. I do not know the inside story, but it probably will make a good movie. What I know from being around this victory is that those who try to please the producers are usually horrified and when the filmmaker has the speed, drive and general sense of "killing the child", then someone ends up feeling hurt. This is also part of Biz and it is one of the real learning tools dedicated to the Sheikh movie business. Of course, failure to write a false review on the Internet is better than failure to sit at home (study: honest and truthful with them). And that nasty, nasty review interprets my best guess. As far as there is a grain of truth behind all things, there must be a point, but these overcrowding of crops is so high that they have become apparently imaginary. <br /> <br /> This is not a slash of blood bathe if you are looking for it more than the mental suspense thriller, which is generally not appreciated by the lowest common index. The best way to see this movie is to try to eliminate any preconceived concept, pop it and publish it - seriously, characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say. Do not think that you can come to the conclusion that this conclusion has been developed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I probably did not give it 9 in the normal position The comment actually attracted me in the film (I have a secret to really bad movies). To me, the ratings below should be reserved for frustrating, vain, bad acting and silly written movies. Anyone who applies here - it is made of quality movies with some real talent. I gave it nine back to the right direction screw tips. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
