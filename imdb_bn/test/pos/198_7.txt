The Russian actress Tatiana Samalova reminds me of the young man of the Hepburn, and the crane's camera loves him much like flying. He is the central point of romance in a diverse battle against the background of World War II in Moscow. <br /> <br /> This film is almost poetic in its fantastic B & D cinematography, which is the main reason for seeing the first movie. From the place, I've never heard of it and decided to try it out in TCM. <br /> <br /> It's a story of deep love for a person who is suddenly away from his role as a draft soldier during the war crimes. He can not forget the memories of his romantic attachment, but unnecessarily tied up with someone who imposed himself on him, a pianist who soon realized that he still loves the soldier he wants to hear. Their marriage is a cause of frustration, because he does not allow his soldier to go in for a happy time. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story, he accepted the idea that he would never go back and be able to cope with the reality and cope with the situation. There is a very harmful final scene at a train station where the soldiers are greeted by their loved ones and the tears share the joy of the returning soldiers with some flowers from her glass to the happy family. <br /> <br /> Stylish and striking camera-work that carries the picture, as well as the story of honestly played. <br /> <br /> It's done impressively, but perhaps English subtitles did not say the whole story because some plot elements seem to be <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, another great Russian movie, reminded me of a Soldier style of style.
