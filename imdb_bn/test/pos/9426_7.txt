Since others complained about keeping Sherlock Holmes in contemporary settings, I will not do that. Basil rathbone that may fit in any age with voice, savoir faire. It's a nicely integrated mystery based on the best one of "The Dancing Man" in Canaan-Dell Tales. Instead of the original plot, it is made of a Nazi plot male section. Hollis became the mouthpiece of British war effort. Her opponent Marriott, who seems to have died often to compete with the central figure in the 13th film on Friday. He is certainly creative, but Rothbone Homes is unnecessary. With Watson just for this one ride. She is not given much stupidity to spout this film and that's a real plus. The intrigue is complicated enough to keep more interest. A last lecture is that it is almost a parody of itself. But then I could not be critical of a time and nation which was under great pressure. If you need to call in Holme, so be it.
