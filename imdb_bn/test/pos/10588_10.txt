The movie was fantastic. If you have a nasty video on the left, Jacques or his show is a fan of Viva La Left, but you can not like it. I have a few friends who are not fans who enjoy it, and others who thought it was not good. Those who do not like it, were mostly female friends, they did not really realize anything of unreasonable humor, which personally I think the film made so much fun. I'm sure the whole film was portrayed in the Bamboo home town, most of which have regular regular inspection positions. Cast is made up of all his friends and cky friends, and also has some big name PRO Skateboarder. Soundtrack, with music by Heim, is phenomenal. In my opinion, Haggard has it all. A great plot, the characters you will not see elsewhere. Humorous songs and a cast that were dedicated to the project.
