William M. Thakur once said, "Sun is a good smile." When I saw the distance, I must say that the sun's light shines on my sun. This picture was fantastic, the opening was done very cleverly, the story was well organized together, at least two fish chip shop owners who were forced to form an alliance to quickly defeat Dawood and Goliath's struggle. Food chain which creates a restaurant in their street. <br /> <br /> Although the film is very intelligent, contemporary Australian ethnically illustrates, especially if you are in the middle of a clash of clashes or culture, it was finally fun. Traditional Anglo-Australians and Italian Australians Stereotypes and How They Found "Crisis, Unity", is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> I see Vince Colosmer's performance as an Italian-Australian fish named "Tony Steilano". The owner of the chip shop was able to be the first class at the age of thirty, his performance was very real and credible, through his performance, he was able to really bring the ingredients, or I call the spirit of the Italian Australian stereotype, which is not really very Italian but it is not only Australian but also the Colosimo He found that the balance was breathed in his lungs and it was a hint Forest said. <br /> <br /> The cinematography could have been good, more shots in the local area were beautiful, I did not see it from Melbourn, but where in Melbourne? To me it is seen anywhere from Ivanha to the boulevard, although I'm not 100% sure on her. <br /> <br /> I do not know why so many people are making "The Castle" compared to this picture. They have the same theme running, standing away, standing in one of their own leagues. <br /> <br /> I think the film is fantastic with "the royal", it has everything, it's funny, Jokes is great, it is related to contemporary things in front of Australian society, the story is good, I like it! I highly recommend it.
