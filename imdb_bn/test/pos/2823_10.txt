This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weakness could be nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is often seen in men than women, so I feel more uncomfortable to see how the lead actress behave. I think women can think about this behavior, but I do not think they work on it. Dark scenes add to the feeling of evil that needs to be hidden. When the prisoners fled, I was released. I was hoping that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but it did not. Maybe that's more realistic. Instead of going up the hill of the new mountain, life is moving in the same direction.
