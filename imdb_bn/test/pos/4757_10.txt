"The Seven-Ups" seems to be a repetition of "French connection", which was released two years ago. Both late ray skidars and Tony Lo Bianco were present, along with stunt driver Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> But we're not talking to French drug physics; Instead, we are cruelly killed by a hoodlum, after we are dealt with a fight against assorted hoods and criminals. We see displeasure and the 1990's New York City <br /> <br /> I love watching this movie because it's exciting to see the action, and it's a cool time reminder. That said, when the movement of cars was compared, Mr. Hickman was one of the three most involved: the film, the bullet and the French connection. Each Chase has its own attributes of the scene, and this is one of the easy spanking. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad this title DVD saw the light of day.
