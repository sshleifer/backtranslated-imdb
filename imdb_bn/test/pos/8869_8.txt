"Tho Moma of the Train" with a lot of smiles is a simple dark comedy. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer; Danny Davito played one in Crystal's writing class. The former wife of the Crystal * Hag * kept it neatly, and the Crystal hated him. Davito, sensing it, proposes an agreement to Crystal one night: if Crystal kills mother Davito, then Davito kills Crystal's wife. Crystal certainly refused, but later, deep corruption in his heart makes him yes. And such things are played when we try to throw someone's wax from a moving train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting characteristic; Evil, greed, revenge, ego, belief, what is right, but the story of most corruption. We've always watched the crystal white collar writer with the clash around him, and due to the continuous annoyance of Devito, he said "yes". But we could recognize his subconscious, he wanted to say "yes" and he was pleased that he told Davito. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is a dark explosion in the film of Hitakote Amar. A train, "and while playing a" stranger in a train "in a theater, a tribute at the beginning of the movie. We are watching Davito movie, and a light search comes on her head. She gets an idea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything around him has made him so fierce that his inner emotions have come out and he is going to train Divito wax Nick <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Interesting character study.
