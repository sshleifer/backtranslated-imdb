I recently saw the title "Reader" and saw that the film was planned and implemented. I really felt for both characters portraying Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz in this film. Elizabeth was able to show great range with her blind character and felt emotionally attached to me. Morgan was able to sell me that he protected "Sisi" or Franz from the sorrow of losing his sister living in Copenhagen. The great thing about the movie was in the short run time and the budget of ten thousand dollars, Duncan Rogers was able to create a very well-made movie that has been interested in viewers. Rogers has a great insight into the actor's ability to display his talent and change the camera angle. If a director can create a great movie with a small budget, I always feel like he can do with a big budget. Great work Duncan !!
