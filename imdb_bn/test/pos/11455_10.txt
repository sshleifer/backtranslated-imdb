This movie took me to surprise. The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. Then, we plunged in a half-cheesy production, betraying his low budget. Typical American ternary characters are usually presented gradually, usually with more personal details than those found in movies. By hitting the slit fan, we know the characters, and like them or hate them like their individual personality. It's kind of like a slow-up set up, a sliding roller coaster up to a shield. Thankfully, once the action is performed, it is completely old school old school! Steve Jones's make-up effect is awesome. Very big budgeted movie quality equal. And the scares are jolting. Kevin Tenney has ever delivered his best film, with heart-felt surprises and unclear suspicious strong ups. Tongue-in-cheeks, sometimes Chess, humorously identify the movie as a horrible 80 horror, in contrast to the previous customs tunes like "Living Dead Night" or "Hills Eyes". But for the true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry of a double bill in 1999's "Hunt on the Hunted Hill". Set-up and character dynamics are so similar that you really think that they are actually making an image?
