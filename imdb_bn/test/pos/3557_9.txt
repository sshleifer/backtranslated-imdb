I really get annoyed with sitcoms; You always stop being funny because you know what's coming. On the other hand, hi hi hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's a loud funny smile. I bought the second set of the series, (Series 3-4) and I am surprised how much I enjoy. For my writers or actors (or many invisible crew members) there is nothing but my praise because the wait they provide is good. The gems and actors from this series are saying for themselves the respect it earned. Kraft and Perry have made some pure gold, some of which are hi hey.
