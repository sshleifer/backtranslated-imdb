You have to choose baseball, and you should sort them at least as a Tom Sailor, but if you meet that criteria you must enjoy this movie. Sellek is a former major league star who found Japan (?) Japan under his carrier wind Interesting visual appearance of really good thoughts and behavior of Japanese and customs. The performance of the Selker manager ("Clint Eastwood of Japan"), his daughter Friend Takshashi and his translator's great support performance. Chelation works well between Selel and Tacheniya, it is actually a very romantic movie different from baseball. Before becoming a continuous rock for the Alastet, see Heisburtt as a fellow player. The movie wraps up very neatly. Easily my top fifty movies all the time and maybe baseball is one of my favorites.
