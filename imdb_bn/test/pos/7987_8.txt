First off, this film has no stories. It is clear that there were a lot of rewriting during the production - sometimes the characters mentioned in a timeline impossible, and probably it was never known to anyone in the timeline set of the whole story. <br /> <br /> I said, the picture is beautiful. Pfeiffer is amazing - and I mean wonder, as Catwoman; She nailed the character's underlying sexy dark and good / bad trend. Walken Walken is - but even more painful than usual. When the Penguin comes when the Davito Comic book is not true, but he is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keaton, as a batman, is underrated. <br /> <br /> and music and style is pure movie thrill. True, the third law does not work. But the final 2 scenes knockout, and it is clearly meant that Pfeiffer and Keaton got a triangle derailed by the strange darkness of this film. This is very bad because Pfieffer and Keaton were classic chemistry and they played with the third theory, Joel, you know who might not have got the opportunity to destroy Batman for a whole generation of movie fans.
