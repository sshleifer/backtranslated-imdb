We need peace and love in this world now than ever! <br /> <br /> This picture really shows the wonderful music of the Broadway show, and the fantastic character of legendary Tharpa! I saw it again after many years, and it's still hanging up well. <br /> <br /> Thank you, for installing MGM / UAE DVD! I like the option of watching the widescreen. MGM threw stones to do this in their DVD releases. <br /> <br /> Love Honey as Williams Burger and John Savage Claude. For this photo they could not choose the best actors and actresses! Beverly D'Angelo in the movie, 'Hot Mama' - I forgot how hot! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is nicely illustrated More) and so colorful and lovely and really brings the great screen of 1968. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when it was released in 1979, when I was released at the age of 15 and still it moved me in 40 minutes. Here are some other opinions saying that they think it should have been made soon - I do not think Hollywood was ready. In the early 60's, in the late 70's, to create such films. <br /> <br /> Vietnam's war ended in 1975, and the whole thing was a little more humiliating to the house, I think this story will be pictured earlier (such as 1969, 70, 71) <br /> <br / > <br /> Bravo directs Milos Farman! I love this picture !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It looks good to see it again, this time in DVD. It did not look good!
