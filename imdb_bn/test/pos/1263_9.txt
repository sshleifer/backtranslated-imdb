This picture is fantastic, it has the feeling of the first film of 'P' and 'Clark' in the same low budget, but it's the style of 'Memento' (Writer / Director Christopher Nawlan). Scores, sound effects, photography and editing almost 'memo' prototypes, and the story shows that Christopher Nolan is the best time to write and manage. Less budget appearance and performance, even by the short length of the film and it will not simply watch!
