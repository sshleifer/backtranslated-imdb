I have to admit that I do not think this movie is very good. But, of course I like it. I think it was really the best adaptation to the Burroughs novel. And of course, it is one of Christopher Lambert's best films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A good movie about bullying, as a doctrine with Weasullar.
