My top two actors are in this movie - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchell. <br /> <br /> Ryan can play some of Arthur Miller's plays from Shakespeare and play nicely. When he began his lecture in this movie, "... names like Samuels and others whose names are hard to name with" - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Samuels (Sam Levin), urged to investigate the murder of a civilian who repeatedly chatted with some soldiers. Mitchell solder wanted to contact him - found his wallet apartment. But Mitchell is a gentle soldier who only lost his wife. <br /> <br /> The story has been told from different perspectives. Mitchell and Samuels strike up a friendship and go back to Samuels's apartment. Samuels seems lonely, think Mitchell. He said, "For years you were concentrating on a peanut and now it's gone". He does not know whether he is talking about war. <br /> <br /> Ryan Monty, superb as psychological racism. <Br> <br /> Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor, whose career was reunited with Film-Nir. "Crossfire", "They Will Not Believe Me" and "Another Woman" is a great example. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The strange couple" Kelly is outstanding as her brief but bold role. Perhaps this is probably the best movie about racism.
