'Oh so praised' was seen in Fargo and it was nothing more than average, and I was terrible if there was a good idea to rent another coen 'masterpiece'. This time I was far less disappointed than Fargo and I must say that most of the credit for it is good joke and George Clooney's good performance. Well, Mr. Clooney, create these at least 'Perfect Stormies' movies. You can work and you showed it here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
