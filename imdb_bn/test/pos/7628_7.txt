Stupid beautiful This picture portrays the movie 'So Bad It Good'. <br /> <br /> There are only two genius Richard Boon and Joan van Arc, and only Boi is good. The person achieving such fame as Paladine will bring air in this ugly wave of celluloid. Although he turned on a fantastic performance, I could not help but he should not have been in this piece all his fellow actors so often that he was even there. <br /> <br /> The effect of this photo is ridiculous, but fun. A dinosaur is being burnt in a cave wall and the idea of ​​coming to life suddenly B-movie gold. When 'Trisitop' dies, see how it is. It is clear that stunt actors in front of the costume know well timing. He fell to the ground before half of the dinosaur behind. I do not think it is like saying that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bunda (known as the world's best tracker) fails to notice it until it's within its surveillance range twice. I do not know what the prints are like, but in my version, there is a trademark of Gaudílí's trail in Terane's roar. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, it's fun load. I love them, and especially bad giant movies, so I consider this my collection jewel. Bad thing to your movie, definitely get this one.
