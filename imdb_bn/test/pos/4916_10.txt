L'Homme Blesse is not an indifferent, adventure-seeker audience. No explosion nor drama straight. Like Lin Ramsey's movies, the director is working more deeply in a mood than a story that is functioning and incredibly running. Because it does not depend on unwanted nudity, or sponsor pop culture. The line of the story, it's one of the best gay foreign films I've seen quite well (see also Francois Ozone, Pedro Almodoov√°). Nicholas Disease "Du Luc Do Now" gets very bad news because it is sold as a horror movie. Like a hair-hammer, this film is more than a box that you can trust. If you sit back and have a mood absorbed by fine, transformed power in the movie, you'll love this movie.
