Of course, really experienced critics who like stuff like Star Wars and Professional Extensions must definitely drag this movie and will have a really bad comment about it. But really, it's an extraordinary story and good-acting comedy Comedy Comedy. <br /> <br /> Jassi Geller (played well by Drew Barrymore) is part of a news reporting team and he ('real') job - he has to go back to school and find these days as a teenager. Well this is okay, until Josy High School remembers her horrible time and gets freaked out. But he never became a hip, it was never cold, so far it was never popular! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
