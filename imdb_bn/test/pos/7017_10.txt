I think dirty dance was a great movie, they tried to create another Havana night which was good but it was nothing like dirty dancing. I want to see another dirty dance with the same people. Without them I think it would be a mess. Many times movies are made when they try to add more, then they start to change people and movies go down the hill. I found another dancer to see what happened after the dirty dance was able to stay together. Patrick did so well with a Jennifer. This image was created during another creation in 1997. But this time it's time to stop where it's kept the same people.
