I could not believe the eye candy from the beginning. The music video being directed by the masterminds is a fan of the movie. I'm glad that this is a magnificent report for the eyes to see happy photo photography. There are so many rich, full pictures in front of me that every time I see this movie, I find something new that I have not seen before. As I have seen with the previous films, such as Blade and Sweet Man, ex-music video directors, color use is very well used to attract its attention. Although the letters can be improved better, the cost of action and expensive admission was good. I recommend you buy this one for your DVD collection. Even if you do not see it on the big screen, you will not be disappointed. I do not know I was not.
