It's amazing! A sick and twisted story of coincidence and fraud. <br /> <br /> The story is designed quickly and intelligently. This is really a perfect mix: It's all about humor and humor from the glamor and the story has been told with a lot of basicity ... The film has been created like a puzzle that is assembled by pieces and solves the story ... There are plenty of surprises to the end of the audience !! I had a little impression that some of the hits were inspired by the work of Hitko. From the scene of the different movies you see the same event before, I have seen movies but this movie goes out of it. Everything in this movie is displayed which is displayed and disappears and appears again in a different place. Every actor in the story has his own secret and we have realized that contests contribute to the puzzle .... I especially like the scenes of dark humor ... which laughs the whole theater .... This film must be seen for everyone!
