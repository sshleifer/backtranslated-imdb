This movie is apparently intended for a young, evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For this, I will vote 7 out of 10 points. This is a young group to showcase a youth movie, but I do not think it will be very good. For any other audience, I want to give it a very low rate. <br /> <br /> The critics who viewed this "a wonderful life" were right, even though they did not think I would say it. I reminded another of a "chick tract", who are a little 3 "by 5" gospel comic book. If Jack Chuck ever made a movie in his tracts, perhaps it would look a lot like "second watch". It is a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence of each of us, but it is somewhat frustrating by Christianity. Christians are all very nice, some passive, and spicy, although all non-Christians seem to be bad people. <br /> <br /> Murrayel played a large part of the chicken, and he is the greatest, chess film character. She is unlike most of any movie I have angel and most negative angel. I do not know if the director wants to stop his personality so badly or does he hurt me like this. (I admit that he reminds me of anyone who knows me.) This love of Dan is an extremist girl who does not have all the types of her, she plans to plot this movie. <br /> <br /> This image shows positive Christian values, and your young people will be entertained because they can see a little better. With a good lesson
