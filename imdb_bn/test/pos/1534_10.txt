Even the trailer of this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for those who are easily disturbed by acute objects! The best performance of Allan Rickman and Madeline Stew, without any doubt. Whether this horrific story of society gives the ability to kidnap and oppress citizens for any reason, whether they will lead anarchist or children's book writer to the bone. It was the first time I saw it in 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares me today hell. It's happening now. Apparently, IMDB needs ten lines to meet their criteria for film review. IMDB would like to get a grip! Some of us are a little brief about writing opinions.
