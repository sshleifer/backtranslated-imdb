This title comes from a revisionist benefit in a landmark prison, which makes the cover in front of his school book on the government, titled "The United States"; He added "(his name)." Many characters in this film work well - Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Beckie (Zenna Malone), Pearl (Don Chaddell) and Father Fitzgerald (Specie) as well as Leland, Becky and sister Julie (Michelle Williams) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is a bit shy, passive, nice high school student who has bravely presented himself to the cookie, whom we (we can find) due to the past history of drug problems, going to an alternative school. In the family of Baki, he has a sister, Julie, who graduated from high school and is preparing to go to college; Julie's son, Julien's age (and whose parents have recently died) live with them. <br /> <br /> Her father (Kevin Speacy) and mother has been divorced for a long time and her father is a famous novelist. Leland is very emotional. "The knowledge of six months" saw the dead man; Leland sees the teenager lovers and after that year they will accept divorce, the pain that many people are following today's happiness experience. But for the reasons that are not expressly expressed, his wise gift is for some people, for some people, not for some relationship, but for others. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, is such an observer, will the patient with a patient ever be suicidal? Even for the mighty cause? Nothing gives the reason for the film. I am working with retired therapists and many experiences with families and adolescents; Although there have been many reactions to film work - this part is not necessarily an essential element. <br /> <br /> And at least one other element that is not realistic with my experience. Life Although it is not critical. The reason for the difference between sister and belly never indicates, but it is OK. Once the two sibs start to grab different roles (one all the good girl, one another boring one), the role themselves can start driving each other's extreme positions. For the annoying one, Becky, its kind, "What do I need to love here - let me go and Julie?" And all-good, pressure to live to be the parent of a child, is not less intense in July. So, why would he sever his son's friend for a long time and his parents will be so clearly approved? <br /> <br /> Don Chadle was good at Leland's teacher; All others were good in their part. 98% of the scenes were good. What was missing was important to understand the nature of people that slip. <br /> <br /> Good acting; Defective stories and psychology; Worth seeing; Not total damage
