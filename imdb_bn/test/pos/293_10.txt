I'd like to submit the following treasure <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene, the soldiers seem to be flowing in the river, taking away and wanting to run away. Some soldiers went to Captain Willard's boat and tried to carry their suitcase. The soldiers are not issued, do they ever carry suitcases in the battlefield? They do not have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but suitcases. This scene is stupid and keeping the use of a suitcase. In addition, if you look closely, you will find that the suitcase is floating above the water. It's probably a very good indication that it's empty, otherwise it will sink.
