(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> 13th century Russia. The opening shot shows the ruins of the last attack: the welding uniform, the human crab and the skeleton of a horse. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkassov) pursued the Swedish army and influenced the ruler of the degree that he proposed to elevate him to the rank of captain. But Nevsky answers: "If you die in your homeland, do not give up." She intends to cultivate fish, ship and trade in fish. But he warns a more dangerous enemy: Nayar, meaningless and there is no possibility of buying himself: Germany. Their motives are Novgorod. They have already reached Pskov: Mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and boys. The brutal occupation forces distributed looting. Rich businessmen want to buy their independence (always some capitalist p.), But "ordinary people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander to be their leader. Pskov is burned on the ground. The Teutonic Knights have a sunny smile for Russian women who feel unfamiliar and helpless witnesses who are worn only to their fathers and children. Children are thrown into the fire, when the high-ranking people in the church look and are lazy. Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two supporters: Rich and Gadrillo and Long and Jolly Vassili. She promised to be the most brave marriage. Vesili Perezalov's Alexander Nevsky called on. The prince decided to strike but he decided to strike at once. Even the women keep a chain armor ... The attackers want to seize "the beer", but Nevsky's stratosphere is examined: Lake Pypsus is his battlefield: his men know this area, but the Germans, who are heavy, can break through the ice ... < br /> <br /> Open your eyes and see the most impressive battle scenery ever illustrated. It's not just extra people (I think this was patriotized in patriotism), but the efficient management of this huge number of Ensenhine: he abolishes sections like chess division on chess board and almost identical to the combination of each shot. An image of Rembrandt or Rubens (Horse in Fantastic stuff included). In the winter, Russia shows itself in fear, but Eisstein's visual imagery is Horos Concourse. The bodies suddenly enter the cosmic light beneath the horizon. At night, Olga and other women searched with the torch to survive. When a perfect falcon is sitting on the dead body of his master, a crow waits for the right moment to find dead moments. "Rolls-Royce" Alexander Nevsky is created by Eijenstein's directive and Prokofiev's score films. Nevsky, of course, changed the pride of Stalin, and the Russians were tall, handsome, heroic, and their perfect hairstyles. The Germans look like the barbarian maid and Ku-Klux-Clan members. Acting actor Vasily gave a one-four-character performance: the first disappointing, then heroic, young lover and comic relief. Cherkasov's main duty is heroic appearance. Finally, Nevsky-Stalin demonstrates his generosity: he "pays for small soldiers" and surrounds knights for soap. Only a beard is murderer and a traitor cleric is turned on crowds. He does not forget a final warning: Who comes with the sword will die by the sword ... He kept his promise. 10/10
