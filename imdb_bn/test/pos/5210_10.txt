People of my generation and those older people know about WWII (or Russian name - Great Patriotic War) not only from school textbook but also about witnesses and participants of the participants. My grandfather was a soldier in Stalingrad and when I was a young girl, he listened to the story of defeating the Germans. He also told me some fictional statements, he did not tell me that he was frustrated. But it was a long time ago and I have no conscious interest in what happened in the Stalinager war, I have to go back to books and movies for information. Since I saw most of the pictures in the Soviet Union, today in Russia there are a few. And "Stalinad" is an exception. The fight in the film is described from the opposite side, and the incident itself is interesting. What is shown in the film is quite different from what I'm using. <br /> <br /> This picture reminds me of a big deal in Remark "Jit Zoo LeBeney on Jit Zoo Starben", because the war is displayed through the realization of a common German soldier. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by a fascist repetition. From the Italian coast, the heroes of the handsome and enthusiastic European movie reached the snow-covered hungry Soviet Union. They are destroyed in death; It's clear from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> After the participation of elite separatists in the first battle of Stalinager, one of the soldiers said that the whole idea for me was reflected; He said, "If you start thinking, you will be crazy". And my mind is also true to the audience as well. On the one hand, one might think, okay, I will watch this movie and it will not remove me, my screen should not feel sorry for people because they attacked my country and not on the contrary. . But as soon as sooner or later but inevitably starts sympathizing with a letter. Probably, when Lieutenant Collega's pushing her tears at the death penalty. <br /> <br /> "Stalinad" is very hard to see, all of these frostbitten feet, dirt, execution, snow, famine, weak illusion <br /> <br> As far as I know, Le. Hans von Witland is one of the few movies where Thomas Creschmann played his star role. I have seen a number of Hollywood movies where she gave the essential part of the little fries, such as "Next" or "Transshibarian" (why she did this?). And after seeing "Stalinadrade", I could not express my desire to attend American actors in American movies, even at a price even second rate. Actually deeply puzzle me I believe that Thomas Cresschmann is a better part of Hollywood and better screenplay capability. And from what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" is the best, out of doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the worst "Stalinadrade" frustrates, they speak Russian in Russian language. I am of course who are supposed to be Russian. Say, the boy spent some time with the German or the girls with whom they planned to escape. Was it really difficult to find actors capable of pronouncing some phrases without terrible pronunciation? Initially I listened to the native German-speaking people to see "Stalinadrade" because I'm studying languages. I did not expect anything extraordinary in the film. But it impressed me, when I was not going, I started crying. I know I've been late for 15 years to see it, but "Stalinad" is not a run of the mill film, and after 15 years it is still worth seeing and frustrated.
