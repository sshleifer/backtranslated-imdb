I have already seen great reviews of this picture, I got a few points for comment, because I thought there was something special about this movie ... <br /> <br /> The first and foremost, the film is realistic. It may not be realistic to an adult, who forgot what forgotten what the teenager did, but it is really such a superdrame that is always running at the thirteen years of age. Second, the good man does not get the women who respect the woman. That's exactly the same in real life! She is very nice for herself good. People are just selfish. Thirdly, a fertile person, a little confident, looked very nice to see. I mean, the role that already takes confidence from the actor, I'm not just talking about the character. Overall, I thought the film is a positive surprise, which secretly hides, in partial teen sex comedy rental duty. Do not make me wrong, it's not all sad, it's a good smile too.
