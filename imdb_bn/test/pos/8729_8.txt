I am surprised by this relatively low rating of film It is a sculble comedy and romance film that is collected by Billy Wilder as well as someone but it really works well and even won Oscars. <br /> <br /> It played a very difficult role in America's Ingrid Bergman debut in the 1950s and even if he is not a young bomb in his early films. This image proves that there is more than one talented talent beyond its beautiful appearance. <br /> <br /> Golf, who won the Oscar for his first film in supporting actress, is the Dentist Furtibi, leaving their love and their Walter Mathaw. Goldie is delighted for all the senses in this role, which sets her as a slam dank for her first career prize with a great cast. <br /> <br /> This picture is not really deep, but a gem that has stood a very good time. That's why I give it a hard 8 so the average mean is not so low.
