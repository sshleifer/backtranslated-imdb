This film is basically a very good production and a battle situation and those who engage in give its impression a good impression. It is always interesting to see the story from 'other' direction for change. This film focuses on a group of German soldiers, who were sent to Stalindraud, Russia after the war in North Africa, where a fight between WWII's most notorious and bloody battles. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to look at the other side of this battle, we mainly see the Germans as 'Villains' only. In this movie, 'Villen' gives a human face and voice, and as a result you realize that the only true enemy of war is the war itself and the ones you are fighting against are not necessarily. First of all, it is difficult to focus on the movie because you are always behind your mind that the Germans have a bad revolution. But of course you will get accustomed to it and soon you will adapt to Germany as the main character of the movie and you will start to care for them and be interested in them. <br /> <br /> The way this story is said is not good either. Sometimes the story is difficult to keep track of, because it moves from one sequence and position to another. The film is not always advisable in its story and it combines some other sequences that are very vague. It's a very difficult time to keep the letters completely separate and to see who. It does not always make this movie easy to watch, on the other hand, on the other hand, this film has a considerable number of sequences and moments that can make it worthwhile and attractive, not only the most coherent. In this context, Hollywood movies are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> There are more production costs and some good search set and location features, although the film was not shot even in Russia. It helps to create the atmosphere of situation during a good fight. <br /> <br /> The character is mostly interesting though a tad bit formula. But I do not know, for some reason the formulas character always fined the film of war and strengthened drama and realism. It helps that being played by well-played actors. Not all the best known actors around all actors (Thomas Kreschmann was still the most unknown unknown actor) but each of them fits their role well and his characters give a unique face and personality. <br /> <br /> Despite the genuine form of German side of the Stalingrad war and all its good production value, the best or most consistent WWII play is not around but there is clearly no perspective. <br /> <br /> 7/10
