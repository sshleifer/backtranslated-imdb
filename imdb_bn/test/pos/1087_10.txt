The truth was fantastic .... Perhaps the company was better but more smooth due to the money earned from the previous movie. Ab Ta shelf shake even more entertaining though. Dialogues are silk, crude and occasionally laughable. Nan Patkar again played a role that can only be done with the authorities, but the Assistant Cast is very gifted. Directions are tight and the stories develop at a satisfactory pace with a very dramatic climax. It can be more dramatic as an illustration of reality, but at the end of the day it is a film so balance is on the spot. I've ordered my dvd and can not wait to see it again at home. Such gangster is very pleased as Flickr's lover, and it is highly recommended for lovers of refreshing "Non-Raj Raj" Bollywood gangster Flickr.
