Curla Gigino literally melts the screen on the scale of this crime. Her sexual appeal, ample resources and sexy southern accent to make this film more rewatchable. But the film has a lot of "other" things for almost modern classical production. Simone Becker's performance for one thing. That's really a great actor. Til Schweiger is so completely cast, it makes me wonder why not be a huge "crossover" star. Gill rounds out these Motley crew and literally stole this show. Other Gugino's cleavage movies are easily the best performance. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so brilliant ... I can not even describe it. Great chemistry. <br /> <br /> The song is so strongly eclectic that it was a character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it is clearly unique and tricky its own right. Sebastian Gutierrez did a great job to handle this tightly woven film and made me look so much that it's me. The end is totally sinister and you do not see it coming. All that is a lovely film, to me, is a very good definition of what should be a good movie.
