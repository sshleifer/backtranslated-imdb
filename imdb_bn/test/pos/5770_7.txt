If people were really stupid this I could be SRW - the supreme ruler of the world. This is a little flickering water for a knotts playing a dimwitted beans counter to the city, easily driven by a group of a slightly brilliant Simplons, slightly brighter than it is. When things for crooks appear a bit shaky they pasy go for a frame up Figg. Knotts lots of smiles as his usual bumbling, stumbling law. I especially appreciate the extension cord view; This is the highest level estin.
