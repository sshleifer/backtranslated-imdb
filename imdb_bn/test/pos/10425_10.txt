Jeff did not know what film or version, but this whole film was just Piatia and it's not going to be awesome. The story was riveting, suspenseful and engaging. And for people complaining about historical accuracy, get real. Yes there were some black deputies martial in Indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest White outside the Indian territories. As a rule, they are used to warrant on criminals not only "crossing". I do not think there is any Indian friend. I know their number has decreased, but it still feels strange to me. Even after Karbie returned to his people, his Indian scars were disrespectful and unnamed.
