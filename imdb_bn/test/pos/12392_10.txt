Francois Troubet, "Kahier's de cinema" Young Zerac, the so-called so-called New Wave's main basement, has made a big display of hatred to the film and even accused the French film by dragging it into mediation. Translation: Trophic, who was sexually assaulted, Karen had already hesitated by giving the viewer's right-hand direction to pushing the right-hander buttons to the story, and in fact it involved something important with all the symptoms and temptations of sex. In other words, where the general public and many critics watched an experimental sociology analysis covered in a beautiful film, Trophaut saw "Girls Loose". <br /> <br /> Carney, above all, had everything that had diminished from the New Wave: intelligence, refinement, humor, a great talent such as storyteller, a great ear for dialogue, excellent technical brightness, the ability of which its performers To do that and to make a good level of good taste. In comparison, the trophy does not speak of a provincial bore. <br /> <br /> An updated version of "French paradigm", "Les Tricheus" unhappy is the story of the youth of Paris, who are known as "Pride and Prejudice" Respect for freedom and traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics considered Carna as the character of the "adult man" moral, although I think what happened, on the contrary, Karen has learned one or two things about homosexuality and suppression, has conned in her story the sympathy for young iconoclasts. In addition, as a French film, there is no misconception that the question of rebellion is basically sexual, something which is still decoded in American movies as "a rebellious one" and "wild animals". <br /> <br> Karen's young people are all beautiful, beautiful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. They are God and Goddess. They drive the latest Vespas and right cars. Cutting their suits, dresses and duffle-coats was a high point in the fashions of the last century. Their haircuts are still plastered to the wall of your local hairdresser. Maintaining their body shape, which they acquire and maintain, is still the modern western model. They hear the best jazz singers. How can they be moved, how to be sexy and how to love ?? Although the pill has not been discovered yet. How they talk about different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they define and live by group code and their heartless admonitions, which excludes sensitivity and sin romantic love. The only mistake with them is that their elders do not talk to them and on the contrary. These incidents in this film have received a number of tongues for a long time in France, which still lead to widespread public and critical success with the immaturity and stupidity of the youth. <br /> <br /> This picture is so stylish and beautiful, I have seen the old audience who watched it may be like those painted in the film, and aspiring filmmakers such as Trophouc, a number of young filmmakers developed a bad case of jaundice Which they sometimes can not make any movie as sexy. This is popular as though they finally look nihilistic bit to be very good. On the other hand, a specific clinical view of the script (outstanding misunderstandings facing an urgent emergency), the only terrible religious and holistic misses Americans can be forgotten from the same basic script, if they dare to deal with them. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Where Hollywood saw Rive Gaou and the nature aspects of existence, Karne Child's tragic and ironic dimension was restored.
