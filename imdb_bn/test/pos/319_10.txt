Always my favorite movie Coppola made it more compelling by seeing a faulty part of the work and the documentary 'Heart of Darkness'. 'গডফাদার' এবং 'গডফাদারি' তৈরির পর এই সময়ে কপোলা হলিউডের রাজা ছিলেন এবং 'রহস্যোদ্ঘাটন Now' এর মত একটি চলচ্চিত্র তৈরি করার সাহস করার সাহস করার জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় অহংাকেও উন্নত করেছিলেন। With great arrogance he took partial scripts in the Philippines and thought what he would do when he was there. Captain Willard thinks he'll know once what he will do in colonel compounds And like Willard, he did not know what he was going to do once. This is an excellent compilation of American cinema, beautiful photography and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. I like the most about 'apolitips now' but it does not offer any answer or decision. As a result, due to these openings, it displeases some viewers, who consider their movies to be more obvious. <br /> <br /> This movie denotes classification. Some feel that this is not a film of war, it's not really that, it's actually a personal study of people. The best picture about Vietnam is my opinion 'Platoon' and if a viewer seeks to recover Vietnam's war, then first of all go there for answers. <br /> <br /> Coppola should be praised for its battalion bureaucracy, which he effectively presented with General Karamen and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and Playmat Reviews. Kilogram's striking curiosity makes him an unforgettable character, and in the morning the attack always can be a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> This is a very cerealel cruise which is too over, which makes it a movie accessible to everyone. Seeing is very challenging but well rewarded. I could give my explanation to each scene but that would be completely stupid. The film explains opposition to instant gratification and stimulation is considered. A little footnote <br /> <br /> Evidently, you ayapoletipssera visitors for the first time, to see the first version, 'redox' version is, I think, for the more hardcore fan and the film is a "new and improved" version of the more than Interest
