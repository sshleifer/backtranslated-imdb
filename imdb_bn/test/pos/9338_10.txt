Without any doubt, all these music videos are big wax !!! Except for most music videos that are "dancing videos," poorly and / or poorly repetitive songs have done this work. Jackson was co-authored and proved most of the VH1's choreography and operated this excellent essay. In fact you could say that the thriller is the most horrific movie creepie with the last second superb eyes. You have to judge all other music videos with this music video to me. You can easily see the harmful effects of MJ Initial break-down dance with Zumbi March number. Because dance, comedy, story, and yes awful I give it 5 a 5.
