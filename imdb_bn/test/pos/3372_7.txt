The creator of Donny DÃ¡rco brings you a story of a fashionable evening in a wonderful fashion theme. The film focuses on centering the medieval young couple's central focus in 1976. One day a mysterious box is displayed with a red button. Later on that day a troubled man looked at them and told them that they could get 10 million dollars by pressing their button, but nobody knows they will die. This is a boring and provocative question that has been questionably identified on trailers and TV stains. But let's know that you do not know what you know until you see it. Occasionally motivated and some spontaneous film is effective due to good performance and playful content. It's not okay to waste a plot twists for you, but it only says that the movie will provide you the expected aspects and will not completely fill others completely by outline. There are many prominent symbols and theorems in the film which are both interesting and annoying because it was not clear on one of his greatest films Donny Darko. There is not much to say about the destruction of the film for you. It is meant to inspire a lot of cafe chic afterwards. However, I want to say that it has shot well and it has a suitable age-related look and it is a clock value. See it
