When I came out of TV, I remembered this movie. The film was released in the first week of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen this movie for more than 30 years, I still wonder how wonderful it was ... at the base, the body of a sister, outside storm storms, no electricity, and still with a killer is still in the strange room premises. <br /> <br /> They just do not make TV and movies like this. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very influential actress and I liked her as a "betweeded" rather than her post-driven role, such as this and "The Legend of Lizzie Borden" in 1975. <br /> One of the 1970's TVs that really will come out with a DVD is that one DVD week's movie. "When did Mitchell call", "Bad Ronald", "Dark Without Off the Dark", "Crowen Firm" etc., would not it be great to watch a DVD? I know that there is a market for DVDs for children who are growing up in the 1960s and 1970s. Maybe, if we're lucky, somebody will offer us a DVD with a great selection of tvv. Movies like this.
