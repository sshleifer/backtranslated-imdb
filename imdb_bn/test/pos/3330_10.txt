This animated brief is a remix of the previous shorts of Tex Avery for Fred Quibby at MGM (Tired of Dog Clone). An escaped criminal (here only known as Joe) who was separated from the 'Alka Feij Prison, tried to move one step ahead of the droppe (here known as Sgt.McPoodle of the mountains), but always managed to run on his way. Or else This is one of the easiest part of fun shorts from MGM Animation Studios. It suddenly leads to the smiles most of the responses, whenever he encounters MacPauld (with some equally brittle sound effects - such as horn, scream, elephants etc). Since any Avery Mmmm should be looking for a small, terrible, directional pacing (with some nice, over-sighting eyesight, Jack is trying to escape from Macpadle and is actually moving next to the movie). Pop it into your DVD player and smile yourself.
