Although I saw this movie in Korea, Korea, and so did not understand the language, the images are definitely enough. The story from what I can do is: Two great fighters became friends in the service of Raja Rakshi. One of them opposed the King Street and killed the important men. The other has to find him down. This movie is obviously great. Lordship is great, great. And the movie has a gripping end. I hope this movie will be sold for Western movie viewers. And of course, the DVD will be released.
