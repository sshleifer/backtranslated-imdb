Despite its title 'Traffic' is not really about drug. In the best traditions of Crusading in the British TV drama, 'Traffic' analyzes its subject matter and gives morality, which is not a mythological fault, but a matrix or process with identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and effects. The film is almost scientifically seen with four set of four letters from spectacularly different global and class backgrounds - a poppy producer is forced to underworld under poverty and simple government; English, the wife of a drug addict Baron in the Tribunal for the trafficking of a former Olympic swimmer; Two German police officers are threatening, who are determined to convince later, more than class anger, like the wrath of law. And the Cambridge Girl, a comedian whose daughter has become drug addicts, is a Turiyan junior minister. <br /> <br /> 'Traffic' is unacceptable from Jack Lathgo's initial scenes in Pakistan. Before further approval, investigating the government's success in the elimination of drugs. British help, we are bombarded with information about the problem. But this 'information' comes from different sources - splits the official representative; Left-wing lawyer in the interests of corrupt (ideological and domestic) interests; The poor peasants who need to become poppy for survival. <br /> <br /> Information, usually assuring the marker on a map, is not definitely enough - the more information we get, the situation seems less regulated. This jack, not the moral point of the film, that connects the spoken threads of the people, actually travels in the heart of the darkness of darkness, its lively hypocrisy (abuse of drug use, but refuses to give any serious meaning) to deal with problems through various free market initiatives and To create conditions, where drug-trafficking improves. The anti-heroes of Old Warner's Gangster films were actually American capitalist models, so that the Traffickers ideologically believe Thatcher and Rigan) can at least accept the reality of the problem. <br /> <br /> As I say, traffic is not really a matter of medicine. Finally, Jack was finally recognized, after being expelled from Tory's post, the drug is not really a problem. It was a society detached by a society that said there was no other thing (proved by Jacque's existential family life), which deprived the optimist and majority of the majority of happiness, whose numbers increased to the drug. <br /> <br /> The most horrible 'traffic' graphic, the flexible screenplay for the abuse of narcotics (technical details that are more often 'legitimate', reflective of the actual real-time presentation), but any joy, beauty, or community in the Dostopian Britain Scattered, unarmed tenens and atrocities, an inferior terrain of modernity, thatcher's runners and barrows Parastadera them for the loss of society. <br /> <br /> This is not just a contemporary British story - it records the collapse of restricted drug trafficking in the collapse of a empire created in business. It must be noted that other sites in Germany and Pakistan programs are important agents of empire decline. Here the old empire was coming home from house to house without being unknowingly, previously abused by slaves, abused their bodies by the power of their masters, returned to London's empire center, carried literally seeds on their body, and their fears were in the 19th century Gothic novels. <br /> <br /> 'Traffic' is one of the great achievements of British TV, and the latest Hollywood remix is ​​in many ways. The political focus is obviously intense - Jack's fall is far more effective than Wakefield, because he is also a part of the problem of government as well as a bad father, but America's only real political error is frustrating. In almost every case, characterization is difficult and more effective (comparison of Lindsey Duncan's Staley Helen, already covered by experience and failure, and its exact sponsor match). <br /> <br /> 'Traffic' (Made in Mexico dark and others) In contrast to suspicious ethnic underrunners, sculpture of a black man, sculpture of Pakistan's portrait has been richly saddled, with controversial reasoning with controversial reasoning, terrible violence Punctuated by the scene. Above all, the intrinsic links of public and private experts. Apparently, the film is notably innovative, never shining or 'cinematic' - especially in the last episode, where buildings and decorations seem to be visible to close the system. If 'traffic' feels like reshaping it, then shreds in the shackles, then the prevailing sense of waste and loss of the present is so damned, Jack's speech is bitterly frustrating.
