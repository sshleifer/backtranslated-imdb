Marigold is the best "outsiders" I have ever seen in Bollywood. (I did not grow up with Bollywood, but now I've seen hundreds of them.) I say it's also Garandar Chad, Mira Nair and even Merchant and Ivory (Bombay Tokyo) are almost dust. Director, Wild Carroll, really loves Bollywood, and gives confidence to let us know - there are humor, but there is no arch, ironic distance, or of course "I really do not understand this meaning". Jerry Lee Lewis will say, he got it, and so he can give it to us - a Bollywood movie experience, with the touch provided by reaching the role of Western story-storyteller <BR> <br /> This is a cultic, pounded, beautiful American B-movie actress (she has only played films with numbers in her titles, such as Fatal Attraction 3), who has seen herself in a different Bollywood movie, For having to stay in India (working sources 3 of his route when he was on the route, apparently because his producers are now in jail). Mega Mega Star of Bollywood Actor Salman Khan, the master of this delightful written-on-the-fly movie, "Now before or after this blind?", The sweetness of his gentle psychic genius, how he found his inner joyful dance power Teaches more than anything. <br /> <br /> The strongest generation gives you Bollywood - a very energetic group of dancers in front of the Taj Mahal (both funny people familiar to Western viewers, as well as the high-speed musical romance that we love in Hindi films) and from the beginning of Salman - a Bollywood 20 Waiting for the hero for a minute. She took an Indian costume in Kit Korson-style Western movie frying (all white). <br /> <br /> Ali Larter's actress character is delightful to Western viewers - she is blonde, "traditional" casting a "white" person in a Bollywood movie and casting eyes visually - but she is a powerful girl, not a miracle kind of blondy which we usually presented Is and is less or less than three-dimensional total bitch, humiliating and abusive a boyfriend in the US And cell phone conversations with the agent. <br /> <br /> We also have visual sight of women who are facing repeated problems to deal with them - people have no power. Relative conversations and traditional dialogues in Hindi films are common, but we rarely see any thing going on in the women (talk about mother and daughter between husband and mother in discussions between husband and mother), alone "unknown" - people are going back and forth So the spirit is the same, the details are fresh, and I was completely delighted by this. <br /> <br /> I have seen it once, in a preview, director, a good speaker and a question-answeree - he and Salman should be "good friends" for his creation, he loves India, he oozes in India Planned to create a movie wizard. I do not know much about the songs when I saw them, except I liked them all. They are limited to a happy parody of Bollywood on the movie-in-the-movie-of-movie-in-the-movie-movie Horns and the Seychelles-Cassade Bodises (this is a beach scene) - it's worth the price of tickets alone - a lovely reflection of the movie Many boring romantic songs in a sad and more serious part. <br /> <br /> Mix mixes of Hindi and English into the song, and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan has received a lot of credit from me for the expansion of the unusual projects - this and Jan-e-standard - and what is the proper judgment about it. Carroll said that he was full of counseling and ideas in all aspects and was fully favored or rejected by Carol (not brutally) - obviously only a pro who loves to involve and cooperate.
