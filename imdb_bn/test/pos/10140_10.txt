This movie reminds me of the live plays of the 1950s - not the recent "Falseaf", which is more like a stunt than anything else, but a true moral drama that is both compelling and thought-provoking. Arne Hech is not believable in relation to the relationship between his believer, Sam Shepard, and the army officer with Ari Stoltz, his lawyer is very nice to defend against the military organization. I look forward to starting their relationship, if they look so good together. This movie is apparently based on a true story, and it is a relief that has been asked to think about the real things for change. <br /> <br /> In the direction of Christopher Menaule, who has passionately played Anne Rand (with Stojes) and Prime Suspect Potion, it is a movie of panache and style and it is absolutely valuable.
