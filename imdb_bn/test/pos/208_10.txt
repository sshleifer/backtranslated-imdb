This is not the case if you are looking for a general war film, so do not bother all the testosterone-pumping killer-hungry battlefield notes. The film does not expect to see the Nazi, Canon, Blood, Gore etc., about Russian characters of WWII. This is not a film that fights for war or war. It is a film about ordinary people who take the fight and choose how they behave. <br /> <br /> Acting, Cinematography, Writing: Here are all 10s perfect. If you are a Russian like me, you must be grateful, but if you do not, you probably like it. If you are not Russian see the Russian version of RussianCo (Russian movie council). It got subtitles in 14 different languages, but I would say the dubbing in English is right. It's not as good as the Russian track (some elements have been lost in translation), but good as well as English subtitles. So check it out, especially if you are reading the movie in any way.
