Well, I would say, "The only movie related to Club / DJ / Electronic Music and RAWS ... which shows respect." <br /> <br /> Seriously now. This is a magnificent fun road, fast paced and fairly accurate screenplay. However, it is in a club, its Wales and some dates. The film excludes part of the Sketchycle of Club Life, but does not completely cut off from them. It presents an illustrated and serious illustration of the rise of characters. <br /> <br /> The main part of the film and the best material of the Justin Curling script is the character, the extraordinary, unique but fully understandable and accessible. This movie will not work smoothly and it will not be less entertaining for Zip, Coop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Visitors can refuse to use the political and social effects of human trafficking symptoms as a significant groove of the British youth culture in the 90s, but ... they can not deny that these letters are compelling. <Br /> <br /> It's cool, it's cruelly honest, sobering it, it's up, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves is a complex thing, so you will face the same drugs that are being taken in these phenomena. But whoever left the party, has become frustrated and is still leaving ... the greatest snapshot of human traffic that can be taken in Gulf way. Whatever you do, avoid all the antithesis that are good about mental traffic as "Groove".
