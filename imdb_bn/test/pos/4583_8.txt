I will sometimes find it to be the most bargain movie and it deserves a special award. OK, so it starts pretty good, logical, humorous, and then completely changed and uh f @ rt, @ ss, fok stupidity which makes total sense. The strange thing is that I made it very disappointing, even though I think it is considered funny, with very serious messages. Why did I smile after a little thought, the answer was quite clear ... I would like it if it is a lot more realistic. So it is too stupid, yet very intelligent if the object can reach people who are not 'happy' with complete neurons and synapses and electrolytes (Hu, electrolytes). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am now editing my comment (adding better), because I read some other comments. The first I saw some people watching racism in this movie. Well, I did not see the difference in my mind. However, if you look at that point of view, I can imagine, you can see something. We can certainly debate the link between intelligence and race, but I think it's not the place to do. I wonder if we want to rate the Hookettle family here, would you call them all black? I do not think so, but I can guess ... (Even from that, two wise people in the world, half of women, I do not seem to be totally caucasian, so what's the problem?) <br /> <br /> Secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings; Between 1 and 10 and everything in it, but there are many polarities, which means the movie works very well! It makes people excited, they want to talk about it and judge. This means that it's a good movie, you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes it became very predictive and annoying, but you keep watching this crazy shit. I keep in expectation that you do so. Or maybe our sick way to see horrific accidents. Well, this is one for sure.
