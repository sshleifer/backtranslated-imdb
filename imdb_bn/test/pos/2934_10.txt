"America's Next Top Model" Best Reality Show! I saw it 99.9 percent of the time saw it. I have kept the whole time open. (Well, I embraced it) It may be sad, funny, or addictive. (Mostly addictive) "America's Next Top Model" is asking me more and it's mostly the subject. This is another channel that is. Sometimes it is not MTV the other time it is. I hope it will be more fans and can be a hit series! It's great for all ages so it can enjoy all! :) <br /> <br /> Also, if you have seen the show before, have you noticed that every time the tire has a different hairstyle in the judge's room? She will have a brief and curly one week, and then long and straight next.
