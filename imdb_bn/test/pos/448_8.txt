Anatol Litvak directed the 1959 film, "The Journey," Dhull Brenner, Deborah Care, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson, and Jason Roberts. <br /> <br /> This movie took place during the Hungarian Revolt of 1956 and expressed concern over the problems of tourists who came out of Budapest due to political problems in the world. They were kept on their Vienna bus, but Major Surov (led by Brenner) Russians seized their passports and kept them interrogated for interrogation. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Roberts), who is an American gesture but actually a Hungarian Freedom Fighters, whose main faith is being smuggled from Hungary. Actually Lady Ashmore (Care) has hidden him. He has become the focus of Major's romantic attention. <br /> <br /> Very good movie that shows the cold war and quarrels, and all the performances are excellent. Brenner is an extraordinary major who is not particularly bad, especially nice, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic, powerful performance that does not want to be born in a realistic country as a pregnant woman. <br /> <br /> Good script, good director, good cast - there should be more such movies. Highly recommended.
