First of all - I'm not the one to go all sappy on movie. I saw the first release of friends at the age of 70 years. I was about 17 years old. Even at the age of 50, I still remember some scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be very tame for teenagers but I like it. The story was decided on innocentness, purity of young love and 2 young people for a better life for themselves, when they were at home. At that time, many young people were very risky to have a movie about Runway, who successfully set up the house and kept their children. I did not surprise the movie and Elton John's soundtrack is almost unknown today. The music is beautiful It was unforgettable.
