What are the movies I mean ... what is the movie made for? Shooting? Killing? No They are made for life stories and this is what this movie is about. It represents how life has changed between two ages. Dad and son, Father needs a job and the boy is asking for help. <br /> <br /> Although there are other generations, there are some features that the family has with Cress. <<br /> <br /> The main thing is, in my opinion, the love relationship with the father of the father. <br /> <br /> This movie is made up of only one conversation, but the dialog is more than I ever wanted. This movie is a pure art! Again, after "Marafa C Bani", Crisi Puyu provided us another beautiful movie. Savass!
