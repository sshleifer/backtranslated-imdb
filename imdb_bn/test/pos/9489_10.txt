Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard that this double DVD was coming out, I was excited to know. I'll just go back here and say that if you are a supplelin fan you must drive it out and buy it now! This is absolutely spectacular! This 'the song' goes out of the water in the same way. Why was this material released before me before. The footage presented here really shows JP at the top of their game, which I never felt that the 'song' did a lot. Jimmy Page is the best of all without any doubt, and these performances look like Jimmy Hendrix kiss! Search for 'White Summer' for live jams ... Wheel! <br /> <br /> <br /> 10 out
