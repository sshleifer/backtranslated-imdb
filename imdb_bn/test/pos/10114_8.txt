If you wish, please call the manipulation drop, but I fell for it. Of course, more characters may develop. Yes, cinematography and constant were less classic than the "film of the week", but Ed Harris was helpless, Cuba Gooding was adorable and sensitive and we face it in real life, how many of us really can get the motivation for others. not so more. We got a little glimpse into the coach's motivation (my opinion did not forget a very provocative dialogue, soon forgot), so in my opinion, it was a wonderful tribute to a man who broke from his "comfort zone" to other people, and the average time , Touching more than hundreds of lives. A lesson we all need to remind us of. Why is it so hard to do the right thing? I recommend this lovely little movie to anyone with the heart You will not be disappointed. And bring your clanx. 8/10
