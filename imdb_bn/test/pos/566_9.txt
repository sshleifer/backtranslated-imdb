In addition, we carry the same unfortunate weaknesses: false, cheating, laziness, the list is underway. <br /> <br /> However, as an American, I found that corruption and racism exist today. Police forces like Dual County Sheriff's Department's terrible intelligence and police killed a white female tourist and the 15-year-old accused black youth. I was ashamed and covered my head that the detectives were protected from their insulting work, when a young man's life was in lazy balance of justice. <br /> <br /> But there is a story of hope with our judicial system and how the poorly paid government defenders are stuck by their guns (for ironic purposes) and the truth from intelligence. I wanted to fly to Florida and tell the number of public defender groups in Dual County; Those lawyers care for "little" people and most importantly, justice. <br /> <br /> Another story relies on the line and about the family. The accused families and their strong Christian (no dedicated religion) believe and appreciate the wonderful family values. I hope they won their case against the Douglas County Sheriff Division. <br /> <br /> Bravo for trial !!! Bravo for a little man !!!
