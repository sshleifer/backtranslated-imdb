A delightful story about two isolation, has become a wonderful small film by the BBC. Most children who prefer a good story will enjoy this. Characters played really well by a very good cast. Our American friends are not sure whether it will realize it, but they have a mention as anti-Lou runs off with a fantastic American soldier.
