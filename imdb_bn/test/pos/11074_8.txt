This is a very realistic movie. I've seen urban youths the most realistic. The actor was great. I will look for more films by Gomes. I have never heard of the film until I mentioned it recently. I bought dvd I was impressed. I do not know in Philadelphia, I have not seen anything in life. This is really close - in fact, a scene where the accident (I will not loot and will not give details) reminds me of almost similar situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought that Gomez took the scene from that real life event, but then I realized that he made that film a few years ago in that situation. I agree with this fact that the film did not try to expand its appeal by fading into Hollywood. Gomez also guided the "Gravity Law" - I'm interested in seeing it.
