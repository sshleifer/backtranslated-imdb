Sarah Plain and Tul Winters, the best movie I've seen. The story I liked the most was Emily Osment, Casey. Only his strength and how he speaks his mind. For example, when Anna comes from town, Casey wants to answer, and he said, "Hello, what Anna said, the eldest father lost, but he laughed and he is not a good man!" I like Sarah Plain and tall movies for my ratings, I think Sarah Plane and Long # 3 Skylark was # 2. Winter was the last # 1! If I can live in a family from the past, it should be a witting family. I think there is so much good part in this movie that I can not name them all. I think they have chosen the best and perfect actors to act in these movies, so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past, then I would highly recommend Sir Plain and Tull Winter to end.
