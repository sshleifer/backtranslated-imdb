I promised that if I ever posted fewer commentary than complimentary, then I would feel different about it later, I came back and knew about the change in my heart. So far, it happened the first time. <br /> <br /> I'm really starting to enjoy the hack. Some have clearly changed. The story line seems to be much stronger. This plot may still be ridiculous, but the characters have developed so much depth that an extreme plot can be forgiven. This feature I played fine <br /> <br /> Not every ceremony can be charged from the gate that is not started. Need some time to take some speed. I'm glad that I'm watching this program, and I really hope it's lasting.
