Another good animation from Disney. Sequels always do that great and tend to follow the same plot as the original. However, the trump boy tries to bring any family and family out of the world and teaches him where he really is. For everyone being a junkyard dog, er dogs that overcomes, but scamp disasters. The voices of different characters are fantastic and Scott Walford, Alice Milano and Mikey Rooney have provided some good actors such as. Recreational and a well-made family movie.
