If we have not seen this movie recently broadcast by HBO in the future. If someone adds it to a video store, then grab it in front of someone else, because it doubts that it will never be republished again. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable and timely movie about the first attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 2013, and how government agencies are working, identifying terrorists and preventing and preventing harm and harm to American citizens. The American property completely fell on the job and was unwittingly let it happen. <br /> <br /> We all know that this terror film will not end till the end of the film. Our nightmare revived September 11, 2001 <br /> <br /> This picture was taken in 1992-9 3 by the wrong happenings which approved the first tragedy in WTC. Yet it took another eight years to be more vigilant against our first WTC attack and be prepared to counter the second and more devastating attacks of the World Trade Center. I see this movie more difficult by watching 9/11 attacks after the 9/11 incident. <br /> <br /> I can tell about this picture, it can not be seen alone. The very last itself is very strong and predictable that you know what we know today and to wake someone who is with you, but you will be released in this disgraceful situation to call you for treatment not to show the film.
