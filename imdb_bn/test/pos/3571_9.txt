'Bluff' has been shown in the film theater for a few months in Bogota, and today I finally got the round to see it. I did not really know what to expect, but was very surprised to wonder. This is the same sort of criminal comedy as Snatch, and it neatly manages to balance the content of doubt about comedy. The film genre was established early on with songs of happy music and Argentine, which produces acids directly on the camera - it is strange for the first time, but it fits naturally later on. <br /> <br /> My less-perfect Spanish Spanish, I still find it easy enough to follow the plot and conversation, and the comedy is quite situational. My Colombian girlfriend was making many hilarious scenes of different social and social class paintings in different areas, which passed me a bit, but for example, the well-liked screenplay of the miracle of an empowered person in any language. <<br /> <br /> I think it's a worldwide smell in the film's achievement: I often did not think that it was Colombia which I saw. It is important to note, however, that many rich Bogotanos live like some characters in this film, and in no way are Bogot√° or the wrong screenplay of the Colombian society, not just a * selective illustration - such as a movie is supposed to portray a 'real' situation / culture . <br /> <br /> I do not know how much the comedy will be lost in subtitles, but if it is confirmed to your country then check it out: It's a very sticky and enjoyable movie with great elements of black smile. And all in a tightly packed 90 minutes
