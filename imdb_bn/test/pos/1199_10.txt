Antivirus musical "hair" is my number one civil-movie How long have I seen this movie in the movie-theater and VHS, or how many times I've heard the CD with stunning soundtracks, and now, this best release has finally been released in Brazil's DVD. <<br /> <br /> The pacifist and tactical story is still amazing, freedom, friendship and freedom of choice, a generation of resistance against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of 70's and his dream, because the present world is probably worse than 70. I do not think I won the Oscars in 1972, but Trat Williams and John Savage were eligible for at least nomination for his extraordinary performance. Beverly D'Angelo spoiled a hypothetical High Class teenager role is extremely fantastic. I've seen the "hair" again and again, and my eyes are always wet when Burger Airplane walks on the song, "I'm that I am", and I started crying with his astronaut in the graveyard. I believe this is the most beautiful, sad and sensitive decision in the movie history. My wife, my daughter and my son also love this picture; So I can guarantee that "hair" is timeless and recommended for any audience. My vote ten <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "hair"
