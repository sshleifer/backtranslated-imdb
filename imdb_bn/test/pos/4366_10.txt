Yes, this movie was just sunny and the acting was top notch from the whole cast. Apart from Shelley Winners, the German pronunciation was not great, but then he was rarely in the film. So be careful if you're a fan of him! Lawrence Harvey and Julie Harris are two main stars in this film. Prior to this movie, I only want to see the Miss of the East of Eden with James Deen and the audio tapes of The Glass Mensjari on the stage with my brain Cliff and Jessica Tandy, so I'm not sure how to be this role and BOY, he told me Influenced. How was hammy I love ham ;-) Mr. Harvey, he's my fancy! I'm now full time Lawrence Harvey fan! That hair !!! * Caucus * OMG! It's almost like a boot lancet, that crazy dirty look, it's not even better. She is young and so innocent in this film. Now look at it! This is definitely my top ten! :) I am very happy that I have found a copy of all that is available to me! Unfortunately, this movie is very difficult to print out and find in the video. :( <br /> <br /> For BTU, hotel room view in the hospital !!!!! This is one of the best parts! Or when Harvey himself believes that he is sick and he is trying to get his knee, you know that How do the doctors work with a small rubber hammer ;-) Well, he cut himself and his leg and * sql * at the table. * Look at his face, so innocent !!!! I can not describe it, but everyone who is saying is very good and can not comment on other kakami, check out this movie and you will see that he was actually a great actor. You will be bowling! If not, I'm scared that I can not do anything for you, you are frustrated. ;-)
