Opera (Terror in the United States title opera) is a bit disappointing in Phenomena, Tenbar and Susparia, like Daryor's other films. (I still can not find Infro anywhere.) This is a movie that was very good at the first half, but through the middle path, some gradually started to expel the wind from the screen and logic. <br /> <br /> The plot is involved in a beautiful opera singer, who is being stalked by a fragile obsessed fan. This killer is starting to kill his close man in a most unique fashion. She binds her and taps the small sharp pins under her pants, so she tries to close her eyes and she will open her eyes. This assassin sees him in his surveillance when the murderer is usually known for his brutal and proud Argentine fashion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film was almost idle in the middle of the miracle. (This is especially directed towards the motive of the killer. I still have not yet found the reason for why he is such a nymph.) Finally, it comes out of the worst case, especially from the left field. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, or already it's some of Dior's best movies and camera work is exciting. Too bad it can not sustain it eventually. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 7
