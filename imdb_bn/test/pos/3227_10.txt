Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show all the time. They only preached the first 2 seasons in India but I have seen the rest in the DVD or read it online. It is very refreshing to find a show, where the heroine does not roam behind her mother but she has an open relationship with him. Chemistry is really great in Loren Graham and Alexis Blayle to play Lorelie and his daughter Rory. All acting is excellent and characters, although extremely quirky, still credible. All the amazing cities of big cities show the residents of the stars, which ends the life of the high school of Larry's parents, in contrast to the constant nervousness and social norms. There is a dance-athen and firelight festival on one hand, there are handcartions, dar meetings and cocktail parties. All the characters have a happy ending for many to develop and many or little ones. There are a lot of dramatic elements but very different humorous. Rare lovers are incredibly hot like their friend Lane. Basically this is a cool, fun, highly satisfying show that covers all aspects of life and gives you a feeling - if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you will get whatever you want, even if you do not want it.
