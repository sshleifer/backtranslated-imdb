A new and innovative show with a great cast at the edge of your seat. Lake Bell is extraordinary .. It is bad that his other show "Miss Match" was canceled. I'm glad I just came back to "Surface". I can not wait for return of "Surface". This show is something really unique to look at. With a free water world like Jurassic Park, this show will surprise you later on. Neem is very tragic, but he is some bigger and more insulting. There are a number of generic shows that only repeat the same old issues. When something like "Surface" comes to you, "Thank you!" Have to say.
