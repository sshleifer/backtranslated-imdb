In the second half of 2007, after a new sudden movement against the Burmese people's intense opposition, a powerful film restored most of its money. I felt a complex mix of feelings about people there, at the same time, something like condolences and condolences, together with anger, because I think that nobody, not the world, or even themselves, doing something that is effective is the shame. I think these feelings have become straight from the movie, and when they were created they created it, so this is a successful film. Seeking peace, searching for knowledge, respect for life sometimes leads to degeneration. In fact, Buddhist Burmese culture, which has open doors open to their dictators. But, how do you feel angry about these poor people?
