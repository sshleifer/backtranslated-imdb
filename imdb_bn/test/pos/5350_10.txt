In 1989, the award-man animated the Grand Day Out launched two heroes. In 1993, they made an evil penguin fight in the wrong trousers. And in 1995, they were recovered sheep from an evil robot dog in a closed shave. They came back in 2005 and they were going to fight something which was used to curse with intelligent and unwise. In this full feature film, Wallace and Groome work in Ant-Pesto, a pest-control business. A giant vegetable is going to be a competition, but rabbit neighbors keep eating vegies. Wallace and Groot take care of this problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will brainwash bunnies with his machine. After doing this, some suddenly eats all the vegies in the neighborhood and it's bigger. Save it Wallace and Groome. As a fan of these two characters, I was fascinated. It has 3 previous chapters and added many Hollywood actors for voice-over, they did not give jobs and boys names, they did a fantastic job. Wallace and Groom have not been changed. Wallace was still a cheese-loving Fakak, as he always was, and the dogs reading the gnomic silent newspaper. Also, the script was not too shabby like other family movies. Here there was a gem-rabbit really. From Nick Park's side (the director of 3 earlier chapters) really did a good job with the story. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula to it, he simply adopted the style of the previous chapters and added a dark fantasy twist to it. Good work, Nick. Rabbit is also fun and adorable, but the most fun rabbit in the movie is Wallace's mix. The letters were not bad and they were not boring, but they would never be the top of Wallace and Groot. Animation is really fantastic and wonderful. From the chicken run, I have seen so much of an amazingly-clay-animated film. Overall, fans of two knuckleheads (including teens) will love this fantastic movie. This is a well-earned movie that will get Oscar next year. Hurai, Wallace and Groot. 10/10
