"Joe" is one of those movies where you think it can go smoothly, end up hurting like you ... I can not come up with a parable. This is not only the concept of America's long-standing unity, but also shows different aspects of our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) Children of the final flower, her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) cleaner. One day, Bill accidentally killed Melissa's boyfriend. Immediately afterwards, Bill Joe Koran (Peter Boyle), a very right-wing, strictly racist work became known with a strong introduction. As a result, two of them may be more involved with the Hippies, which the bill considers irrelevant and Joe is sincerely hated. But in the end everything has been a fatal catastrophe. <br /> <br /> True, some parts of the movie are short-lived, but it is a good relationship with two American parties during the Vietnam War. And rest assured, all the remaining effects that would probably go left.
