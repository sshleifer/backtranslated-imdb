In less budget but memorable is the shock that will emerge as a bizarre theater. The weak nurse, Charlotte BL, comes to an isolated mental hospital and is unaware that only simple people have been killed, despite the red flag which is constantly raised around it. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget really gives style makers more style than the cast of dirty characters. The joy of this movie does not come from the shock of film, which is fairly humble, but comes from strange atmosphere. First of all, our mischievous girl thinks that her baby doll is real. A murderer murderer, a shell-magician, experienced veteran and old Miss Clahan, just like everyone's drunken old grandmother, Amok is gone. A young person named Alison gives new money to the term "pneumophomaniac". A big guy named Sam is a bit slow after a detailed lobotomy, and Jennifer vaults in catatonia and violent explosion suddenly. The only other sensitive person in the place seems to be Dr. Masters, but is he secret? <br /> <br /> A big example of low-budget exploitation films "The Look In the Basement". Many conspiracies are not going to work, but they work for the movie. A few cast members can be really with you for memorable performances, especially Betty Chandler and Anabella turning Winnick, and how the director adds a little weird story to the movie. <br /> <br /> Allison and "The Telephone Scene" is a classic, and especially delicious for all times, when he starts to go to the edge of the end of the film, then the expression of Dr. Master's face Browngrug also makes great use of soundtracks, many musical signals actually reveal the letters they are coming up with. My favorite queen "crazy" cue, when a patient works in a pathogen, a point is glowing. <br /> <br /> Charlotte also went into violence in climax itself, revealing patients only Dr. Masters is in another prison, and yet the carnival is also a patient who is allowed to perform his misdeeds (he must have made a firm determination on the reality, Why not ask the phone service's evil lack? Contact outside?). The scene where Charlotte manages to barely survive Dr. Steffens with a toy boat will be the greatest moment in the low budget horror. Yes, "do not look at the basement" may be "American beauty" of the grade J trash.
