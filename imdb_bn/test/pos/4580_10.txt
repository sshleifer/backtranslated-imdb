I stumbled upon this movie by accident. I mean, how can I find out? It has not been promoted by the studio at all, even I did not hear it being released from my friends being plugged in. After throwing my money in such a bad film this year, I hope I have seen it in the theater opposing the DVD. Mike judges master the delicious cute laughing disguise in a humble package. Just look for "King of the Hills" for a little while ... This is apparently red-colored humor, but at the same time it is very sympathetic, but it can be very fine in the Redains. I read the tagline for this picture, and I immediately stopped the internet. Without Carl's junior, I do not understand where this negative reviews are coming from. This movie is not only ridiculous, but it is also balanced. In our current superstar / corporate culture the levity between sunny eyesight and jabs is interspersed in moments. Of course, there are some crazy humor, but it is only there to laugh outwardly. The courtyard is only semi-wide, but since that even matter what? I do not see people blaming "Phuturama" because the compound is very similar. Just watch this movie. If you do not smile, then something is really wrong with you. Perhaps your dad works for Gatorade or something, and he was really offended by the movie. Maybe you're an ass Probably next.
