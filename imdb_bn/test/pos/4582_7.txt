Yes, I know that this movie is meant as a comedy! And humor is above! But in the future the theme about less intelligent people can not be carried so far! I can not say it, but if we do not take proper care of our education system, then it can be more likely! I noticed that some schools are not reading the information anymore! (Like history, geography, basic elements). More on learning the real power of focus! The theory behind most things can be boring but understanding how things work is understandable! This ridiculous example of the harvesting people with Gatorade in the film! Well, we can laugh at it! But if you have never been taught that you have enough minerals to grow plants in the water, how do you know! The idea of ​​this fear! So now understand why this is no more fun! It may be that the Mike Judge is making fun but at the same time, despite the rapid improvement of education, the people are warned about the real disaster! I take this movie very seriously! Yes of course Each of his own fun! I like the work of Mike Judge (Bewis and Bottled and Office Space)! At the same time he could be critical and funny! I missed this in "idiosity"! Most of the events are too irrational and I have already said very scary! I think if you're in the mood you will love this movie!
