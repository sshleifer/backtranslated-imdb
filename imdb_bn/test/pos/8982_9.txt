Best form Mike Nicholls I was not fond of "closure", so with this comedy set it is refreshing to see it again in the most dark conditions. Only a slip in the sound can break this compelling picture, but Nicolas and his very powerful A-list cast do not mistake a deeply defective but totally compelling congressman's biopsics. <br /> <br /> Philip Camur Hoffman is naturally surprising and bright - playing a damned but super-smart CIA manipulator here, and it's exchange between the characters of Hong Kong and Hoffman, where comedy accumulates. Very rarely comedy comedy and more smart ... It strikes the spot time with a satiric ironic edge that makes both of you smile and cry in the world of the world (often at the same time). <br /> <br /> Another major plus image length. This image is based on George Cheryl's fat book of the same title. The screenplay will be a temptation for Haroon Sorsin (his claim to claim "The West Wing"), but what we got is a 90-minute spectacular story with a deep impact. <br /> <br /> This movie is seen and it can be recognized to find an extraordinary balance in the light of the darkest dark subject and the touch of its striking malicious script - even if it spreads clear links with hearingings and Wilson provides and final results (9 / 11).
