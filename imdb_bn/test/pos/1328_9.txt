The ocean's twelve is probably better than the ocean's eleven. I know most people will disagree, but I actually liked it more. Three years later it was nice to see the gang returns. The cause behind the head is a little more inspired around. I saw why they stole from Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the last picture. This photo they have a little more motivation about the second time. More entertaining and cooler than the ocean's twelve ocean waters. A top of the top Grace says, "I just went to the new Dennis quad movie" and other things. I think twelve ocean is probably the best of the series. Plot: Twenty years after the ocean Terry Benedict (the man who hides in the last picture) has returned and said that the eleventh ocean money does not return the money back, he is calling the police. So Danny Ocean and gang goes to Europe, where Rusty meets her old copil girlfriend Isabelle. After he again met her, she started following them around. Also, the gang can learn that their enemies are thieves who are a little better than them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's cool, funnier, and more than eleven ocean's recreational ones.
