Without exception of the main character, the actress did not believe me strongly, but the story was pretty good: it is a love between a gay party boy and a young Mormon missionary. You can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and, for example, there are some metaphysical commitments to criticize religious intolerance. But some story lines are pleasing: one of the main characters asks his fellow coworker: "Do you believe in God?" And he replied: "You mean: other than Madonna?" After all, this film is not one of my best choices, but the script is really good and I really like it: it's standing against recreational and religious discrimination and intolerance. I think this is an important message of our time. Since I've rated the complex with 9 ratings, it's definitely 10 for me. Some people might find this exaggerated, but I think this movie is worth it.
