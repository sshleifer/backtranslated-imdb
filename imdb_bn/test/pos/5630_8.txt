I am a student where UW-Milwaukee is proud, where the part of the film is shot. Yes, I can recognize Mitchell Hall, where I took a film class, probably the same course as my fellow student Smith From here I learned about "American Movie". Our professor told us about it sometime before its release. To be sure, I was curious, but for some reason, I stopped watching it for several months (at least in Milwaukee it did a great job if it still plays). <br /> <br /> When I finally got almost to see it, I thought it was an entertaining documentary. This is not a great work-it's been a long time-but I found Mark's passion and inspirational commitment. I hope this movie will start something bigger and better than that. Perhaps his upcoming "North-West" will have to run the fate of him. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Released by 108 Minutes / Sony Pictures Classic
