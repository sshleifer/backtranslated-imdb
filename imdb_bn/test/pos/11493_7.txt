Joline (Heather Graham) Karl (Luke Liss Wilson) and after about five hundred days married, Karl is very depressed and lets him leave, hoping to 'clean the fog' in his life. Jolie confronted her marriage as an important promise at the end of her life and decided to look for Karl in Texas. He is supported by his brother J (Case Affleck), who met him at the Mexico border. There, Jolain met confused Karl and realized that she could not change her decision, J. J. Carmen (Patricia Velasque) started dating her and eventually 'life goes away'. This movie is very vague, having a very different story. I believe it is an independent manufacture. In some areas, this is a bit slow and annoying, but there are some movies that make this movie worthwhile. I liked it, and my vote was seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Rebellades at and Fame' ('Reach the end') <br /> <br /> <br />
