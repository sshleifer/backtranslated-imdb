I'm not sure why there is no article or poster or anything about this article because I saw it and thought it was great. I think this is not for everyone because it basically fulfills the Kafkaar "trial" "Beige and Butt-Head", which is a difficult combination of swallowing. Yet, I thought it was great. If you're going to see it because you want a seagull in the office space, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you want to see the most cruel, acid-sphinct, and ridiculously honest face under the leadership of our society, you are in for a behavior. I saw the opening night of Saturday 8th Saturday in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means this image will probably go away in the week. It's really shameful because, on one side, Idrischara is one of the best ways to come within a few days. But then again it's essentially about 99% of the filmmakers who are making fun of the movie, so I think the studio became scared and tried to dump it.
