Fully shot in Bulgaria, The Man with the Screaming Brain is a rich, ugly-American type and a ridiculous love story between a murderous hotel maid, Gypsy. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife, Jackie, have reached a business tour in Bulgaria and hold a cab held by the Hosteller Jager. The Theatories began to grow, when the maid killed Tatya, Jaeger and William, and on the head of the mad scientist William, a fragment of the Jaeger's brain was broken. Finally the robots are involved, such as the broken head, head injury, Bruce Campbell prunes surrounded the pink vespa with a little streamer and runs an all-off-me-style physical comedy with a character in the battle with the voice in the brain. <br /> <br /> < br <> <br /> <br /> <br This is the most ridiculous tracking shot I saw (when Bruce Campbell's character, from the lab to the fresh and monster forehead and blue hospital Law pajamas, complete with a place in the squares, and crowds of people scared) and falling down a full test screening audience suddenly light-hearted light-hearted murder scene. The whole thing is a deadly riot from the beginning to the end and I would recommend it to any fan of Body Comedy, Bruce Campbell, or B-movies.
