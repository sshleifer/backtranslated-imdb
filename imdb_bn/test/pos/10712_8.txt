Although it was a low budget movie and definitely last minute, it was difficult to identify a specific charm. I believe this script writer - Grant Morris (see Dead dogs), despite an infringing plot line, injected a fantastic piece of humor, weakly absent in today's box office hits. Definitely look for a Sunday afternoon laughfest. Speaking as a true single girl, and very doubtful this picture has inspired me especially, but the hope for a lovelife has shining a small flame. Not my lover, my little lunatic neighbor lover who lets her hamster sit in bed. He can find someone.
