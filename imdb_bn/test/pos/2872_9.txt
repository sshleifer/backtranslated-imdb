Finally a real horror movie. In those years my eyes had to cover my eyes for the first time. I'm a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it's pretty great. I'm a big wrestling fan but Ken really pulled off the whole monster thing. I must admit that I did not want to see this movie, my 17-year-old dragged me, but I was very happy. I was looking at my shoulders during and after filming. I'm fair enough to agree with others about the horror movie remake. I think why this movie is some good reviews. It changes a refreshing and takes you to Texas Chess (first), Michael Mayares and Jason. And no CGI shit.
