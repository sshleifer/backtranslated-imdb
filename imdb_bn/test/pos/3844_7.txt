Duchess and her three children are enjoying high life with the mistress of their devoted people, until the evil Batler Edgar, with a large heritage of his eyes, decides to grab them and find them in pictures. How can these brittle animals cope with strangers and parishes in Paris? Just rough rough diamond with romance in her heart, meets the obsolete lane cat O'Malley. After getting the taste of a hazardous world, he manages their home, and Edgar gets only sweet on the wrong side of the horse. As always, it's actually the heart of Disney Magic that sounds more than animation: Brilliant as Phil Harris O'Malley, Eva Gabr as Duchess ... Well ... Eva C abor; But perhaps the most memorable moments are Pat Batram and George Lindsey, who make old harmful Napoleon and Luffyte a few points of South-Fried Red Corners. Classic with their scenes with Edgar and the musical number of Scott Cats and his cool-friend band. The most striking about viewing the Aristocats is how deeply it has changed the style of Disney-style animation in the late 1970's. Probably nostalgic, the feeling of the date is simply a result of being annihilated at Bell Apoc Paris, but animations and much less insane (sometimes a relief) of overall speed than the recent efforts such as disappointing (a sorrow) and an image like Aladine.
