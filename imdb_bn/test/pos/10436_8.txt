When I was 12 years old I saw this movie. It was one of my favorites ... it's awesome soundtrack, so perfect in all the glory done with Chess conversations and it was both ridiculous and sad. The first film I really was right in the end ... I will not destroy it for you, but the boy is a tier ... I am very sorry for Gary! This is a bunch of cool characters in this movie !!! They are all very good, even the girl does not like to wear ... (though she had a pretty good body). I do not believe that all the girls go for a rick, a sledgeable ball that binds her napkins around her neck !!! Ha ha ha ... Seeing this movie, full sexual jokes will be made with sexually transmitted diseases (almost). But in real trouble, heartfelt stories, thinking about life from insecurity, changes decisions and feel genuine sadness for cast. I love this movie !!! If you want the Valley Girl All the other time classic you too!
