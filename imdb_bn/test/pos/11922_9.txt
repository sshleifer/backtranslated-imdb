It's a precious, though sometimes Chess, it's great to see a young Shan Astin, and it's finally being a entertaining and ridiculous action movie. I saw it many times when I was younger, and I still enjoy it when I pop the old VHS machine (I'll own a copy). So come back with this movie, the reality is to go for a short time, and you will get some good smiles and an enjoyable hour and a half.
