E. Ilias Marehiz's Begton is a novel by treating humanity of nature. Various things you can explain in different ways, but the plot is simple: a god drowns himself and stretches the earth from his body. Mother Earth then felates the dead body of God's corpse, and then impregnates herself with the residue of her seed. After that, he gave birth to a Messiah, who is a possible childhood, but probably brought to life on earth. These are all performed in the first 15-30 minutes, and then, the rest of the film involves dragging Messiyah (who regularly engages in quivering, or seizing) across a smooth landscape across the desert. The magical images only paused to push the Messiah cruelly, and then dragging around him. <br /> <br /> There are a few ways to explain this based on the light of your hope and your world view. The Christian "deity" comes into such a modern society, because only the total lack of direct power that calls their names for the progress of their selfish goals can easily be interpreted as an absolute non-selfishist atheist metaphor. Or you can explain it as a postmodern pro-Christian metaphor, where you can see how the world's message is so enclosed by humanity that its original purity and innocence can not be relevant to any other world, where the message and image are interpersonal violence, Namely to support everything from war, unanimousism Thabhabe is used. <br /> <br /> This movie scene is awesome, and you will not see anything like this. If you can, see the original VHS release, I recommend it. I'm not sure if the visuals are changed in the DVD, but I have seen these streaming clips in the tube and the effects have been severely reduced. In the VHS edition, Merge has achieved total Benarry Contrast. Money, shot is basically no mid-tone except some grains. Apart from that, this film gives rare opportunity to look pure white and pure black, and as a result it is stunning, halusinator and quite annoying. This film makes the film look silent and out of the mood positively. The shots disappear into each other, which it considers without a complete measurement of Chien Andalou, it is called a filmmaking rochech test. <br /> <br /> It is said that the film must certainly try the audience patience and commitment. There is no dialogue to start. The only word throughout the film is a fairly constant constant loop of chipping players, sometimes with the death of dead bodies and hunt with mortality and an ammodic droning synthesizer texture. Personally, I see that the film is also the best artistic music such as the Downward Spiral era, the instrumental NIN remixes, F * ck buttons, and more sound / experimental music like Audacity. It works quite well with apocalyptic black metal. Basically any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most wonderful and versatile aspects of this movie, it's a new beginning for renewal, while performing an ant-Guard music, it's like a project or a primer to compose an under-guard music for it to go. <br /> <br /> Once the birth of the Messiah's image, there is not much change for the rest of the picture, that is, you've been drunk and killed for at least 45 minutes or more for Messi's drug addiction around the desert. It looks very nice, but something really new is not revealed. It helps cement the purpose of filmmakers' communication purposes that have been using Christ's name and image for personal benefits for thousands of years, but a temporary audience may be annoying at some time. Basically, if you are looking for a modern horror movie, then see elsewhere. If you are looking for a unique movie experience and you are not particularly interested in mainstream Hollywood movies, then it might be your quivering messiah.
