The film marked the end of the "serious" Universal Monsters era (Abbott and Costello later met with monsters at "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentine"). This is a little unexpected, although Volume Man, Frankenstein's monster and Dakulla's funeral efforts to revive the classic "monster" of the "last" period. I said, in the previous film, "House Frankenstein," both the Vampires and the Wearwal legends say that they are both Darqula and Wolf Man (according to sunlight, wolf men by Dracula and a silver bullet). Yet they returned to the House of Dakula without any explanation. Frankenstein's giant plot would not have been running continuously in the House of Dakulla of the House of Frankenstein, and if the wolf did not heal, the film could have played as a prize of the House of Frankenstein. Then there will be a plot hole. But in this case, Dracula and Wolf Man's plots do not make sense. <br /> <br /> However, ignoring these plot holes, the House of Dakula is a classic atmospheric horror film that makes fun of seeing. It has many high points. Especially wolf people see to be cured. I know I just said that this should not have been included, but it was really good to see her cure after all this. And playing the "Monleite Senada" in Piano, the lady's scene suddenly started playing hunting when Dracula's spelling was very bad. Dr. Adlman's transformation "Dr. Jackil / M. Hyde" type character is also very well done. <br /> <br /> and Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man are happy to see together, one "last" time. <br /> <br /> *** *** ***
