Last week I hired Boogy Night and I could tell you that when I saw the movie I had a blast. If you think that when you see the movie you will get screamed by porn. I would like to say yes, if you do not have any obscene person who can not be disturbed by it, it's not a movie. But the matter is, the whole film is not really obscene. Well, half the film is about the art of indecent art but the development of the other half character and the bad situations through these characters. Actors play a perfect role there, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Raleigh, and William H. Messi The sex scene must certainly be horrific but focuses primarily on the promotion of the character of Polish films, until there is a struggle. Nice movie, the best one! <br /> <br /> Hadith's Outlook: 10/10 **** A +
