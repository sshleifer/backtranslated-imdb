This picture was awesome! I like the way to mix dark humor with the drama. There is a time when you feel there is no way to present the situation, and you still feel a wonderful quarrel. It's astonishingly, through the wonderful performance of Sijourini Weaver, Jeff Daniel and Emil Hirsh. It is written with a stylish, wonderful end. I do not want to say that everyone will love it as much as I like it, but it will give it a chance and it will pay. The DVD has a special feature, which has full length commentaries by Dan Harris and Emil Hirish and Sijurini Waver, which gives you interesting information about the movie. I hope my comments are helpful, and you enjoy movies!
