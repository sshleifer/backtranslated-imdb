When I was a kid, this movie was always broadcast on channel 40 in the summer on Friday night (this Fox network had been a few years ago and took the program). I always looked forward to it. I want to make a grocery shopping with my parents, then my Swansea's TV dinner and Lady Lee Colla (the only time of week I got a chance to drink cola and could have enjoyed it.) Sure, the script is like the 70 Little Darling), but it's a funny movie , And I like Rudy and Tripper. Bill Murray, along with little effort in the film, but he is charming. Sponges and glasses of glasses (retaliation of the nethers). He played the same character in Chris Mackex's "My Bodyguard" but he did it very well.
