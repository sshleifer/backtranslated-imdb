A very positive message for our youth is shown in this movie. As a medium of rugby play, high school rugby coaches carry their players' behavior and lifestyle, outside and out of the field. <br /> <br /> Performing and directing is good. Rugby shots are okay if you do not know some rugby or do not know much about it, but really cool. <br /> <br /> I am valuable to watch this movie, especially at a time when this game is getting more adepts every day. <br /> <br /> This plot is based on taking a true story in Utah. Coached by this film, the coaches have won the Highlanders for more than 30 years (and losing the game only every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
