"Body Holly Story" At the beginning of the famous airplane, at the beginning of the famous singer, Dunk Lubock, in the wake of the rise of Starodom in Texas, his tragic death occurred in the plane crash. Like Holi, Gary Busy runs her own instruments, the film is her pureest biopic. There are some things that seem to be a little hackneyed, considering the rock 'n' roll, Lubok's people are considered to be satan's music, but the performance of the skills exceeds any weakness. If we have only one thing to do something specific in this great world, it is that Body Holly's music will never be old. Whether it's "That Hole the Day", "Peggy Suu", or one of his other songs, they still have great words after all these years. He is the greatest singer in history. <br /> <br /> Just remembering her most famous son, Lubak did not name the street behind her 37 years of her death! What a bunch ingrates!
