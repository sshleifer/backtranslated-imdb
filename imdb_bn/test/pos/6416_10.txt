On the final day of 1999, most of Taiwan died. A strange Plague Island has been destroyed. Untreated, the disease sends its victims to psychological conditions where they work like pests. Finally, they died. Hole takes place in a growing apartment building (which is especially well built; set designer kudos!). His two heroes live each other up and down right. The woman is leaking horribly on the bottom floor, and the pipe above her apartment, not to mention her affection, threatened to destroy her food supply. He calls it a plumber to check out, and he eventually pokes a hole through the floor of the apartment apartment. Two have never seen before, and they come into contact through the hole. <br /> <br /> The script is quite bright. Together, some films together are fun, when complete human, deeply human conditions, especially feelings of loneliness and frustration. Tsai's direction is simply beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese executives, he used to spend a lot of time. But differently, say, How Hosio-Hussain does not use them anymore. Actually, I do not know if I've seen their good use. They are always effective and not tiring. <br /> <br /> Reviewing this image is wrong without mentioning musical numbers. Yes, Hole is a musical, and a great one, that is. In the film's best scenes - what's saying, considering how good all other scenes are - people think that a woman is a singer, almost a cabet singer These numbers are completely dancer, often with backup dancers and singers. A stroke of genius, these widely produced numbers of Tsai performs in a crumbling building, highlighting the signs of apocalypse and erosion. This provides a sense of both stone and absurdity. <br /> <br /> Hole is a picture that wants to show. If it is anything else, it ought to be a godly classical. Before I went to see this, I was told that it is a decent film, but perhaps at least Ming-Liang's at least good. Well, if it's true, then I can not wait! 10/10.
