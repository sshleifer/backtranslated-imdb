I found both the windscreen and the view, it is very difficult to compare the film with the original. Although I think skeletal, novel, superb, the movie was not added. It was a completely different story. Of course, Leigh and Gable would not have a scarlet and rhett other than, but new actors did a good job, consider. I liked the story of the story with the wind and the wind, because after reading it I felt the rise of despair because it just stopped and the readers were surprised by what happened. Scarlett completes the story very well, and Alexandre Replay makes the book a great one. I only follow this story more, though it is also very cool.
