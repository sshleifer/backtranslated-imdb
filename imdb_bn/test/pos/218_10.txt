I remember the first time in this comedy from Jumu's brothers and Jim Abraham, at Comedy Central early. In those days (90's), Beni Hill reunion in their program and complete with the original MST3k, bearded host. <br /> <br /> Captain. Frank Drebin (a rock face, dead-pan filipster, played by Leslie Nilsson) is a process created from the first prototype of a statutory police television show heroine (Dresnet Starceki and Hatch the Show shows) that is a well-known police television show plot and circumstances. It is dull, to produce the most pure police made every time. Forget about Simon Peg at Hotfuze (for now, save it later). Frank Drebin is mostly stupid, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, even sensitive and risky. He asked a master of the police investigation system (AKA - Johnny Lady Old Shoe-Shine Boy). This is not a bad police to him. The police get lucky Captain Drebin (here he is a captain) made it perfect. With his partner Nordberg and the rest of the forces, he portrays the police drama on 6 golden episodes. <br /> <br /> The show is a billionaire and quoted quote from the Sunny dialogue. Sight gags are quite date and stupid. Although the magic scene does not come from the eye, though. With crazy rails in its original background, there was a unconscious and direct face-to-face conversation and activities in the foreground. The best gags from this series can be described in the 90-minute compilation of the best films. Think about Monty Python and now something completely different ... <br /> <br /> If you like Biman 1 and 2, Necked songs 1,2,3, or Top Secrets, then you will definitely enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I like the series better than the movie, even though I saw the first movie. Why? 2 words: no and no.
