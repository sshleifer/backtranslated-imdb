Based on the volume of some of the writers, David Krupt and Jimmy Perry, the UK's Butlong Holiday Camp Campers followed this event during the same ceremony, "Hi-D-Hi!" Post-war Britain mentions 'Slapstick, Postcard Humor'. The city located on the fictional sea-of-the-city of the hypothetical-on-Sea, compiles the comedic running performances in Maplein's Holiday Camp - many of them together with mega-rich British coast, but never seen (on screen) Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the original exhibition began in the 1980s with the pilot episode and was going on until 1988, when the BBC thought it was very trickling for its early comedy division, in the 1-55 season season it looked at 1952 and the season 6-9 Spotlight 1960 - A time when old style British holiday camp starts to fall. In the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrader (played wildly) was late, the great Simon Caddle was the entertainment manager of the camp; A good meaning, however, a little former professor of former university leadership led his team of entertainment entertainment workers into the "real" world, free from his high school background. From his own laid-back personality After seaso to N6, Fairbrader was replaced by Clive Dampster (played by David Griffin, when Cadell released the show at the height of his popularity), the hero of a former RAF war who was like Cadell's character in the background in many ways, but much more <br /> <br /> However, the real stars of "hi-d-hi" in nine seasons are Ted Bowie Tabhabe played), stiriootaipikyala the working class, the drinks, Crude Humor - someone who could not resist the opportunity to kyamparadera cool! Gladys Pool (currently operated by Roth Drug, now BBC comedy, "Little Britain"), Main Yelochet (Entertainment workers were called due to their bright yellow jackets) and sports organizers - but more importantly, a person who does not have to go to Zafri Fairbrother and Clive Damper were embarrassed; Learning more about 'Show business' than Peggy Olenera (Sue Pollard), a little dodi, yet loving low-slate maid, who is a yellow coat and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Ted's innocent premiere. <Br> <br /> Naturally, with a crest and perry production, there was a bunch of wildly played muffis by cast actors involved in cast. Mr. Activated by Partridge (who left this event at the age of 70 by Leslie Dewey), the alcoholic children are haters-entertaining children; Fred Quillie (Felix Bonuses), who is a former champion jockey with a suspicious past; Yevon and Barry Stewart-Hargreaves (Diane Holland and Barry Howard), Snobbish Dancer champion who was on his carrier's evening in the former Belur; And Sylvia and Bati (Nikki Kelly and Riqui Howard), the two main girls, Yellowcock who always searched for the interesting Maple Maplein, never allow them to camps. <br /> <br /> "High-D-High" its casualties in the slopstick era in the late 50's, and some specific degrees, obscene "tongue-in-cheek" humor (jokes about the people sitting in toilets and with adults' The narrations about 'women' were ordered. But despite the "carrier on" fun, it was always innocent and became something of a proposed family to return to the 80's. Of course, critics of the show have commented that the show is welcome for several years, but I do not agree. Early seasons focused mainly on pain and slopstick humor, but the subsequent series of "hi-de-hi" looked more into script and the main characters (especially Spike Dickson and Gladys Pag) were able to grow with more sensitive stories. Line. That said, the show had some criticism. Clive Dempster was not a Jeffrey Fairbrother, and many were not as Jeffrey with former Gladys. (I personally think Gladys would have been more believable if Jeff married); The five seasons of the five seasons were more than just a few consecutive flaws (from 1959 and four to 1960), the disappearance of the old faces and the introduction of new characters were not properly explained, especially those that came with yellow quotes and went regularly and its character Gladys Pool, a free- Loving people-eaters, who suddenly became innocent innocent virgin There are also a number of notable mention that most of the holidays in 1959 were covered in the season, so the rest of the five series were extended beyond the rest of the year, something unbelievable. Still, the show is not meant to be looked at meticulously, and more than comedy's flaws <br /> <br /> On top of all, "hi-d-hi" is probably one of the BBC's golden comedies and even if it is " Remember that as a comedy, the family can enjoy the summer wine "," Hi D High ", not being able to compete with the mainstream of British broadcasters as" Ball flowers and horses "," Porridge "or even" Last ". If you are already testing it for yourself, then I request you to do this.
