This is my first Deepa Mehta movie. I have seen his Sinta character as Nita on TV in Hindi version of Nita. I also think that Radha has taken a metaphorical trial by firing this photo, not Nita / Sita. Yet what I liked about this picture, I did not have directions from May. Mehta. Small and tiny letters were developed better and seemed to be an impersonation at the end - something like the end of the Majuro's "single woman". They are brave women surrounded by brass men. And we see a cardboard man (Ashok) living in the last shot seems to be alive - his illegal mother is carrying the bet. She finally seems to take a future responsibility beyond secularism and secularism. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Mehta feels disrespectful as a director (though she considered to be very brighter than most mainstream films in India), because she can not use a microscopic joint family to present her script apart from using it. A glimpse of Chinese minor minorities in India's social milieu. He even sacrificed his mother and daughter (not even his father)! Yet his Radha resumed the Halcyon's day with both his parents in both the fields of mustard grass. Compare with Munlf Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishna of Murffar Ali and sinking through his Canadian - his capable Canadian manufacturing team and financial resources! Mehta's film may be anything on both floors of an Indian middle-class family, but middle-class home instability does not seem to be doing anything better than just living in a limited social place. Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali films have touched parallel themes in India, but there is no campaign surrounding this film and therefore it is not seen in the broad section of intelligent cinemas. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Das, today Ajmi Mr. Jafri and Mr. Khairband is trustworthy but not outstanding. Miss Azmi is a talented actress who has done outstanding performance of the good director (Mrinal Sen's "Khander", Gautam Ghosh's "Pa", "Ankur" in Benghal), notably missing in the film. Ms Das sparkled due to her acting ability instead of her screen appearance. Above all, the power of film is present in the frameplaces framework in terms of international film. I'm sure Mehta can maintain her talent in her future screenplay.
