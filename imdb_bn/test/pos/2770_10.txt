I hate absolutely not being sold this movie. Those who love this movie need to email their Disney and increase its demand. They will eventually sell it then. I know I want to buy a copy for everyone. Everything and everyone in this movie did a great job, and I did not understand why I kept this image in DVDs or VVs in rental stores. At least I can not see any copy. This is a bad movie and should be seen by all. New generation kids are not able to see it and I think they should. It should be returned to the channel at least. This movie does not deserve a cheap download. It deserves real things. I'm emailing them now. This movie has to be a DVD.
