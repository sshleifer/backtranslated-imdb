This movie is really a classic 80s movie! Must have an '80s' movie collection! Guns, bad guys, chris, gangs, charles bravan and more Chris !!!! <br /> <br /> According to me, this is the best death movie. Tons of non-stop action! Keep the movie "Bad guy vs. Good guy" in classic <br /> <br /> and classic 80 - nothing but guns and cripples about this movie! We see that Brinson threw bangs and creeps with heavy machine guns in the Korean War of 30 Korea. Sleep a heavy machine for sleeping! When Charlie runs out of a heavy machine gun, he goes back to his car and takes his weapon with a long range high caliber pistol! This pistol can turn off a freakin elephant and is putting the hole in the bad guys with Charlie Hub Cap size! And if that's not enough, Charlie is also packing a tank grenade launcher, which is as good as it is if it gets integrated together. <br /> <br /> This movie is being played "O O" great and the wall actor (mainly playing the cripple) appears across many movies! The film is loaded with memorable one liners and scenes! Hack, my favorite scene / line where Cripe leader confronts Brosnan in prison and calmly explains to him: "Tell me what you are going to do ... I'll kill a little old lady ... just for you! ... Six o'clock Take the news "<br /> <br /> What is this picture fierce? Yes yes However, you will smile and cringe all the way through !!!!
