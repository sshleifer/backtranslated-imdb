This is a nice, suspenseful, murder-mystery movie. Not only is the plot associated with mystery and conspiracy but you will see fantastic Ryan bathing for a few hours, do not love! Also, Sandra Bullock is good at this film - I was always a fan of him (I hope he is not scared of being a "lake house" which was terrible, but this is another story). There are obviously thousands of other killers / horror films, despite their similarities, there is no need for this movie to have at least some recent adjustments. However, this is a great movie for you, which actually enjoys the "horror" movie, it's a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie !!!
