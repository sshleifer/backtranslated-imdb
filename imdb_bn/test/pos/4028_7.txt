This is a remarkable reunion of the original by the same title in the movie. The film was cool, despite, I hate the new! Cast was all awesome. It's great throwing and a terrific plot !! The main conspiracy is that a man is poisonous and he should solve his own killings, be healthy? Dennis Kaid is the person who "DOA" (otherwise speaking of death). He found help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! Dennis took a few hours to poison him in the character. The movie is quite fast and full of action. You can see two big stars of Meg Ryan (Angeles City of Air Fire) and Daniel Stern (Home Alone, Very Bad Things, Bushheked), in support of the wonderful rebuilding role of this great, great movie!
