Hit is a light hearty comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances. Smith must remain invisible to protect his client and his job, who will be able to make a credible performance as a clue and tip date doctor. Smith was very nice, it was never too much volunteer. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> . This actor did an excellent job of developing the character, because he heard Smith's directive, but ultimately, he can not really help who might be. <br /> <br /> And finally its main message is this picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know his name, but he was very good. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun, light film that's definitely worth it.
