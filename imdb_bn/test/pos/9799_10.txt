This story is a wonderful story for two boys who can do whatever they can to get away from insulting drunk parents. "Ring Lord" star Elias Wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role. This film is just touching a single beer and I will not be as long as I live. That could make me sound like a silly, but I would say what. This is a wonderful why it is not heard as a classic American story.
