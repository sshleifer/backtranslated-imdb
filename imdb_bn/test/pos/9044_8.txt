This is a 1972 Disney movie For that time I was 11 years old and I absolutely enjoyed this movie. Nostalgic seems to be, I bought three series DVD Dixit Relay movies, and even at the age of 46, I still enjoyed them. It was all about imagination, magic, and fun fun. And it's still! I was not sure that three movies were first and second in the end. So now I have official dates. December 31, 1969 Computer Wash Tennis Shoes - You can not see him now on July 12, 1972 - The Stringest Man in the World on February 6, 1975. I still think the middle movie was the best. Special effects were amazing to our kids in 1972. I definitely recommend it to all ages.
