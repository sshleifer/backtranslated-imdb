I always thought Batman Return was a great series of Batman. The story was an interesting and wonderful act of Danny Davito, Christopher Walken and Michael Keaton. You can face Plus, Tim Burton was a genius and judged more and more the role of comic book than Joel Scrummacher. Plot: Oswald Cobblopt is also abandoned as The Penguin (played by Danny Davito) as his child is being distorted. He used Gotham's first born child as an excuse to make fun of a cruel plot to kidnap his gangsters (Red Triangle Gang) and the unexpected tycoon Max Shrek (the role of Christopher Walken). Then Max Shrete calls Gotham Mayor Penguin. Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushing out a window by Max Shreck and is revived by the cat. Later, he developed qualities like cats and tried to destroy the highest screw and batman. The reasons behind the destruction of dark knights are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a dark feeling in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton was always a pester for making appealing appeals to the distressed backgrounds. Michelle Keaton is still sharp as a batman. Danny Davito stole the show as Oswald Cobblopt / The Penguin. When you think about it, he made better legislator for film spun than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer sometimes gave Catwoman more personality than Hell Berry. Max Shrek is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. I love Batman Returns, the main reason is its fun. It's only creative but its fun. A lot of big budget movies are sorely lacking in these days. After deciding to turn on Tim Burton, Batman series goes to the dog. You do not trust me, see Batman forever and Batman and Robin. Thanks to God that Christopher Nolan returned to life with Batman in the series.
