Perhaps the film was made up enough after Karen's passport, perhaps feeling somewhat guilty about Richard Carpenter and how people close to Karen could contribute to their health problems. Years have passed (about 25 may be correct) It has been easy to deny any consent. Immediately after the death of Karen, Richard spent years after the recording with which he reproduced and reproduced the reconstruction. He married his cousin Marie and from what she reads, she seems to be planning next generation of carpenters with her children. He seems to have apologized for creating this movie and it may be unavailable for any form. I think a fairly poor assessment of the unfortunate short life and the incredible talent of Karen Carpenter.
