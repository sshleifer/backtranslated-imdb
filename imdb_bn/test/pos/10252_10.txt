The Kuolis High was actually a drama with comedy moments. It was a reflection of high school life within days. From 1976 to 1979, I attended High School in Washington DC, Sylhet, and what was in Coolie High is a thing every day in Coolidge. After the movie came, everyone called Coolidge "Coolie Hi" after all. Higher, shooting dies, chasing girls, basement parties, and fights, which lead to high school for many of the DC's. I can not forget Motown because Motown music started in 70 seconds long ago. The hit just kept coming. However, Cooley adds the level of humanity to high anger, because when everyone speaks and acts in Coolie High, my classmates and I love so much for each other. And there was life after high school like the characters of Quuli Hyai, but there was nothing to wake up every morning and there was nothing to see the entire day from home to seventh stage. Thirty years later we are ready to celebrate those good times. Cooley hi definitely gets better with a time piece that time because it is the only thing left from that day to remember, something good, and some bad.
