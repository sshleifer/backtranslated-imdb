It is the most part of KW's next years (mostly) "Doku-drama" (often) operated by actors (but the fourth quarter of the TV game itself!). It was made for the BBC 4 Arts channel, but I guess there will soon be syndication and DVD releases. KW is played by Immediately Excellent Michael Shane, here's a great success to repeat the role of his previous stage. Most supportive castes are also great, and a great touch is the entertainment of TV appearances with newcomers. But it is not light-proof - anyone who knows KW diaries and general unhappiness will already know how to curl in the next life - so do not expect styled buffuny 80-minute carats, as strongly emphasizes throughout the whole. . Recommended, but indeed it's tragi-comic,.
