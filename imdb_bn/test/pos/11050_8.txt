I'd like to read all the negative reviews for "Anna Christie". You know, the strength of the static camera, the output screenplay and the power of sound. But yesterday when I saw it I experienced it significantly and enjoyable. Yes, Clarence Brown's camera remains stable in most cases, and I'm sure the microphone was hidden in the light of the ship. Yes, there are many conversations and no spectacular action sequences. It is a primitive technical feature in technical terms. But ... then Garbo, Marie Dresler, George F. Marion and Charles Bakerford, everyone proves that the acting is unfinished. <br /> <br /> I believe "Anna Christie" is still Garbo's most symbolic acting. And it's a wonderful performance from Divine One, a role that is really quite unusual for him. Yes, we have groaned tired and almost beaten up, yet never behind the bag or whiskey shot behind his eyes. Garbo acted in the role of a lot (delightful) costume, seeing her play a contemporary woman is interesting to see. She is not weighed by heavy dresses or make-up. This performance seems pretty raw from Garbo. <br /> <br /> And O'Neill brought the former prostitute from the plot to the plot, Swedish, and tired her reunion with her boozy, emperor father. Twenty times she had enough trouble to get her for a girl, she was drunk, who told Marthy (Dresler) repeatedly. He has found comfort in one life of the sea life and thrilling a rough faucet, but hearty, fisherman (Charles Bakerford). But her past threatened to destroy her all. <br /> <br /> Charles Bakerford overlooks the long line of garboe (most of the inferior) leading men. He is an actor who can share the screen with him and can not get consumed by his magical presence. Pairs together have great chemistry and enjoy working with each other. Dresler can never be accused of repression, and again the Grand Dame relies on its old tricks, but he is not boring as a terrible and convincing, awful "dinner at eight" in his role. I've never been George F. Marion never heard before, but she was wonderful as the father of Garbo. <br /> <br /> This is pre-code, and rather intense and darker than the MGM criteria. I've really enjoyed it, and it may be creak in some places, it's still wonderful.
