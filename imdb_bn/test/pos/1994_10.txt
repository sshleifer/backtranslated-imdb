Many like David Craneberg, fellow David Lynch, an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes like reality, distortion, sex, madness and death, is forced to get the most extreme ration from the audience He proved this with movies as fly, nude lunch, crash and exiting (Capital X, Capital Z) and more recently Spider. Good to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Do not try to read too much about the plot, or it will be destroyed for you. I can tell you that Cronbirge takes you to the world of videogames that work as a metaphor for any kind of seductive behavior. Some people always dream outside of the fantastic living, but how far do you go to it before the reality becomes deceitful and the imagination ends and becomes a nightmare? These are extensively identifiable, identity, human mentality, physical bodies are affected by diseases and, most importantly, the fact itself has been searched. <br /> <br /> The stories and directions are excellent. Craneberg knows his business very well and successfully brings an artificial world involved in the achievement of life, to avoid common errors and reviews related to such stories. The film shows a somewhat disgusting element, but unusual low-key in the Gore section compared to other works of Kroneberg. Shock effects He is never above the drama and the progress of the plot is very intelligent and creative. This is sometimes not the most intellectual movie, but it will give you a wonderful, thoughtful and fantastic confusion about it. <br /> <br /> The acting also gets two thumbs up. Both titles, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, perfectly play their portions, and shine reflects the moods and contacts of their character. The conversation may sometimes appear to be somewhat tedious and clinical, but it is a part of the Krenburg effect that can create an unhappy and alien atmosphere that most of the time stops you from. Actors such as Ian Holom, Don McKellar and especially the unclear Willam Duffer lift the film with their boring familiar performance. <br /> <br /> Some of this is being used in the film, but if you can understand the dark tunes, then you will love blood-cardeling imagery and the story of survival in existence.
