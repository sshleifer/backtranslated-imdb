Disney has been inspired to be inspired by Little Mermaid, after the great animation of the Japanese animation master, Hayo Miyazaki by Pioneer Sea The Cliff a Sea, in 2001 and after the Howl's Moving Castle's huge work in 2014. His signature style animation animation fantasy realms and children's letters are again displayed. <br /> <br /> Photo son Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), discovered a 'goldfish' stuck in a glass jar when playing with steep bottom beach. She gives her mother, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above and above. Sosu loudly loudly loudly said, 'Find out the goldfish' but there is a little goldfish stuck. Then he tried to pull it out but it just could not come loose. Sosas then keep burning on the ground before breaking down a small rock, when it immediately breaks into pieces while enjoying a small cut on the finger. Then search for 'Sonfish' to see if he is still alive. As he observes it, 'Sonarfish' suddenly responded to his blood throating. Excited, Sosuke quickly rushes back home and kept a small bucket 'goldfish' that it hopes to survive. It did and he called it 'ponio' ​​(urea nara). <br /> <br /> The above scene will identify what will be for the rest of the movie. It's the interaction between the greens and the piano. And Hayo Miyazaki did a good job of filming. Before presenting this chemistry of communication between the two main characters, it should have a deep interest in how children behave, their observation and understanding. <br /> <br /> The affection between Sasuke and Ponio grew, Sisuk brought Pisco to school at Lisa's car at this time. When the father of Fujimoto (George Tokora), the father of Fujimoto (George Tokoro) brought the two apart after a short break, the best moment came when a magical maritime would deliberately recover the defective piano before entering the Magic Bubble. <br /> <br /> Once Fujimoto has been encouraged to contaminate the people in the sea and to deny people with hate to steal his life. But all the ponies want to be man and be with Sosuk, so that he escapes, the second time he escapes, his father creates a storm of tidal tide, emptying the magician Eliasi's valuable store in the sea, and occupies the small town in this process. <Br> <br /> What follows the fate of Sosuke and Piano in the flood-hit city? <br /> <br /> Have you ever been happy? Will true love win? You find out. <br /> <br /> Cliffe sees the art in Poyo by the sea, rendering a deviation in Miazaki's past works in rendering. It seems unfamiliar because the characters in the game are not normally colorful as well as the characters in every play of the scene like Spirit Away (2001) and Hawl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetic appeal is discounted from the color penciled seems to be drawn. Objects and letters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> It is extraordinary if it is written on the face value, but the story is written as well as it has been said, the possible explanation is that the Miyazaki viewers see the picture with the child's child, still allowing the adults to remember Japan when they were younger. This step can withstand potential moviegoers, see Miazaki's work new. The trailer did nothing to promote Ponyo as well. Miyazaki's case is far different than that of moving the case to Japan. But <br /> <br /> The whole part of the summary was not equal to its parts. In addition to the ability to cast Miazaki's fascinating and animated characters, the film lacks exciting and miraculous elements while measuring past works, which leads to a lack of big screen presence. <br /> <br /> Pano and Sosuke surprises have failed in a big way, but the warmth, kindness and love moments can not yet be made for the kids to recognize the film, but kids who were not all or once in a while.
