I saw this film in the first video form. Even on a television screen, the vistas were impressive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> as authentic as any film of Oregon road etc. can be. So it shows that achieving independence with the truth is absolutely unnecessary - something that today's filmmakers have to pay attention - the reality is enough. <br /> <br /> Natives based on the plot on the people's struggle against the plot element and the adversity. Subplots are few and easy. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere I've reviewed the Paramount rival's big trail, Fighting Carvance. In spite of having more sophisticated plots, despite the good actors, the caravanes lack lacking in the exciting scene. <br /> <br /> The Big Trill should be compulsory.
