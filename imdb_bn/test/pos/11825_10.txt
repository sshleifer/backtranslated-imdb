Treatment is an outstanding real-life drama that deals with a very sensitive issue. It's a story of deep and dear friendship between two sons, Eric and Dexter. Accepted from modern blood pressure. Thus, he and his mother (Anabella Cylora) were labeled as exempted by public and labeled in the name of dangerous company, mainly because of the general lack of knowledge of the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (known from Brad Renfro, 'Client' and 'Apt Pupil') and his mother entered the house beside him, he would have to work for fear of public humiliation and taking AIDS. However, Eric overcomes all of his fears and risks. At first he began to talk to Dexter, but eventually he embarked on the trip and joined the wicked boy (played by Joseph Majello of Jurassic Park) and his games. He quickly developed true friendship with Dexter, who was fine and weak due to his condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the movie ?? Which theme at the same time makes it widely authentic and tragic ?? Try to find out how Eric and Dexter complete healing. First they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves ??

This sequence is one of the most compelling parts of the movie, showing a very strong interaction between two actors, who manage to avoid strange and a little dialogue and performs a complete realistic act in its genuine sincerity and honesty. <br /> <br /> I will not do anything to outline the plot, because I do not want to give too much information. The ending is emotionally difficult and makes the audience so sad that seeing this movie will affect everyone personally. This aspect makes this movie so powerful, so outstanding and makes so believable. The emotional burden on each character is so real and so rattling that some of the strong members of the audience may also need some Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> A 10 is judging this movie and it is not a very high rating. Any film of my life which is not seen in my life, therefore manages such mental problems with so many intelligence and sensitivity. It's how the two boys enrich each other's life and teach them how to teach each other's life. In this way Dexter surpasses his isolation and depression and realizes the life of Eric. And both of them realize that the real friendship of gifts during the most difficult moments of life. <br /> <br /> This movie is tragic ?? But its message is merely inspiration.
