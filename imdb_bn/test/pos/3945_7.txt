<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The monk and his three disciples will bring peace to the world to get the holy tunes and after talking to the world, bring peace to the world. But an evil force intervened and kidnapped all the children in the city. The evil energy seeks the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. Before sending the monk to insecurity, the retainers fight in the dark energy (the monk thinks he can win easily by logic with the bad guys). The monk ends with a clandestine IPS set, that he plans to feed him ... bad guys arrive and the ODC is closed with many fierce. <br /> <br /> Which movie can start off the railroad off crazy? Do not make me wrong, I really liked this movie, but some scenes from the scene of the shot and plots and logic that has fallen just so easily, so much so that it took a middle step. The disciples' left ground fully recovered). This is one of the smallest movies I've seen a while, but it laughs me and laughing laughing. The film begins and you have no idea where things happen and then what is on the screen is interesting or fun and you go with it. The thing from the things we do is often beyond me. We know where from where we are full of strange Asides and strange references to God from the rib cage of some mythical animals till the ocean to the ocean from Heaven. This movie fills everywhere that helps keep it fun because you do not know when it will end (and "because the details are kept in the minimum) and it's funny." <br /> And it's very good, even if it is a good part of its CGI animation (which creates some great images, golden stuff, spider attack, gives the angels on the flight ...) and apart from its touch and action and comedy it's a wonderful love The story It's the story of an ugly imp and the end of the fall in love of a monk (and there are other complications). It is an interesting look and the true nature of love <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, away from enjoying every time we get to road accidents. The barrier you take yourself from the movie and how much you get melted from the other sources you make to realiz. <br /> <br /> There are many favorite moments since it is very valuable, just be ready for some breaks and you have a good time.
