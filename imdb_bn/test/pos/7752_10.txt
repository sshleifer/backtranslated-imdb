I fall in love and fall out of love, as much as you see, the more shows, only poor copies of some gems or resume of old sources. But once every time one of the real gems comes and its originality leaves you away. Haruhi is really one of those shows. Many anime series mainly translates to Monga and sometimes an animated show rather than a bad job and the animations do not use animations on static drawings. Haruhi is actually based on a series of light novels and a fire in the story of all cylinders, beautiful animations, great voice acting, great music and a complete and good story. You will not be disappointed by this, and I recommend to watch it on the broadcast so that it works better in this way.
