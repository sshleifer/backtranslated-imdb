Naming and oddly described, "One Dark Knight" Ur "McQueum", is one of the best early horror video-rentals. Original and quite raw, we briefly meet Adam West on Telcanens and teen-age headgear in this movie. In the blue satin jackets, a high school gang of "The Bone" of Hare Hoppers dares to spend Meg Tilly in the night crypt. This initiative has been hampered by a recently broadcasted organization called "Raimaar", a Massacre mental wizard. This amazing film with amazingly awesome make-up and fear influences painted film and provides a heart-crushing climax.
