This is one of the best teens movies, along with good stories, along with the music there are well along with the movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a classic and well-written script, it is an exception, rather than enjoying classic movies. Maybe the type of hair and the language should change a bit, in 80 I believe that the offensive language is rarely heard. <br /> <br />
