It is less obscure than the only Taseer movie that I saw ("Weave L'Amro"), but the ideas of others' emotions and accessibility concepts are clearly illustrated here, because Cassi has placed long shots after a long shot, usually with long, in Taipei Recommend a sense of isolation. Musical differences inspired by Grace Chang welcomed confusing but welcomed milestones, which adds a new dimension to the gradual increasing relationship between the young and the upper lip. This is not necessarily an easy movie to watch (even if it's not heavy in any way), so I want to warn any casual audience who is looking for some "indie" entertainment (such as tarantino or gai rici). But if you want to know about the separation between Taiwanese settlers and want to know more about city isolation and romantic wish, then watch this film immediately.
