A rich medical doctor related to the problem related to the opposite sex. Sir (Philipp Leroy), Maria (Digamar Lashander), a free-thinking liberal woman who kidnapped a woman, believes that men should be "specific" instead of men. Saeed went back to his royal estate, marriages Mariah's disgraceful series, threatened to condemn him and kill him. It seems that the desire of the sai, to master his body, mind and spirit, to make him his sex maid, obey his orders, follow every one of his desires and jokes. After the resistance, Maria slowly looks at her goal, but she has her own plans .. She says she wants to help Sauree leave her tragic behavior to women so that she can love and do not want to hurt her desires. It seems that Siyar has held her firmly, in some embarrassing situations (such as her toes, such as "creating love" for an explosive doll that is for herself entertainment, often while spending time and even when she has blood from her nose When it comes to face, surrounded by him), which almost breaks him, but something happens when the patient gets angry with Dr. Marija gradually May fall .. And it seems to be a great endeavor to end madness, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> Hand. Through a large deal of film, Saariya Maria fiercely obliges her to submit a series of psychoactive psychological games. Trying to escape failed because of his failure because his house is such a well-designed fort. It is a common European deco-type palace in the European industry, it is arranged by a person and arranged by the person who returned to his back for most spellings this weekend. (It features walls and doors open its commands, with an area quarantined closed for its "victim" ). But once, when she saw a pain in her hand, she pumped a bottle, the tables turned and she wanted her where she wanted it. He saw that he really wanted him and Maria used it in his favor, when Sa'i worked hard to hug and destroy him (.. and I could understand his frustration because his frustration was to make a man crazy I think the film works, in the end, crying for women, empowering them and holding those who are against rebellious men They always have that control, sexuality, and should be mentally control. The "wrapping" is the ideal final. I could not consume Sai's fate due to his strict cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen. We see how he develops his tonal athletic personality, and how this victim is part of the usual routine every weekend before the start of the game of true mind with his prey. If he fits very well and spends time building himself for the extraordinary activities that follow his time, how can he harm his future after finishing his contract with Maria? <br /> <br /> <br /> He later admitted that he was the first person kidnapped; In the past, call-girls paid for their services so that Sa'i may feel the power to dominate a woman, even if it is a fantastic character who is unable to connect to the opposite sex by a discriminatory person. To jump from a normal decision, the spontaneous decision to do that may cost more than he could ever know. <br /> <br /> All these psycho-sub-lessons are interesting to see revivals, but Dagmaar Lashander, such as a delicious sexual kitten, was the reason I enjoyed it .. Besides, I did not like it much because he Trying to earn is as important as the victim. Perhaps the brilliance of the film, dressed in delicious dance like lasander, dressed in gaz (!), Unveiled his breasts in Jazzy, and unveiled the dress. This is a sexual seductive moment that sweats your mouth and forehead. Digamer Lasandar certainly will be happy for fashion designers because she wears these clothes so well. This kind of coolness, sophistication and screen presence, with its beauty and seductive power, will make its carrier exceed the part of Digma's part to create a symbolic character ... even if the film is not well known (.. I have found it through sound words ). It does not deal with many different forms, dialogs quite illustrative and elaborative as it appeals to some crowd in the nature of stimulating the subject of script and risqu√© subject. Occasionally, I could not comment on Maya at Jail's prison, how he enjoyed the suffering of women, and forced him to thrive in an exciting slave enslavement. , It seems all rather hokey). But, Dagma is real to see it, and this film is about me, it works best like an idol film, the potential male imagination of this visible primary and correct idealist, holding and holding against his will, an uncertain situation, his fate is probably a Complicated and possibly dangerous masochist mercy. How to respond to her, and how she responds to her aggressive behavior (.. There is a time when she expresses her scary desire to embrace her, reveals possible attraction to herself, which can rush to look at it itself) This absorption feature is the most interesting Highlight. My other favorite scenes, as well as dancing, piano concert with Sierra's lover Maria, because she is playing a tragic tune.
