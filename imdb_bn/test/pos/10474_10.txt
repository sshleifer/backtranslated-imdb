A gentle story, with a redemptive message and glorious celebration, hinting at anger. Photography is surprisingly well executed. Cinematographers can not see such a movie to diminish their imagination, but only to improve one's story, but a camera vocabulary can enhance an emotion. Feeding the soul is defined by the definition, but with the grace of a elegance and delivery that does not only do more, at least with this degree of taste, restraint and mood. If you are careful about the development of stories and characters, it is a great film that can fill the impression of a character with a simple line and right distribution. These matches match a film score which is the lowest and perfectly fantastic character, and you will "get" this movie.
