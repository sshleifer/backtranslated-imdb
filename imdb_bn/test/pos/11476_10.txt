"Soto Nulla" is the # 1 box office of 2004 in the Portuguese film. This extremely low budget production (approximately USD $ 150,000) was opened in Christmas time against American blockbusters like National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander, but soon the Portuguese's Silence. In spite of the toughest competition, the small film has been working wonderfully on the top of all the other Portuguese movies in the first week of the first week. The film is a mystery / murder, which is directed by the laughably written and directed Fernando Fragata, which has become a strong reference to the strong number of European independent films. I like the movie Yes!
