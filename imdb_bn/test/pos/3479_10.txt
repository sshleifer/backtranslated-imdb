This picture was amazing, it was extremely fun and moving. Damian O'Donell and Jeffrey Kane have set up a great movie together that will appeal to all ages. James MacAye and Steven Robertson make the film bright. Their acting was wonderful, they had a sense of real life, which you really believed they were acting in the characters they played. Romola Garai is surprisingly fantastic and brilliant in its role. The story of these two physically challenged people and their caregiving is kept well and the film goes towards such characters, so you know and grow up, it was especially boring to the end. I would recommend this film to anyone who really loves the movie, and to the more sensitive audience, the alert will be ensured that you have tissue that you need. <br /> <br /> again amazing movie !!
