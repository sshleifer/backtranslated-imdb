So completely unique and entertaining! Another great Canadian invention A regular "Joe" (Dan) and a bunch of miffint deincinants (litigant puppets), all part of the house living in half-way home. Dan's work is to 'look at the society towards the society' of four and help them rehabilitate. Bill, Homesidal Dummy, Rocko Cigarette smoking dogs, Button, Nympho Teddy Bear, and Cuddles of Comfort Dolls. Find out all kinds of their five strange prophecies in themselves. In spite of their own suicide, and often despite excessive opposite sex trends, it is difficult to find lover on their behalf. <br /> <br /> I make this shot as easy as 10/10 because it is a Canadian mood that gives me great pride and good entertainment without the need of a great budget.
