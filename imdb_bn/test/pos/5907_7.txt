I saw Jimmy Stewart in all regular roles, but "St. Louis of Spirit" was considered his favorite. A poor box office actor, released today, mostly forgot this picture today. In 1927, while telling a well-known story about the famous London flight, Stuart seemed like a Miss-Cast for the first time, and his well-known voice would never forget who you were watching; It seems like George Baily again. But Stewart has clearly worked hard on the role and he has done everything, so much care is not taken at the age of 20 than that of Stewart's picture long ago. Stuart's Linberg is so unpopular America, the apple pie that you've caught in the story and you realize that Stewart Lindberg wanted to portray with all the odds, Yankee-knows how he can stay up. Linberg was a legendary hero in the United States and Stuart felt convinced to be visible. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks are used glossy, which is a truly straightforward revelation of the belief that the continuation of a continuous story is going on and I am spread through electrocuted films; Lindberg is trying to teach how to fly a hopeless pastor, only to be confronted with the priest, or to refuse to carry a professional Saint Christopher's medal for saving the weight of the Linnberg plane, after finding his hidden bag in his lunch bag, he will cross the Atlantic . For me, this is a film that is not unknown to people about unknown journey, but its perception that this life is much larger than we see and feel.
