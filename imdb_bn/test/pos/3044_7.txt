Although Pat Quarre's autobiographical book "The Water Is Wide" has proven to be something of the Southern "Down the Sea SeaCare", despite the anti-anti-teacher formula, "Conak" is really every little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (from unrecognized black kids on an island from South Carolina) actually learn to learn, and their collective wide eyes have solitary sweetness. A real clown actress (Tina Andrews, a wonderful performer) played "hard nuts", had to crack her whip, and once she fell around him, it all seems to be windy. But the story is not ready for a happy ending, and I was not ready for the last silence. It's nicely done. The script must be closed now and then, but director John Martin Ritt is always very smart to return to the strong presence of Joan Voight. The scenes do not add much to the scenes of loudspeakers, but the entire film is filled with episodes that spark emotions and their finishing ends their salaries. ** **** of 1/2
