I did not read the Richard Brooks novel "The Brick Foxhole", which I hope is not as remarkable as the title, but I realize that the original villain is not a homophobie, an anti-semit. (And to be honest, Sam Leven is written as a gay guy who brings a drunk soldier.) Well, you have to go with the flow. Consider in 1947. Even anti-semism was not even treated on the screen. Most of the people responsible for contemporary movies were Jewish but were active for several years against anti-Semitism because it was considered unpleasant. So we can not blame the creator of this image, because the hunter is not homosexual. Now it's really unpleasant - and Robert Ryan is out of it for many of the viewers to run away with him. We are not impartial in any way, but since 1947 we have been far ahead too. <br /> <br /> For the first time this is the first time I see in the slow motion of the first half of the film, two people shots, shadows, questions and answers passed between, uninspired editing. But due to the subject of the subject and some other things I could have stayed with him. <br /> <br /> One of the events that deliberately reveals me, so is Robert Ryan's performance. The guy does a fantastic job Sometimes he is thoughtful, happy with subordinates and can be helpful to the police - "I can help by any means, yes sir." Then, with one or another soldier, rude hatred comes up, which he says, but not by the way he looks. That scowl, that's scary scary, glittering those dark eyes. Wow, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It does not bother me, though I think the camcorder does not have to cover its face while talking about "Mix and Popstasts" to the Demotic. Still, taking the subject into consideration, it is one of the more frustrating moments of the film. Its effect is often due to the casual delivery of the message of Yang and its part is not being heard on the screen. <br /> <br /> Another feature that makes it almost surreal is the role of Paul Kelly and his relationship with the prostitute Gloria Grahame. Holy Guacamole, what partial conversation Kelly is given. "Do you know what I said to you, all I said is that they are all liars." His character clearly crosses the stone with crying. It is impossible to know what to do. He did not add much about the plot but the film would be much less without his presence. <br /> <br /> This is a moody, unclear movie. His people live in the dark And there are murder killings. Actually no one screams or screams. The men who have experienced this horrible experience and some of them are still carrying them with malaria, it seems only under the surface. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have an opportunity then please see.
