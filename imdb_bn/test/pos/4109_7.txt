Despite a great soundtrack, sadly, the box office failure was combined to achieve this huge achievement. I can not say it was recreational, not a cure for insomnia. Yet I enjoyed this movie - it escaped after one afternoon. A good look for those of us who are looking for the ideal life, although a fantasy. Hope to have some corny moments, a few thrills, and a occasional smile.
