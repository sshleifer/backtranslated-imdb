I like movies. I love Timothy Dalton and Joan Holey. There were various places in the film. I really like Anna Ann Hampton realized that he did not love Rite. And when Scarlett and Anne were together and Anne asked for forgiveness for Rith and Scarlett together, she told him that he would not worry about bringing him back. It was a great story to tell it. You just can not compare it to GWTW. It's just so much great view. I love both Scarlet and GWTW! Of course do not forget to have a hankie easy.
