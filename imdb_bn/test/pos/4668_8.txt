Especially after releasing the matrix !! * SPILILERS * <br /> <br /> After seeing all the funny fantasy of the Matrix, their robotic characters were refreshed to see an action movie with real people after meeting their power. I have taken care of these people, although some stunts appear to be a little bit, yet it has made me think of "this possible" verse, "what stupid video games" (like matrix) <br /> <br /> The movie brain It is not straightforward, it is very straight forward. Some things are predictable - as someone knows someone is going to be back stab and anyone is going to die soon. Quite obvious, but what's so? The first 15 minutes is our reason, our purpose, our original purpose. <br /> <br /> I do not have any make-out views of Thar√°n and Wallagh. I'm glad they did not go there. They keep it fun conversation, especially about seven grenades. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it is fun , Fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I guess it's a big thing) is that we're really rooting for bad guys. This group of progressives already have the wrong side of the law. There is not a good message for KDC - Parents, please explain it to them. <br /> <br />
