Like Richard Prior, Meson never received the right material. Whatever you know him is wrong. Get past the pronunciation and see her stand up. You'll be very surprised - he's one of the best stand-ups and I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from Jerry Seffield to Chris Rock - from Lonnie Bruce to Eddie Murphy - Jackie Mason is definitely there). She is known to be a comic comic. Even Howard Starman also said that he was one of the best 3 fun comedians of all time. <br /> <br /> Complaint that Mason is not a dangerfield, ridiculous. Dangerfield is known for having a huge Mason fan. Dangerfield's career was not going anywhere for a long time until Mason's follow up. Messner provided Dangerfield with inspiration for him, "no respect" routine. Although I think Dangerfield is great, stand-up both, and you'll see Meson is a good comedian.
