One of the longest and weird little movies in Storkix is ​​to find a orange, followed by a toy dog ​​after searching for an orange after being tired of her head tears. An orange comes after the back of the back of the car on the sale of dogs, but in the night he can save the orange after entering the weird nightclub. With the help of a staff cat, the little girl of the dog gets orange back and he is saved from a horrible scurvy death. There are new tricks in Mascot that I have not seen yet in the movie of Sterevich. Combination of live action with adding sync sound and stop-motion animation creates a new package in the old style of styuich's old style. Walking as a moving vehicle and human footing scenes Scenes of scenes sitting on the concrete path are impressive and fresh. The idea of ​​small studio sounds expensive and the reason for the attention of street vendors on the shoulders is significant and the use of new technology sterruiz seems to be an old cap. The new doll character in this movie has a terrific contribution to Satan's club scene. Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. The skilton of dead birds gives egg fork for eggs. Characters come flying from all over Pat and pan and rocking horses. A new edit strategy uses quick zooms which are edited by editing at a speed at the speed of visible speed. Above all, Streivich is able to update the film's style of production to meet the demands of new audiences in one of the best examples of her work in this movie.
