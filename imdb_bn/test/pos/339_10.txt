How wonderful this movie was! The plot is remarkable, and the performances are spectacular. At first I thought that it could not be a great reason for the essence, but after the first five or ten minutes of the movie it made me seriously wrong. I cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, in a week I saw almost the same scene! No, the music scenes were not so great as they could, but the plot really gets you. American or Come, I'll recommend someone to this - and now I have. After I see this one Guarantee, you will find it the best, and its plot. I hope you will feel the same way, and write a Reveal Review!
