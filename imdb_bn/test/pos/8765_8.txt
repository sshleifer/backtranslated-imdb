Sabotu's 1942 film, partly aimed to achieve American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Promotion or not, it's great entertainment Director Alfred Hittak wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanby in their roles, although the directors were Robert Simmons and Priscilla Lane, who gave more importance to the film. It has a good film with Robert Simmons and Priscilla Lane, which brings them to their own style characters. Like other hitcoc movies, we ignore the director for socially voluntary and well-being. He often portrayed the spy and the foreign agent as an excellent high-class person, who at the same time proved to be a criminal until the democratic values ​​were proved and innocent. These upper crust traitors are chasing the police last or even suspect. Hitako had the disbelief of police life. He wanted to ambitious people, Bangabandhu and colleagues who did not take himself very seriously. Seeing him as an icon in Frank Caprice mold, Gary Cooper. Nevertheless, Bob Cummings puts his own stamps on the post-door door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, Spanish female lead, who comes off as all American girl who can handle herself nicely during the exam. Robert Kamings, the defense plant worker Barry Kane killed his best friend for a bomb attack. It runs on a cross-country Chase scene, memorable to other hitcoak heroes. Hitscock repeats some well-established sources of previous films - women unwilling to drag into action, eg Madeleine Carroll in 39 steps, and risking her life to keep her heels in danger. We have seen America's scenes because Cain has been trying to find the real culprit of the bomb attack. We can see the rivers, bridges, the rear cabin, the trucker, the Hoover Dam and finally New York City. An appropriate backdrop for New York Climax, which we go from Rockefeller Center to Oceanline (with a cut in the ship Normand) and to the Grand Finale at the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with endless action. Do not miss it.
