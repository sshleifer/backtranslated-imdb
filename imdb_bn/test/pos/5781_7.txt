I saw many films in the Art Museum at my university this year I was most lucky. Occasionally, for half a time, I was unable to see the movie there. I tried to see the movies I missed. Platinum and plazers in Salton Sea, and whose car killed the car? There are other films that I have seen in this way. The film has added a curiosity and it is well-prescriptive (later emphasis) but not as successful as plugins and plazers, but much more than electric cars. <br /> <br /> The film's thesis concerns the future of American concepts of colonial living. With the rise in oil prices, the probability of such habit is questioned. So, the film discussed the emergence of the suburbs, and it was evolutionary in the early 2000s. The theme of the movie-length discussion creates fasting among its residents. While most people can live together, we define the word "do not know" each other. It represents the power of the film, to me: It appeals to real human emotions. We understand the reason for film makers so easily because their reasoning is not to accept our legitimacy. This is one of the reasons why Salton Sea is an excellent documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sabberia lost its message in the interpretation of Firebanks in support of its central argument. Their arguments, which speak in interviews, are increasingly more similar to those created by militant environmentalists. We have been told that oil production will be top of the decade, but no scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) is supported in support of this claim. A little bit of information was given to us about how this date was calculated. Thankfully, this was the only significant error that I was able to identify in the film's arguments, yet it's a surprising one. I noticed another less important discrimination was a liberal (political) bias that could kill some viewers. However, this bias reveals a complete clip of various events and not the filmmakers. Especially in the 1950s the clips were unnecessary to me. The film was not good with their presence, and their absence was more concise. Before writing this review, I thought more about the film, why I found why its logic is more convincing than the other recent documentary films I have seen recently. Finally, I realized that filmmakers actually analyze sub-problem problems. They propose a decentralized village where people's pockets live together. They will reduce the requirements for this practice fossil fuel and reduce waste space. For example, they determine the waste space as the parking lot in the shopping area stretches long. What is incredible about this dream is actually worth it. Most documentaries vaguely say that some problems should end but there is no way to do so. While thinking more about the film, I decided how the analysis saved the film for me and why I can give it a favorable review. <br /> <br /> Despite being completely unreliable in the presentation, Sabberia's last one is a perfect investment for a time. This is not just a contemporary problem in Revelation, but it provides realistic insight on how it can be corrected. The audience can enjoy high production value with different clips of 1950 spliced ​​with modern arguers. People living in Atlanta, Georgia, or the North Carolina region will especially enjoy this documentary, because Sprite is the most established.
