I finally hold the Life Force on DVD in the Widescreen screen, and Henry Mancini has lost the highest score. After watching tapes for fifteen years on the life force, I was told that the 'uncut' DVD version was both great and frustrating. The US version is * much more than the DVD (European?) Version. The American version of living is moving faster (editing in DVD editions is terrible, looks like an incomplete cut). And not seen in the American version many scenes add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, a "new" moment almost destroys the whole film, when Kainand (Peter Firth) catches the male's alien in the cathedral. I love this scene, though in the US version. In DVD, male aliens speak to Kain and what she says is very colorful. It's at the top of the Hillary: <br /> <br /> "If you come to me it will be very frightening!" Male Alien said, the 1950s style voice. When I saw this I was floating. It just does not belong to the movie. That scene is a pure camp in an otherwise super-serious flurry. Whenever I'm happy, Hooper (or anyone) would spend that scene when America was released in North America. There has been a lot of change in the US version that makes Lifeforce better, and I have a DVD of the U.S. Wanted the version. The edit should not be intense and annoying and some of the spots that are already in the U.S. The version was annoying because of the visual divisions, the DVD version is more annoying. And the credit opening on DVD is terrible. Very good in the US version. More fine <br /> <br /> I love this picture. It originally created a pit stop on the alien earth and sucking as much life force as possible The film has a lot of flat, vague sequences (talk, talk, talk) but when it goes to work in London, it's fun. The film really shines in this scene. Hooper could see someone doing what he is doing: chaos, brutality, horror! This chaotic view of Lifeforce was more. The best apocalyptic scenes they ever put in the picture. It's sometimes the best junky movie. Zombies hungry (for life, not meat) and they are crazed and shiny and terrific. Other zombie movies do slow moving bores. Also, many people have criticized the end but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, such as one of the worst of lifestyle. <br /> <br /> And when this movie is beautiful and it's time to pick up at 80, people will not be able to do it. Or cocoon or other sweet and annoying, well-think sci-fi movies. There is no doubt that it was a bomb attack because it was ahead of its super enihilistic point view! <br /> <br /> As well as the DVD, it's not cool. The image is crazy and grain and there is no extra. But the film is looking forward to its widescreen format. I hope they will release a clean, crisp US version in a DVD and by Hooper and DiCrussor's commentary.
