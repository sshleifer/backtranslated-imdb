A very insightful mental thriller! A stylish example of producing powerful Italian films of Footprint 70. And Luigi Bazoni, an erroneously underhand director and apparently amazing 'Outerau'. The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspicious environment and is not particularly disappointed with the tragic and dramatic ending! Florida provides a remarkable performance, flexibility and touch sensitivity, which is able to illustrate the dark lady, which is not only interesting, but rather real and sadly lonely fornication alone. But all cast a treatment! The role of Lila Kedrova, Nichletta Elme (the mysterious sea beach), Italian screen legend Katrina Boratto, and the beautifully beautiful B-movie Queen Evelyn Stewart play short but hunting role! And Claus Kinsky is a surprisingly annoying show! Curious what it would be incredibly good to think incredibly good movies like footprints! Vittorio Storer's Moody and Blurred Cinematography, Stylized Position and Set, Hunting Score of Nicola Paivani and the first of all stories, so intense and boring, so intelligent and structured! A thriller with fantastic elements, but especially with a soul and a personal vision. I will not forget movie like footprint! I wanted more insightful and personalized today than the movie was 60 more / 70's back! And yes .. I wish that soon someone will take this digital remaster widescreen DVD out of this little masterpiece!
