Among the top 24 lesbian films in my library, I must rate it as the number one movie. This movie will be considered as the best in history. This is the story of a girl (Rachel Sterling), which gets richer from riches and richer than cheetah, with her first love (Kili Haos) in her life and going outside. It is set against a Victorian background in the 1890s, which makes it an ideal setting for one of the industry's best entertainment. This film did not bear any cost for music and clothing, and was made to make make-up Rachel and Kylie when only the films were added to the diversity of the films. <br /> <br /> You are not interested in what kind of movie. This film guarantees you not only be surprised but will watch you through three episodes. This picture will be played and enjoyed for decades. Animated DVD collector version is required for any library. Rachel Sterling and Kylie Haus were the best choice of casting on these two lands and they played very well.
