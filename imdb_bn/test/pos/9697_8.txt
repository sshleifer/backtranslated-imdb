This movie was Hilarius! It sometimes went too far, but what do we expect from them? Theater roared with sunny and ooooooed at all incredibly crazy stunts. It's rude, crude, and sometimes horribly intense. The whole gang is back and even more from their minds, which in turn provides for some great entertainment. I do not want to give anything, but there is nothing compared to the little snippets of clips that go around the net. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to meet with friends. Try to see it with a big crowd. You do not have to be frustrated. Do not just go with anyone (see above) that does not take it. It does not go well, you can be sure that. But that's quite obvious at first place. If you enjoy the first one, then you loooooove it
