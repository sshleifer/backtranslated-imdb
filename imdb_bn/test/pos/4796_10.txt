I love Bunuwel's supernatural movies (such as "The Bourgeoisie's Cute Skin" and "The Eightinnating Angle") and the absurdity of the foolish fools. Other, providing more serious and a strong social message about past actions (such as "Forgotten", from children in restricted areas in Mexico) to criminals. <br /> <br /> I believe it is "Nazneen" which is most successful shoot for the heart of viewers. Although it is true that it is intense with satirism, it also reveals a section of Buentel that seems to be stimulated by the beauty and glory of spiritual pursuit. Here, although the director (in most cases) throws numerous jabs in the Catholic Church, he also surprisingly showed that the practice of true Christian thought and praise of selfless love. <br /> <br /> ?? Luis Buunuel unabashedly praised images like a Jesus ?? "I always think of him as a complete cynical artist without a trace of human virtue ... that until I am" Nazarin. "My gratitude is that he expressed difficulty in following the example of Christ in society associated with adultery, ignorance and sin. But he presented the hero, Father Nazarioo as a light flame in the middle of the dark sea. At the end of the day I was not looking at him! <br /> <br /> Some would argue that Father Nazario's doubts about his faith point to the loss of his child's values. (Alas, if he can not do good on this earth, who can ?) But I would say that this "error", his frustration, precisely makes his character more heroic, because it shows how he and his challenging people struggled And who says that the priest could not finally get up from that "dark night" and could get his confidence back? Perhaps we have just been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey. The elegant, open end (in which he is extremely curious A woman gets the results given by a stranger) let us imagine the final outcome of the story. <br /> <br /> I can recognize Benuelle's aggressive, self-proclaimed atheist, raised with brilliant intellect and social consciousness; But after seeing "Nazrarian", I feel some warmth, depth and maturity from him, which is not so obvious on his other work. Unlike <br /> <br />, I firmly recommend it to watch the short film "Simon of the Desert" (several years later in Mexico). It discusses similar topics - abandoning ego in the face of temptation - it does this in a strange and completely irrational style.
