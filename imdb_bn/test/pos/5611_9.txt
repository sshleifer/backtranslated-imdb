The world was ending at midnight on December 31, 2012. The book of life, writer / director Hell Hartley, looks at the possible probability of a new millennium. Armegaden, starting with Jesus' return on New Year's Eve? 99 The story examines the work of God's Son, who must open the Book of Life (now the remaining three seals of the seven seals on Mac laptop computer), of which there are one hundred and four thousand souls will be saved in forty days. Together with Magdalena (P. J. Herv√©), Jesus (Martin Donovan) came to New York City to prepare the preparations for his father's wishes, but he started the second thought; He must be alive and judged? Will they deserve what they deserve? It is a cup that he does not like to embrace at this particular moment, which encourages Satan (Thomas J Ryan) who fears washing all his hard work at midnight, because he is only concerned about people who are related to their kind of hope and dreams. Work as many Artisticly transformed, high-resolution film, Hartley presents stories in an intelligent, thoughtful way of provocative way, taking great care to deal with sensitive issues, so that it makes the most enlightened fundamentalist even obnoxious. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is appealing and stimulating, as they affect the presence of their presence during the city's municipalities. It is a spiritual aspect of human fragile existence and a deep focus on it, which is predicted in the publication of John the Apocalypse in the last book of the New Testament. And in the second case there is the argument of Hartley's method; While maintaining the speed of film, it maintains the aesthetics of contemporary setting, which apparently provides a unique quality to a movie. Christ disgraced a suit and tie, effectively wear a blend with the population, while Satan's clothing is a little more casual, his face is somewhat scruffy; She plays a wound on top of her left eye. Donovan is well-funded as well as Jesus, a very important mien loan and a concept of vital urgency towards his character that is very effective. This, of course, is a unique illustration of the savior and, perhaps, because Seratum is the best in Max Fan Saidor's 'The Greatest Star of the Told'. He has successfully expressed the feeling of spiritual peace and peace, peace, which is the very essence of character. And Ryan Prince of Darkness's role is perfectly involved; His voice is sharply sharp, his eyes are sharply sharp, he is impressive with glances and captivating stares effectively, differently different and different from each other, different and different, different and different, different and different ways. Using He or she can sell you something in return for your soul before you know your injury. This is a memorable performance that makes Donovan's Jesus' screenplay so good. Supporting actress Martin Pefferorn (martyr), Miho Nikita (Eddie), Dave Simmonds (Dave), D. J. Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniq (true believer), Katrina Hardtt (lawyer assistant) and Anna Kohler (Hotel Clark). With its own, extraordinary style, 'Heart of Life', Hearty is interesting, entertaining and truly unique, which has created a perspective on the last day. It's just a way to capture life as a closed center, it's a method that works well with the movie itself. Comparatively short for a feature film (63 minute running time), it is one of the best of Hartley and more than the admission price. This is a movie that will be with you and perhaps you can think of some things that you can stay in the corner of your mind. And that this photo is part of the attraction; It provides you that `later 'probably presumably. I rated this one 9/10.
