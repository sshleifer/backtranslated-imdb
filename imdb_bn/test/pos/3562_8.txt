This enjoyable Euro-Western is open with a view that predicts the same scene that Sergio Lyon wanted to shoot for "Wayne Apne at Time in the West" but could not persuade Clint Eastwood to appear. Three hard-hitting gunmen can go to town. Dress like a man with no name in one variant. Like another kernel mortemer "more for a few dollars", and the third is made like a jungle, but the horse is run instead of pulling a coffin behind him with a machine gun. Our hero seen them in main street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins. Spaghetti Western Spaghetti Westerners, with a joke, is Western because they find three heroes. From a little more comedy, especially in acrobatic war sequences, it's an over-average oat <br /> <br /> The lucky pistol robbers carry gold coins in exchange for 300 thousand dollars across the border to the army train. Engo G. Director of "Inglorius Bastards" Kastalari keeps several camera corners from the angle which moves you in front of the action. Guns hold gold dealer as well as Lokmohon and separates from the rest of the train located in US calories. Monteiro and his gunmen kept the Kaval ank, Pajondo (Pedro Sanchez of Sabata) killed the commanders, killed the engineer and his crew, and jumped for himself behind another pistol. Basically, Pajondo doubles the Montero and stole gold for himself. Later, Monroe Ridge took Grand Pazondo off. Before the gun was published in Los Angeles, a calorie sergeant shot Pajondo to death. Before he died, Pazondo told Monteiro a medal that he worked as a source of where he kept the treasury. Comedy Cavalry Captain (Ivano Staccioli of "Commando") detains Montero, but he can not free his left tongue even after using his whip. He is very excited to see Monteiro's closeness, if the Captain shoots the Mexican without killing him. Meanwhile, in a temple of fishermen, Monteiro talks about, but he is not really a priest. The Six-Guns Tattooing Stranger ("The Ruthless Four" by George Hilton) spins as a man of cloth and rescues Monteiro from a firing squad. Unfortunately, before retrieving Monteiro, Clayton (Edwards of "77 Sunset Strip" of TV) took away the footprints from him and kept it for himself. Transmitted bank representative for the protection of Clayton Sonar. He is afraid that Captain Monteiro wants to shoot. The client's career in the bank depends on the variety of gold recovery. Strangers set fire to the fort to confuse the firing squad and Monteiro captures the Captain and tries to escape, but the stranger shoots him from the horse. After the death of Monteiro, it can verify that Strangers demanded from him a profitable prize and he came out with the help of Captain Gracious. The men of Montero have left the castle rather than showing him to rescue him from Stranger. From this point on, Stranger, Monteiro and Clayton formed a short-term coalition in search of gold. Casillari and painter Tyto Carpi, who has written several words of Spaghetti Westerns as "A Few Dollars for the Dingoro" and other casualty "seven Winchesters for a genocide", is based on clever humor and wonderful reactions, it's working and quick - Arranged. A cool scene with Clayton sitting at the table while sitting at the table while she heard some suspicious words behind her. The client poured his drink on the table and saw gunmen with six guns behind him. <br /> <br /> "Any song that can play" contains its title. In fact, many guns play, and at least twenty or more bodies fade out before the pill was done. This western is not very parody because it is "The Good, the Bad and the Agy" of Sergio Leon. You think, bad boys and good people often fall like a ten-pin in the bowling alley, but their death image is not brutally depicted in the west of Lyon. "Any song that can sing" does not take Leone seriously like Masterpiece. For the three top leadership jockeys are ahead ahead. Each puzzle has a piece that will take them to the bow, but they refuse to share their information until the end of the shooting. Lensar Geovani Bergamini's colorful widescreen photography is spectacularly growing, especially in the background, with the opening of train trains to connect with remote hills with remote tracks. Another great shot occurs when Montaro Stranger tests the impossible peace. This scene occurs after Mexico's small soldiers rescued Stranger Montero, after their commander came to save Bacon. Seizing the six guns of Stranger, Monteiro aims at the Pope-stad, and empties the revolver, keeps his well-targeted bullets unarmed inside and around a shameless gunman. Castellari's second world war thriller "Ingolierius Bastards," photographer Berggini, frames the scene with a background stranger for a delightful, three-dimensional style shot and with his pistol in his brain. Meanwhile, the lively Orchestral soundtrack of Francisco de Mossi is memorable for its own unreasonable sun, because the soundtrack of Ennio Merrocron was for the west of Lyon. The opening song is memorable with the 1950's Hollywood Western memorable songs and guitar reefs. Although it is not a major spaghetti Western, "can play any song", especially with the inevitable Gilbert Rowland, which was 62 years old with interesting plot twists and good performances!
