The magic of Hyo Miyazaki's magic is going on with Ponyo Clive, the latest animated film in the sea, which makes it your natural pleasure to stop socks. I thought the trailer was silent on his hypnotic, and did not have to wait for an invitation to confirm that I got my ticket for the film's shiny preview, scheduled to open here next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Ghabali movie studio, you probably know what you are doing, Miyazaki is one of the winners of his film, which will win new fans. I've only seen my Neboberto Totoro (eye-biting DVD's crown) and are feeling embarrassed to say at least watching love, but guess that it will not work as a last push for me, which will not be absent, I'm probably enjoying animated films . <br /> <br /> Pinoo (voice by Uriya) is a sophisticated goldfish who wants to know what life is going on in the bubbles of the whole world from its constantly running ocean. Sneak a peek of water. Nevertheless, this ambition touches briefly with her modest father Fujimoto (Tokro Jogi), which maintains some hatred towards the human race for pollution, and a maiden on Mother Nature as well as environmental protection / revenge. One day the accident hit Pinoo and the five-year-old son Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lived with his mother Lissar (Yamaguchi Tomoko) on this mountain, and Baba Kochi (Nagasima Kazushij) was mostly a sea sailor. And you can revoke the choices made for The Little Mermaid or Splash kids for a short time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are lots of things going on at the same time in the same frame, so you can probably clear them all Games to repeat display will be. It is obviously coming from the simplicity of its beauty on any 3D or SG animated product any day, not only from the Artwork Department, but also in the story of her taking a page from Hans Christian Anderson Classic. This picture has a great way to darken, but it has only suggested some dark themes, but instead has been chosen for a film with more positive emotions, which is suitable for both kids and adults. <br /> <br /> About love, Kochi, Lisa and Sosuke families, and especially among family members of Mother and Son. Even more, the love and love of the boy and his new pet fish, whose name he has pennies, and I tell you that Ponyo has spent quite a lot of his hands down like Bolt, Wall and Eve. Here the character is not the top groove, and it is not difficult to fall in love with Panini, in any form, especially when he is an interesting person who does not hide his emotions - if he is disturbed by you, he will run away or you <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and the next time I will go to Tokyo, I'm sure that the fame goes to the Gebie Museum. Haoy Miyazaki came to us under all the historical world. Highly recommended film, so you do not go missing this on the big screen!
