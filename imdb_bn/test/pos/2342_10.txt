In 2000, at the premiere of the Edinburgh International Film Festival, it saw the One Life Stand and was blown away. This black and white digital movie, made in a small budget, is brilliantly successful despite the restrictions of European films and DV's. The film works because it is Indie Heritage - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and free by the presence of humor. A life stand is avoiding being trapped in other UK realist films, ordinary workers portrayed as depressed victims or comedic stereotypes. Performance is strong, especially Maureen Carr's mother, Triz. I understand the film recently released DVD and I will definitely recommend it. Rating on this site is confusing, so I gave it a high score because filmmaker May Miles Thomas apparently puts his heart and soul in it and has more than 2.8 eligible for his amazing achievements.
