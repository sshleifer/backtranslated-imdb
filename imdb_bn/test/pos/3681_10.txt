I saw the first movie in the movie enthusiast. 10 minutes after the movie ended, a gay couple started walking towards me and asked me if I needed help - I was still sitting, crying like a joke. Chess in the movie, it's intriguing, it's upside-down, it's gay - but it's amazing. I think every character is legitimate. Everttat's character means a woman who only tries to help, she brutally throws his friend out, he is angry, he is a fly harmful, "fly", which can double his life by killing his life's love. Bats is a miracle, he is perfect, like a role. A woman whose love and respect is so strong that she even loves her lover's lover, she is the essence of true love. I even understand MAC (husband), he is upset with his life, he got a middle-agony crisis. He came out, tried to make an exciting life, only realizing that he was really annoying in the relationship and b) that he loved his wife. I really come back to him because I think that it gives the film a perfect balance between dreams and reality. In the end she is not her husband and she can be as exciting as Victor but she is real, she loves people very much down the earth. I have seen it almost 50 times and I love everything about tenderly cinema. Read only the autobiography of BTW, Rupert Everett, and the only film in the UAE, which he spoke as one of the best films of all time. This is the best movie for me
