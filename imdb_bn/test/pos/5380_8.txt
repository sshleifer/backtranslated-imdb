Every great time, you stumble upon a movie that even beyond your wildest expectation. Given the 4.0's IMDB ratings, I really did not have much prospect with the Brotherhood of Satan. I am optimistic that at the lowest point it is one of the most important of the Devils Run or another 70, which is compatible with Shantik Awesome movies. I could not be more wrong. I was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast of what was really a taste of instead. To avoid giving away a few words, the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the easily readable stories in the early 70's. Satan's Brotherhood does not hit you with plot point and explanation. There are plenty of viewers to fill in empty. As an observer, you do not know anything, but for the longest time you're not sure exactly. Unknown helps to many remote environments than most similar films. The last is effective with its surreal imagery. To start the final credit roll I am sitting in wonder. Those who want a big slam-bang finals will be frustrated with the last simplicity. A low film tried to find all the stops and probably, unfortunately failed. <br /> <br /> At the moment of the movie where the director is easy to forget, Bernard McKeilly worked mainly on the television before the Brotherhood of Satan. There are some scenes that are very good setup, lights and shots that even the most directed directors can even learn one or two things. For example, I've seen enough films in a few years to realize that directors may occasionally show trouble shooting in widescreen screens. Not here. The scene where people are discussing their action plans at the Sheriff's Office, it's amazing. Do we see all five people together ?? Doing their own thing as each real life is doing. In a small film, we can see all the men at once, but each timeless will be, their turn wait for them to quietly communicate. It's a small scene, but it looks so natural and it's so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of Satan's Brotherhood. Finally, I mentioned my opening act, so a long air lecture, I would simply say that Jones, featuring Satan's brotherhood Stutther Martin and LQ, Any film with these two sons is almost an automatic winner with me.
