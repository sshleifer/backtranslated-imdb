I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival, where it ended as the darling of the audience. This is an irony on the French cottage industry of the 50s and 60s of Osos 117 films. Based on the novel of John Bruce, the first Osos 117 was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first James Bond film, the six subsequent Action Adventure detective films were created until the 1970s, by Hubert Bonisoor de la Bath and Ivan Desnie. Luce Marylanda, Frederick Stafford, Carrier Matthews and John Gennen are all calling Osse 117. Jean DÃ¼zzerin plays the title role of this comedic in the series. As soon as the film started in 1945, there was a French crusader and similar to Daisie. But as the film began, the setting in 1955 was really like CN Connery. This gene franco halim wrote a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It enjoys the taste of the nude song, Smart and Pink Panther and it uses fresh humor in a fun mix of current events that will enjoy international audiences and I'm sure that it reworked the restored OSS 117 comedy adventure. Michelle Hajnavcius gave direct directions. I would give this a 7.5 and recommend it.
