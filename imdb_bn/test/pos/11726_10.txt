Darty Harry goes to Atlanta, which Barts calls this fantastic, first-rate detective thriller, which makes some plot from his producer Dan Andrews film "Laura". Bert Reynolds is not the only star in this cool cat but he also manages it and he does not make a single mistake with the action or the cast of his characters without making a mistake. The film is not a bad act, and Reynolds does an outstanding job to manage it. Henry Silva Hit the Man really as ice. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Shirke (Burt Reynolds) is in a drug case in underground Atlanta when everything goes wrong. He is chasing a suspect and winding up shooting it with a gunman on a bus. During the floor, an innocent pedestrian died. John Woo's "The Killer" replicates this scene. However, the Atlanta Police Department gave Vice-Down to Bourne and ordered a new boss, Fisko ("Oh, Brother, Where Art Are You?") In the basement. Sharky's air currents are operating in the air. Sharky and his colleague Detective Arch (Barney KC) and Father (Brian Keith) have monitored the high-value call girl Domino (Russell Ward of "The Dark, My Sweet"), which has a luxurious apartment that she shares with another girl. . <br /> <br /> Domino wants to see the local administrator Hotchins (the head of "Police Woman") as well as to campaign for the governor, as well as see the main villain Victor (the game of The Dentyge game Gassman). She has to end. Hookinson is reluctant to reconciate Victor, so Victor gets the delivery score (Hipri Silva "Wiawout") to destroy Domino. Billy bomb exploded a twelve inch pizza size apartment in Dominoe's door and killed him. <br /> <br /> The shark has been stuck. During the surveillance, he encouraged the Domino to point out that he was frustrated with his disappointment. Shekry's goal in life is to kill Victor now, but he knew that the villor is an informative inside the Atlanta Police Department. When Sharky discovered that the wrong girl shot and the domino is still alive, the plot is really warm! Shark took his protective custody and things became more complicated. In order to deal with Victor and his hood, he gathered the title "machine". <br /> <br /> William Falker's widescreen screening of this action is clear. Unfortunately, this extensive underlying classic is only available as a complete frame film. Fraker clearly contributes to the picturesque atmosphere, especially during a blast scene in the boat when the villain cut one of the sharky fingers. This is a rather terrible scene. <br /> <br /> Bert never made a movie that crosses the "Sharky Machine".
