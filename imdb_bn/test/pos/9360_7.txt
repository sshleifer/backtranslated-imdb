The "crossfire" is apparently the secret of a murder, but the difference between other similar movies of the same time is what the killer intended, which is anti-semitism. This story is an example of ignorance that highlights the highlights and illustrates the example of a "hillbilly" and Irish immigrant reference, which enjoys motherland due to their ethnicity. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks, the film plot known as "The Fic Foxhole", was a hate crime where the victims were homosexuals. It is disrespectful that this story about intolerance should coincide with the intolerance of sensors, for the screen version, the type of rebellion involved should change as anti-semitism. Another ridiculous soldier's behavior, who is proud to be involved in the war against the Nazis, and still admits the hatred of the Jews. After the "House Non-American Activism Committee" appeared in black blacklist, the film's director and producer had to suffer other types of intolerance. These pictures seem to underline the deeply incomprehensible and incomprehensible nature of the entire problem of the ideology described in this movie. <br /> <br /> When Police Captain Finley (Robert Young) Joseph Samuels (Sam Leven murder investigation), he discovered that he died at night, Samuels is socializing with a group of soldiers and one of them, Corporal Arthur " Mitch "Mitchell (George Cooper) is quickly identified as the main suspect. Further information was collected from Montgomery (Robert Ryan), one of the soldiers who was present on that night, and Sergeant Kili (Robert Mitchell), a friend of MrsGeel. Kili, with the help of some other soldiers, explains her interview with Guinean Trimain (Gloria Ashim), a dance service, when she finds Mitchell's find and finds out about what she did on the night of the murder. <<br> <br /> Keei helps prevent Michael from arresting and trying to identify the murderer. Guinean Trimine is questioned, but his information was inadequate to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigation led him to recognize the cause of the crime, and then he formed a wide trap that led to the real culprit to express his own crime. <br /> <br /> A movie with a message "Crossfire" is revealed in a very early stage of the story of the murderer. The "message" has been published in a way that is no doubt that it is a good creator for the time it was created, but it seems to be a heavy handover rather than today's standard. J. Roy Hunt's paintings are less surprising, combining light and creative uses with numerous technical table lighting, a screen that can become fully compatible with screen plays. Despite the low budget production, "Crossfire" was a major box office success and it was exploited with an extraordinary cast, and was well benefited by holding very relevant stories, among which two of the best supporting actors (Robert Ryan) And was nominated for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. (Glory beats). Additional nominations for Edward Demittier (Best Director), Producer Adrian Scott (Best Picture) and John Packeston (Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay) This film provides more evidence of a fairly acceptable positive recognition.
