A refreshing change from the PG films that are going on in the bed and outside of the small girls, how many girls of the high school can "hook up" the girls, drinking the kids, doing drugs, etc. etc. Hyssen wrote many books that are enjoyable but rarely classical literature. But in the end he has written something which Middle School kids want to read. And this movie sends a message to kids that they may make a difference, maybe their voice can be heard. South Florida movie, scenery is beautiful and natural and real. Who is its predictable, and a little freak care if care. So that was Willy Free and look at how good it is. This is a good family movie .......... a rare species.
