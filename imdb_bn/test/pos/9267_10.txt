The Closer That Gates ... I really knew an artificial documentary related to the death of a person. It allows a glimpse of the personal moments of the family involved in the most trying time of their lives. Parents continue to support the work of their children, in this case the documentary subjects went up and out. He intends to share his death experience as love work for his son. It is the most sensitive work of art, weighing serious, calm and light direction for this family. The story may be one that laughs, but it can also cry because it solves the problems that we all can face. I recommend refusing to cry to this voice and wish to deal with the death of the most humanly. This picture will touch you.
