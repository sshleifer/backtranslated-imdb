Are you looking for a ridiculous play and looking for a ensemble throw? Better detect this little sleep. John Lathgo and Billy Bob Thornton are great in this little plot. Do not forget the Camio by Jamie Lee Curtis. A touch of 60, the touch of "Prince and Pasha", and the gold dash of that house is made for a great story.
