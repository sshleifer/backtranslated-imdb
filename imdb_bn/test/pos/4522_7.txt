Chan was involved in New York and he tried to rob a new aircraft design. <br /> <br /> The war was more than a year to reach America, but World War II was elsewhere in the world. And so most people probably realized that war was coming. The war is not mentioned here, but the film deals with the production of very few aircraft. The mystery itself is pretty good, it saves the idea of ​​sabotage in the plane, rather two rather nicely lend at the moment. Make sure that we are talking about Charlie Chan so that we can be sure that he will live to fight another day, but there is no guarantee that someone around him will survive. <br /> <br /> I really like this picture a great deal. It's a horse, and not far from the worst. It's one of the really rare things, really enjoyable one. Of course a look or six price.
