The rules of engagement are one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It is well-built, has been piped together nicely, and it offers excellent footage to back up the spoken word. The best quality of the film is not based on sympathy for the Davidson, as soon as it illuminates the audience's misunderstanding of the chaos and lies around the whole situation. I left the feeling of annoyance and furious anger on the way the government was operated and then covered a tragedy of this measurement. The cover-up really left me fuming. It is one thing to make mistakes in the operation and to confess the crime, but on the other hand Americans look shiny and with them. I think it will not surprise me with the history of our beloved country, which is the murder of JFK, Vietnam War, and other important incidents that have seen so much bad smell of a cover that you have to keep your nose in Washington DC with the help of a special heat sensing technology. Some companies' automobiles clearly show that the FBI is lying to the public. There is something I try to be aware of when I am active, that I am usually taking testimonies from one perspective. But again, without any doubt, successful success of one of the rules. It presents its evidence in such a conclusion that how you can believe in them if you present FBI statements. I clearly remember when the media presented David as the rebel group of David Quorsch, who presented her as leader of the selfish Jesus Christ resurrections. None of this was truly true, but the stories were spread through bits and pieces of events. They were just standing right to carry weapons and practice their religion as American citizens. If you were at this and you wanted to search compounds, then how can this be done with a unit of men equipped with rifles and bullets? If you are an FBI, stay busy in mental battles and offer some suggestions in real negotiation to help solve the situation. Why do you want to save the children to pour harmful gas gallons? Why do you open the big hole in compound formation when you know the possibility of starting the fire? Why can it be clearly shown in the video that they are not lying about surgery? If not Unless you want to end the situation. The Davydian star's flagpolyte burned in the fire, and after the raising of the ATF, soon there was a psychological climate scene that hated my head and my stomach became uncontrolled. My greatest congratulations to filmmaker William Gazecki It takes a lot to create a movie and I'm sure many feedback from the government. People like him can show true truth to the public, which is filtered through a media that provides information that can be very rarely considered genuine. This is really amazing when I think of David Quaresh's media presentation and how I felt during the Davidson about how I felt after watching this movie. It reminds me of a man's Bible line that was healed by Jesus and the elders said, "I was blind but now I see", he told them. Make yourself a favor and watch this movie. You might look for it but it's really something special.
