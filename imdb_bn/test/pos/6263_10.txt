A lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures from China. It has been described worldwide that captures the film's first audience's surprise and, in fact, actually uses real Lumiar films. I do not agree with other people about bad acting for a British colleague - I thought he was good, but the Chinese leadership really stole the show. In any case, I found myself with a lot of laugh and smile on my face. Those who are afraid of subtitles can think that many movies are in English (for some reason subtitles and DVDs are given to Chinese).
