I first saw "Life sign" as an American playhouse presentation in PBS. It's an amazingly written, composed of Levi's Joey and Vincent D'Ophriyo as her brother Darl's great acting. Arthur Kennedy, one of his last roles, as an elderly shipbuilder, whose excellent family business is being closed. The Beau Bridge, Cathy Betts and the rest of Mary-Louise Parker give extraordinary transparency and material to their characters. <br /> <br /> The direction is fine and functional. I've seen this movie several times over the years and will highly recommend it. A beautiful piece of film making.
