A vampire martial arts movie available in Cantonese with Twin Effects English subtitles. It produces a Jackie Chan and has made it a special guest appearance, but not for those who like Shanghai Noon / Knights and other recent Hollywood flickr, this film is much more special than that. It was originally known as The Vampire Effect, but the very popular Chinese pop couple took two popular roles, The Twins (Charlene Chio and Jillian Chung), whose title changed to cash in their fame. </ br> <br /> The film will appeal to three types of viewers: Those who love martial arts films, who like vampire films and who play fierce movies, are generally silent. <br /> <br /> The premiere for the film is about the vampires and a secret society we all want to live before trying to find them all. This bloody work is managed by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give their little edge, thirsty work may also be! Especially in the case of most of the Pampa principals, until they take up a set of keys managed by most Pampa prince, especially in the case of the nasty European vampire, but she can walk around sunlight and usually eat whenever she wants. Not saying anything on this plot, the film will ruin the joy of seeing it. <br /> <br /> One of these pairs is Vampire Slayer (Chung) and the other sister (Choi). This is really a pair of twisted pair. Some new and funny acting is going on. The dancers who handle the scene of the scene are quick and furious and mix well with real athletes and cables. To add cherries on the cake, both of the twins are beautiful to look very much. <br /> <br /> The direction is crisp and the script is sharp. This picture is given only 3 things: make-up is very poor for vampires, Jackie Chan appears to have only made it in his picture and added nothing to his content and some slapstick comedy tried to be fond of male vampire hunters. Fortunately, these pairs only bring a fundamentality in the European film. One of the best scenes for me was that one of them (Chie) contacted only by shouting, through this medium his ability to express his thoughts was a ridiculous joy. <br /> <br /> There are so many touching of their originality in this picture - I especially love the coffin with sound stereo and TV screens around! And it mostly touches and plays genre of films that prevents it from being tired of old flashes, and it certainly turns to movies to watch movies.
