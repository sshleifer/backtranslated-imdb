I heard John Garfield, but I did not know him. I like this movie. I did not hear about it I just sorted it randomly. John Garfield movie is a boxer. He knew his part so he was in real life. He was a mad across the movie. Someone else killed a man. She is blaming the character. He has made friends by a family who has questions and is not sure what he should do. All types of minor plots ensue. My favorite was the terrible swimming scene of the water tower where the water was deep and a dead child could not swim and none of them could escape. The character of John protects the day. Dead end kids were great as his friends and followers. Among them is a very last right. Anne Sheridan family played the family and John's last love interest. She was credible, but my opinion is not lovable-the only weak link in the movie.
