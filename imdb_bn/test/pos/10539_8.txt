Hack what people are doing on the horror film this day. Somewhat frustrating like 'SAW' or it's just shit ... ??? ??? Now, I do not claim to be an intelligent expert, but I am 47 years old, I have seen thousands of films and I genuinely believe that this director really gave this film a good, sincere effort. Believe me, as soon as I was ready to start cringe for the dialogue, assuming it would be horrible and I was pleasantly surprised. It's no Mamet script, that's definitely guaranteed; But let's go !!! All the terrible rubbish there, especially in the horror, I thought it was the top of the pill. <br /> <br /> the director used many beautiful, cute camera angles; Soundtrack was excellent and Moody, perfect for the atmosphere necessary for this type of film. Editing and time were very good. And it did not resort to tired clit√© of tired, excessive 'slasher' violence; For example ***** tiny spinner ***** is absolutely delightful and completely unrealistic (but delicious ..., oh, I mean taste) during the nude shower scene I hope to get her cut and diced perfectly; But, amazingly what we did not just make sure you enjoy its celestial loveliness and it's a fantastic ambiguous end, ***** The last mini-spinner ***** also, the excitement was built very well, leading to what you did. ***** SPINER ***** Especially where the psychologist leaves the girl alone and Pinnochio at the office; We talk to the dolls, but we do not do it in video recording. Also, the mother's pinschio is running and looks quite nasty! So, both mother and daughter are mentally ill ... ??? Also the original 'killer' and any possible evil effects of the mother were conceived. But with all this, we are still not sure who is killing ***** the last spinner ***** So, above all, I believe that it is a good, strong, sincere effort, good ol 'first full moon type style and violence With so much restraint on And for any reason in a general sludge (only beautiful, innocent, beautiful shower scenes, which will remember the end of my day ...): There is no general sledge than the complete mineral drill, it is a defiant, strong 8/10 !!!
