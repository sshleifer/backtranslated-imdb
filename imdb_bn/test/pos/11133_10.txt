'Fame' (1980) Bright. The late 70s have made so great that all of these attributes have been found. It is proud of its perception and is not ashamed to be top. <br /> <br /> What is really important here, not a journey, not a destination. The unknown idiots with soap opera mentality will never realize that 'fame' is not about their youth, their struggles, anxiety and wins about their career. <br /> <br /> Hassily enough, a talented actor 'Fame' made it in Hollywood. 'Fame' marks the end of an era. Artistic independence and examinations and commercialization and political correctness begin. This is the last statement of a generation that had its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
