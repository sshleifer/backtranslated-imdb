Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" is not a Vietnam War Film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to drop behind the war, but it is a metaphorical manifestation of the harmful effects of war on the human mindset. This is one of the most commonly produced, produced, even fantasy movies. (This is the second of the Lord of the Thrones trilogy.) An excellent composition to call it will measure the proportion as the ambition of the production level of the film. <br /> <br /> Opening without any credits and in a memorable first view, "The Last" Martin Shane's Captain Benjamin L. Willard halcinates the pictures of helicopters and napalms, firstly the plot was originally put in. For 15 minutes.Willer "Mission ending in the extreme context" Colonel Cartes (Marlon Brando) who has left the AWOL in the remote area of ​​the Cambodian jungle, and his general said, "There is no work without proper sanitation, completely beyond the pale of acceptable human behavior." And he is still the captain of the field The army is in there. "Cartz is a misleading colonel now worshiped by a large group of followers The secret operati for Willard seems to be somewhat more effective than actual war, even then, the journey that he is going to take will be a personal search that will challenge the boundaries of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> In a debate about a small crew, they fall under the expanses of a wide boat on the river banks. Along the way, Willard Kurtz educates himself in all things. During Shane's acute voice, he described his thoughts on a lot of reading material. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected green beret. He was a normal person with a family, being part of a horrific killing of man cruelty on his part and led by Willard that he led the way he led himself. Jungle breeding is characterized by a messenger oura which does not fight away from war. Eventually, the strength of this experience attacks the senses on the weight and solitary confinement of the team as a drug. But Waldhardt feels unknowingly and helpless to find Kurus. She read about this mythical image, she pulled into the power of the human being and why she has become. We know that Willard's slow losses will be parallel with the cartridge. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been honored for decades. Her presence: unmatchable. His talent: inevitable. But for those who are unaware of their acting skills and their physical flexibility, an inconsistent film as a hack-in the eyes of the gear, Brando can be realized. He must of course not. Brando was difficult to understand, difficult to understand and impossible to understand, but his talent for the unreasonable gems and weird belonging unreasonable People obviously did not know what we would do if we did not. His Colonel Cartage is one of the limitless confusion and persistent tendencies. <br /> <br /> If the film gives an indication of the journey to Narsingdi, the actual experience of Francis Ford Coppola is the fanatical struggle to produce a movie in the real life of a man. It has been reported that during the main photography schedule of the 200th Plus Day, Coppola thought of suicide. The film was not just an illogical struggle; It's a serious film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood pierced through the holes of steamy locals and its cleansing holes have been pierced by Martyn Shane's ghostly soldier Willard's ornament. <br /> <br /> I can not feel the nostalgia warm feeling for such a movie. . The original and unprecedented startups, the films that were challenged and stimulated, were common. Aside from inefficiency, Apocalypse is now making pure films. Mr. Coppola is the highest order of respect and respect. But in terms of today's standard for the film, I came back: lack of innovation. This is not the only movie world today; It seems that someone wants to tell a story more or tell one with the heart. But we still have the best composition of Kapolo, such as a film, which is tender to do something deeper than our understanding, as well as great people. <br /> <br /> The depth of mysteriousness is now a mysterious step. Can kill the killings. Disinfection can unhinge damage. But it is harmed by; Irrational barrages of images that annoy our memories of everyday life and our deepest thoughts, disturb us and make us separate from humanity and make us into a vibrant, barbarous and vivacious kingdom. The idea of ​​killing does not provide livelihood, but the act of killing supplies people with their basic catharsis.
