In England we often feel very attached to British movies that we like, as used in our normal American settings and laws. From London, where virtual sex is set, I felt it was a strong emotional attachment. Virtual sexuality, especially women, especially women, is just like British Terra, I felt that I was almost on film. I immediately relate to this film related to Alex's character, his shyness is very common among most British teenage boys, especially to girls. Virtual Sexuality I think is really good among the British filmmakers not just about gangster or middle-class, but the average age of teens who are watching this movie is thirteen. Americans will not feel truly emotional attachments, but every British teenager will see it. Anybody from London can recognize the parts of the city from the movie, it has specially got a special place in my video box!
