I know girl girl who has been skating figure for character girls. He once dated my brother and he was always really nice! I live in Cranbrook BC, about 15 minutes from the castle. When I was in primary school, I used to go there for the field trips. It was weird to see it in the movie. The film had the opportunity to create the film to be extra, because there was a casting call for them. But I did not want to go there because I'm not interested in acting. Now I'm completely I wish. This is a great movie that I bought it from eBay. It did not come here, (which seems strange to me as it was partly illustrated) so when I came I was excited. I really liked the story line and the polar bear was good. But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask :)
