There is almost everything in this movie. The action is cool, it's funny, 2 great men and a really nasty villain who really hates me. There are many bad guys in the movie and bad guys. Only primarily comic book villains <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The direction is perfect and has an unforeseen lighthearted feeling. I usually prefer movies set in the old days, but it likes a lot because it creates a boring point (like sensitivity and sensitivity, the age of innocence and the worst ... Lady and Duke), like many other time films. This will restore your faith. Thanx is the most amazing score of Craig Armstrong. Music is both atmospheric and celestial and it is very exciting in action scenes. <br /> <br /> DVD is 5.1 in Doble and a very nice and dirty looking 2.35: 1 anamorphic picture.
