It remains a mystery that managed to avoid the attention of Thursday. A strong mix of comedy and crime, it takes an opportunity to make it safe with the Tarantino Hollywood formula. The risk is not always closed: one character in one sequence comes off unreasonable stupid and falls flat. In the main role, Thomas Jane gives a wonderful and complex performance, and two short presentations in Mickey R. would indicate the high likelihood of this freely and abusive actor. Here a director should take care of one.
