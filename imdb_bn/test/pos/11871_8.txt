This movie will not be on the list of the 50 best films of all time, but if you are compiling a list of "Awesome Films", it is not a bad place to start. Liv Tyler is amazing, captivating and delightful, and everyone else has died - just for her parts. This is the 21st century "Tom Jones" competitor - in other words; Just good, bawdy fun I think it can be a movie starring on a large starboard. Without any nudity she has sex in the film. It is all astonishing to give boys toys. How could they help but do that for Levi's Jewel as a helpless, innocent?
