This undoubtedly I saw the most annoying black and white film; Indeed, in this period only Western director Dr. Samuel Fuller came forward towards the distant position from the intensity of his work and intensive glue power. However, I saw a Can Ichiwiwaw preview in September 2002 at National Film Theater in London, but I could capture some of his works created between 1960 and 1973. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it is agreed to be; However, it also shows the welcome impressions of black humor - a deceased person who wakes up to answer an inquiring soldier and immediately 'dead' again, in the case of mother-tongued shoes exchange order, a wounded hungry hungry hero tells the body to eat, etc. Incidentally, was written by a woman - the director of his own wife, Natto Wada! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ichikwa is a versatile and animated filmmaker whose reputation could not be as high as it was in its peak years (1956-65), but Here his guidance is often sudden - the pre-credit sequence of the pre-credit sequence (fierce threats to leave the hospital before being expected by his superior officer), the death of the gunfighter Philippine female gunsmith A surrendered Japanese hospital bomb attack with Rear (after the medical staff escaped to protect themselves, the injured soldiers left them out of the shake at their own limited speed), automatic rain march discouraged soldiers (which are also associated with shoes previously mentioned in the business which is actually involved in Western Front [1930] ] All of the queues remember the same scene, it is a soldier A rock associated with the corps of dead body, which is attempted to climb, end, etc. One of the main resources of the film is the apologetic and stunning painting of a lonely muddy landscape. <br /> <br /> The movie is notorious for treating cannibalism banned substance. (Almost 10 years ago it became the stereo horror film), but Ichikwa's method is not only fine but also very effective: the meat is actually referred to as "monkey meat", when the protagonist only once participates (and quickly cut pieces with his harmful teeth Left it!); On the contrary, the weak underling soldier (despite his name, when played by Mickey Curtis, at that time the Japanese pop statue!) Is suffering greatly, the nearby ground spreads with blood. <br /> <br />, Ichikawa thinks that the main actor Eiji Fan Koshi (whose screenplay is distraught, deviated) has reached the set in the deviated place - so that the production is forced to stop for two weeks until the recovery! Donald Richie's perceptive interviews support the film's anarchism on the underlying patriotism behind the retreat as a recent Hollywood holiday as Savings Personal Ryan (1998). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Burmese Harp (1956; another character-driven war film, but with a spiritual voice and the standard that is available from DVDs) and ENJO Lawyer Conflation (1958; which was released locally as a part of foreign-film week a few years ago Was alone). Personally, I place a special soft spot for the Director's stunning style outline, Anne Am√©res Revenes (1963), which I have actually caught twice in 1999 in NFT and noted before 2002.
