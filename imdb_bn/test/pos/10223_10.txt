This is my opinion Clive Barker's Masterpiece. The movie has a great story and some amazing make-up and effects. One thing I would like to see is a sequel. The film was set up for a signal and the second film with advanced technology could be unbelievable. David Craneberg must be present at the Craig Schaefer as well as a signal. But this particular movie was a great, creative and entertaining idea and I can see it over again. Craniberg was perfect in this movie and added an interesting torch to Chefera.
