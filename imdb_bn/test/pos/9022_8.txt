I like this movie. I saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and my sister could see it so that it was back again. This movie is so funny. Two times I laugh laughing to me. I did not expect to see a movie so funny; I really wanted to see it because Laura Fraser was in it. I first saw him at Titas, which is an extraordinary movie. Critics like others say that many people are expecting a deep-moving movie. You're not going to get it. What you get is the laugh, the eye candy, and the chance to ask yourself how your perfect partner can see if you can create yourself. You may wonder what it would be stuck between the body of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous sequence involves Justin first seen herself as the naked man herself. I was crack up <br /> <br /> I swear, this movie I've ever seen is the most fantastic teen movie and it's my favorite now. <br /> <br /> Just remember why the movie was originally created; Do not visualize motion as entertainment. Remember this and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality.
