Looking back on 2002 when "Fury" was created, one can easily recognize today's new generation of heralding songs in Romania. <br /> <br /> The main qualities of "Fulljay" are standing in a very strong script, with a significant dramatic core and a really professional development, plus a cast of excellent actors. All four leading roles have been commemorated and deeply edited: Dregos Bucur and Andy Vasseluyu have confirmed that two of our best actors are from today, Drona Chirac followed them closely, and Audrey Pull, who is not a professional (in real life, a Cemetery Manager!) Throw as Gabon, a real ex There was a fire! <br /> <br /> Also, the direction of Radu Munin is efficient and evocative, a very compelling style that creates feelings of "lucky night" and missing fate. One can easily pass some weird and even failed moments, since the time only proves uncertainty in their first film, their next movie never repeats: "Hartia vie albastra" and "boogie".
