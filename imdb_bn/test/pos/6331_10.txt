Although the term is not a comedy in general, it is more fruitful than comedy, but without substance. I do not think Bergman's films can be easily classified under narrow styles, even the halqatam complex. Despite the light touch of this film, the film caused problems in marriage and its flaws and what happened during the fire. I personally do not contact these problems because I'm sure others do it too. But the movie's atmosphere is remarkable, you almost do not want to end. I must admit that I had been away from Bergman for fifty years, after that I knew most of the time. Nykvist, von Sydow, before Ulman The master has produced some of the rich, warm and touching cigarettes that have ever seen. Although it is a long shot, I have seen such kind of love in human nature, in its complexity, only at the same time in Philinea's movies In addition to the summer night Smile, a lesson for love for Bergman fans, full images of human power and heart is good to see for love. If he could rest in peace!
