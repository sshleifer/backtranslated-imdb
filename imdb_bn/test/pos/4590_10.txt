We saw this movie in Alto South Lama at Austin Texas in the afternoon yesterday. It laughs me a lot! Albert Einstein's views on humanity hurt me over and I could not laugh. It is very bad that it is not in the theater, I know many friends to die watching this picture! "Welcome to Kust, I love you." ... great work involved in all! Also, if you see it, be sure to stay up to the credit! I'm definitely going to take my family to see this weekend! If you are a fan of Office Space and Bavis and Bathidas you will see this movie. It's a classic and nobody knows it out! So if you're having some mood watching this weekend, definitely check it out.
