"House Colossus" is a wonderful romantic comedy which can best be described as "how they make". It is a recently widowed doctor as Walter Mathew (one of his best roles) who goes out of the dating scene and hits his payday every night, just like a different woman. Then he met with the hospital's patient Glenda Jackson and soon made a relationship with him. But he will be strictly tested to tell him that he is a man and he is expected to be a woman. <br /> <br /> This is a sweet, very funny movie starring Art Carney as the Administrator of Senate Hospital and as a friend and fellow doctor of Richard Benjamin Mathle. It must be seen for any fan of a mathu fan or light comedian. <br /> <br /> Do not be frustrated.
