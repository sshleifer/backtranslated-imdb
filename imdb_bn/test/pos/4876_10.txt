I was present at the Rai International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this movie won the best show. <br /> <br /> The flood of Duster, Comedy and the beautiful scenery. A return to the story during the strange goings. A growing expanse of ill health, with the adverse side effects of public issues, comes from a young professor's teacher; Stefan, to investigate. During his travels, he decided to slap briefly and asked again to marry his long love hand, would be sent only once by his extremely dumb daddy? On the way to the "outside of the city", he came to the sick girl in the street and said to him. Deliveries to Maitland (acted wildly: Edward X. Young) Steven was admitted to Evils. Legs Only Professor Dr. Dr. Dr. He is insulted just because he got a boy for training ?? No one is less, Stefan becomes much more than a common disease. Horror icon; Tom Savini portrays the final religious torment Maungdar; Preston John Skin Queen; Ingrid Pitt came out of retirement to star performances like Anagire. Many beautiful and gifted supporters hold the story together and effectively helped to move it with Claymax. <br /> <br /> Dark religion and top, but fun and sometimes very original, cow's scenes make such a great deal. Hammer paying tribute. This stylish movie goes back into the flashback, the reality of the world, the dream and the character of the surreal. <br /> <br /> aside from the horror and the gore; This is a very funny movie! Slapstick, tongue and lip humor and dark comedy dark lines raise their head in line. Others have said; This is really one of three great movies like. Very entertaining and original.
