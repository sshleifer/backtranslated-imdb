Mary Pickford played Annie Rooney - a policeman living in a tough part of the city. She is an uncertain age (somewhere between 12 and 16 somewhere) a rough and Orthodox young lady who loves scraps but has deep heart down to the heart. <br /> <br /> This is a very common style for Mary Piccord. . Like many of her movies, she plays a young girl - although she made little Anne Ronnie at the age of 40. And, like many other stories, he was both adventurous and brave. As a result, I had a strong sense of déjà vu. Now if you have not seen his other films, then this is not a problem. However, he is playing a character like Spuroz or Daddy Long Legs - though these two other films are even better. Now it does not seem to be a bad movie - it's not necessarily in its best work - rather than "surprising" stories which are extremely heavy on sensitivity but not particularly trustworthy. Seeing the relaxation but essential until you are silent a huge fan
