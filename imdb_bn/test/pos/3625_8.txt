Jasu Pits is the thing that you have never seen here, Jasu Zinger! In 1933, Pletle starring Olive Oil played the role of Maestre as an animated cartoon version of Comet Strip Popeye for Flasheel Studios. Jasu (pronounced jae-suo) is walking with his best "olive oil" in the camouflage, holding his hand down or connecting the police to his breasts. I was waiting for him to be a dead man, but instead it was "always with someone." For the first time I love this picture and I think its character is really funny. I followed him in other movies where he did this same screaming, warmth, fragile-round routine. So, after watching this film again I started to get a bit annoying with constant whining and near hysteria on a piece of dust. However, here are some funny comedy bits, and it's a mystery film as well. It's actually an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that works. Jasu Pitts and James Gleason hold the plot of mystery together to congratulate Arthur Cremer of the camp. The ghost house has many secret passions and even fun to have a skeleton!
