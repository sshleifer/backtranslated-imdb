Fair and Nifty The recent game of little science fiction / famous video game designer Algra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) - "Existence" not only attracts the attention of people who volunteer to try this game, but who almost killed him (and his game, Too). As he is forced to refrain from sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikk (Jude Law), Marketing Training ("PR Nerad") as his bodyguard, though his body has teeth, bones and bullets made from a gun. Director David Krenberg used some bits of his earlier films ("videodrome", "scanners", "the fly" etc.) and kept some parts of the story with some good times. Laws and Leaves are fine here and some of the supporting cast (Ian Holme, Will Duffo, Sarah Polly, Christopher Eichelston and many more) have a international twist. In addition to Dofo Gas, there is some other devil, a deceiver garage mechanic. One of the best scenes in the movie is Teddy Eat (fish and frog) and a gun making and recognizing Allegret - "I can not help myself." "Exsthenge" shows that he (Cronbirge) has his old tricks up and it still works like a charm.
