One of my favorite movies all the time. For the first time, this movie can not beat anything. If I could go back to the time and remove my memory or enjoy passing amnesia, then I can say that this is the first movie I can enjoy this movie. Shock and thrills were not unexpected because it is still enjoyable second round and round time but I received more praise from humor myself. If you want to see a movie that you are not able to predict, then I highly recommend this movie. Its cold, damned, full of crystallized and it has excessive humor to help you through it. If you look at this movie and do not like it, then I really want your sanity!
