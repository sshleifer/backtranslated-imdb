After Mick Molla's extraordinary track record was out of my own, I had less expectations than crackerjack. Even the promotional poster for the movie was nervous to me. In fact, if I did not receive a free ticket for the preview, I would have opposed the pressure of Mrs to pay for it (who thinks Mick's a hunk -). <Br. <br /> The first few minutes of the movie worried me - it started tired of being "angry at the tired things" of Mix, but it was given a balanced touch, which at least refreshed it. The rest of the script was good, and very light-hearted - even the ordinary Mick Mollay (and Judith Lucy) comics were well distributed and when I did not ever want to pick myself up, I made more chocolate which I was hoping for (and It was consistent). <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in this plot - quite predictable, but it has quickly moved between the one-liners and other jokes - I have never felt it very long in any element. Very small; Mick has to work hard to smooth his script. There was one or two "late shows" in Jokes, and the Melbourneers received one or two jokes - but there are plenty of generic things for the wider audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> He was frustrated by the relative ineptness of Hello Clark - he did not just say to work as a bad guy, but it would not move much away from the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I've enjoyed this Australian comedy, and the movie was pleasantly entertaining for the duration. I leave the movie with a decent sized Green - my book is a pretty hard thing for an Australian comedy. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
