I believe I share the same mental aspect in the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I'm Dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the universe is not ineffective in the total cosmic world. Poland is likely to play Poland as a poet-ruled by a poet or perhaps a social and cultural 'low-pressure area', although Christian is Jewish to Christians, although Christians are often less critical than themselves. . There is innocence and crime in the world scene of Kesselovsky, like the symbol of Catholicism: White vs Black Madonna. In the Rose, Black Madonna was in love with the judge when he was a young man. Flashbacks are related to magic with reality, although it is quite playful, as the camera just wanders on the other side of the street or the young juggernaut's young car in the car accidentally hits the dog. We leaped through the same camera moving time, that we later realized. His love was not altogether, so that his life was not his plan. She has lost the ability to love other people and animals. As a judge, he thinks he is actually spying on other people's lives and when he retires, he only does so, while spying on his neighbors at this time. The sense of innocence and spirituality of the newborn (literally) enters her life, reinstates her good decisions, and because of her husband's neighbors and police acknowledges her secret behavior, even after accepting it and even holding it up, the stone will eventually be thrown through her window. In this process, history repeats itself between this man and the woman he likes, although this time he is not old and women alike. Kislowski may be wrestling with these bits, instead of being old-fashioned pride, and he was infatuated by Iran's Jacob. Both women play the same essential role in their psychology, one (!) Who holds his heart and soul, and so can him or her as an old man! It is such a 'wind energy', or is God, to combine them. Coincidences * Very * Incidentally wishing only the opportunity or even good luck. Some mysterious, supernatural or religious sources have to be influenced by this intense deep decision-making. The test book is open on the test page and another example of this. Or at that moment the old judge told the young girl her heart, that the outer wind from the opera house suddenly slogan open doors and break the window. The giant image of the young lady predicts one on TV after the sinking crash of its canal crossing trip. At the moment, by the voice of evangelism or sounds like it (Van De Budinmar)
