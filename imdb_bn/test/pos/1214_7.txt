It was a very good PPV, but after 14 years, many matches were increasing on WWE like WrestleMania XX, but some matches were in vain. I'm not going to exceed every match on the card because it must be done forever. <br /> <br /> The main highlights included huge pops for winning the tag team belts of Hamu and Andrei the Giant, Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherry vs Dusty Rhodes and the first match match with late Sapphire and The Ultimate Warrior and Hobck Hogan First clash between <br /> <br /> Some matches were completely wasted time. It was about 40 seconds long, like the Heart Foundation versus Belshavix, the Rick Martel versus the Koko variant was small and the Big Bassman versus the infinite was very small. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Roberts was really very good. <br /> <br /> Overall grade - B.
