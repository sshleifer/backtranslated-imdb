An interesting pair of stories, this little shake leads to the seemingly different lines of characters and storytelling together in WWII's retreat and succeeded in combining them apart from losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth depicted by the depth of the characters and how much I really felt that I could understand them and their motivation, although the time for the development of each character was very limited. The ability of the person involved in this movie is easily mentioned. A fun, stylish movie with several sunny moments and a bunch of more heads blurred. <br /> <br /> 7/10
