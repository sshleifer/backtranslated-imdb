In fact, Elizabeth talked to Desmond in the film Cynthia Waters. Although I'm just wondering how he ended up as a 'rehabilitation patient' (?) Where Harley is trying to reduce his weight (seen from previous episodes). <br /> <br /> However, this last episode is really postponed. The end is not so understandable. I think the author expects the audience to come in the 3 seasons. <br /> <br /> I hope the next season will be more vague / hanging events that happened. <br /> <br /> Just can not wait for season 3.
