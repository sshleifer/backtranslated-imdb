Good animation, excellent character design, and a light hearty story, Suzumiya Haruhi makes Youtube easy to see. <br /> <br /> After watching my first, I thought that this nickname was quite good, but it was a lot better for a second watch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's chronicelical order Is over, and once you see it in the correct order, once you see links that you have not seen before. (Or you can see the second meaning of some of the events that you have not noticed before) you may want to read the original novels (not Monga) before or later Tanigawa Nagar. Anime is very good to make every detail visible in the stories shown in it. <br /> <br /> However, there are some short stories in the book that are not animated, but it has been mentioned. (Bamboo w / greetings have been shown in episode 14) Overall, once this platform is a little nicely after the analysis of the platform, this genre is really very good (it also improves on the book). This is a nice break from Shane-Jump Enam which seems to be taking.
