This is the first James Cagney film I've ever seen. I have never been interested in his movies before because I think I do not like anything in the style of the movie and because I have heard that most Kagina movies are the same. I have to say I've really liked it. According to today's standards for movies, this was not special, but I found it surprisingly amazing. Cagney was not a tough guy, but he played very well.
