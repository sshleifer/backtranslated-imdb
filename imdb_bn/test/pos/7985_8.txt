What can I say, this picture is amazing. He has flaws like every picture, for instance, in a graveyard, Bhabali headstone, during a scene of the death of Penguin, a clear visible slide board, Max Shrekh image consultancy created a makeup among the shots that lost his black eyes in a split second in split seconds between the shots. He can publish Bruce Wayne in Catwoman, Conversation Note It is played again but it is played again and it is said differently than when it was first mentioned, and finally the Catwoman suddenly knows how to use the snake whip no matter what the training. These errors are small compared to the ones you can see, for example Batman forever, where Ridder can definitely wait for change between his cou or well-killer hair shots. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Michael Cutton reiterated his role as Batman and did much more in this film. She looks more comfortable in the role of second time and is equivalent to performance of villains. Danny Davito perfect penguin I really like the Penguin transformed character rather than the threat character from the comics or TV shows because now the character has more depth and it has more interesting stories generated from family's more basic needs. Took and wanted It gives us a bad character, for which we feel sympathy because he did not blame for what he was not guilty of. Excellent as Michelle Pfeiffer Catwoman. She is sleet and sexy and she can feel sorry for the way she is a villain. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and it is as interesting as a character, though he is not even in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is much better than the first and the chance to show Danny Elfman. This time off her musical genius. The set is amazing. They can describe how amazing they are, how they are detailed, eye catching, sinful, gothic, unique, dark and many other adjectives. The dress and make-up were fantastic and obviously many work went on to create them and stopped all the work due to the improvement of the batting suits, making the cat's case extraordinary and creating penguins and making the effects so sure. The animatronic Penguin played really realistic look and played well. The script is really good and my opinion is a potential one of the story stories. Overall, due to all these factors, this film deserves 8/10 and stands as my favorite of all Batman films
