If you get a little from the music of Pink Floyd, you would love this movie. The score is completely pink floyd and of course, the drug film contributes a large part of this film to the suspense of your life in the weakest moments. This film touches the heart with the story of love and the people around you ... There is a huge connection to the world around you with the private island environment. This thing tells me that I need to add ten lines to the movie, but I've done that because of this you got this movie 6.1 which is a big disaster for a movie with such scores. Look for a dream and requiem for the show .... equals good score for our generation but too much
