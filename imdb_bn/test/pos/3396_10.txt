Perhaps one of the best movies ever made. The friendship between Oree and Gerae deepens, and the fight puts pressure on their strong friendships. As a Southerner, I can honestly say this epic as accurate as it does. Brother brother fighting Can you imagine that life lived the course of life? The best part of the movie, for me, when South surrendered; President Grant urged the President to keep Lincoln really stuck in the south, he said, "Mr. President, many people want the South to bleed on what they have done ..." President Lincoln wanders in his direction. Very tired voice is saying, "South is fairly burning ... and so we ..." I burst into tears, and take a deep breath. What the President! It's like a father that his son has been punished enough, and despite his anger he realized that his point was made. This war was very dark time for our young country, and it was to fight. President Lincoln knew this. I request everyone to read this movie, and add it to your DVD collection. Then thank God that our country was preserved. As Jesus said, "a divided house can not stand."
