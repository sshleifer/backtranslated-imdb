... the true gaique-girl's dream: high tech, high drama, smart ball, steamy sex, and big explosions. (Very Large Explosion.) Sam Waterstein was so natural in Oppenheimer's role that the original Oppenheimer term was unclear: Clearly, he had a voice like Ronald Regan! The victory of Oppenheimer and tragedy is one of the most exciting plays of the 20th century, and this film should be the model of Doku-drama model: The events are allowed to speak for themselves, though the fictional parts are used to increase and fill the record, themselves. Do not pay attention. An interesting reality: some technical details have been used recently, and so are special interest. A must see!
