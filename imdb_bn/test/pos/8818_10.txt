Above all, Big Bad John was a ridiculous and touchy movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie got it. If you're a fan of the song (like I am) you mostly know how it ends. But if you do not, and do not want to see it, I strongly recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a ridiculous pair with great chemistry. However, I would not recommend this movie to the harsh urban guy. You will understand where these people are coming from, and only a small number of us will be left. But even a few urban people can understand it and appreciate it for it: A good, low movie movie that laughing, crying and inspiring you.
