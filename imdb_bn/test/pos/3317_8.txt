Caroline Bender (Hope Lanz) is killed just when getting a job. Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Dian Baker) is very innocent and very easy to stay on this road for a long time, a dangerous combo. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) wants to be a gatester and an actress. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paperback publishing is a slug, not as "the valley of puppets" but as "vanity three coins" as vanilla. <br /> <br /> Male - Brian Eating, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jardin and Robert Evans - Most of the time are sticky, adorned and not good at all. Aherne resident sex offender - walks by something will pinch, and makes the left and left undesired progress. Its character is offensive as hell, but it does not play seriously. Harassment has not been discovered yet, I guess. Boyd works there even though you're not actually doing anything to him. She is very busy, intelligent and drunk. Evans is abroad, so Diane can enjoy Baker style - he is a rich child who got him in "trouble", instead of marrying him, he promised him that he was going to get 'Operation'. <br /> <br /> <br /> Zardan is a director who mistakenly had a relationship with Parker. They share a war scene that is not fairly close to a movie, but the scene is finally destroyed by Parker's histronex. He almost ended up stalking him, and he did not really deserve such a lousy fate, his bad acting availability. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Well they're small, is not it? What is the reason for a person to hate? Caroline does not think so, she stood admirably every opportunity till Miss Farrow got up. Crownford can only be released once, when he tells his married lover 'You can go to hell to face your rabbit' and destroy the phone. The poor soul can not see him, who dares to overcome him. <br /> <br /> The 'story' of Marth Haier, as it was, is very weak, and she is in a hurricane leading to unmarried mother. Summing up on her cardigan for a huge "w" ('slut'), she walks around like a kindergarten for most of her screen time. Even worse, in the end it is not all 'tied', courtesy of one way or the other. It will not be too much, but still .. <br /> <br /> This is all of a sudden, it happened in a completely different world. Most of the people were inferior to each other and the job was not a tension, but there was something exciting for the girl outside the NYC. <br /> <br /> An unexpected drunken scene aside, Caroline has at least one of her characters on the side. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the women watching opinions, opportunities and preferences. That's not covered in a nice bow, but it makes some points for equality. Probably significant and perhaps controversial in 1959. 7/10
