Such shows are not supposed to happen on television. This is usually the type of intensity reserved for independent films. This is just what HBO is supposed to do. In fact, Dennis Lewy was able to join one of the best television shows, easily joined the posts of Soprans, Oz, Ed. NBPD Blue was not a silence and congratulated the gang on ABC to show it. Mr. Leary and his gang to create a really unique viewing experience. My only complaint is that the show is not long enough ... one hour will do it better, but I can not wait for the next episode!
