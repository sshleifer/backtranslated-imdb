A mud of a silent era cartoon - it was re-discovered on the cartoon network and sometimes it was broadcast for the first time in decades. <br /> <br /> It is so enjoyable that different types of cayos ... Douglas Fairbanks are attacked by giant mosquitoes; Hey will visit Static Studios as 'Boss'; As well as the presence of Chaplin, Keaton and William S. Hearts. The picture of chewing gum can not be described by reducing the population shoes (Felix's near-bankruptcy-based shoes = money-making plan for the salesman's master) - it must be seen. A horrible cultural jewel
