William Wellman, the director of the most exciting silent films ever produced, 'Wings' (1927), here returns to the sky with a story of Dior-Satan Fire, another Rip Girlling. Wellman was an aircrop in the first world war, and no one knew the bipelines like him. Here in 1932 there is also an interesting flash of commercial wind activity, as they are, stunt-flying, crashing, explosion in the air, and what you think. And there is a well-stocked story, which is well-known by Richard Barthelmess (silent star who has made several films with Dr. W. Griffith), Sally Eels and Tom Brown. Eilers are a real Sizzler. All photography performed in today's Hollywood film, instead of Botox Dummies, is such a relief to see the real woman with real fire and character. The story is played with a sad, genuine pathos, and well guided. At the end of the film there are some exciting thrill scenes of disaster and rescue, and which should be the most captivating blind landing in the fog. I do not have the courage to give the impressive aspects of that special episode. Worthman is played by Barthelmess himself, a real wild hell in the air. Anyone who likes to fly in the early flight will love this movie, and it is very rewarding for anyone who likes good solid entertainment, love, tears, and non-stop actions that meet all kind of Delayed Wellman Amalt.
