If you're going to challenge James Bond, it's a great idea to have a great idea to look like two San Connery and Leonard Rasitter, leading Jean Dzourdin, who has fully captured the Connie Sniper who confused himself with the smile and laughter thought. She is civilized Dujardeen plays like a clausaur who can stay in the cart. This plot is looking for our man in search of a bandwagon, who has disappeared mysteriously and has such imperfections as a Nazi cell hidden inside a pyramid. If there is a jarring note, it is the main female, Berenice Bezo, who has received all the intensity of a sweet pudding and surrounds it - but only by - by Atik. It's good for a visit but it's about it.
