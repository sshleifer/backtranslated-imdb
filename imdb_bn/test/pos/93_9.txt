Montreal resident of Montreal, Maurice Richard received letters in his voice, mail to Toronto Maple Lift. I recently saw in a class where some students were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew about Maurice Richard and Toronto / Montreal challenge. Very entertaining, funny, and accurate.
