Exceptional films that handle the theme of great proportion in a very balanced way. Demrick was a very good director, at least I can tell from this movie and Mart from my sweet, but as the other film director and actor, he heavily influenced Huaw. There is no Oscar for crossfire, because it's a great example of making a great movie in a low budget. Everything about this movie is exceptional: a well-written script that uses massive flashbacks, a great cast, a gorgeous light that considers the story to be more than just the right steps. What more can you expect from a top notch movie? I can add that Noor is used here for its stylishness, and I can add financial benefits. But it has once again proved that B-Movie can be considered to be very influential, most of the heavily-elephant-A-films that have lost their audience today. <br /> <br /> Every noir movie is not raised and this really raised serious questions about what actually happened to Noah. The style is definitely silent, and especially in terms of lights but the theme exceeds the recipe of "noir style". You can see things from the opposite perspective and claim that Anti-Semitism is an attempt only to investigate criminal, the actual focus of the puzzle around the killing. This was not the case with Robert Ryan's extraordinary performance. However, the film has offered a lot and it is really sad that the director had to commit many sins for his former faith in the "silent" time of America.
