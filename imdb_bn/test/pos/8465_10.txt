The movie shown in Berlin in London suggested that the print was acceptable enough for this printing. Now the question is, why is this long lost and important movie not available in DVD (or even VHS)? A large number of people in Europe and America are expected to see this film, if there is no other reason than Sergei Prokofiev for extraordinary music. What is the need to get this kind of wonderful production available to the larger public, not the sponsor of Barbarikan in London? For many years to pay tribute to Prokofiev's music and to be aware of this movie, please do some 'correct' work there and it can be brought out as a DVD.
