"Edge of the City" is another movie that lends a lot of credit to "Waterfront". From its NYC locations, your score assumes that you can read any problems, you can fix your mistakes in some way. <br /> <br /> "Edge" also manages ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, the movie does not succeed like "Waterfront". Within 85 minutes the film goes through establishment of relationships, and closes everything so quickly that most of it seems to be forced and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Potential Spellers **** <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sydney Poitier and John Cassavettes may be better at the beginning. I do not believe that these two letters were so fast connected to two different places. <br /> <br /> I think the whole love with Casavets could have ended the sub-plot. She is painful to see it so painful with a woman. Why is it the only reason why it can motivate him to do the right thing in the movie? There are other ways they might have shown this. I see why he is like that. <br /> <br /> acting is excellent. Poitier nicely written a role horrible. Tyler's role is attractive and multi-layered, and (especially in 1957) is his confident, respected and intelligent person. As the answer to Excel, Cassavettes, when not very good, seems pretty good for the part. Warden is very dangerous to know the secret of the excel (although at the end of his battle with the Casavetts is horribly handled, many unstoppable boxes). I thought Ruby dei Poirian's wife's role was amazing. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Take pictures when creating movies, plays. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
