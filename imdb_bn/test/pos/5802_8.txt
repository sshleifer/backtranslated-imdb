I must admit that when Madonna spent her holidays at the top of the Pope many years ago, then I told my wife, "Another American has found a wonderful thing that the whole thing is wrong!" Well he was wearing a terrific wig and was dressed appallingly. I could never love my daughter in the way of love but I have to eat my words. I like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her shooting concert. This confusion tour is superb, even if the music is not (and it is not). I was impressed by the staging and the concept. Madonna herself was developed by the incredible dancer selected for her support for her performance. My daughter was at London gigs and was crazy about it. The lady (maj) proved to be the initial assessment of my initial mistake!
