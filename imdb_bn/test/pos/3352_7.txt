Alice enters a world of wonder ... but you do not feel as a child. Mad Hatter, White Rabbit, Queen and others (even Tivaldini and Tiveddale) show some things about his body to Elise - and other human bodies - it can be quite surprising. Love and desire is a story you never met. <br /> <br /> Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say, according to the 1970s decade, it can be the most attractive adult actress of her day. I believe it was his only film before going to mainstream work, but it was more likely than it was to be chosen (Alice was no secret for all my love). Even better than "Fair Tales" (which is not really pornography). <br /> <br /> The songs are Chess, but the theme of the movie is fit. One song, "What an Aal Girl Like You Like Give Night?" Was quite funny, and others had similar themes. At the end the trial was well written and Alice was very naturally fit in the world. Logic and humor were calculated for calculation. <br /> <br /> What else can you say about such a movie? What I know is that in adult movies where it is only used for 30-second lead-sex, it's going to overload you with plots and music. But, personally, I think there is something special about this movie and I hope it gets a good DVD release with touching it and special features (if it is possible). I can see this a ritual movie.
