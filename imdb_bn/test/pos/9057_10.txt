This is really a great film. Full of love and humor, the audience is really forced to take care of the characters and take part in their journey. Michael Persce was able to combine a big cast of top players, a small miracle for a first movie. No doubt, they were moved to help her to tell this beautiful story. David Krumlaus carries the film with his low intensity and fidelity. Natasha Lyonne is uncertain, exasperating, and is still completely lovable as Grace. Also Karen Black as Grace's crazed but sympathetic mother (see her on the screen again) is a great turn. Spending intellectual life, allowing us to be ashamed while facing life. Acting stupid, tight, inspiring, and musical mood creates a fitting backdrop. The current time is full of Hollywood blockbuster craze, big budget, big name, car crash and special effects, a 'refreshing exit' of 'Max and Grace'. Give yourself a treat and watch this movie.
