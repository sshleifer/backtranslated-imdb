Episode 1 episode is a real stand in season. This is a common feeling of pancreation in a location, clustrophobic condition, and frozen air, it must be seen in one episode of the season. The inhabitants of the Eastern Muller, the terrestrial and other four, killed each other or killed themselves. A virus is causing serious aggression and is responsible for the deadly paranoia and fear. MADRUPARS AND THE SCHOOL REALLY begin to question each other's proximity. The writer must earn a lot of credit for creating such scenes where the atmosphere is so difficult that Muller and the school face direct conflicts.
