Everyone seems to compare the matrices and the 13th floor, and when I saw it first I would agree - I was expecting the matrix and was a little disappointed. But my respect for this movie has increased greatly on the repetitive viewpoint. <br /> <br /> Remember that The Matrix is ​​a great action movie, a philosopher Mumba-jumbo thrown out. Action movie to be adapted to a 13th floor with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo cast. EXSTENGE is not an action movie and it's not about "reality" or any "deep" concept (many believe). It is about intentionally artificially (both artificial and its behavior) to replace the world of faithfulness about human tendency. <br /> <br /> The most captivating moment of this movie is the "script" line when it is repeated by Allegra Gella. At this time you realize that people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will to participate in a story. Meanwhile, after commenting on the possibility of Darcy Nider (or his player) playing his life in the game, it made it even more fierce. I am fully sympathetic to the "realistic" philosophy, which provides a fascinating world that people simply identify the correct path of the end goal, a recipe for the existence of this result. Living "in the game" is not always lived, but it is a tempting way to spend your time on Earth. Algrea commented on the real world, "There is nothing going on here." Between someone else's imagination as well as Jack, and might be pretending to do something interesting. (Even though I asked Croniberg to consider this self-accusation, he offered himself to be experienced in the 90-minute snippet.) <br /> <br /> After leaving the theater after watching this movie, I I thought it was one of the movies that just got to see how it was finished. But I saw it a few times more (thanks to the Saifee Channel) I understand how deep it is. Seriously, if you've seen it only once, it's another viewable.
