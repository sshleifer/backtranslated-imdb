Traditions make many poor little horror flickers, most of them in the slavery sub-genre - thus making the film move more than the rest of it. The Demon of the Night is a cross between Gore Film, The Evil Dead; And with the violent house-Slash Hell Knight Flick. Such films usually display a brittle / perverted crazy feature as bad guys; But here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always interesting than a crazy if you ask me. This movie has many comedy and the first three of the film can be easily set up for a direct comedy film. But once enter the central position of the letter; A humorous funeral known as 'Hul Haus' - this movie contains the form of a horror movie that provides the title. The plot line is as easy as you can expect, and we follow a bunch of kids that decide to keep a Halloween party inside the funeral home. It may be a bad idea, however, it is transparent that it is once accepted; Children begin to live in the body of children! Their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream ... but finding the gate on the ground is not so easy that it sounds. <br /> <br /> The center of the gothic palace is where the action takes place. This craky old house makes for a great awful film location; It's used to be a funeral home that only adds this. Director Kevin Tenny shoots the room well, and especially a good job is that this room is somewhere in the middle and is difficult to escape. At the beginning of the movie, the comedy is usually very funny, and I was hopeful that it will laugh after the start of the horror. Comedy moments are when the kids enter the hul house, but this is not the funny thing, and it is clear that the main goal of the horror film. This is not a problem; But it is very good to be connected properly to giant night elements. Most of the characters are what you would expect from such movies; But the actress fits the movie well and it is clear that the young cast was a good time to create this film and it translates well on the screen. The effects are good that they accept the film well and most of the death is properly implemented. It's a good bet that most people will not bother watching this. This is a classic or a movie; But I can highly recommend it as a good time to offer and will appeal to fools folly kid fans.
