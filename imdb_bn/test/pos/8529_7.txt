Year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; Two competing bond movies. Roger Moore played the part of "Octopussy", a public poet, brokly bond franchisee. "Never Say Never Again" by competing producers, except for the horror "casino royale", the only bond film that is not part of the franchise. Its huge attraction was that it was brought back to the original bond, Shan Connery; After "Diamond's Forever", Kanree's remarks made her title perfectly that she will never play the role again. Many have complained that Connie played the role of 53 years, but he was three years younger than his successor Moore, who did not make "Octopussy" in the same year, but made another bond film, "A View to a Kill", two years later . <br /> <br /> The film has its existence for the settlement of cases related to the rights of film work by Ian Flaming. Perhaps it is unfortunate that there was a section on the condition of this settlement that the new film "Thunderball" should have been rebuilt, probably it was not the best of the Canaanite bonds. (A rebuild of "no no" or "goldfinger" might have worked well). The plot is much more like the previous movie; The terrorist organization, Speaker, has played together with a megalomanian tycoon named Largo, stole two US nuclear surgeries, and the governments around the world are trying to get rid of their threat of explosion until they get huge amounts of money. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is fortunate that it is not only one but one of the most beautiful bond girls, Barbara is seductive in front of the bonds after learning about her lover's evil plans, who are seductive as Largo's girlfriend Domino But Carrera as deadly Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger Most of the bond films have a plot that holds on Hill's ability to win villain or win a female colleague - like "Goldfinger", "Live and Le Mite" and "The Living Dellites". In the official series, Bond's partner is generally considered female lead, but here the carrier is played with Villains, it is billed on Basing, who was a relatively unknown actress at that time. Bicing, of course, has become one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, whose carrier has a few bond girls who have faded from their point of view. <br /> <br /> Max Fan Saido is one of the main effective Bluffs in Spectro of Villains, but Claus Maria was feeling very silent and atrocious like Brandoir's Largoe, probably during the "Dominion" games, "Violent" invaders such as "Space Invaders" In addition to the more sophisticated version it was so popular. First eighty Branduir can act in his native Germany "Muffinto" and "Aubert Radle", but he does not come so clearly in English. One of the features of <br /> <br /> is that it follows both the normal bond formula and, sometimes, it exits. Based on the movie title, there are standard World-in-Parle Plots, Chase Signations, Exotic Positions, Interesting Women, Horror Villains and Specially Written Theme Songs. However, there is no extended pre-credit sequence, and we can see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, Bond's boss M became a cruel, supernatural elite, his American colleague Felix Litter was shown as black for the only time, and the question of the scientist was portrayed as a confusing enemy by Alex McConnell (his characteristic alarrennance despite his high-ranking Christian name). -Classic accent There is also a fun movie from Roman Atkinson as a wonderful British diplomat. Though Connery was probably not very well here, he was in some earlier films of his roles, but the changes in the familiar theme make one of these memorable bonds. 7/10 <br /> <br /> A cave. The character of Rowan Atkinson says that he came from British Embassy in Nassau. Although, Bahamas are a Commonwealth country, there will be high commission in the British capital, the embassy is not the embassy.
