Holden and Jones Siegel in this film, but in the way we can not think of today - it's very subtle and under the surface - still clear. Especially Jennifer Jones is so hot in this movie (much more than a monkey like a joke) because she has created a true woman - in all aspects of femininity: she is intelligent, intuitive, and delightful. He will will and desired. <br /> <br /> There is a view of the famous hill, where he is lying on grass, looking at Holden and expressing his expression in X-rayt, but in the context of the scene and the character, the whole sense makes sense. You do not need all that you said in the conversation - Most of the modern films have been made as weird transparencies. Has all of her eyes - sexy yet elegant. She did what was a stunning, under-rated actress. (I recently saw his first ma'amom BOVARY and was flown in the same way.) I'll take him a day on Bergman, Davis, or two Hepburn.
