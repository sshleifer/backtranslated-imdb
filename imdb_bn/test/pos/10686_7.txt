In this film, astronauts have discovered that a newly discovered planet will have to invent different conflicts, and they work so intelligently. The film promotes its original plot theme in a unique way and it releases slowly, although it can already be predicted. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, although sometimes hard, it may be acting as late as the 60's. Especially after the creation of the plot theme itself, it can be somewhat sound and even melodramatic. Apparently, it is a scene that has seen a scene similar to the previous year's "2001: A Space ODC" and it is related to the movie. Actors acted in the 1970s for some TV shows "UFO" which are interesting to test camps and DVDs. <br /> <br /> Despite these small points, space flight is realistic, and considering this was in 1969, the scene inside the spacecraft's cockpit was a realistic look. (See also the decade of 1990/2000 video technology!) One thing: I think the love scene has been cut, but I can not prove it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am doing this film in my video library. Are happy
