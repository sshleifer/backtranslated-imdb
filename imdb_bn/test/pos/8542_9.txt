I saw this movie about 25 years ago. I would consider this film as a classical all-time drama section. Anthony Rani is one of the most wonderful performers ever. Within a few minutes, he laughing at you laughing. This movie presents a wonderful picture of how humanity changed after World War II. How that generation is a great part and impending its innocence. It took me a long time to find this image called "25th Hour". Such films are not money-making, but they are definitely a treasure for someone. I am surprised to see why this film is widely used for the media to enjoy this film.
