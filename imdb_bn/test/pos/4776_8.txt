Built in 1928 and originally named Marta, Walt Disney changed his name (his wife believed him), Mickey Mouse became the head of the Disney brand. I always believed that the cartoon was Mickey's first cartoon, it was actually his third, but it does not matter, the six-minute animated short, it's enjoyable. Mikey looks at a steamboat pilot until he is taken from Captain Peat Bridge and the Mali Mouse lost the boat. He closed his music sheet and a goat ate them, Mickey smashed him into ankles and helped to play the tune and kept other animals in an ankle, until Pitt came to stop him again, Mickey roots made potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on 100 most pop culture icons and he was number 31 on 100 best cartoons. very good!
