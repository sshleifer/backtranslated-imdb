Yesterday I saw this movie with my 20-year-old intern from my office (OK - it was cool after Thanksgiving) and we both like it. The way I am looking at the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and dog doors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Discuss where your ethnic group is a very important issue. And I love the wedding at the end. <br /> <br /> Mini driver is great - and Bonnie Hunt has to win a prize for everything. <br /> <br /> Boni - Make more movies!
