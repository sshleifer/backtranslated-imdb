'Blade' is a very top-comic comic book, Vampire-Hunter action / horror if it is not for two minor flaws. # 1 I saw all but the strange blade / snippets do not slicing her and dicing, but the whole "yes!" The fist / punch was literally a letdown. # 2 Bad, that's not awesome, CGI ?? Even for 1998 standards. It is mainly scattered throughout the last third, but nothing is in the end. Okay, despite those small infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors have done a subgenre and it is delightful considering that it seems like a rip-off of another 'matrix' that it came a year ago. So maybe 'matrix' copy 'blade' At any rate, it's a very movie for multi-lover audiences: Comic Book Gakes, Action Fantasics and Awesome / Vampire Lovers So, our blades, half-man / half-vampires, or "day-walker" and his achievements, whistler (a la "Batman and Alfred") fight against unwanted war criminals, who have apparently found the number of people around them. Who knew A rare work of humanity (our ascendant of blood) Our sword Nijja / Vamp rescues a new infected (coincidentally) blood specialist / doctor. Meanwhile, one of the pumps (as you guessed it) has been facing problems of getting the Supreme Power and in some way it requires blame. This is not the main idea, if you read what you wrote, it is still very enjoyable. If you want to see Blade want to be successful, you will be rooted for him despite his imperfection and approach. And you know that it's coming Comunic Book Presentation 1-2-3 general work in the movie. Still, see this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 "Santan lotion"? Really? What about scalp? Still not burned that? Are they burned for fuel only for weapons? Oh, all right, I'm going very deep. Again, sit back and enjoy the fun of teco-charge fun.
