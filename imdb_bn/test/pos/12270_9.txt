It was a really nice surprise. I was late last night and could not sleep. I was not really thinking twice, I was going to launch my TV and HBO, and this image is just starting. Thankfully, I saw the whole thing, and I'm very happy I did. Because this image was very good. The actors were well cast, and they did an amazingly good job. Kris Kristofferson delivered a solid performance, there was a lot of substance behind her line. This picture has helped me understand that she is a good actor. Brian Keith was as great as his father, as Tray played with Wilson's Colonel (it was the final role of T. Wilson before his seemingly impossible death.) Very bad, he was an actor and felt like a good man). Jibth Williams has done an excellent job as an American wife of Christianferson. As far as the direction is available, I did not know Franklin J. Shafa was the director until I read this review in Leonard Moulin's movie guide (this last film he ever made). Now I understand why this movie was so good. Shaphan also showed Patan a true great movie (I did not see his other great movie populin). When I was watching "welcome home", then I said to myself, "The director really knows what he is doing", did not know by the instructions of Shaffefar. A really beautiful view of a Thai orphan sanctuary, enough to bring tears to my eyes. Just this was not sensitively indicated, but it is indicated in a very profitable and taut way. There is nothing to waste in Schaffner's efforts. The script was so good because of this movie. The authors do not weigh down actors with many lines. It was very easy but very effectively written. It just shows that you can be called with a few words. This photo has made me proud of an American, as well as it shows how beautiful people are all.
