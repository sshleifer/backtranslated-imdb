In this fast food society, we are finding it difficult to find such fast food societies, since we are known to be a man called Hit, to help man find the love of a man, which he has become crazy in love. His rules are that he only helps you to find love, and only some casual sex that does not seem very good, but the word starts to spread quickly and with that he starts getting the wrong idea that makes it difficult to relate to the woman. <br /> <br /> I said, it looks really nice to see Will Smith in a movie that does not try to save the world from the world or robot. There is no jaw dropping effect and she is showing her beefed up body. He was just a normal man who was really nice in this movie. He did not extend his acting muscles in this movie, but still the story does not call for him, but likewise it was nice to see him discouraged and showed us the hijacked body that he did not jealous of six packs. Her character here seems to share almost all the characters about all of these strange love stories that are likable, malicious and very charming in all its characters. The Kevin James character is only a regular guy who helps hooking up with his dream girl, which really makes you think of the steps and the route for each person. Mandage's character was a tiring spot for me, because he was very cold and counted that Smith's side is hard to believe that Smith might fall for him. I think a challenge will make love. <br /> <br /> - We'll make a joke about the part of this review that I will never need for a hit because I am a player but I have received about 16 reviews for other web sites plus I still work on a little project So I'm now slightly jaded. The movie is packed with ample charm and favorite characters with funny lines, but it slowly falls into the ocean of particular romantic movies. After the big scene, where the mysterious secret mystery is seen, everyone gets forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey, about 4000 filmmakers have been suffering from dangers, so I do not think there is a lot of damage due to the loss of more than the other film that has happened in the end of the future. I really like the message of this movie because ultimately you do not need the formula to get the right girl, just be yourself and everything is played in the movie theme which is why it works well. Whatever Smith's character follows, James's character follows the girl, making sure I was sure that it could be a nice empty movie, but it turned out that it really works well. <br /> <br /> While predicting it is a perfect date movie. It's sweet, it's funny, and it's romantic so anyone who shows this movie on a date will get something after the end. And by some I mean sex
