RailLine Children, this long-time British character, written by Lionel Jefferies, written and directed at least this 1970 film version is an unacceptable ... classic. It tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; The feeling is muted; Childhood travel is involved in the revelation; And Jeffrey brings her production cleverness and style. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family in Edwardian London is living a strange life. The father is rich, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are loving and loving, their homes are warm and comfortable. Then one night, on the Christmas holidays, two men appeared at the door, quietly talking to father and then taking him away. At one point, the life of Mrs Watterbery (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobby, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thompets) and young Peter (Gary Warren) changed. Just going to see them through their consistency and good spirits Now, to solve poverty, Mrs. Waterbury is not too far from a small village with a train station to live in an old brick house in the village near a railway line of her children. The children were able to discover the railways and sit on a small hill regularly to look at the passengers by speeding the train. One day an old man, looking at his business in the city, looked at his newspaper and looked back at him. It is not long before she will play an important part of the story. <br /> <br /> When the time comes, Mrs. Waterbury brings her love and intelligence to her kids. He started writing stories about making money. He teaches them lessons and provides them with a home of warmth and security. The story, however, is about these three children, especially Bobby. At the age of 14, she is very old enough to share her mother's thoughts, enough young to enjoy any event she has with her sister and brother. They find a poor man at the station, who can not speak English. They discover that he is not a Russian refugee who knows where his wife and children are. They insisted that he would come home with them, and their mother would take him away. Long ago, the children wrote a big sign of the old gentleman's train for his help. They help a young man to take part in the steeplechase that breaks his legs in the train tunnel. Soon, he is recuperating in their home. They decided to make a birthday party for a station master, a man with some friends and a stiker for his dignity for a birthday. It is not long before helping children understand the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, three children face all kinds of problems during their childhood and are happy to see the happy ending of all problems. <br /> <br /> But what is their own problem? Finally Bobby learned from his mother that his father was taken because he was accused of giving Russia state confidentiality. Will Bobby be able to find a way to help? Will the old gentleman get more than just an old gentleman? Will their father's case be opened again? Will be a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny is about 18 years old when she takes part; He plays 14 years Bobby with great naturalness and charm. Important as other players, especially the mother of the story of Agna, especially as Dinah Sheridan's mother. For me, it's Genie Agutter's talent and Lionel Jeffery's style and moderation that makes this movie so memorable. The story problems do not come with any serious suspicion but they will be resolved. And Jefferies not only gives us an expertly adapted and directed movie, but he is charming, which is just noticeable which is added to the touch. These two frequencies may include only a split second as a fridge frame; Or slowly, slowly, a small, yellow wild animal in grass outside Bobby's house, then gradually turning the yellow-back from a yellow oil lamp; Or a look that a pleasing interior shots or green countryside scenes or a look at the train station from a hill ... all suddenly recall those magical Edwardian hand-painted drawings by a perfect time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this modest story can not compete for kids today to perfect their Nantendo giant-splatting skills. I am often not positive that it will not attract the attention of most of their parents, especially those who are breastfeeding in Batman and Leone. Yet, it should not be entirely kept in the movie together and forgotten. After 19 years the story was again spread as a television show. During this time, Jenny Agutter played the mother.
