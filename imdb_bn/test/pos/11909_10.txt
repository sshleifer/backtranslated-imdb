I like this movie. That's quite a lot I can tell about it. Lou Gosset did a good job, though I'm still very frustrated in the aftermath of the Iron Eagle film. Even if the first child dies (even I will not give up), then I started to laugh inside, it was done in a nice, fine fashion. Most of the movies work well, so check it out! This is another movie that I got really cheap, so I bought it, and I give the same suggestion.
