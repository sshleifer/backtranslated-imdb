I saw this movie a little more than a year ago. I've seen it 4 times I have never heard of it before and I think I know the classic movie. A true, polished, diamond rough. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around Japan's Viet (lead character "Conak"). One school First of all, students reveal that they are rarely outside the world of their island home. The heart of the movie has found inspiration to awaken their young minds. Students reward their teachers with an extraordinary skill to become interested in learning quickly, which were foreign to them shortly before. Using unusual and clever teaching techniques that can be a little fun! God forbids Learning and fun? Together? Could not be, or so saying charging. To avoid a spoiler, I would just say that the Conrack boss finds resistance with the humans .... and the end is really bittersweet. <br /> <br /> I'm 35-year-old white male with some teaching experience, so I should identify with the lead character, Pat Conroy (Ur, Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I did not, I marked with black kids. As a child, I was set up from the school on the other side of the city from 4th to 6th grade in 1979. These kids remind me of my classmates in the movie. Fortunately, in the fourth grade of 8 or 9 years old, racism does not understand. I think we were all kids, playing 4 squares, kicks, hidden and looking and running relay. <br /> <br /> This movie is very moving. From the beginning to the end, there are non-stop and delightful moments. I have seen myself with tears in my eyes many times, and then suddenly laughs loudly. This is a fun movie. <br /> <br /> "Get rid of that wind !!" .... "Sir, if you are ready to accept cone, you have to say that the rabbit has just done it on your neck" ..... "So you are a teacher in white school, Mr. Kanak, my boys love Mr. Kanak. You are a good looking teacher, you are a beautiful white man. "....." Small boat warning about 15 miles away from the wind: Small boats beware. Large boats are okay, 'nothing is bad.' ... "Cook the fries, but Alan Roosevelt is not a partner, but (some Latin) ... that Latin ... I wait! "...." Konk is singing like a frog .... I like to sing well, what do I talk about? "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It still makes me mistake that I still can not hear anything about this movie or it's a little fame or following. I have more reviews, comments, backgrounds, and more. Wanted to find "made" tidbits, they are out there, what's the action given to my wonderful kids. One of the children, Mary, I was an actress, and you can say, however, lots of other kids have la There is no real reaction and I wonder how they do it! I guess there was a specific conversation to work with Conak and Mary, when some scenes appear naturally or publicly. <br /> <br /> Conak is a special film. According to this, it is very good and one of the few movies that is unknown. The others in this category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 Ogi and with bekalera) God Be Crazy (80), and Black Rock Black Rock (55). I recommend all of them. But first, Mr. Kanker's class.
