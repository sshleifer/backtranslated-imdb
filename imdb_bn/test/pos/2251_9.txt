Excellence Holdwood looks rare today. Only two of the nominees of the year's best picture are considered to be sensible in the film industry. And 'everything is illuminated,' the mark is directly hit. <br /> <br /> The film starts its brightness with beautiful setting-the-view entry. From the beginning, you get warmth and real family connections and the feeling of relationships between each other. And also, throwing is perfectly launched. The character of Eliass Wood, Jonathan, his sensitivity was revealed by his grandfather's hand. And for Alex entitled Character, his perspective is easy to see in his life - the true Ukrainian rock star. Along with the Prothom-alo being enlightened, the story gradually makes our mind easy because Jonathan decides to go to Ukraine to decide to save his grandfather, thus the whole family will be able to do so. And from there, the stories are slowly filming, yet in a fast pace and scene-by-scenes opposite tear-dropping drama, the sunny sunshine in every scene. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself is rewarded, there are various complaints from other sources, which commented on the false adaptation of the Lave scriptor Jonathan Sapron Fowan. Personally, I do not read novels. However, the storyboard of the movie matches the storyline of the book, especially that the film should not be specially graded, rather than how the original idea of ​​the novel is expressed and exploited by the film. It is not possible to get far from the novel, this does not mean that the film should definitely be seen - it is still there. <br /> <br /> Throughout the whole movie, new information enters the mind of the audience very slowly. Some of these thoughts are not answered; And in fact, the second half of the film revisits its whole subject and makes the travel reason different through Ukraine, but it is similar to the main objectives of the film. But the film leaves you with a happy note - yet to a weak heartless soul, a tier can be dropped. And throughout the whole film. Just about Alex and John's funny and ongoing conversations, the savage people are laughing at the general sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I will recommend this film to different types of people: those who share their sharing scenes with a continuous drama-comedy, who are interested in family contact, and who are interested in holocaustic topics. And those mad people find slapstick as those humorous comedies, this movie is not for you. And for those of you who think it's a serious fun and absolutely impressive funny movie, you're wrong; This picture is a comedy moment and dramatic sequence share. And for those who judge the movie on the basis of their liking with their similar novels, you may or may not enjoy this movie, but it should take much more about whether the film is close to the book. <br /> <br> Above all, 'Everything is enlightened' is an impressive part of the work that will enlighten anyone's heart.
