Clearly, the reactions were written here and can not be taken in the context some years after the film was released. Returning to post-labor England in 1980, these pictures were bloody fun. We were happy to have a full social level sympathetic spider, sunny and ripping dump, if it was never, one of the best British season of its time. It hit almost everyone and a joke in true British fashion, we laugh at Rigsbyt among ourselves. America had nothing to touch such humor because the country's sufferings were not funny to our foreign cousins. Leonard Rossi was the best actor in England's best film, TV and movies. Her commitment and professionalism was second to none. Although Richard Bekininsl was young, he should be classified as the best of all time by the perfect comedic foil and all rights to the chemist. If he is not so young, I'm sure he is now classified as Britain's greatest comedy actor. Francis de la Tour Rising Dump has found his best television moment and for me, his role undoubtedly undoubtedly did not calculate. If you can not see the movie at the time of release, you are not eligible to comment, because you can not understand why it was funny, the humor of the moment.
