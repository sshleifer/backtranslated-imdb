I gave these nine stars instead of just 10 because I do not really allow pornography. There is an effective purpose in the pornography society (I can not always say that I always remember) but this is probably the case. <br /> <br /> To keep aside personal visions, I really believe this movie was quite funny. I bought this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I'm one of the 'Alice' Wanderers who will look at 'Alice in Wonderland'. My DVD has almost every version so it's a clear choice to complete my DVD collection with it. I must admit scandalized beyond my expectations, and the whole thing was totally obnoxious if it was not so funny. Besides, the music is really good and I love musical instruments. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can make a good punk musical. Anyone who saw 'The First Noody Musical' knew what it was like. Considering working with the low budget bill Osco, 'Alice' is remarkable as a musical instrument (it is better than some of the music made in expensive budgets). <br /> <br /> This movie can not completely cease the tragedy of indecency. . I often see the XXX version for full shock effect and scandalizing some of its scenes (we're screwalizing because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where I started masturbating Alice (Christian Doubl). It makes me feel like a vigilant. And there was a little more recipe for non-lesbian lesbian scenes with 'Alice' and cats and cats. <br /> <br /> There is humor on everything in this film. There is a special moments during Rani's orgy when an actress goes up and says, "Who is F-K to come out of this movie?" Ridiculous <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that the whole sex is good for you, tell your brain to Philosophy here, but gender does not disturb people, and humans. (I do not know if I really feel that way, but I can not resist telling it) Some people think that sex should be about everything. I do not know. Yes, just show some freak'in duties and decorations. This movie definitely scores points for sex-minded, but I do not push your luck, the next time you really can be someone gorgeous. I mean here is dealing with children's literature.
