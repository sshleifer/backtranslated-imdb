When you are thinking of a golf movie, you are thinking about Cadash, but what happens if you are close to the kids? Go to this movie! Disney uses proven to create a movie that adults and kids enjoy. Acting in this movie, in my opinion, is quite good and the main part is mostly young! This movie is very nice and unique, well-liked to see all the corners of golf. I think this film should be for some academy awards for editing or doing something like that because the full flow of the movie is a top notch. Although the end may be a bit expected, but the movie itself is good! You do not need oath, nudity or violence to make a great golf movie!
