After thinking more about this film, it is easier to dismiss it as a boy's dream. I actually got some spiritual strength from UttarPark ... .. Angels exist .... We are definitely entertained by the Angels .... Most of the time we are not even aware of it ... my spiritual life And at one stage of mental dirt, I personally needed this movie. Yes, I have written before, it talks to many people ... ...... can not wait to go to heaven ... <br /> <br /> "Being so sick of all FX and Formula stuff , I found this movie as a genuine movie.I can say that it has touched me in so many ways, I am still working on it.Fort Fork is a wonderful film, it is one that brings the mind of the viewers out of the gad, the heart. Attention is so curious to me, give attention, because you have to use your brain and heart, God has given you the story to follow. I think this is probably a little more than a person's head, but I think that people say this is the most important thing. I want to see it many more times, so I can take it all! <br /> <br /> We will have to read this movie to realize the art. <Br /> <br /> Thank you all for creating this image. "
