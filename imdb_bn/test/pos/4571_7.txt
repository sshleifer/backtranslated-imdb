This film is closely examined, it's a little sad. It is also very difficult to touch on the real problem children, who are big in the poor, functional environment. Nevertheless, it maintains its ridiculous value with the encouraging performance of Dianan Carroll and James Earl Jones. The cause of sadness is the struggle and disadvantage of the mother (Carroll), which can not really help her children, because she does not want or does not try, but because it is clear how she does not know. Remember, this is a comedy, but if you do not see it, or if you see this movie and look for humanity in characters. good picture.
