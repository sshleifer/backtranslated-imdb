I've just met my three children - 12yrs (boy), 10 years (boys) and 8 years (girls) and this film was the courage of old fashioned family work. Although the child is clearly visible in the market (I say 5 to 13) It was obvious and it is a delightful topic to find a movie as a parent, which applies a broad range of applications, although it is suitable for the whole family - especially young boys <br /> <br /> This story revolves around Ricki, with some fantastical imagination (it must have been growing in his day-to-day views Ekha may be), who was kidnapped and stolen during the theft. A flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's father is an aviation mechanic, so Ricky simply does not know the plane structure inside him, but his computer flight simulator's top-gun also. The pilot and the co-pilot have been cold due to the accidental series and no one is left to fly the plane. I do not want to give anything in the plot
