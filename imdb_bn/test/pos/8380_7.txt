Operation Scorpio (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not slip in the top gear for the last 25 minutes or so, but when it hits at the top speed, it provides some excellent martial arts visas for the audience's attention. Is that the first hour is not to say void ?? It seems comparatively complex compared to the final war festival. <br /> <br /> This plot revolves around Yuk-Su, a talented comic artist who dreams of becoming a hero? Draw her Yuk-Su rescues a young maid, Sue-Yu, who is being sold prostitution, she hates the wrath of her evil boss, W. Under the Sony-led, Kung Fu master of the cat style, Yeh-Su and Hrishikan Y, behind the maiden. Yuk-Su's father intervened but he was injured. After being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders, three of them are hiding in a Noodle restaurant owned by their friend owner Master Yacht. <br /> <br /> Euk-well cooking or noodles can learn to cook, but regularly go out and secretly build up its strength and learn Kung Fu under the teachings of the gene, who are teachers of their rescue muscle teachers. When master yachts go out of business, Yuk-Suu will be in charge of the kitchen; However, he went out to serve his skills with the gene pop out, CU-UK customers to serve. Sonny and her guys go to the restaurant and hate them by the noodles they serve, trash the restaurant. <br /> <br /> When Master Yaku is learning that Yuk-shout is crying, he tells him that he has learned Kung Fu from him; It transpires that Master Yat used to be a top Triad killer, until he decided to try and change his way. Under Master Yat's direction, Euk-su improves his skills, even to learn the art of the body of the film! Yak-su has finally announced to his friend Fatty that his maid has been sold for prostitution and has the chance to become a real hero. Together with the gene, they look at Wai Wai for the search of new women of French women. When Fatty's maid is presented to them, she accidentally beat their silver and eventually the action closes the big style. Despite his best efforts, Johnny was severely beaten by Sonny and forced to flee to Yuk-su. After returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Su has seen it; And the worst, bad boys have got Cui-Yu! Yuk su, next to Master Yath, Sue-Yu comes back to the place of effort and rescue ... <br /> <br /> In spite of some fairly entertaining training scenes, the final step in the Wa's room is to slowly build up very drawn-out And no serious battle scenery is perfect. It is a shame that instead of storing all the juicy stuff in the end, the tidium has not been broken by a decent scrap midway. <br /> <br /> The last fight is worth the wait; Jean Jean has presented a wider dropping performance, which gives strong performance as a high-fired Sony whistle, flip, and spin and chain car-folk artist-active fighter Yuk-Su with excellent ability and skill. Also, especially the old school, Kung Fu star Lu Kar-lang (AKA Liu Chia Liang) proved as a master yacht, proves that this old timer can still kick the ass! Although not a perfect film, Operation Scorpio has enough standout action in view, which guarantees to be clearly seen. <br /> <br /> Nb. I think some names might be wrong. My DVD calls characters in different names than those listed on the IMDB.
