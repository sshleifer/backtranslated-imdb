Perhaps it is mostly commented, but it has been explored ... This is probably a great composition in Spanish movies like buenullae masterpieces. "You can have 15 days with you" now and they can be "rewildings of other films" long before: "Midnight Cowboy" but "Les Amant Two Pant-Nef" or a realistic and spot-look (but most realistic) "Trainpotting". These difficult stories are the place of humor, love and of course dramatic sense. In the new social Spanish movie this little diamond can be a resurgence of the Italian Neo reality. It mixes the best Kenny Loch films. <br /> <br /> I've probably discovered the 10-year-old movie.
