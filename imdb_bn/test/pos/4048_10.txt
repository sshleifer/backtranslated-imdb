I probably saw 4 or 5 times the movie. Each time, I can go far beyond the desire of a young heart and are strongly influenced by both the faith of both Kai and Gartha that they want to fight for the faith. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is presented like this, you're just moving into the plot and before you know it, you're there. You can see ... Yes, Kai ... working hard on the mirror ... a little jump ... there's a garland, fighting for her love ... and there's Snow Queen ... <br / > <br /> It's just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, tension. <br /> <br /> This is 10 out of 10 bright
