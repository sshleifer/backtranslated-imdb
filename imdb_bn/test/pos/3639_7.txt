I know Guerrit. He is currently living in the United States, based on the events of Gerrit and Celesty Wolfert's life. This is an extraordinary story. It inspires me to read "Cree, favorite country". The film is well-produced. The music is beautiful <br /> <br /> The story is called flashyabya. You learn the stories of a white racist South African (GERIT) and a black South African (Moses). Their lives intersect the violence. The finale is not the norm of Hollywood - it's a tremendous reality and ends with a note that encourages you to think about characters and themes. <br /> <br /> See credits - you'll see Gerrit's footage in real life.
