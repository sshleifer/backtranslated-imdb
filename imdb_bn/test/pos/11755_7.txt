This movie can be very sensitive to most visitors, especially contemporary visitors. Yet I enjoyed this movie, mostly for the comedy of the world below my favorite star and the amazing beauty of Winifer Jones beneath William Holden. These two actors recovered what some of the couple's talents and talents have done in the lower hand reduction lines have some truly impressive scenes. Hong Kong's cinematography is another highlight of the film since the time of filming. Above all, better than average romantic drama, 7/10
