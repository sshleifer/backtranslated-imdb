Most of the previous films of Coen Brothers have seen I was somewhat different and I was just waiting for some time. OBW is certainly one of those things, but there is a big heart like Mississippi. It is one of the most enjoyable movies in recent, intelligent, disciplined, clever and gorgeous movies. <br /> <br /> Characters are delivered to their extraordinary shades by a group of great actors. George Clooney wins me completely with his character and character. I've seen him in three kings and his thin red line camio, now I'm a fan. Please more comedy jorge. <br /> <br /> John Tuturo and Team Blake Nelson bravely help, especially Nelson. If ever, "Simpson" is made in the movie, then it would be normal to play Claytas with Hello-Javed Yokel. I do not think there is a performance that is excellent from the whole cast. My special favorite Stephen Root, as the blind radio station man <br /> <br /> <br /> Great old time music, Clooney is a jigy-type dance which I like to learn and a feeling of South American depression era like sepia Photography Until this century I saw this make the best movie. The only error in the film is that it has often sent me soundtrack, DVD and a DVD player to send it .... It's good! <br /> <br /> <br />
