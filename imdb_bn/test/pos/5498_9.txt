Quite simply create a well, well written and wonderful acting movie. Classic as Eastwood Classic Secret Service agent Frank Harrigan and Ren Rousseau. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Standing as "booth". He <br /> <br /> This character captures the weird enough of anger and hatred, as well as his humanity. <br /> <br /> I personally think this was his best performance and it should have been a <br /> <br /> <br /> Oscar for it (but I liked Tommy Lee Jones in that same year ). Overall you want to peek into a murderer's mind, see through a great movie and on the edge of your seat through the whole <br /> <br />. Enjoy !!
