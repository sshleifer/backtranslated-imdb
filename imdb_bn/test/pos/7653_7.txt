I ended up liking this movie but it was not the easiest to get through. The movie is great and the movie makes the movie. The song is beautiful and talented by the musician. Rome did a great job to show different settings for people. <br /> <br /> However, viewers were not given enough guidance. Rome's history of human dignity was even better. Only a fraction of the spoken words are given an English subtitle. In addition, more explanations about the settings and those of them and those of them were challenged too. Explaining an explanation about the story, the dress and the music, it will help.
