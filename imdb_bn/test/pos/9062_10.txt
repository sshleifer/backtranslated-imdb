Quirky, risky, raw, honest and watch to watch. I'm not here to summarize or summarize the film. I just want to congratulate this small film with a big heart. I tip my hat to the filmmaker and cast it nice. If you want to know what happened to the film ... then see it. Michael Zies, author / director, has a very sensitive and psychological subject, including extremely compassion, humor and sympathy, conducted suicide. I see a great career ahead for Mr. Perseus. This film works. Terror is tender from the opening sequence, from the honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. We have to suspend some of our mistrust with each film, but I have found it with MAX and Grass that was easily transferred and its "guest bed" was perfectly sure. I just wish they would push something more further. Mr Persce has some surprising performances from this already talented cast to "stretch". For example, the performance of Gilimo Diaz as a shelter was violent and moving. Colossus Ralph Fairer, former Mr Olympiad, as a terrible patient ... perfect. I can go further ... this independent feature has a big budget Hollywood star power star but if you flick with this wonderful written story you forget the screen stars. Here is the real star bright screenplay. I look forward to seeing more from writer / director Michael Perseus.
