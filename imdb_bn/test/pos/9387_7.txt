Death bed: eat that bed. <br /> <br /> Judging from the title, you can guess what this movie is about. And yet there are many more (background) stories in this movie, then some suspect might suspect. <br /> <br /> So, the main plot is about the bed of man and food, but there are some concubines. I will not loot them for you, but they have a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Sorry, this movie is very moderate in acting. Although most conversations are not spoken by actors, they actually do not help improve the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> Because there are too many voices. The thoughts of the characters are also expressed watchers. Sometimes it works, sometimes it is not. <br /> <br /> effect is good. Sure, it can be better if compared to today's movies. But you should not really be; Just judge the film and do not take it seriously. You must admit that a killer bed is quite creative. If you are easily spooked, do not see this movie. You do not want to sleep again ... <br /> <br /> Death Bid: The bed is a strange horror with low budget, but I still recommend it to the fans of the horror movie. In conclusion, I can give this movie its creative story and 7 stars out of 10 for the unexpected twists here and there.
