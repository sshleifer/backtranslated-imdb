These dark film actors are really credible and well cast. The quality of the camera makes you feel that you are there, the script is intense and does not pretend. Plot is one that wants to see you a second time from the new perspective you've got to finish it. We showed this movie to a small group of patrons of the Gadsden Center for Cultural Arts. After the film, the sponsor was eager to discuss the film, and a person told me the next day that he was still "tired". Although we restrict the age of the 18-year-old film, I will look at the film with a youth team because it sets a stage for a very real illustration of a ugly situation and great conversation.
