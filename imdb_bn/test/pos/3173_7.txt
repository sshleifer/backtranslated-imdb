I have found that there are no surprises in the reviews I have seen that noticed the main points of this movie, or at least I saw it. It seems like a big homosexual fantasy, camp dress, a certain sexual tension between Arial and Prospero, and a final measure, a group of sharp sailors danced Hornpipe. In this whole process, once you use it, it provides all kinds of fantastic scenes and images. The point of view of a innocent aerlele is to drag a desperate nude sequox to execute "its soil and disgusting command", I've sometimes seen in Shakespeare's film in the dark. But at the end of the film I was tired of style and the final Hornpipe dance was not too much to accept. Yet it is an interesting explanation of the game as a whole.
