The tempest has been interpreted in different ways, from less or less traditional perspectives as related to art in the more post-modern arts of art, to disintegrate the game with colonial, feminist, gender, or deconstructing lines. Jarman's version keeps me fairly cold because I do not think what he was about. What is the underlying vision / concept / idea behind this rendering of Shakespeare? Prior critics revenge crash, do not get far more than Punk Show, but surely it does not have more? It can not be said here that there is no vision here, just to discover it was difficult. As it may be, there are still things to enjoy. Punch smell is refreshing and fun. Miranda and Jack Birkett as wonderful as Toyah Wilcox Caliban. I do not care too much about Williams as Professor ... Thinking is not enough magic. Switches in the old monastery / castle and outside (very English) world may be a bit annoying, but I guess it's deliberate. Above all, I did not expect to be attractive but most of the success (especially seeing the carvings of Jarman).
