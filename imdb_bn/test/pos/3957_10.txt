My blood favorite is a "blind spot". I discovered the concept of three unknown people who searched for a mysterious man, who loved him and betrayed in various ways. Cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as a broken heartbroken boy from Los Angeles. His journal entry, which we heard in voice-over-descriptive, works well with visuals and is quite intense. The film has a strong style. It pushed new elements like road movies and revenge-drama elements. It can play with time and perspective in ways that enjoy the terrible atmosphere of lost love. Various successes have a dream-quality and the images are associated with exciting intensities. Strange. Anxiety is uncertain Beautiful look The price is definitely worth seeing. I really want to see it again Period Check to see if I have been distributing blind spot. I can not wait to see the movie again or in the movie. <br /> <br /> David Pepe 13/08/2005 Ballona - Italy
