I've sometimes seen the best thing on TV. It was both entertaining and informative. I can see the reason for finding this site again. <br /> <br /> In light of the current understanding of history, we have to be sympathetic to Jane Leslie Grove who are responsible for nuts and Bolt's ongoing Manhattan project. Most thought in the past that he was not paranoid about security. <br /> <br /> Welding for the real life of people portrayed was outstanding. This is the first time I watched Sam Waterton as an actor. Without height, he looks much like Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The early scene that Oppenheimer's graduate is leading a class of students, especially me being playful.
