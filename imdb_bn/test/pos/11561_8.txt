All right ... this is 2005 and when you finally see this movie, you probably will claim it. But here's the thing, the platyple was brave, the exposure of the music industry was brave at that time ... and it took some time for the creation of music to promote African Americans in the same level. As the white work It is still in some cases - but in the 70's, this movie addressed some "background" which many never knew. Now we have "American Idol" - "Pop Idol" and some other things in the mind of "Record Executive" and how they think that they do not sell in some market markets that sell and are not market talent. <br /> <br> When I was young, I released the Earth's "winding path" the earth, air and fire, among which the biggest hits were: "Shining Star", "Reggens", "Yainan", Lornein "" And the title. I do not know it was a movie soundtrack ... until I went to Los Angeles and got a wonderful "Z" channel. <br /> <br /> The "Z" channel retroactively follows the image "Harvey Keitel". Yes, I have no idea Harvey Katel has given so much movies - and when I saw this, I was surprised. This film is not a dramatic form like a movie, but it is more worthy of it. This is a nice little film. More than "vanity pieces" for the earth, the air, and the fire, Harvey Kettel works as a "crack record executive" as "trying to fight with the system". There are many lessons drawn from this, and many "introverted" trade has been published. <br /> <br /> If you find this void ... it's a look.
