"Outside of Africa" ​​The stain and picture of the post-postcard was probably buried in my interest only to read Isaac Dixen. So when my brother bought me "Babes Feast" and knew it was based on Dyson's story, I did not compete with the visa. But as the title rolling, it became clear that it was no ordinary movie. Jutland (where it is set) is not Africa; The camera shots are not that cold fog invites to collect. Cold, sea banned; Heavy, gray clouds; Pale, snowy green hills - translate the difficulty faced by the director Gabriel Axel. Wriggest as Philippa Philippa! Among the outstanding capabilities of this film, that face is the most memorable. It stands like a map placed before our minister's apostolate cherished wonder; Long neglected Fjords like a shrub where his church's persistence and commitment hangs like complications escutcheons. <br /> <br /> How do I gather the point of Dinines? The world is genuinely painted for Christian dedication, when Philip is denied his only serious relative (because he is afraid that he will never measure the rules and hard work of his small religious cycle ), And he came back in search of his mistress, whom he considered to be the best chef on the continent. I also understand that Christians are contrary to worldly successes who have answered doubts and sorrow (Philipa's sister Martin reinstated the effort of a visitor baritone (Jean-Phillip Laughton, whose zinta creates a rising counterpoint of Sparky's spirits around his discovery.) To make an opera star; The title of the character leaves France and a scandalous era And two sisters, as a servant spinastara gained person seeking refuge) for the witnesses of God and His closest artist to achieve success. But it has a great effect that you do not expect from a movie about self-sacrifice, faith, and religious conviction that keeps Accidental life incompatible with the prosperity of Martin's voice and Babbett Hersent's table, which Axel has. <br /> <br /> This movie set apart from other religious movies is what its cute humor. In the memory of the death of the minister's 100th birthday, "Babes Feast", meaning the banquet - it is a beautifully arranged clash of sensors that provides comic moments through a garment of weird actors in their losses. It's just this cute comedy that enriches serious feelings while closing. Together they rarely do some sacred movies. They are a believer horribly optimistic and unexpectedly strong and courteous.
