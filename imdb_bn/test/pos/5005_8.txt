Interaction with Spike Fiston is one of those groups that must verbally obscure the audience. Do you like it or you do not Personally, I find most bits of delight, but there is something "yes?" The moment <br /> <br /> Staples like "Idiot Paparazzi" are happy to laugh, but my favorite bit is to be one of the "Hollywood Duchess". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only regular bit that usually confuses me (which is part of the point!) Spike and its authors lead to loads of load comedy time after time, so the show is never drunk. The Freestyle humor brand may not be for everyone, but it is certainly valuable. <br /> <br /> The public has been talking! We like this show and want more. Please note that I'm not allowed to speak with Spike Freesten, "Speak Fistone conversation" staff, or Fox network and affiliates in any way. It's just fun!
