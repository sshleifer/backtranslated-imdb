Whereas the flow of the river is called a "good news" about the two people fighting to "progress" and to save their own lives facing development. Apart from enjoying the film as entertaining, I learned a lot about the life of Grand New England in the late 1920's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cinematography retains the raw beauty of North Vermont and set the music.

The character of Fox seems to be the weakest in the film, but RIP Torne and Tantu Cardinal Claw in the best two performances I've seen for a long time. I was sorry that I did not congratulate him as the best actress of the year (I think the film was too small to be "a film").
