When I saw it in the theater about 20 years ago, I saw Nightbird for the first time, and when I think in my mind, that time it seemed to me that I was like today. I really can not complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as Boone's main character. I never realized why he did not have a successful career, because his early work was outstanding. As well as the chefron, Cranberg is even even better. Psychologist Dr Decker scriptures are unforgettable and steal the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley, is very good, ridiculously save for top Rodenic Sheriff. Good visual, and some shots are great. Danny Elfman gets as much score as he gets, and in his best work. The last epic was, nonstop action for about 20 minutes. Overall, Knightbrand is an extraordinary success for Clive Barker and is regarded as the darling of his movies on the front of the hello. 9/10
