Man, I think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. Everyone thinks they are critics. They comment on movie gear that they do not even know or can not think. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this picture. I was hoping it was not so frustrating. Steven has found a bad rap to give his opinion in his films, but there are reasons to see it. Even more interesting is the fact that people complain about his film, he is the worst and we do not see his films, yet we go to see his movies. They are so bad that they can comment. Who dummy? If you do not like his work, do not see it. Then you will not have to bow down on this supposedly painful incident. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie individually and you can start enjoying the movie again.
