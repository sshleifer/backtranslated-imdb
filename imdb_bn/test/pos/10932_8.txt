"Eagles Wing" is a beautiful surprise for a movie, and is interested in the viewer. The British did not know anything about it if I could not read comments from other viewers. I understand why it won a prize for cinemmatography, because it was brilliantly presented and looked fantastic on a huge theater screen. <br /> <br /> It looks much more realistic than most of the Western, how the West really won. As well as the complexity of the letters it represents. The Indian-Sam Watson character is particularly playful. He feels cruel in the devastating environment that he is, but the irony that he encounters white men and women is a remarkable honor for him. He is not friendly or sensitive to the intruders in his country, but there is a limit to the feeling of his vengeance, even when he is in power position and even revengeful harmful white people to take revenge and show sympathy to the girl. He was abducted after capturing a stage. For example, his character seems to be complicated, but he agreed with the hard land he lived and was not disappointed by the intimidation by the intruders. <br /> <br /> There was a complex link to the huge horse that he was riding on. It's funny how it manages Indians, Martin Shane has the ability to possess it and have some power for some time. "Eagle Wing" is an unusual Western, a section I'm not going to, but I really appreciate this wonderful offer, which I will rate the second as "only a man called horse".
