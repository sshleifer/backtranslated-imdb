I must say that this is the greatest movie I've ever seen. I know that it only got negative reviews on this website, but once I want to be a good person who reviews the best movie in the world. I think the movie is very funny, and everything in it is a perfect mix. When I see it, it makes me feel like all kinds of emotions, and I can not get it enough. The soundtrack is bright. I love it, I understand why people do not love me, but I do not understand how people can hate it. Cinema 100% Brightness. Amazing amazing. I never realized that the theatrical movies could be very good, and I never realized that I could see a movie, even if I was ill for many days. I think everybody will see it, whether it is a childhood life, or if you reach the end of the year, you will see what you will see 12.
