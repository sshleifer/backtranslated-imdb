"Gay Desperado" is a wonderful surprise throughout. Leo Caroline and Harold Whubber are so funny to hear in a film like today. Best line? "This is my third choice!" "Diego", perhaps an article for Kevin Smith's "Silent Bob" Lucien N. The black and white painters of Andoite (especially with the shadow of banditora) were interesting. I can say about Ida Lupino, "Thank God for DVD!" You can go to the scene where he is trying on Monday and Sepep and watching him again standing in front of his mirror. <br /> <br /> If I forget that Nino Martini man sings the true accuracy.
