I was a little skeptical of entering the movie to see the OS 1111: French joke has become so spontaneous nowadays that only the most foolish people score higher in the national box office. But I was surprised that although the humor does not always reach the level of Myth Python, many references to the French-language approach representing the Osse 117 in the 1950s were able to re-establish the style of film making. That time with a wonderful honesty. Make it short, not to mention a wonderful bit, nice performance from some secondary actors. And for at least one time, genes adhere fully to the character of Dzurdin (which can reach the nerves of many people) with his character.
