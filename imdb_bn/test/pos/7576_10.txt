Glenn Close Sarah is back as plain and tale, a woman who holds the family together with good and bad times. Fantastic acting - Christopher Walken (unusual non-wonderful) her husband is again distributing a top authentic performance. Young Christopher Bell looked good at all; Too bad we can not see anything brought (Lexy Randall, a few years old), but new additions to the Winging family (played by Emily Osment) were very good. And finally, Jack Palance, as a long lost Wing Fathers, is fine like before.
