I read the Asian comments and thought that they were watching completely different pictures! <br /> <br /> I saw this picture in the morning and was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> And Randolph Scott was quite a bit! <br /> <br /> Gabbi Hayes was even more fun! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Good guy - he is usually very thin. <br /> <br /> All, a good western, very well played and written. <br /> <br /> I liked Kansas's background stories and "winter wheat", which, in effect, helped it to be a state. <br /> <br /> I think that the girl who was beautiful playing Susan - why she could not think big!
