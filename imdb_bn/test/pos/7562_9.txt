I have not seen this movie for more than 20 years, but there has been an impact on me that I think I am sitting by credit and after a complete scary a few minutes later. This is one of the most undressed films of the whole of the decade which was originally released. I decided to copy a copy of it to the DVD and pay for the overnight arrest and can not wait for it. It is raised at times, and very dark and somewhat annoying. It's a close-knit band story of regular kids growing in the inner city, and it really means sitting on the ground instead of watching a movie screen or television. Difficult to explain, but something that will be experienced in it. The story begins in childhood and tracks the life of four main characters in high schools and they begin their separate journey of life. The whole cast did a great job and it was Jodie Th√©leen's best career. I hope the DVD lives up to my memory and this Friday is planning to see it with a good friend.
