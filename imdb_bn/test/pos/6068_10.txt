Not only is this English patient (romantic romance, tragic war, great character) but it is in such a way that there is no other movie. This is a spell-off story spoken by flashbacks, featuring a vague visual image, the characters we care about, and the most exciting love stories ever featuring amazing performance. A filmmaking landmark, the best film of 1996 and the best of the 1990s.
