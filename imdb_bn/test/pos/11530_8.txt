It is 1969 Phoebe (Camila Bell) is a 11-year-old girl, growing up with her ideological philosophy of 19-year-old sister Fit (Cameron Diaz). Faithful, truthful, all the mistakes in the world. Then one day, Phoebe and his mother Gail (Blythe Danner) believe that the belief is dead. Believes killed yourself. Both Phoebe and Gayle feel embarrassed by this news, and although Gayle expressed regret, Phoebe can not let it go. Phoebe decided to go to Europe and decided to find out what had happened. <br /> <br /> Now 1977. Foobe (Jordan Burrell) decided to move to Europe with his mother's objections for her real discovery at the age of 18. When alive, faith was inseparable from a male "unbeliever" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf did not claim to know anything about the last day of Faith, Phoeb believed him to tell him everything. Within a few days, Wolf realized that he could not go past even before, and he joined his pilgrimage in Phoebo, Portugal. Finally, Wolf was able to talk about the credibility of the abuse of narcotics. His own crime in preventing suicide. Although angry, Foobe finally realized how human and broken faith really was. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I was old enough to remember the old army bank robbery and I was 10 in 1969. This story was known to me. I still try to remind the youth that they will go to Canada or not to avoid the draft. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it probably happened several times in real life during that time. Enjoying Camila Bell's was fun and funny because he portrays a young cuddle sister excited by what happened around him. Jordan Brewer made easy slides in the old Phoebo role. Blyth Danner was the longest supporting mother, unfortunately she was very familiar with American TV. I would like to see with the powerful element to work with her. Cameron Diaz plays perfectly unknown anarchy. Although sometimes, a 1960s activist began to come off a news relay of his performance. Among all the characters it was Christopher Ilkston's Wolf, which was the biggest increase. When we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the film, we can see that he is a faithful person. He is a patient and kind man, filled with anger in the injustices of the world. Finally, the command that he feels and trusts is wrong and he "begins to grow up" in deciding to fight injustice on his own. Faith refuses to join her and ultimately leads her to death. Eccleston's Wolf is the most real of all the characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was enjoyable and excited to have thoughts. The "Invisible Circus" TV-AAA has been rated, but it has fewer exploitation, sex or violence. The reason for movie subject rating.
