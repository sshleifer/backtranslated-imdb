The Universal Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a heart-warming film for the whole family, with good quality and sensitivity. This is the story of a teenager Sandy Ricks from Shadow, who unexpectedly spent her vacation with her Uncle Porter Ricks in Bahamas. This ultimately changes the lives of thirteen and he progresses in the process. He learned to praise nature and pay tribute to the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and the NBC television show "Flipper" was my favorite childhood show. Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as a 1990's Sandy Ricks and gives an excellent performance. In the 1960s, I liked films with NBC television shows and MGM Theatrical Feature Film Luke Halpin. I feel Eliass Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. To Louis Halpin, I think Eliass Wood has a range of acting talents and more acting actor, which makes his performance nice and more credible. I think Eliash Wood is the best actor in the film. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote Screenplay and both the author and director of this photo did excellent work. Paul Hogan gives a ridiculous and preferred performance as Sandy's Uncle Porter Ricks. Mr. Hogan's performance completely stopped Eliar's role as Sandi. I am a big fan of underwater film. This image was nicely shot in Bahamas like "Thunderball" (1965 UA). Photography director was Bill Butler's ASC. Who blamed "Jaws" in 1975. Mr. Butler is a talented cinematographer. Petrowna was the director of photography water. He did a fantastic job with watering cinematography. I enjoyed film scores by Joel McNelli. These good film scores featured Crosby, Stills and Nass among other gifted artists. This motion picture was shot in pawnition-like shanberels in the Panavision-like ratio of 2.35: 1. If possible, try to see the film in the visible version as the frame and Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler's views. Another nice thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave a small part of the original "Sandy Ricks" (Look Halpin) "Redeem". She portrayed Beauty Fisherman # 3 in this movie. This part of Mr. Shapiro was very nice! As you can say I am a true fan of this film. Sadly, this beautiful film was mixed in strictly by most film critics. I originally saw this movie on my birthday, on the 31st of May 1996 in the movie theater. It meant a lot to me. I have so many video versions. VHS versions are "pan and scan". Laserdesk version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I also have a VCD of 2.35: 1 from Hong Kong which is "non-letter" But my most valuable occupation is printing a "original" 16mm theater properties which I'll treasure for the rest of my life! Thank you m Shapiro, Elias Wood, Paul Hogan, and everyone involved in creating a memorable movie for me! <br /> <br /> <br /> I must add that the quality of Universal DVD is fantastic! This is the best DVD I've ever seen, the best DVD. Colors and resolutions are spectacular. The soundtrack is great. I think for Universal LaserDesk version they will use the same transfer for that DVD. 35mm chance printing "piece" and Alan's film really has a wonderful look at it. An extraordinary film is a great tribute! DVD resolution is more than the quality of laserdisc! It's just spectacular! Thank you to Universal Home Video for great quality control and transfer. Many thanks for doing fantastic work in this wonderful family movie. Thank you so much for Alan's me for your extreme kindness !!! It is a real honor to let you know !!!
