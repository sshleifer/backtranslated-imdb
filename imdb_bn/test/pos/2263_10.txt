I first saw this movie on Alaska Airlines, and then I saw it twice more. It's simply - and simply - one of the best movies of the year. I've seen it enjoy after seeing my first, but what happened a little cloudy After seeing it again a few weeks later, things started to be moved. It was not confusing, just deep. Actually, the depth of the film can not be appreciated for a long time. For example, it happened after my third visitor that Sammy Davis Jr. (Dada's dog) was more than just a pet dog - perhaps he stood on behalf of his dead wife. Witness how he fiercely protected him. There is a lot of symbolism, and none of which is unfortunate or helpless, just real. The adventures of their travels keep a storyline on a perpetual motion and even when they reach you are still not sure if this is really a destination. The film continues, so does the adventure and I understood that the destination was just a point of view. Sound track fun, scenery compulsory - and both decisive pre-blocks. I can go and go deeper into the film, but I am not completely sure that I have yet discovered all the information. Plus, it's more fun to combine itself. Since any film can be, "Everything is enlightened", it is like a beautiful wine, which is sweet with time. I highly recommend to see it - twice.
