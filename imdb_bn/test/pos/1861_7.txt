Real life husband and wife Paul Betney and Jennifer Connelly Creation in Creation, which in 1852 mentioned Charles Darwin's life time before being published "about the source of the species", his infamous, world-changing tomato in evolution and natural selection. Due to Darwin's research, there was a great barrier between his day and the scientists. He said while fighting God, even to "kill God". <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is as nice as her extremely devout and loving wife. A publisher in the beginning will follow the scene when he leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles fails to say "Amen" and the enormous difference between the two. He is convinced that his eternal enmity and rejecting God will bring misery to his family. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Darwin has exploded in his strong love for his wife, his faith, and even strong reasons. The beautiful moments of observing his creatures, separating their behavior and creating their life, which describes their children, the first born, the events of Anne, maintains a very serious curiosity. We interacted with him in England's first Aurangutan, Jenny, as the child was playing, to show every aspect and work. <br /> <br /> Anne, the eldest son, died later and Charles was afraid of his death, he was closest to him. In my opinion this section is very long, bizarre and painted. I do not like the trance scene where I seem to be losing his mind and his daughter is screamed by ghosts, screaming and ranting. Although Charles thinks that his wife blames him for a fatal illness, he still says a poet: "Actually, if I knew, now I know that I will marry you tomorrow". Their bonds are difficult and disobedient despite the tremendous differences of faith. <br /> <br /> When Charles finished his manuscript, he put his wife in the final copy, saying that she could burn her if she did not agree. He would eventually read the night and finally presented him with a package, ready to send the book to the publisher. Finally, because of the reason and perhaps love, win, because he has shown a colleague of his Stanchester opponent. It is very interesting that Darwin has received a full-fledged grave in Westminster Abbey, proving that his land-poor ideas were shown to be controversial, but it was already recognized as a very important knowledge for mankind's progress. <br /> <br /> The picture certainly attracts Darwin's family life, his joy and his troubles greatly. I went to choose this aspect but Fabio said that it was like watching a documentary, I quote, "Hitler's passion for ping-pong" It's true in some cases and I wanted to know more about Charles Darwin's theory from this movie. I do not agree with his wish. It remains a well executed drama and shameless acting drama. <br /> <br /> My ratings: 7 Fabio's: 7 Total score: 14
