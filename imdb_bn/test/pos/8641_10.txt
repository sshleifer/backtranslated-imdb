Spiller Alert - Although it's almost impossible to completely explain a plot <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Lynch's enthusiasts know that his style and attitude have been uniquely combined with film noir, horror films, spirituality and parasychology ?? With a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black laugh for good measurement. All these elements work on 'Mulholland Drive' for a lot of writing, hair-raising, and highly satisfying film experience? Especially if trying to fit all the pieces of the plot logical, mysterious-confusing groups can not be too dark. <br /> <br /> This movie contains Naomi Watts and Laura Harring's extraordinary performance. Young women whose life spreads through different ways in the setting of Hollywood, which is a confusing mix of contemporary reality, reversal of '50 nostalgia and satirical self-enrichment. Their seemingly random primary meeting was followed by the opening scene of the film, among which Harring's character does not refer to one of his life's unfortunate, terrible, automobile accidents. Staggering down the hill to Sunset Boulevard (the most archetypal of Hollywood's two thoroughfares) from Mulholland Drive, she started a new movie which finds her way around her apartment about sublet belt (knock-downs) from her Aunt Ruth, which is a successful successful actress Is closed. We later came to know that Betty herself came from the Deep River in Ontario, after winning herself a Jitterbag contest. <br /> <br /> In the contest, a highly energetic and stylized flashback form a form of two pre-credit tempting sequences, from the Cleveland, the bright eye of Betie's heralded boyfriend is the silly insanity of frustration lovers and the bit-part actress. Unable to remember his name, the character of the character took the name 'Rita' from the silent classic 'Gilda' poster, which decorated Anant Rath's apartment. (In fact, it has been going on for a long time since the death of Anth Roth, and whose apartment we are actually a good question to solve in a good prediction.) However, Betty Rita has helped to discover what has happened and discover its source, cash rolls and a mysterious blue What is that women find in Rita's purse? The two women started to grasp the details together that could be Rita's true identity. They also become lover, distorting an incentive chemistry that I can not think of homosexual treatments as the mainstream treatment (if any lint film can sometimes be named 'mainstream'). <br /> <br /> The ritter's attention is caught by reading a waiter's name-tag reading 'Diane' reading on the local Winkies restaurant (its recurring realistic face-to-face like a repeat position). As a result, he took the name of 'Dainne Selvin', whose apartment is soon traveling between Beti and two women. I will not reveal what I find among them, but the scenery is enough to be presented with the liquor lingian tragedy. Then, Rita wakes up at night in Spanish and wanders the belt in an allround magic show / theater called 'Silenceo', where the mentality of illusions and lip / instrument-coordination industry and blue-headed lady is practiced, the last credit is mentioned , Reign as the presiding mind. Blue-light, made by a red-screened silencio theater, blue-haired lady occupies the last shot of the film, possibly a symbol for the imaginative artistic imagination ?? Rather Steven's "blue guitar man" was filtered through bad-drug drugillism. <br /> <br /> During Silicio's continuation and Rebecca del Rio Camio transformed lips and lips into his own strong Spanish to weep on Orbisan. '), When an isolated epiphany occurs, when Betty discovers a blue box with a keyhole open on her own purse that clearly matches Rita's purse key. Even if we do not read the parade of Freudian sex symbolism very deep, but the moment is Hacachion, which is what matches the box and it completely distorts what we knew and we have a whole new set of character relationships and money. At least it is not discovered that Betty is for Diane Selvin and the fussy girlfriend of Camilla Roads (i.e. Rita). Camila is instead a Latin femme fatale film star, whose diane she managed to securely owed her some minor roles and is more significant, with which she is emotionally subjugated. <br /> <br /> After this and other discovery, the first two-thirds of the movie's accounting problem on the third floor of the movie is not resolved directly as 'Vertigo'. Although bits and pieces of imagery and dialogue indicate that if the previous elements are exposed to Diane's very subconscious and moved, then other bits and pieces offer a cast supernatural intervention that could direct inspiration. Michael J. Twin Peaks, along with Anderson, rebuilds his unclear leftfreight power and a bob-variant, hanging behind the wings and the final box for blue box and its ID-like associations. <br /> <br /> One piece fits together, though, 'Mulholland Drive' is a whole lot more ?? And more mysterious ?? Its part is more than the sum total. Lynch takes us to a wonderful inventive, provocative, and pleasurably annoying mind trip. What's more, movie cinematography is stunning, musical filling soundtrack, superb acting, and guidance / editing skills. This was probably the best picture of 2001 in the United States of America's main Liberation War.
