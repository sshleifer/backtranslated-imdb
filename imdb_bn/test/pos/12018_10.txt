In any of these movies, for any reason, just clicked with me. It's about everything right. Eric Roberts Lechanic, excellent investigator, his voiceover description, twist plot, Dan Hedge and Dennis Lipscomb have a good introduction, settings, artists studio scenes in pictures, last credit sequence and wonderful hunting theme music that perfectly embodies the whole picture. If I have a reservation, it's a girls' catapult for Beverly D'Angelo, but she nicely plays her final scene. I think the director Matthew Chapman is trying to think of 'Chinatown' for the whole thing. It did not work. But as a murder-mystery it is a jewel.
