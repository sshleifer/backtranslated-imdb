I can even think of what this picture is even dedicated to. When I was a teenager, I felt (now 37 years old). From mid to mid-80's, I started watching this as a late night movie, and I have been with me for a long time. Seeing other comments, I was not shown in the theater that anyone else had no idea that it even existed. I do not think I mentioned this movie to anyone else. <br /> <br /> But after half a lifetime, I still saw a lot of movie which I have seen lately long ago. I think the innocence of the features, their situation, their mutual affection for a long time, left the long-term mark due to the fact that I do not fully understand. Maybe I saw it when I was a teenager, and it touched me like that ... I do not really know! I also want to know what is going to happen after the end of the movie. Oh, sorry! <br /> <br /> I have never seen it before, or, but I love it. I keep a casual look for it, but I doubt it will be shown now and it seems to have faded into redemption. But if I see it, I miss it even in the TV directory. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> reviews here renew my interest. If someone can know about his availability in Australia, then email me everything and let me know. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Shan Buri ... you look nice to see a look on the comments here. I watched your movie history and noticed your last appearance in James Bond. What are you up to this day Oh, and do you have a picture? Cheers !!!
