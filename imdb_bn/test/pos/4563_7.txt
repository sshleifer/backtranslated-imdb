Honors for the Happiness Honors, based on the fifth edition of the TV series focused on the British Army Rifleman during the Napoleonic War and based on Bernard Kornwal's books (which I strongly recommend reading). Although you want to start by showing this particular one, you can get the idea that Sharp is not so much the army force that the other army forces roam around. In that case, I suggest starting with the previous chapters, such as Sharp's Eagle or Sharpe's company, but it is a suitable choice for the second visit. <br /> <br /> This story is about spying something. The French army retreat by separating from Spain, Major Dukos, the thin spy master, allows the situation to rotate. The brutal British / Spanish alliance will break through killing British Marx Richard Sharpe, the British army's hero, and things will revolve again. Although the Spanish nobles come to Wellington to cry for Sherpa's blood, the English general fakes his death less than willing to hanging his best soldier and soon, he's out to find a masterminded conspiracy who has closed a secret mission behind the enemy line. Surprisingly enough for a Sharp film, there will be a fantastic woman recovered along the way, that is fancy. <br /> <br /> This is what is more an adventure style approach. Reduces the density of the English army with Shapera and concentrates on his escape in the rural areas, pushing the French Patrols, being cruel to the Spanish guerrillas and escaping boldly from the strong military position. Sergent Harper, his loyal right hand man naturally accompanies him, but the rest remain in the rifle camp, without knowing their leaders, they are still alive. Strangely enough, although they get more attention than usual, like the air in their own mistress engaged in the delivery of Harper's child. <br /> <br /> This slightly different method creates a playful episode but it's just a good thing. In the long run. And nobody will be worried that there will not be a standard war in Climax, because again poor old French could kick. In addition, Obcity Hakeswill makes an extraordinary succession as bad guy loves to hate you. He is a female dog-like, harmful and absolutely bad boy, and ridiculously riders of the Lost Ark reminded the black guy. Elsewhere, Hogman has got the chance to get most of the print time and opportunity. Comes to the person you want to pay for your first birthday, even if he looks like a member of Iron Maiden, who accidentally wanders behind time. <br /> <br /> Powerful section of Sharpe series. Sharp has always been heroic, but in the earlier films, these shows are so bitter and angry at this time. This is not one of the best presentations if you do not see any other chapter, but it shows an aspect of Sharp that we can not usually give evidence: Action hero instead of a professional soldier. And if it is not enough to tempt you, then it is valuable to look at the visual aspect rather than the harmful shuning business involving a live chicken in the nan group.
