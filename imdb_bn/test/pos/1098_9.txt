This video store was a random rental. But I was impressed from the beginning. A mini feature of a second feature by an attractive director of wooden cameras. The film captures deeply insightful moments and most frustrating and complex social interactions of young foreign friends will have experience in a modern post-alphabet South Africa. Young actors are quite good and well guided in their approach to original elements and dialogue is natural and interesting. This film provides a frame by studying deep compromise and achievement frame if it does not fall into strong prosperity and fulfillment. The musical score of the film adds body to the film without compressor. After watching this second time, I tracked the DVD in Amazon and I was happy since then.
