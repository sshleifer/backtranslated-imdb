I heard about this picture that it was only slow. Although, probably this point. The two characters are unforgivingly and generating anxiety concerns in the slow-motion conflict between them. Complicated and subtle gestures and short dialogue pulls at a point where otherwise the normal logic shocks the viewer. Spectacular, visible spectacular, and intriguing in Istanbul and on the coast are thrilling - "Do not you see, the hero still flew another car and now he is flying with his motorcycle" I saw the characters move between each other's noise and fog engulf in Istanbul as I was cold below my spine.
