Italian work day requires lighting and no experience is required. This is a great matinee and a good afternoon movie. The plot is good, but the actual game of the plot is very simple and requires a thought process. It is an easy motive to defeat the "bad guy" operated by car driving, explosion and Edward Norton. For Norton, it seems that he has been instrumental in portraying characters in his earlier films such as "The Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charles Theron deserve good scripts. Warning: If you've seen the trailer you saw the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at cheap prices you need Italian jobs.
