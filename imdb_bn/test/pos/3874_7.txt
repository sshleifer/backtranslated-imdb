"Back in the Day" is a fun, but flawless effort. Ja Rule is a honest but sad man trying to deal with the death of his father, as big as Reggie Cooper. He met his old friend Joe-sister (Wing Rams) who tried to force the regee to commit crime. Reggae is also the daughter of Elka (Tatyana Ali) boyfriend who falls in love. Now he has to choose: love or crime. <br /> <br /> JA Roule is doing a decent job like Regi. At least he is trying to work. Ving Rhames J. is perfect as bone. He brings lots of strength and hazard in the role. Joe Mortton as a preacher is his usual excellent self, but he does not do much. Zycarlo Esposito is also the same problem as Regi's father. She needs more screen time. I do not want to say it, but Pam Greyer is pretty scary as Mrs. Cooper. She overacts every scene and brings down the movie. Tia Carrera and Frank Langela are in it, but nothing is done for the plot. <br /> <br /> The end: You'll see it for the skillful performance of Wing Rams and Joe Morton and its intensity, writing and directions.
