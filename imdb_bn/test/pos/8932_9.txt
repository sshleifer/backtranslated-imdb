I saw this movie on Sunday evening and I must say that there is no way to end on the weekend. I offer this film completely satisfied with humor and warm charm. It just leaves me beautiful mood Viewing this movie means having a great time and a warm feeling. <br /> <br /> This movie provides intense black British humor and feels very fresh to me. You really enjoy stories and characters. Brenda Blethyn is so great. I do not know exactly why. She is very old to be loved for me and my mother is very young. But when he shows up in the movie, I feel comfortable. <br /> <br /> Some might say that the story is thin and expected. But who? There must be only a happy ending, dance in the sun! Characters are cut out or stereotypes? I do not know - I do not like! I just loved them and enjoyed seeing them. <br /> <br /> I must say that I usually do not like romantic comedy. But this one is outstanding: a dark comedy with the heart of gold !!
