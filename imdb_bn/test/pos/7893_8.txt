If Archie Bunker is armed, he may be "Joe". However, there were fewer than "all in the family" because the censors did not allow it to run along the line of the film. Joe is a working class guy who is a racist and intelligent, and has a big face, especially when he is drunk One night he met a man at the bar, Bill, who after drinking his daughter's junky boyfriend seriously, drinks to calm her nervous nerves, and she releases this slip to Joe. Bill's daughter was living with junkie, and she went to the hospital after a lot of extra time, and she goes to the apartment to collect her belongings, but she does not expect that she will actually go in a lover, who comes fresh from a big drug deal. The struggle that takes place, the boyfriend is killed suddenly and nobody wants to know the bill, of course. But he let Joke slip, and then when newspapers and TV reports came out, Joe saw him, put 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man was a hero in his eyes. He is hooked up with him and Bill is certainly concerned that Joe is going to blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to hang out with her. Which, often, almost bad. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic there, and returns home, and incidentally saw what happened and later and most of the films enter "underground" to try Joe and Bill to find "underground". Her It creates a rather awkward end, which was completely unexpected to me and according to your point of view, only the right note or the wrong note was finished. In the early 70's, a different aspect from the perspective of the fun class, which comes from most of the perspective of the workers, which is not for everyone, but it is not a bad film and it is a modest watch. 10 out 8
