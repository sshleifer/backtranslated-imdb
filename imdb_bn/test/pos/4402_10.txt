Coen Brothers or George Clooney is not a fan, whoever sees the suspicions brought in the theater. Again, some of the Hollywood people dare to create something different. At this time, Janee (for a temporary lack of a good word) Coen is one of the greatest works in literary history "doing his things". Who thinks Homer remembered this? I do not know how this movie is going to fit in Hollywood's history books, but it will be in my DVD and VHS library. This is a movie that you can watch. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a few Gumpesk fame, Brus, Cluny, Tarturo, Nelson and a short but ridiculous Hunter's wonderful performance. Born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I want more people to have a little fun like us. They even call a soundtrack fitting for rural south. If you are not doing something like this weekend, go see this movie! <br /> <br />
