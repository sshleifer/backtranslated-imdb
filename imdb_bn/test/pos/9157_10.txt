Hey, you're not alone! Remember Nicholas! It was when I was only 17. I think James Garner was the best actor and Nicholas was such a great show. I could not believe that there was so little time, I could remember the last episode, probably I could not see it ... there was no VCR behind it, so when it was you saw it and if you returned it a summer reruns Missed an episode it has gone forever until it came. However, it will be great after coming out of the DVD, but I do not think many people know about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
