I wanted to get an internal look inside, to see this show. This is Robin Williams, then more about Murray and Mindy's story. Still, it was great. We can see, Robin always 'on', no matter what. The performance of Dantopoulos was remarkable. <br /> <br /> The role of the main players is very real to me. Like Gary Marshall, Roebuck was nice. She was so charming in this, which helped me get through the power of Williams. The scenes of his other shows (Happy Day, and Lorraine and Sheryl) were a bit luminous behind the scenes. I thought Richmond-Pack was a wonderful rock in Harvey's pond. (This is a good thing). <br /> <br /> This movie is about the story of the age of Hollywood people, going through the stairs and the edge of the stardom. It made me glueoid on my TV, and I learned to love Robin, most of them all seem to be super people that I sometimes think of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder why the network men always played for idiots. We never saw ABC's head Just listening to him, like Charlie Angels to Charlie (I wonder how designed this?). It seems very sad that a show number 1 can be destroyed by their own network. <br /> <br /> I think this story can climb up the ladder of somebody's life. Movies, and TVs are always loved or hated by many people, that they always want to reach back in the past, remembering your favorite past. I remember seeing the show, and I am always wondering what is happening in their personal lives. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy will always be my part, and I found their part. It can not be true at all, it is also not false, but ultimately, it tells me a wonderful, sad, happy story.
