Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he cuts loose and puts the drama next to his madrassa system. He managed to keep Barry Levinson's normal restraining pensing alive, and when he really shines at the moment of this movie, "Man of the Year" Williams and his Disapproval to be associated with What makes him so obnoxious is his humanity and likability. Here is a man who can impose on his audience but really loves them. Her humor is like a garbage cable, and it's still cathartic. It makes him very attractive to people in this movie and in real life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actor, but I think he has been boxed in a stereotype and, unfortunately, in this case a less-recognized performer was more interesting. Walking on a walk walk walks around.
