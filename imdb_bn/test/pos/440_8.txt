Although it does not appear to be very committed for a long stretch, Reno's French Cancun has ended as an enduring charming film. The story is Clich: Laundry girl, Nini (Francoz Anarl), a nightclub owner, was discovered by Danlard (Gene Gabin). Danglard steals him from his unemployed boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend, both of them come back for their ex-lovers. Nikki has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with unemployed, go with her employer, oh, or become a princess, because a prince is in love with her at one point. I am very happy that the film could not go for the most obvious choice because there must be a lesser movie. The film ended with the opening of the Dongarad's new night club, Moulin Rouge, and a few excellent songs and dance numbers. The first of them, "Coolant de la Bauti," which provides the basis for most of the film's score, is the only one of the most glorious songs written, and Renoir himself wrote it. If you were in Buzz Lurmerman's 2001 movie Moulin Rouge! It's a fan but you can recognize the tune, because it comes at the beginning of the song Rupen Weinwer at the beginning. Although it is not very prominent in the film, everyone knows that soundtrack likes it. In addition to one of the most lovely songs ever written, the French Cancan also boasts one of the most prominent leaders of screen grave It is not difficult to move the head over the love for the girl. 8/10.
