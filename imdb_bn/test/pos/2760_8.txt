Graphically, this is just like the first game and the game has been added for some interesting fun. <br /> <br /> PS1 version still has a problem by providing enough air for some ground tactics. Dreamcast version is rarely seen, it was the best version of 4 editions (Xbox finally came in 5x with version 2x), it had clear solutions and scatters looked better and could handle PS1 and N64 in more detail. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What I like about the first two games, they do not graphically improve these games, they only focus on level lengths which are cool <br /> <br /> Overall, the same as the first, and the good value of the game.
