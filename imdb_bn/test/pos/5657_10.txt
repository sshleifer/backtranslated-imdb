I saw it one of the most anti-traditional fight movies about. Instead of ordinary movies, the majesty and perhaps the most humorous characters (like John Wein), the film emphasizes on the contrary - human-humanization that happens in war instead. This story is concerned about the Japanese who were leaked to the Philippines in late 1944, after returning to America in early 1942. While the film started, the Japanese did boast clearly, but Bushdo could not consider himself because of the insane argument. Surrender. At many critical moments, at the beginning of the film, the doctor is said to be the main character to report in hospital due to his TB being unable to fight. The problem is that the hospital will not accept him, so his commander has asked him to go back to the hospital - and if he does not accept him, he has to blow up with grenade! Well, this happens within the first five minutes of the movie - this soldier and some miracles can happen because they will not surrender. There is also a case in the film where a soldier tried to surrender but was shot dead. This war happened a lot later because often the surrendered Japanese soldiers were trapped themselves when they came closer. In addition to this, the film shows a crazy picture of a movie that is starving and a movie I have seen. In addition, cannibalism, ugliness and betrayal, along with this very diverse, realistic and depressing realistic film. You simply can not make such a good film. Awesome but great.
