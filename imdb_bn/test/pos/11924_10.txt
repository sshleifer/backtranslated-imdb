I liked this movie because I saw it in the theater in 1991. Then I was 12 years old and Will Wheaton was my favorite actor and teenage crush. I'm 23 now and I still love this movie. The best part about this is that I love the person I'm dating because it's a total of the Machi-guy movie! It is worked with enough action and decay to keep men with glue the smallest attention spans on the screen. I just wish that the DVD is available!
