This festival is still the biggest surprise of the festival and the festival is dedicated without any doubt. After learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire The Foursenden, I went without any expectations in this film. And I'm pleasantly surprised. The film star Laurie has passed a husband as a young mother in Informed Fame. He will take his two daughters to a mine near an old family in the hill, which is also in the graveyard for more children during the day. For them, vulnerable children take vengeance and ate everyone in their path. The film works many levels. This is good, suspicious, especially in comparison with computography and especially computational performance. The atmosphere is still slightly terrifying, malicious, and decent makeup effects terrible and straightforward. The film holds a strange and unbearable voice and the children themselves with pale skin, lips break lips and lips are terrible and irrational. The film is original and innovative without artists or complex ones. I can not publish this film a little bit and without a slight fine tuning. However, they must have a good product in their hands and some types of theatrical distribution should be followed. But in the theater I saw it was terrible. The word was terribly upgraded, which I moved away from the movie and it stopped in the middle because they could not center it on the screen, which bit the mood slightly. Although it was the most satisfying of Horfoffs entries, it was the lowest expectation, but it was also a host of additions to successive films.
