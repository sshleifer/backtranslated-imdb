I was very happy that this movie was too much of an incognito-seriously different movie without the supposed depth of it. The race was a matter, yes, but the class was ... and loyalty ... and honesty, etc. <br /> <br /> I also like the idea that the love relationship is simply the appearance of the character of 'decor'. Our divorce is not court (both parties on the Atlantic, I daresay!) Have seen enough couples who are looking 'good' Together 'Is it all difficult to get married? In any case, the softness and intensity of both characters was thick enough to cut in scenes which was a sunny day for a day-to-day! In other words, a light hearty movie that is not light weight!
