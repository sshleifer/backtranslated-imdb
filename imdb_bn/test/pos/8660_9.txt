What was this a great movie? Is it heaven Hell? Or something in between? I disagree with many reviews of this movie that it is a screenplay of hell It is not even clear if the opening scene starts or ends in the flashback. Moreover, it is not clear that the main character goes to hell, but perhaps a bit of it. The hell I read in the IMDB, but I expressly disagree. Consider that possibly better suicidal people can not be condemned to hell ... this is the only religious beliefs. It's actually a think-tank, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of movie. Of course it is worth!
