This is a great movie, must of course. I really like every aspect of it, sword fighting, romance, clothing is really well done and put together. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. I like the mystery and magic. Also love energy messages, that love has the greatest power. I really like the heart of the king that he wants peace and blood instead of peace. I hope I can live in the sky on the earth like flying ships. I also think that it was really nice how they brought animals to this movie. I thought the cooking was really fun. I saw it many times in a day and still it does not tire. Just like they want to get onto a DVD.
