The blade is a dark, depressing, but significant vampire movie and one of the best. Gore a bit, but really that's not anything bad. Wesley snipes play a strong role as she eliminates vampires. Not really like buffy because it's very embarrassing but the blade provides a decent plot and it's a movie that you probably want to see in a dark stormy night .... which are good to see! <br /> <br /> 87%
