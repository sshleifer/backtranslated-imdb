I agree with the messages that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a sophomore at the high school in SUM SC. I immediately fell in love with the book and I waited waiting for a short series release. As much as I liked the movie and thought it was great, I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mini series and book. In 1988, I agreed to meet John Jackson at a closing ceremony in the USC. I'm around later and see Jeakes. Unfortunately, I did not ask him a question. But meeting him had considerable respect. I majored in accounting but South Studies got me a minor. In addition, I did a lot of pattern after Ory Mune. And I'm very similar. I think my birth was 150 years too late. I'm a gentleman and very proud about this. <br /> <br /> I love two women in the movie .... Jenny Francis and Wondley Kilbourne Man, I have hot for Wendy !!!! I could not quite find her a real life version. I hope a lot !!!
