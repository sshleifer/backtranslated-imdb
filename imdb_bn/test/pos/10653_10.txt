The film touches the viewer's spirit very much, the scene of the film comes out in the final and tears automatically, I am surprised to see this movie that any director can manage this kind of film in 1925. I can say in the film that this movie helps to understand the use of Montage. The first time when our teacher told us about this movie, we understand the genre of this movie, there is nothing to understand in this movie, but finally when Sir explained, we came to know how wonderful it is to see the movie. I can say that it helps in understanding many of the movies. And as a movie student, viewers can see this movie.
