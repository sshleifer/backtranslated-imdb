I loved it slightly more than terror by knight, although it is probably not enough to give extra *. The start is just brilliant, as we have planned to show new hand bombs on Nazi agents and invent them in small Swiss villages, only plundering by an incognito Homes that scientists are returning to London. Once there, he can do everything to keep the scientist down from human beings - not Hitler, rather bad: Arch-Aries of Homs, Murrayi. Of course, the scientists disappear, leaving a tangled coded note, and again doing Homes pursuit in disguise. Moriarty's dockside layer is sensible suited to a climax, and we can all assume that all of the ends, can we? A little above the patriotic message as the credit roll. Now I think, despite the clear set of space, the fine feeling of the place, the use of the incision of the rathlon, and the plot which has decreased gradually within one hour - has got extra hacks * and my favorite. I saw that 5 Rothbone / Bruce films <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> "50 Sweet Classics" part of the match between cricketer watched the DVD. The transfer to these El Sasto box sets is very low quality, but fans of Homs believe that Rothbone / Bruce movies (this set has 4) are all dense and rational sharp.
