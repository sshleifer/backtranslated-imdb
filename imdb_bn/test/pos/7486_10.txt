This movie is excellent. Because it's not something special or new, but it's consistently great because it's all part of it. There is no part of "Ground Breaking" or "Stella", but all the parts are medium-to-high and it makes me a nice movie. <br /> <br /> I have several copies of this movie, and it can achieve in Collector's DVD or Blu-ray, one day (due to the high Blu-ray price now closed, and obviously the face that my blue- Ray player ... but this is the point of this review next to it). <br /> <br /> It closes in a general way, but quickly becomes a sensational drama, some steps, strongly illustrates the characters and a good plot that you do not want to end up with. <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it does not start normally. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> tarts Movie WISHES It Could Be. With an effort to buy coffee and donut ... very, very wrong. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, nothing seems to be missing, and some people have died, and few people are very rich. I will not tell you ... watch and enjoy! Overall rating: 10/10, a **, nice!
