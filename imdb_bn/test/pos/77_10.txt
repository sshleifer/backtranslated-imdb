July Andrews played a German spy, who fell in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson, while Germany's appointment time. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. There are two good pairs. Julie shows this film more generally than the normal girl's role in acting. <br /> <br /> Semi-German, semi-English girl who sings beautiful songs and entertained WWII soldiers, Julie sang some loving manchini. <br /> <br /> I like the pictures. Some would say it's "chick-flick", but what's so? It's nice <br /> <br /> Supporting letters are somewhat stereotyped. It can not be a pillow talk, magisterial observation, or giant rock's performance. <br /> <br /> The film is shot in Black Edwards Ireland and the real WW I-Type planes are used in movies. The view of England and France is absolutely fantastic.
