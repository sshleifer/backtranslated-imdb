In short, the story is thin and you can see the end of a mile away, but Jean Kelly, Rita Hareth and an impossible young Phil Silver always keep the film and occasionally take it directly into the air. A few of the songs are considered terrible clunkers ("Puna John" a train debris) but most of them are believed to be great scenes of fun, and the scene to perform on the huge set of heirlooms Kelly's rival for Kelly's rival. Another treatment is the perfect faux-nyc set in the best Hollywood tradition. <br /> <br /> Another attraction, if you consider such attractions, then there is a terrible male "talent" to women. Lubrication and transparent adaptation that is returned for male charm (in the film, at least at least) is presented here in its most laryd form. Men like some cartoon wolves <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A little frustration is that Eve Ereden was trapped in the role that she had rarely done anything . I can imagine a possible comic interplay between him and Silver - a missed opportunity.
