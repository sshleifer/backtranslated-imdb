I would consider myself a fan of Dan Quotes; I read several novels and liked them all, but unfortunately I almost never read the watch, instead of comparing the book that I did not have to do, instead of rating this image on its own qualities, I had no choice but to leave. Read. I went in hopes of something awful this, and when I did not get a fantastic horror film; I believe that this book is rated by fans because it is a film of their own rights, watchers are a fun and somewhat original little horror movie. The plot has some impact on spreaders and starts with an explosion in the research lab. Before a ranger died in the hands of some weird animals and the lover of the daughter of the dead was caught by a very intelligent Ranu dog. With the incident of murder, the secret government agency is running the case. The boy is fascinated by the intelligence of the dog, but it is related to the killing, and this is why the company is in its tail very soon. <br /> <br /> The script of this film was originally written by Paul Haggice, who later denied it. I do not know why? Like the 2004 hit crash, writing here is not funny! However, the main reason for this film is undoubtedly the dog, which is rather kept away from the intelligent, the best actor of the film. Corrie Heim, the success of The Lost Boys' success is humanitarian leadership and actually chemistry is better with the dog, though it seems ridiculous that it talks to her in most cases with her film. The plot is rather dull and such a little bit of film is more dirty; But it's ridiculousness pulls it through during all the awkward moments. Michael Ironside is also seen in the film and the official agents 'bad police' as well as well. The giant is, of course, one of the most interesting things about the film, and how often it is killing people is always entertaining and intelligent; Unfortunately we can not see much of it and when it is frustrating - then the filmmakers have already seen Bigfoot and Henderson! Yet, it is such a movie that can be easily enjoyed despite numerous problems and I would recommend the horrific viewers of the decade of the eighties.
