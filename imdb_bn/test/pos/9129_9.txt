Like the Riffef, the most attractive scene in the film is the perfect silence of the Jewel Hijst. The scene is executed by him, every robber has the skills to work for his own work, everyone successfully combines their own unique talent and one month before, the strangers are completely successful. <br /> <br /> The scenes play very slowly. In fact, the early scene played a long character role in both Corey and Vogel, as we see Corrie is released from prison and Vogel escaped to jail. In the interior of the Korean automobile trunk, two characters are gathered together on the street in the diner by fate. From this unlikely break, two unknowns agree to be a partner for the perfect and precise jewelry hijst. <br /> <br /> However, in order to drag the hijst, they must include the help of Jansen named third person. Jansen is hired as a shot shot gun shot. His inclusion in the mix was an interesting and great choice. During his career, Jansen was in full battle with DT, and most of his days floated over the canyons, snakes and spiders. William S. His transformation from Burroughs's unclear and sculpted world was firmly handled and in a dream of a cool sharp shooter, a very fast and perhaps the only true moment, but it is my favorite. <Br /> <br /> Another silent case was the police inspector. Occasionally, he thinks it is bright on the right people to collect powerful surgeries and information and wait for his fledged captive to take his step. At other times, he appeared 10 years before his retirement, especially during the escape of Vogel's forest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br <> At the beginning of the film, the police are moving fast through the city, we see the first image is the red stop light. My first thought was that it could be a 'red circle' and if I could find a deep meaning in this movie, then perhaps it would be red light with the cars or people inside it. Those jewelers will close 'off'. Hmmmm? <br /> <br /> Perhaps the red circle shouts to the triangle? Perhaps it was a burning slide? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it does not look like that. The end is a bit of a disappointment. It seemed too early for a movie that felt like a tastier slow burning. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clarke Richards
