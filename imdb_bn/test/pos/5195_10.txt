If one of the best I've ever seen is one of the best war movies. It is very difficult to talk about such a movie, because it is very hard to point out any film mistakes. As "problem" it looks very real and it puts you at the ruins of StalinGrid and hurts you for both sides. Because of this, this movie does not glorify the heroes of war or epic in contrast to most Hollywood movies. Instead, this movie only creates heroes for humans, and it offers as much a proposal as possible for the war. Extremely firmly played in the war scene and so impressive, most scenes look like the isolated piece of the piece. Also, the German army is driven by the Germans which are so sure. You can see their love for perfection details where the film is produced and produced by the Germans. That's why "Stalinad" is one of the movies that I can see in a million times and never feel silenced. I saw this film with my father, who fought in WWII and the first one said: "It's like reality, how the war against the Germans was." The worst nightmare of warfare in human history and the turning point of WWII: This is the place that has seen it as a soldier in Stalinadre.
