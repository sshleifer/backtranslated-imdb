I did it too When I first saw the band, I even fired them straight away without listening to music. Then one day, out of curiosity, I bought the CD and fell in love with it. So I bought the video Keep on your lunch kids, this is not going to be nice! The video was awesome - a great opportunity to listen to music, watch some videos of the promotion and fill the band ... even though I still do not know how they can wear masks! Band is for all fans, and generally for alternative music fans
