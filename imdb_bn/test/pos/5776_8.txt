I saw this movie, when it came first. Patty does not want to be separated from his siblings. However, the Juvenile Justice system does not care. When Patty looked at the case file, the judge sent him a juvenile detention facility. He violated privacy rules by viewing personal files. He just wanted his family together. I could not blame him. Dad was not even fit to parents. One of the small children was a restroom. Dad stopped and left him. She stopped him and threw the surviving child to the service station. Paty had to take authority to protect them, as he was the oldest. They are placed in feathers home. The good part is that social workers got their family back as well. The chief social worker, did not ask him to confiscate and interfere. He was crazy power. He was the one who established the Patty Juvenile facility. Why they did not go behind the father, were released for release from prison. Yet the children are caught in the middle and feel insecure.
