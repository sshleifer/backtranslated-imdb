The actual incident, based on this epic, is set in 221 BC City and tells the true story of uniting China. The action pack and the plot, filled with the sequence of emotions, betrayal and unforgettable battles, it keeps my attention despite the 160-minute length. <br /> <br /> The King, directed by Li XuJian, is involved in the integration of Yang Jong. China's seven kingdoms and becoming its first emperor. Lady Zhao, her lover, played by beautiful lover Gong Li, has created a plot through which she will set up a fake plot plot in Yen's neighboring state, which will give an excuse to the king to attack Ian. However, as the king became even more brutal, he became a victim of the killing. <br /> <br /> There are subtitles, tragedy and constant high drama. Have great beauty scenes and ruthless cruelty. Great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> The deep characteristic features me thinking about Shakespeare. And tragic events that call the Greek drama feel. And ultimately it is entirely Chinese, because it supports old questions whether it supports older questions. And raise questions related to life and death and good and bad and all blurred edges. <br /> <br /> It's history story, history of people who have shaped China past two thousand years. I raised the story as well as raised moral questions. There is no simple answer and it is one of the movie's strengths. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But ready for violence and violence. <br /> <br />
