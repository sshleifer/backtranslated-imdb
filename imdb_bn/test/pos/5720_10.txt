After watching this routine by John LeGuZamo, finally I realized why he was so talent. I enjoy great work, and it works at its best level. I can not label it as a stand-up routine because leguizamo is so intense when playing different characters. The only time to break the character when it is necessary to complete his part so that he gets so cool, that you can not help but appreciate his talent. I was not really sure how I felt about him as an actor, but Freak strengthened my perception of him. For those who did not have the opportunity to see this show, I think for you. Certainly check it out. It's one of the Nestest routines I've ever seen. Eddie Murphy, Bill Kosby and Chris Rock Four stars and more.
