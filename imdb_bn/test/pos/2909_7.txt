Nobody can be impressed by the intelligence and scale of this film, and at the same time lost opportunities are frustrating. <br /> <br /> I think the script is nice and the vocalists of Edmund Pududi are quite influential. However, as a painter of his time, the film suffers from many Hollywood-especially, poor casting, extreme mitigation of sets, and excessive persecution. Admand Paradum (who plays the title character) is apparently weird with physical acting. I suspected he was primarily at Shakespeare's theater. <br /> <br /> So if movie people read this, I am a nice candidate for this one, especially if you throw real Egyptians like Egyptians!
