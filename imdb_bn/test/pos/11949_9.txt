This is the classic 80s humor. If you were a young man at the age of 80, he went to see this summer. It was a primary look at who they are now super. This is good for the dead and the dead just back and enjoy the fun and silly movies. They can admit to the age when they were in a crazy summer when they were teenager. Even family and friends like crazy like this character. Some of these characters were very fun to be launched. The uncle who is crazy, waiting for every million dollars to win, sitting at the moment of wake up on the radio, the grandmother who only chooses grandparents and hands over a bill to children after dinner, twin brothers who do not see the same thing and meet with Houpp So much fun It does not win a prize, but it's a fun movie to be lost in one afternoon.
