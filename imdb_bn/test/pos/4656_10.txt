What can I say about this movie which was not told hundreds of times? This is an American classic. It has spawned dozens of imitators. No one else Midnight Madness is one of the kind. From the ridiculous opening Montage to Music / Bonnet to HOtel, I was hooked. Leon felt us all so young and indifferent. In response to one question, how were two hot hookah with him? And how was the time / money to arrange a ceremony? Throwing is the top notch. David Knott Here's his best. Her tight yellow sweatshirt is annoying. His younger brother Michael J. Fox (his first acting role), is a real brat. There is a fisherman hat mandatory black dude on Nolton's love interest and a dark and yellow party. Michael J. Fox Pausht tried to steal beer cups in Blue Ribbon Braueri and went to the Floydor van. Flounder's team gives us the most comedy. What is the deal with the same party? Is he dating Flounder? Or Melio? Or the blade? Yes, the Mexican gentleman's name is PLACE. Flounder team has the best line in another guy movie, I do not have to pomp them here. A bunch of meat machine team drunks. My personal favorite is the spear. But silent black people are very great. The other two teams are 4 men and 4 lesbian (two of which are 450 pounds). <br /> <br /> You know the end from the beginning. But that does not matter. It's the best of the merit of 80 Do not hire this one, buy it. And now buy it.
