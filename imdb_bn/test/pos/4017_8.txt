The film was written based on Jules Verne's book, I actually read about ten years ago. I think I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job for storytelling. The most important thing about this movie is not the story, but its main original scene. <br /> <br /> The visual scenes are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a tricky combination of animated drawings. Live performers are associated with stop-motion animations and are portrayed so that they can see from an animated movie. Zeus Verne's own unique version of Airplane and Submarines, and Karel Gemon's good instructions, combines in a very good and strong visual style that effectively keeps their attention up to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to some problems, one of the water scenes may end up for a long time, for example, because the story goes very fast in the first half of the movie. None of this is important even after the movie is always very enjoyable. A gem to be better known for today's audience. A proposed movie for the whole family.
