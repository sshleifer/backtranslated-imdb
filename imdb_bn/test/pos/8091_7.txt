Great comedy from Charlie Chaplin I saw Chaplin's 4 big films (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator), and I think it's the most fun of all four. This movie I've ever seen is almost another because I smile more. From the very open disclaimer ("Any coincidence between the Great Dictator and the sailor's shop owner is completely coincidental"), the film is a combination of frustration crystals and a mix of oral laughs. And at the same time, Chaplin sovereignty manages to portray the evils of oppression. Maybe the least of the last and last thing is permanent, but easily 9 out of 10 for me.
