If (only I mentioned in the whole detective), following the tradition of comics to find disagreement with Keaton Law, this Langdon short (Tramap, Trump, released before Trump) was based on another comedy - a wise wife married, and some secrets Try to get away for Lorl and Hardy, like Fields and Chaplin, did it in several films. <br /> <br /> I have a problem - why do these characters always get married with such nasty women? And there is an interesting socialist side problem - why do not you find these f crews married female comedians of homosexuality? I can not remember anyone other than Carroll Barnett Skit, where two Nigerian members of two couples discover that they like to give back what they return (such as mutual Saad-Mshokisam, but assures them that they are not married to a namby-pamby type). Because of that, comics are fascinating weddings, I think they can imagine that they got what they deserve. Or they? Ollie really deserves a wife who spit on her and spit food? Yes, he attended the conference of the son of Desert, who had destroyed his plans, but he wanted to get some personal time - he and his breasts had nothing to cheat on. In fact he was created by Mais Bush because Stan collapsed and told his wife the truth. <br /> <br /> Here, Harry's wife (Alice Ward) talks with her mother when she puts him under strict control. We saw Harry in his job (this is Saturday morning, and ends at noon in the last weekend of work - five days a week, 40 hours in the industry before working week). She works in a foundation where she is shaped red hot metal (an early joke about Langdon - she is a small, light man, muscle type is not a sludge ham swing). She just misses trying to give her street people a light. He telephoned home to explain some things and could get an ear from Mismus for two minutes. <br /> <br /> On her way home, Harry met his Pale Steve (Vernon Dent), who met two beautiful, sweet girls who just wanted to keep a date. Harry hesitated but agreed with her after talking to her (she agrees to pay for the hot dog for four - her silver half dollar in her pocket in 1926). But when his plan was to discover the hidden "cache" of his coins, then his plan became inaccurate. He hides under the hole in the living room and finds it to walk along the rug. But his wife spying on him, and seized it all. After he talks with her and overhears her semen. He insulted him back to the dime and said that he can treat his date in soda. <br /> <br /> But Harry has a second cache, and is dressing for a date - and goes out. He and Dent were seemingly late, and Dent blamed Harry, but Harry tried to do this: he made two prostitution. When they say that Dent (wisely) that they do not have any kind of girls, they will sound as "beautiful". Eventually the girls show up and start the date. But soon Harry hid in the Rumble, because his wife went to his street, and girls' sons friend angry with their two rivals. <br /> <br /> Short work is good and fun, and Harry Langdon gives a good idea of ​​a personality developed in his short starred as a comic master. He is constantly kept by others. He misses his car because he wants to see some unfamiliar smoke and light, and ultimately finds strangers his own. Harry's birthday is a wonderful girl behind him with a little dog. He wanders in two cars, which starts driving away both and ends up wrapping around a pole. It certainly proves that while Langdon made his features, his screen was close to personality. Only if he could keep complex three together beyond the first three features.
