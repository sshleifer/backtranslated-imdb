I did not see a movie where God gave blood to so much heart in their work and concentrated on the best details for a long time. <br /> <br /> Everything has been well-thought-out and has turned into a real reality. The camera-work, editing and compositing worked well together, it's just amazing. The titles were so funny and perfectly complete dancers. <br /> <br /> This movie has thrown me away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Showdown" could be cut by 10 or 15 minutes. <<br /> <br /> It was close to the silent silent film story, acting, scenes and the perfect respect for the costumes, at least perfect and reliable from silent film making time.
