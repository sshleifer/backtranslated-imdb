Well, Maunne Sward has finally received a DVD release from Korea, and I have heard most negative feedback, and despite suspiciously its DVD release, I could not help but pick it - any Y-Zia movie is better than most of my non-Woo Zia movies: D Perhaps low expectations were a benefit, because I enjoyed this picture quite well I was quite surprised to do that. <br /> <br /> A killer is involved in a coup coupling that is killing many ministers, and the government is given the responsibility to identify the top sledgeer criminals. It does not take a long time, but the answer does not want to hear it. Through the long flashbacks we know why and through the history of the terrorist and murderer, and the history of revolution. <br /> <br /> This movie is usually mellodramatic for Korean movies, and is strongly protected - an H-Style Comedy moment can be found here. The first of the stories can be a little harder to follow, but all eventually makes sense. The film eventually goes a bit lightly, but Chang can not do anything worse than a look film, and in most cases it is enjoyable. Production quality is high, with some good cinematography capture it. The war scene is not good on the qualifications of the film Hw Zia, but perhaps they can not be - Wars are more "realistic", they are less like dancer dance routines, but there are some cables and sometimes CGI that puts film in "Woo Zia" mode . Unfortunately, the film does not have the best cast, which is a lack of elegance among the lads and sometimes difficult to distinguish from one another. There is a young lady in the film that I do not think I have seen before, but gives a great impression of any policy - only you can not see its priceless ... or perhaps it is a lack of film: H. K. W. Zia is a beautiful poem and probably Beauty, but I just want to make this half better with HK - TWINS EFFECT 2 I do not expect it to happen anytime, though If habila and to cast her in tasui must BOARD. Munu's word will not go to my list, dear Wujia, in any way, but it is better than Romantic Warriors or Evil Lake - perhaps more likely than Venkumura, although I like that movie quite a bit over another. Obviously it is not surprising here somewhere near Musa, but it really is really a different matter. SITM will probably have the second chance to see in three years, the best indicator of how much I liked it :) 7/10
