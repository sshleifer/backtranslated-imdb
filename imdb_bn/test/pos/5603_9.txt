Of course, the camerawork must have been "funky" - perhaps a "rolled" Dutch-roll short of the movie - the premiere was fantastic. This is really a tricky humorous (true Hal Hartley) God, Jesus and Satan. The interaction of Jesus and Satan provided some ridiculous views ... Even Jesus' solidarity was great - till then I saw even Jesus. So madness, Jane-like, son-of-God-Isaac, but still as such a wonderful man. At one point it is a general view of Christianity's rebellion, but there is still a personal level, where you can relate to Jesus without God-complicated (compared to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
