This one you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feeling. If you look for blood and jump to grab your pants, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> This budget was especially amazing for budgets! Although the film was portrayed in a budget budget, music and audio were obvious compared to most movies with huge budgets! <br /> <br /> The story has been really good and the director should be appreciated. This movie has a perfect blend of horror comedy! Acting top notch and room to create a sigail which I definitely keep out for! I have no doubt that this movie will become a classic of the instant culture. <br /> <br /> This short story describes the life of a boy who entered the cemetery career. The robbers say every flashback story of even more fantastic experience than facing each other. Zombies and even Alien Vampires! Our stars begin to steal for simple burglars and robbers, but quickly become a graduate of the body for a crazy doctor (angus scream), which requires body for physical exercise. When both of them found the way to send their ruthless employer to the vampire, the graves and looters discovered that stolen dead bodies regularly due to trafficking in bodies is much more profitable. The only problem is that there is another gang named Murphy's house, which is competing for the body of the same body- and wherever there is a fatal consequence of gang-rape gang collision. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the most refreshed and exciting horror comedy I've seen for several years and reminds me of Evil's dead. Do not miss this one, you regret it!
