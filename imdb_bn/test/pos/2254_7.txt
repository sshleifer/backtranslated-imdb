For the first time, writer-director Liech Sherebber's film comes from "Everything Enlightened", complying with Jonathan Suford Four's first novel. The book was ambitious and broad, its magical-realistic element, and the bright language used to represent the screen is impossible. Movies, cute, low effort. Though the end result is not a miracle-like novel, it is still a complete film about a curious Eastern European road trip, or as one of the characters "It's a very strict search." <br /> <br /> This character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian who loves American pop culture but does not seem to be straightforward in English. Nevertheless, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a tour company catering to American Jews, was determined to serve him as a translator of Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan is investigating his family history, especially trying to find a woman who rescues his grandfather from Nazi. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> It is a semi-cleftmanical Weiduro who collects his own grandmother's "family stuff". The quiet, wide eyes of the wood, sincerely this role works very well. The Hats made an impressive debut as loose-tailed, accessible Alex. Her malapropism is pleasing, but she is able to pull the character's growing self-awareness. Dog Micky is very funny, Sammy Davis Junior Jr., and some of the movie dogs that I saw are cloaking, intelligent and unreliable. <br /> <br /> "Everything enlightens" finally puts Holocaust on a human scale, telling us to remember millions of specific, small tragedies, not as a general event. The memory of a European film, it also worries the impact of past events like youngsters like Jonathan and Alex. Its main point of view, strong performance and some very interesting scenes, "Everything is Illuminated" is a great work for a first timer, and it is expected that the script will continue to operate the film.
