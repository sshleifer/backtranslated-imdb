It is recommended to me by a friend who says it was tricky and cuddly for a "gay sex flick". Boy he was wrong I guess she did not get it. I do not understand, understand and do not understand myself and try to find myself through trial. More like this. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and vibrant, and the story gets enough fun through theater performance to anyone interested. <Br> <br /> Rachel Sterling went in search of much love as "Nan", who wanted to find only that she was a man who was afraid to reveal to everyone and found out. "Flo" was awesome as Johih May. I had seen him before, where he spent a few hours trying to remember him, only he discovered that the quiet sister "Alice" in "the end of the people" was fortunately, I was raised in a liberal family and there was no problem in trying a movie. Like it Many people are missing out on such flicks. I'm glad I took counsel from my friend and tried it. But, I'm sure I enjoyed it more.
