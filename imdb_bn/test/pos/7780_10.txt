Love Jones looks shy in a clever, positive, realistic sense of young African-American men and women. I think the actors and actresses were all great and really did a great job of capturing the mood. Nia Long and Lornez Tate have worked well together and I hope to see more work from them. In fact, all actors / actresses have done such fine work, so it would be great to see another romantic-comedy from them. This movie can be compared to a well-written, romantic comedy. If you have not seen this movie already, I strongly recommend that you do it, it can certainly give you a different perspective of life and love.
