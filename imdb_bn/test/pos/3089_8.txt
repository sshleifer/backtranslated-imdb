German film maker Warren Herzog's 1971 documentary-like film Fata Morgana was portrayed in the film for many years in the late 1960s, it is one of the rare DVDs that should be commented consistently. This is the visual encouragement of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery which is timeless. You could not just say that it was made twenty-five years ago. The soundtrack of the film, including rock music by German classical music (Mozart and Handle), and Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, lends its timeless quality. The description of three different German descriptors (German film historians LÃ¶te Eisner, Eugen des Montgennes, and Wolfgang von Unger-Sternberg) are strong, and Hezzig went on and on the project's own and film history, imported and later, but the English translation speaker, James William There is a voice of Glead Hill that seems neutral, which is more in this project itself Uropuri the loan, even though most pathyai - in any language, but irrelevant. Yes, the first part of the film, the obscure biblical slogans of the creation of the mythical creatures of Creation are funny, but the text of Herzug writes in the remaining two parts (Paradise and Golden Age) with quotation from German poet Herzag. Name as Manfred Eigendorf, think about the first part of the somber tone of a taunt ?? Together, other hedge projects were simultaneously painted together - even curiosity, even small and documentary of the Dwarf's launch of The Land of the Silence and Darkness and the Flying Dog of East Africa, but these projects' just added the elements rejected to the beauty of this photo, such as remodeling flamingo Lake sky scenes, which are the Heroes of Heroes Crows about the commentary, which gives a strange odd sense.

Godfrey Regor Quotisi films are unclear However, Regio simply casts the content of your photos, Hernazg's ability is only to make American filmmaker Terrence Malik: creating a completely spontaneous vocabulary with a mixture of pictures and words and relies on emotions - the first press. Analysis may fail when such effort is taken. Herzog often understands why his art is great. He is often the greatest sensation and mesmeric. That is why publicly commented on his humiliation for Hollywood's lowest ever Donnirator Pop Perhaps <br/> the best picture comes in a scene that says that Harzg has worked hard to dump in Cameroon because of our hard work. It shows the dead body of the cattle, and Harz describes the intolerable stain. Despite this, viewers can understand everything from these pictures, the sun's black color makes the parts dry, and the blanched bone. Yet, in that commentary, Harz focuses on hard work, no deep meaning. He gave you materials to explain how and how he would explain his work, such as the size of a woman in a hazardous size of sand, which remembers the events of the time of the life of John Bergman, where Max Von Sido is holding his hand. Ingrid Thullin's beautiful nude body bend. However, the original image of this film, which symbolizes most of Herzegade's career, is driven by the patronage of a lakeed car that seems to be a lake. It is deep, hypocritical, confusing, deceptive, supernatural, yet real, just as Harjag, the believer who came from the family of militant atheists. But, then, like everything, it ends.
