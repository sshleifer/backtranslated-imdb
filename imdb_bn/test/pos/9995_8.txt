You know that "the best game of all time ever" is about golf. I used snicker over the dramatic title over, but well known for its role in director Bill Packthan (aliens and true liars, known for his role in the great visual appearance), we found that it has a lot more meaning than the game <br / > <br /> <br /> Although the movie is about golf, it seems like the game is just what the framework is. What is actually happening is that people are told that they can not fulfill their dreams, age or social status. A conflict between a son's will and a father's needs. An English golf legend wants to bring the title to the country that is breathing on its neck. <br /> <br /> Shia La Bououf (even Stevens) played Francis Umit, who played a cadie with a God-given talent that never allowed to play. Golf in the first place Despite the annoyance of high-grade "lady", Francis had a gift, it was not believable. Playing by Elias Cotas (Sh Sugartime, Teenager Mutant Ninja Turtles) was a big threat to what his father was frustrated, who think that playing a mere game will not improve their poor realistic situation. With the constant support of her mother, Francis finally met her idol, golf legend Harry Warden (Stephen Dillon). <br /> <br /> This movie is more impressive than the film's achievements. This proves that the story is successful through pure film. The whole movie can be said without dialogue. There are scenes in the movie that only make strong mysteries and strong emotions with photos. In a special scene, Francis Wyamet swung and the whole crowd could move around in their head, but Harry Wardon's face was intensely watching the flicker in Ummeet. The golfer enjoys a much more beautiful way of visualizing the course. <br /> <br /> Completes a beautiful supporter cast. The Peton List shows love interest and thinks valuable for the game, and Josh Flitter plays a loving caddy, pushing Ummeet under pressure. Whether or not the golf fan, you can be a great medium to tell a story of the movie that will compliment the movie for its beauty and its reminder.
