I saw two very different nice events this morning, but you would be surprised at the same kind of. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first collaboration between Belle Rathbone (if I was King, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and director Roy William Neill. This was not the adventure of their first Sherlock Holmes, as they did a few years ago. <br /> <br /> has created a fantastic team, but I like the version of Hummer, which I will talk later. <Br> <br /> Homs depends on many disguises to do his job and when I find out I'm continually delighted with the methods shown. They seem to dash when they always find a new formula. <br /> <br /> The story about keeping a bomb site from the Germans in WWII was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery.
