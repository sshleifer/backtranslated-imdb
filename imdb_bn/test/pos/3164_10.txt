Check out the full check out. It saw MLK's birthday 2006 and it hit me a big time. Sometimes we think that we are all trapped and how much we try to make it to the past is destroyed. What we can do is keep going and talking. Just keep going. One does not mean to be humble because it is not the point, but we need to reduce how we will work ourselves. What happens to us when we are told by the best people of love to go out of our "dead end road", but we do not hear it. I know some of us listen but how can we see the rest of the world? Just going, I guess. This movie helped me to think more about these things, so I guess it's what it sets it. I think good movies or sports or books or poems or lectures or something else: something that worries you and is removed from an active direction instead of being stuck and indifferent and hopeless.
