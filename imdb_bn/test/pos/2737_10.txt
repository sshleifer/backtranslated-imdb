I've remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what power it is! It was fun and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren might have seen it. It places right up there with the Winky Dink - another favorite. I discovered that one of the creators later worked in Rocky and Bulikiin. There's no cartoon for kids today that this preliminary show is going for them. Today's cartoons push the idea that someone has special, some magic formula or talent that can succeed in bad or dangerous situations. At first the cartoons were not very poorly controlled - it was a much more modest and safe time - they allowed us to develop our own talent and character.
