1959 was a landmark in the film. Some of the classic classic era of career career capping freed the classics that got their best place. The headlines are just an instructional, Hitkouk's North by West West, Billy Wilbers Common Leak It Hot, Howard Hawkes Rio Bravo, Douglas Sirac's Imitation of Life. Add a couple from the previous year, Osson Welles's Touch of Evil, Hit's Vertigo, and Nick Ray's Wind Everglades, and what was possible with the classic Hollywood style got you a great collection. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films were shown, which indicated the whole new method of film creation. One was Jean-Luc Gordard's respirator, the other was John Cassettes Shadow. Among the two movies, some things were common, which played extensively improvised by non-star, handheld camera, low budget, and a certain youth, jazzy swagger. In some ways, though, they may not be separated away. Gordard was still a believer of the director as the style arbiter. He knew more about movies than most Hollywood producers, and the suffocated film was filled with classic crime film iconography. On the other hand, Casavets was an actor and refugee in underground theater scenes in New York. His first film was a little influenced by his film and a big believer among the actors. Goda's film constantly mentions its own handicrafts, Shadows aim at a certain type of nature. <br /> <br /> This is not reachable, especially naturalism is a mythological phenomenon, especially in movies. But it's strong, dynamic but slick like cool jazz in the sky, certainly the main inspiration of the filmmaking style to show here. It does not eventually remain together, because basically Cassavetes' actors are amateur amateur beatniks, where Cassavetes style requires strong, imaginative actors. His subsequent work with Gane Rowlands, Ben Gazrar and Peter Falk was hit by the water. Due to the director's technical inexperience, some of the dialogue was later re-fixed, which defeated the innovation of reform. Still looking for a great moment (such as Lilo Goldoni talking about her expression about losing her virginity) and looking for a distraught artist to find her way.
