Every time I see this movie, it really wants me to go out and get a good night! My spouse uses the statement "landed on weekends" to nominate my mind before going out! And so I ... sometimes <br /> <br /> This image is a great introduction to writer / director - accomplished companion! <br /> <br /> Great acting, all characters are trustworthy and bigger than life! A pleasure to see the 'weird' scenes, Jeep's ongoing Mr. Floppy flashbacks / explanations / visualizations are all great! The scene of the Huaweiuse Pub, when everyone is standing and starts singing national anthem, still smiles. Here's a comedy load - Howard Marks 'Spelef Politics' speech is ridiculous! <br /> <br /> Oh God, you just need to see this. I remember, I felt that the film has glorified some pride, but hey, is that true? At least film is not shy away from this fact. I think the film also carries a nice message for it - do not take life seriously, you have to leave the hair for a while. And of course, when the movie explains to his colleagues that he is coming out of medicine, definitely the pub chat definitely seems to be that when you are good at coming out, you know about the party! <br /> <br /> This is a very clever film using camera, light etc. It's an available part of movies and a great feeling of companionship, love, clubs and drugs-good stories <br /> <br /> Get out of "Rat Races" !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
