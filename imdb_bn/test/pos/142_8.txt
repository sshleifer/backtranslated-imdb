We all know what Chan-Ouk Park can do. If you did not see Oldbay (or sympathy quarter of that), you are not among the best movies of this century. But I'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk thirsty. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you expect. Yes it is a vampire movie, but simultaneously it is a very twisted story of romance between a pastor and a young girl. I will not get into synopsis (you can read that at the top) but instead tell you what this movie offers. Chan-Euk Park is the head of cinema photography and this film is no exception. With some of the most visible scenes to be made in background with intense light, he sets a complete mood in almost every scene. The film has started somewhat slowly, but I think it was necessary to build relationships with letters. Once things start moving along, the credit rolls up to about once. "Thirsty" is mainly a love story, but the same ideas which you do not feel. The relationship between lead letters is very intense, but almost annoying at the same time. We know that Chan-Uk Park is not unfamiliar to controversy, and this film touches on the ban as old age. In the last scene, the film's most powerful, and probably the best decision I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie that I think should see all the movie buffs. It's an exciting (and individually different) vampire to take over the world, and romance is far from sad or annoying. This movie is a diverse, miserable and beautiful way through all the wrong ways. Obviously this is not for everyone, but if you are already interested then there is a possibility that you are reading this review. See it. Do not be afraid
