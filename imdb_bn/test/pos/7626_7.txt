I first saw on TV 9 years Friday night. I remember the entire page ad in my TV guide with Rex's photo. After some 30 years after the amazing stick in your mind. However, if your child likes giant movies, especially knitting and kettles make each other excited. Special effects are no Harryhausen but if you find it somewhere late in the night the price of one and a half hours. This classic cable fades away from cable TV for some reason it has not seen a few years. If you catch it late night it is very critical not only to grab some food and enjoy it. It may be chessy, but I think it was much better than a Kong Rimk, which came out in theaters a year ago.
