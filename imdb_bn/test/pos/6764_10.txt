Without doubt, one of the fun and most entertaining movies I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. They are all wonderful surprises in them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> There is no annoying moment. I was completely captured by the movie. And I was thinking acting was great. <br /> <br /> So if you want to watch a fun movie. You should look for green slaughter. A great movie <br /> <br /> I give it to 10/10
