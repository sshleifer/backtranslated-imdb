Last night I saw this shocking movie, and it's a boring mind ** carrier, and incredibly bloody and total attacks on some unforgettable scenes and senses. Lynch's mind seems to be a movie (especially ERASERHEAD), budgetary, and even "odd". Does this person not believe this pregnant sister, but then what really happened or is she battling left and right in her brain? To draw a subtle line between imagination and reality, the main theme of this piece of art, and what would happen if the right side of the brain crosses the dream and the imaginative logic and the logical left side. And the music in this film is incredible, an electronic score that is absolutely perfect. While most extreme scenes (including hard-core sex) are a sudden and frustrating film, you can see in a movie, I've seen it as an industry and loved it. And that music still amazes me, if I have tried and found the soundtrack I have available. A real event to see "subconscious cruelty", and do not forget the audience easily. And a note of gorehounds, this is a must. <br /> <br /> WARNING ... Precautions of buying this movie, because some have graphic sex scenes and fogging on the utmost gorge, especially the Japanese release from the copies.
