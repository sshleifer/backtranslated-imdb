This movie has seen and fully loved it great characters. This is definitely my kind of movie, you will not be disturbed in this movie, I love independent movies which they are very fruitful. My husband and I really enjoyed J's style. If you are an open minded person who loves to think about movies and then love the conversation then you love this movie. It's definitely provoking.The film will definitely step up on some toes but those people who care about will probably not go see this movie. It's amazing to see the characters evolve. J Floyd has really been holding both parties on the table. Applause applause J. I hope you are working in another movie.
