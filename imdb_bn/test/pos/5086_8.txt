I remember this show when I was a kid, but now it seems that the show may be a little date as an adult. Well yes it makes more retro (and musics too terrible) for me. <br /> <br /> This show is mostly good writing. I think it was a procession that was canceled after one show, especially when this show was more popular than the incredible list. <br /> <br /> I think fans should ignore the poor special effects and should enjoy the story. <br /> <br /> This next sentence has a spoiler: My favorite favorite is a kid when two spiderman was sticking to the idea of ​​Spider-man 3 in an interesting way. I would hate to hate something like this TV show ideas. I believe Stan Lee was not a fan.
