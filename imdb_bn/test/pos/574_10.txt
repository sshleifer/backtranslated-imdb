I'm glad this was the work of foreign painters because it can not be accused of proper bias. For absolutely no reason, the police in Jacksonville filed a lawsuit in this case and chose the first black suspect for the murder of a white, foreign tourist. They picked a 15 years. The old child, who is almost near a saint, can find you randomly, and then trying to fool himself by making an unfinished case against him. In addition to the overwhelmingity of rebel bias, the innocent innocent young black teenager has a 6-month imprisonment prison. It is a question that as society we find those accused who should be accused of them, find out innocent and later innocent. This documentary is well-produced, professionally recorded and presented in a fun package from which you do not want to take a 1-minute break. If you are careful about social justice, do not miss it. It certainly deserves his Oscar.
