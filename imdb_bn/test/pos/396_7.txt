This is another good western, which I enjoyed. This is not an epic or something, but it's good for it. This is about 3 fur troppers, which led by a man named Z., who are filthy and helpless. Z and his two friends found themselves as scouts for their own and the only fort standing between the Indian band, who bothers Americans with their land and wants to get it back. This is the main theme of the story. These are actions, excitement, even a diverse humor, and banned romance. One of Z's friends, Gass, reminds me a lot of quotes (played by the Robert Show) in the movie Joss. Both of them are miserable, Gryff Davyner. A Western fan, you have to make a lot of choices about this special entry. I think it deserves a 7/10
