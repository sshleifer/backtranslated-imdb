I did not see this movie at the age of 30, so I do not know whether I like it when I was 12 years old. At that time, I liked this movie. This is a great "Starter Cook-Flick" for young pre-teen girls. Finally, be careful. There is tears and harsh emotions. <br /> <br /> Seeing it back from 2008's perspective (with more knowledge about child psychology, politics and political accuracy), I think it will be interesting to meet again. Patty's helpless, humiliating father, indifferent mother and dear sister contributed to everyone's weakness and hunger for her companionship. Patty was sad when Anton left. She was heartbroken when she died. The anger that guided him later was frustrating. After all, he was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> What I'm holding firmly is how this movie has taught me and even "enemy" soldiers are people. Not all German soldiers were a nasty Nazi. When I was older, I saw TV shows like Hogan's Heroes and The Pat Patrol that "regular" German soldiers were not like Gestapo. <br /> <br /> "Regular" soldiers were drafted. Gestapo hate was handpicked into the volunteers for their special attitudes. I believe that there was a special privilege of being a Nazi special, and they did not go to war. Their specialties were interrogation and torture. Later, during the cold war, I used to think of Russian soldiers and SOMGS. We were taught that the Soviet Union was "evil". But the reality was that the Russian army was not destroying America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government is destroying their way of living. Which was true, since the US fought to end communism. <br /> <br /> The text is still applicable today. The German soldiers were not just like the Nazis, just as Muslims are not like Al Qaeda.
