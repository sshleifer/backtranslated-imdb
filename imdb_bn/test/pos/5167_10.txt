My wife and I saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much that we wanted to see it again. It was so moving that I had to call it a tier jarger. The mystery sent to report to Billings is not really a mystery. Corner !! It seems that he had been confronted with some of the things that happened to him, all was well, and I believe he was somewhat scared of George because he felt that he could not understand what he had achieved. It just shows that the cold heart can change even with the right attitude around. If we could all treat each other the same way, then the world would be better. Today's date we're searching the net for a copy, now finally I can find a copy I'm going to grab it.
