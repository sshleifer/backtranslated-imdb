I did not see a movie that has been removed for a long time and stuck me like this; I can not take my eyes on the screen. I was busting for loo; And I did not even want to stop it because I was pulled properly. Emotional; Powerful; Very running; Terrible and heart breaking This gives you a wonderful insight from South Africa; Their struggle and their lives. The mind played by Lead was blown and the script was incredible. In spite of the terrible events and the terrible events that emerged in this movie; I was captivated. I do not even want to try and explain the story; It's very complicated and I do not do justice to it. Please see this; Why do you understand why you Cheers, yes
