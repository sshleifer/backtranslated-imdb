I'm certainly not a gamer, but a couple couples between my family and my boyfriend. So, a little reluctantly I decided to find out what is the big deal with "fantastic elements". I saw the Darkness Rising and I thought it was Hillary! Slapstick it, but those who enjoy playing the role are not humiliated. Also, and most importantly, those who did not sing before they can enjoy and do not try to understand the plots or do not feel left. The acting was great and the field shot / set was credible. This allows me to see other movies by this production company. I can not wait to see the future holds for this team! Three cheers - good work !!
