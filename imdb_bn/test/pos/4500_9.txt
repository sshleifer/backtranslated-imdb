This is a movie that has left me breathing .... I want to know more about Afghan history and tradition. The modern "evil activist" mantra was inspired by the reality of the clouds, the beauty of the people and their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Casting was unclear, the scenes were just wonderful. Acting was the first rate and it ignored the academy (except its music). <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey. This provides a "ugly tears" from the observer. <br /> <br /> A film worth seeing a second and third time.
