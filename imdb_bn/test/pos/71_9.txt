I always like this picture. Music, stories and actions I especially love opening and closing film. Stay with me throughout the year for music. WWI air warfare was fantastic and comedy is usually Black Edwards. Sopartik is next to her 'after all. Julie's singing is amazing and keeps the screen glued. Set and scene is wonderful. Characters are attractive. I liked the scene with injured soldiers and Julie singing them. I want to sing to me in Vietnam. I enjoyed the old car from that time and WWI music. I was happy after reaching the DVD. Now I can often see it dark again.
