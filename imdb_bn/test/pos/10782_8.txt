Oliver Stone, always ready to create a politically themed movie, here makes another one. "Talk Radio" is based on the career of Denver's radio talk show Host Allan Burg, who was killed by white robbers. In this case, the character Barry Champline (Eric Bogosian) is a talk show host in Dallas, talk show, who does not love anything more than annoy people to call. For example, most of the people who call the children are disenchanted. And things can be warmer than anyone can understand. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I really liked the scene where he called who has a jab at a redneck. Imagine, I will never call this Oliver Stone's greatest movie, but when the media gets even more focused it is a good reference of an era. Elaine Greene and Alec Beldwin also have good performances.
