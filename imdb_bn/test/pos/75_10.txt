This often maligned movie is essential for fans of Black Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini, or Hollywood musicians. Other authors have commented on vocabulary, confusion of plot, etc., but there is a lot to suggest that the film has. Henry Mancini's best (and he made many wonderful compositions), singing songs for the completion of several songs by Andr√©s, Julie played differently and she was dressed in some nice clothes (she's here with her boyfriend), on-the-spot shots are breathing. There are some fun inspector clausau-type visual gags to take and boot. Rock Hudson basically calls her performance, but she's good at best. A real curiosity item it was that last major film Julie has done about 10 years and, in many ways, a precursor to Victor / Victoria. Look at it and look beautiful. It can be found in DVD ??? When it is, I want both versions - long and short, the director's cut. Since it was lamped on the SOB, they would create a great two packs!
