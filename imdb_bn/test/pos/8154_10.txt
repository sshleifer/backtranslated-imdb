I saw this logo on television today. I was absolutely enthralled by this powerful message and plot lines in this photo. I do not want to waste it. I would say, I belong to the internal struggles of Aaron and his legacy. As a gay man growing in a small town, I relate very well to the "big secret" and the choices I made. This movie has had a big impact on me and I plan to purchase a copy of it in my personal library in the very near future. I did not say anything more than finishing the movie and my friends asked to recommend it. It was deep that impact on me. Who read this comment. See it Try to have a little damage as possible. Also, keep an open mind. It's not a movie that can be seen as a Disney movie or a movie of the week. Instead, read the dialog and actively read the dialog and take time to read and join the plot. You can find yourself in tears. Since "Steel Magnilia" I have not moved in tears by any film. This is the one that just did. Cast and writer and crew thank you for creating a mentally charged romantic movie about homosexuality and religion. It has long been delayed.
