There was not much ambition for this photo, but pleasantly surprised. Very well-made film, very well cut, can not really reach the heights of humanity, but it is a very good effort. Good instruction, and I think lead actors make a fantastic performance! Actually, the only real bad performance in the film was Tim Curry, who is supposed to be the name. <br /> <br /> Cool movie made a surprise that it did not do better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said,
