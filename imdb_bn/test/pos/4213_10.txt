My uncle was ten years old with me and my brother to watch this martial arts movie "Drive in" in Long Beach Circuit Drive. The title was "Hajj of Allah", from which I will never forget for some reason, but what I remember is that the various scenes of my mind are being printed forever. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me of the film though it seems to have been forever we have seen the movie. Over time, I'll find it in rental shops and from time to time I will check the web and for no reason do not show it or anyone is talking about a movie, nobody knows. <br /> <br /> If I knew that it was available, then I would like to buy that movie. Notify me if someone is aware of its availability.
