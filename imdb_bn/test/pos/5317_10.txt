This movie was a great composition of people's emotions and experiences. I think many people have been portrayed as a story of Leland's offensive mental illness, but I was attracted to what I expressed about the relationship between many characters and the emotional power of the people. Most of the film's message is that we do not know anything better than bad, which is a bit of a clich√©, but this movie is so good and what makes it so strong that it portrays a very harmful and devastating force that can be bad, you look bad everywhere like the Leland Whether or not the unexpected love of complete helplessness or the relationship that you are not going to work, how much it is eaten Disobedient. This film can make you better than how helpless relationships and emotions I've seen, and it fascinates the film as frustrating.
