And she was really beautiful (Larryn Day, that) - herself, her part, and her performance. An intriguing story of selfish vs. selfish love, for the same people, rich hearty and dipsomaniac Robert Cummings. A variation of the restrictions leads to an event that forces the local community and tests metal (and to each other) near two sisters (Gene Muyer and Lorraine Day). Their comfortable and somewhat simpler mileage has ended because the two girls face the imminent crisis and respond to the demands of discretion, honesty, loyalty and love conflict, which results in deeply different results for each of them. With abandoned old vanities and niceties, their real characters are expressed in contrast to enthralling. <br /> <br /> A wonderful look on TCM!
