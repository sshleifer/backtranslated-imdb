Black Rain is a fantastic movie, but DVD is currently being sold for about $ 300. I have a DVD, and it's terrible. The extremely small anaophoraphic image of up to the size of the resolution killing. Acceptable word This is a primitive DVD that was released * absolutely. <br /> <br /> There are BTW, my laserdis and black rain VHS. VVS DVD is a huge step up! And lasersdisk is the best picture of them all away and far ?? Black, sharp, big picture, simple but very good soundtrack subtitle. Buy VHS and these artists are claiming to avoid rebel prices!
