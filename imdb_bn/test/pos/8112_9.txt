Before the WW2 debut, the film entered the production, but it was not released until it became effective. With significant fascist sympathy in the US and Chaplin is suspected of communist sympathizers, The Great Dictator was a very brave attempt. Such risks in film making - Thinly secret political statements - today will be almost impossible. If anyone wants to create satirical films today, but imagine the foreign policy of the United States? <br /> <br /> This picture is ridiculous, mad and sad. Tragedy is that Chaplin made an application to end madness, but it's already late - for him and for us. If you have any interest as a form of art, history, film making, politics or satire.
