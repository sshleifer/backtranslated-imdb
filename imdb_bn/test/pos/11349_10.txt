The most interesting factor in this film's best performance is not a nice lead actor. It is not their outstanding performance and sizzling chemistry. <br /> <br /> To me, it's the mis-en-scene of the whole movie. Settings, lighting, props ... add love mood in all original characters. Smoke smoke from Chaur cigarette tells us the condition of his mind, that Lizen's ever-changing chit-fitting gland reflects the lack of decision-making, reflecting the debris of the orgic graft relationship with the bad relationship of two sides. <Br> <br /> The wonderful use of the Miss-N-scene gives the film a perfect amount of emotion to face the complex nature of the characters' relationship. Movie seekers wish for more.
