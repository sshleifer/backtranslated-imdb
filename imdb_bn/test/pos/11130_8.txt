High school After years and decades, look at it again with some love, feeling embarrassed to others. But some may easily forget. This is one of the most important stages of our lives, when the changes come fast and angry, whether we are ready or not. Now the children, still adults, the immune system gives us a buffet, pushing and pulling us from every direction. <br /> <br /> "Fame" has done its best to keep this character unheard, weird for Cast Cast. In most cases, it has been successful. It is drunk, but feel like a slice of life. This movie contains a special place in the heart of class 80. We just say goodbye in a decade, and soon after three or four stimulants and sometimes difficult to end the school year. We were headed into the cold, cruel world, then the unknown part of the house left for college. We contacted our Watershed Event, this new release was like a two-hour anniversary for us. We could not escape from Tytuler songs on the radio. That screen was ours there. Those who faced our own dreams, disappointments, successes and failures, were our friends, rivals and classmates. <br /> <br /> It is especially furious for anyone from other elite, high-level high schools in New York City. , Especially Stevensent, Bronze HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like kids here, we are considered the best of the best. We had no audition, but rather strict entrance exams. Probably more than performing arts kids, we were hoping to change the world, though it did not necessarily become famous. Like them, we did not make it all. But in the press cooker environment, the extraordinary cameradari and escript de corps were proclaimed, not against hat-topping "hot lunch jacket" in cafeteria. On our own graduation day, our spirits almost like the enthusiastic jubilant crescendo in the final. At the end of the "I can sing physical power" the film leaves us in the only winner note. It refers to the bright, unlimited future and all its commitments in the dark. <br /> <br /> "Fame" is set elsewhere. This story never worked in small or suburban schools. Los Angeles has got a strong introduction to film and television, but NYC is a Mecca for all industries. Homes are not called pH only, but world famous jewelery, NYC is a cultural center that is not mixed by any other city. It was also a capsule of the rest of the time, which showed seedbed, mud and dirt, which often prevented financial disaster due to the New York regional crisis. But most of all, it showed biography, since Giuliani, the muted by the underlying of Disney and tourism. <br /> <br /> I do not have to be young again But with "fame," at least I can think of how it was.
