Although the original essay of the movie is a major "coincidence," all actors do a great job and bring the story to life. I have transformed myself for characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, compassionate to both, and want to adjust them. Sam Waterstein and Ted Danson are doing well in their role, doing a decent job with stereotypical friendship. Although the story rages in time, sometimes hunger hungry for the absence of visitors, it still flows and avoids any real misunderstanding. This interesting story has all the ingredients for a good "chick flick".
