"Hoot", Mullet Fingers is engaging in enmity for closing the Pancake House. The problem is that the builders start again, and they need to take more stringent steps. When faced with the dog, he feared them with a snake, before being bitten by a dog, he did not have to go to the hospital. <br /> <br /> When Ray got to sleep, she asked her father who worked with the department. Justice, how he deals with crooks. His father said that there are tedious steps to find papers, because sooner or later they slip. You can see it with Enron and WorldCom. Roy looks at the document related to Pancake House and finds a suppressed document (he must break into the company's trailer), so when the police see it, there is a law beside him. It was different from the police when he was deported. As mentioned earlier, the verdict is not always law-enforcement, and when the company's man is owl (illegal), Mullet Fingers takes direct action. He can not wait for the law (Mullet Fingers is hidden). Recommend that the film should work in a system.
