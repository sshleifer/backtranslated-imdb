Although the film is more heroic and changes the reality for entertainment, sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life, and still there can not be much more than the Floor Castor. This remains the best movie I made about Custer. The music of Mc Steiner was fantastic and the film was known as the Irish song "Gary Owen", which was the customer's favorite. The film should have more villains because they try to focus on all bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flin and De Havilland is not like any other stream outside their movie, and director Ra√∫l Walsh is in the best way with many outside actors with outdoor viewing experience.
