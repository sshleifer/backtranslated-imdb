I was surprised that so many spectators did not find all the symbolism in the film ... this film has done incredible work of art! The story is related to most tragic things that a movie can hold, but it is one of the best movies I've ever seen because of the brightness in your best imagination and story. <br /> <br /> If you want to pay attention, the message is there. The younger brother killed his father. Created a story about flying wagon as a way to deal with the death of the elder brother's brother. There are some who will argue with the reason why they will talk to their own children. The answer to me is because she does not want to share such an unrighteousness with her kids, or she has blocked it and replaced the idea of ​​taking the memory of the terrible event into the safety of her brother's thoughts. I've read a few reviews that believe that she was the only child and she forced the younger brother to flee to get the accident she had suffered. Although it's a fun idea - I love the imagination used to come along with it. I do not think he lied about his younger brother. But, I believe it is he who lied about the death of his younger brother. However, I like the concept of a much more ending than this idea that there was no symbol in this movie. <br /> <br /> You can take many variations in the movie but if you bring the movie face value ..... two brothers create a wagon which flies to escape an abusive stepfather - you missed the brightness. I was able to see the fine text of the script, which made me make the movie incredible. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to create it ... deep ditch when you see it. You will be surprised at the talent involved in the film. I have seen each other among the symbols and the delicate messages. The only other movie is Pleasantville ..... But this is a comment for any other movie!
