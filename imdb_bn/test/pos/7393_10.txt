OK, so this was not what I was expecting. The way I want to see first, how can I rent this image. However, all of this movie was B-Movie. But when I saw it, I realized it was very funny. For the first 30 minutes it was a gentle man killing the man and a man lost his vicinity. However, those first few minutes it was one of the few interesting liners. When he threw his small minions first, I knew it would be very funny. They all worked like the quaint four hit Grimlines' grimlines, which looks like it is spoofing it and forgot me as a B-movie. So you want to rent this one.
