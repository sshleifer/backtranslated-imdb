"Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters" is a visible stunning production that deals with complex problems in innovative ease. It is based on the controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. This is not actually biology - at least not in the traditional sense - but a search of Mishima's Icologic ow. The film is successful in presenting an abstract concept in an unembroidered, fully compelling manner. Paul Schrader makes you sympathetic without you decrying him or his work with Mishima. It mostly does not solve the puzzle but it does not make you realize it. An Extra Bonus: We see Mishima's anger on the lack of tradition of morally empty modern society, Schrader gives an excellent demonstration of dichotomy in thinking and execution in our film. John Bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good. The composer Philippe Glass works perfectly for the geographical project. "Mishima" is the best movie I've seen this year, so far.
