This is what I said in the headline of this review, it hurts me to say it, but knowing about what "hit" hollywood romantic comedy can ever hope. I became a critic for the general and its name until I can remember myself, but in almost tragic notes, "Hitch" made me laughing, forced to spend anywhere near two hours of my life, smiles plastered across my face. <br /> <br /> This movie can sometimes be misogynistic and arrogant but it can be described as the subtlety only British who possesses a certain humor. This is a great comedy of Hollywood (or rebuilding a case) that can laugh at us both. I sadly and in most cases this movie provides 9 out of 10 ... You can rarely see me in the future for romantic comedy, or at least, I hope.
