This movie reminds me to show my old black and white movies with my dad. Love for love, staying in love and losing it is more true in the character of life. See the old stories fresh. Carey Grant was in the Larrenz Tate genre because the character was probably in a clumsy position, but the actor kept him as stupid and as a cardboard keeper. Nia Long was always my favorite when she was tough, even like the talk of Hepburn. This is his best work and it showed that he is always better than playing an angry black man. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic, extraordinary performance, good writing, a real love story in Chicago, what else do you want? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
