First, positive: An excellent job portraying urban landscapes for the mood of the movie. Some of the shots may be painted by De Chirico. Sophie Marso, beautiful. <br /> <br /> Negative: The story is hard to believe. Unreasonable, one-dimensional letters were posting during the pre-100%, as they were some kind of catwalk. This is not his previous, much better movie, nor Antonio, and we all know and appreciate. Malkovich extra baggage in this movie.
