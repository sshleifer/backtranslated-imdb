How important is the director, anyway? In this movie, during the political turmoil of the late 60s, the question of social organization was a major contradiction, creating a movie that creates questions that move the camera away from action and only wants to reveal to William Grieve. This is an important task, since it shows that blocking, organizing, and setting up a movie does not show the problems; It reveals the role of the crew, most of the directors want to disappear invisibly and invisibility is essential to suspend disbelief; And it considers the role of functionality and scripting and how they do not match the conclusions / reality and how the director ultimately affects the reality. (<br /> <br />) Documentary, or pseudo-documentary, or legendary statement (as you like, the themes you like) are more educated in their brain, in additional intellectual crew, struggles to understand vague and unclear directions between lost actors , And his heart's director, who expressed his desire to represent, represent, and express his intention to express Or why do they want to do it. This is a film that intentionally repeats barbarism and only lets see if it can be more than the banner. This is a movie that sometimes displays multiple shots, leaving only the editors' edit and reveals how different shots change the view. <br /> <br /> This is an important work, and something that is interested in art and the process of film making and watch the clock. This, like many experimental films, does not appeal to genuine public audience - it's not for them. It's for industry and for the 60's, asking what to do with a group-effort medium that still depends on a "voice" and "author". <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
