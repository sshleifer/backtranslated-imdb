I saw this movie on its opening night, and enjoyed it. If I used to sit with my dad then perhaps I would have enjoyed more. My parents watched the original (unfortunately, I still have not seen it) and keep talking through the whole thing. He said that the film was sucked up, and it was stupid. The thing is, he does not realize that the creator enjoying a little bit of fun with the little picture. Every horror movie, there is always a particular character portrayed. If they are not in the movie, then you really do not like it. Trademarks are letters: <br /> <br /> "Lead Character": Curley (Elisa Cuthbert) "Boyfriend of the Lead Character": Wade (Jared Padlaki) "Lead Character Brothers / (soon-to-be) changed" Nick (Chad Michael Murray) "The boring slutish character": Paggi (Paris Hilton) "Who wants to look very nicely": Dalton (John Abraham) and Blake (Robert Richard) <br /> <br /> with those letters Sama N makes predictable who will die and who will live. Obviously, you know what I'll type. The film can be predictable (actually, I had a good idea that the trailer would die), but it was still enjoyable. It seems stupid (why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a holiday camp that was not at the beginning?) Occasionally, but it is easily seen. Comedy and Gore were the perfect amount of weak-staged movie-gear, it was glorious, I'm not mistaken (less than "Final Destination 2") but it works very well. So in conclusion, this film was not set as hot as hot as the fire, but the temperature could still burn "wax".
