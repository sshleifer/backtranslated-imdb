Is it okay to play sandy with the posts of Tiffany Thaisen and Mark-Paul Gaisailer? Of course this is not right, it's ridiculous. And is this movie entitled to a '10' rating? Ahahahahah ... it's funny. Although this movie was not so awesome; I'm better off than expected it. TV movies for creating are often so much similar. Many of them feel the same. This one had the same feelings but it would get b * stard in the last job, which was yet another tortured wife, although it worked. Before starting I saw Mrs. Thesene as a vixen type 90210 temptation but here she was innocent as Kelly Capozski, which refreshed. Eric Close really surprised me playing his part really well. With some decent writing, the director is played very well, credible without being very impressive. Everything was somewhat interesting, certainly better than most of the TV movies. My grade: B-
