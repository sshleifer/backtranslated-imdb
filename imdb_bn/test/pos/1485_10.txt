In the 1990s there was a popular decade for the British Seitkum, like a foot in the cow, absolutely the Fableaul Thin Blue Line, Brittas Empire and the first time TV screen reached. /> However, Mr. BEAN, hands down, 1990's greatest sitcom <br /> <br /> m The BAN has presented the first major attempt at a threat of silent great era like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keton for decades. It brings the listeners into a single character - starring Mr. Bean - Rooney etkinson. <br /> <br /> There are many people who have commented on the message board on this page and other websites, or there is a debate about whether Mr Veena has mental disabilities or whether there is a significant learning problem arising from such disability. However, I believe the debate is unnecessary because I am very doubtful that the makers of this event can consider Mr Bin in this context for a moment in the audience. <br /> <br /> Bijon has been shown a character which seems to be very few friends, without speaking to others, without speaking, themselves rarely speaks and likes to solve the problem. Anyone who curiously communicates to showcase some of the methods of preparing for lunch or going to the dentist daily. This is where humor arises from. Mr. Bean is certainly not someone with mental disabilities, he can be an intelligent person just to deal with things like himself. And naturally, some of his methods of doing solo work often come crashing down, which we have seen to try to solve Mr Bewun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, we see Mr. Bean shows a medium or small line. Those around him try to compete or at least play a joke on the prospect. But at the end of the day there is no actual loss of any person and the results are always assured. <br /> <br /> In the last 30 years, in contrast to most of the British comedy examples, BEAN is a simple, neutral, harmful U-Rate Entertainment Suitable for everyone in the family. Due to this, the TV series has become a major hit in dozens of countries around the world. It will still be remembered for decades when many TV shows come, gone and forgot. Some critics claim that this show only appeals to children, but I just smile at Mr. Bienne Antix as much as I saw the first episode of the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson uses the natural ability to create his visual visual gag, which seems like a repetitive philosophy for the first time. <br /> <br /> Two of the TV series are spin off movie, BAANA and Mr. Ben's holiday. The expectation of one who is familiar with the humor shown in the TV series, does not translate to the big screen for success. The two films make little trials for TV series and in reality the episodes fail in magic. The greatest failure in both movies probably changes the setting live. In both the films, producers took Mr. Binake to America in his usual British neighborhood (first film) and France (second film). As a result, Mr. The characters of the movie around Biyan react to different behaviors than their TV series opponents. Both films re-use gags from TV series and the evidence shows that the gag was made for the first time. In the second movie, Mr. Bien is considered to behave in some aspects of his personality outside of character, where some Gaga seems silent than funny. At different times, I thought that the character I was seeing was Mr. Not Bean but there was a pale trick. It is clear that Ronan Atkinson is not enjoying himself as much in the TV series Her heart was not just performance. After the second film was released, he publicly said that he would not play Mr. Bin for the second time. <br/> <br /> To return to the TV series, showing evidence of plans designed in every scene of each episode in terms of writing and execution. Even the worst part is still very enjoyable and two movies are ahead in front. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the first three - these are a high quality set that can continue. I think the final episode is weak, but still sunny <br /> <br /> to summarize, Mr. BEAN is a family-made spectacular sitcom suitable for all families. Rowan Atkinson is a genuine comic genius and there is evidence of 14 episodes of this TV series. My recommendation - watch and enjoy. But if you think of a dead-hard fan after watching a TV series then see movies.
