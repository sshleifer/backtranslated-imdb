I'm not sure what I can add that this other survey has not already been told, and is pretty ridiculous, but I try. <br /> <br /> <br /> The bed is overwhelmed by a monster that "absorbs" and her orange (or whatever) her orange soda-filled Putting it with the body. Our man is there, in some scenes uncertainly looking like Robert Smith's The Quayer, hanging hanging inside the wall and we have different victims that can not prevent the comfort of this mysterious bed. <br /> <br /> This is not a normal bed. No sir bob It does not just eat humans, but it is clear later, the cover again and it is also made up. Who would not want such a bed? It can initially use its sheet as "dead body", which can be traced back to fleeing people (especially if they try and escape half the film length). <br /> <br /> Our "main" story (if you can call it), these three girls travel around this remote area (??) I do not think properly, but it is not really important because there are so many things that you just accept and accept to accept. The dialogue is not different in the film; The characters talk to each other with telepathy, because their faces never go on and there is a constant image. One of our girls believes that he does not like the rest of the "gang" and confirms all of our feelings on this matter through a willow voice-over, but we do not care; The character development was thrown in this film a long time ago, so why start now? The bed does not hear the smile, snores, crunches, and different crystals that have the scene when we assume trials by excuses by our cast reactions. This and telepathy makes it very difficult to diagnose the problem of diarrhea ... but it is okay ... it's the bed of death: that bast and it violates all the arguments, so it's okay. It creates a lovely dream quality for this most wicked movie if you buy this purchased DVD (I bought it ... What I "bought"?), Check out the role of the director. He explained that the film "Flick", which began in 1972, was not wrapped up until 1977; he bought it for some years for some luck and then released it from DVD for fast moving from 26 years 2003. It seems that someone has printed it in another country somewhere and it has ruthlessly created Beckelge and it is rarely on the message board, our manager has found evidence that people knew it, and gas! Careful, about her little known film. She decided to give it a shot and release it. I'm glad she did. Once you hear the title of this movie as much as you can, you must see it. I'm going to buy it for one and I'm going to spread its Gospel around the world ... starting with this comment
