This is a forgotten classic of the movie, and Harmony Carin has borrowed a ton for "Gamo". Gummo is good, way to the river's way, the way is good. Kaneu Reeves is no secret information about the world's best actress. No, actually, he's a terrific actor. However, he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire to Bill and Ted, and his role in this photo. She is perfect as a sort of good nature but very indifferent and confused teenager. Then there's Crispin Glover. I think this photo is one of the best in its career. As phenomenal as he drugged the character of wackjob. Then there is Dennis Hooper, who is perfect. This movie is simply amazing, and if you do not see it, then run it and see it today. Its bright I saw one of the best paintings in modern America.
