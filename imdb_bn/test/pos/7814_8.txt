I caught this first night on television this night. I secured only tune for a few minutes, but expected to find himself confused by the movie. I ended up watching it all and it found it surprisingly compulsory. Three American Lead performances were quite good, especially the Alex Cord. She is a gunslinger game with several weaknesses. Most of them are portrayed in the west. The end of the various situations where he was the mercy of monsters hunters. The final shotout in three leads and bad boys was very good, the scene where the doctor dug a bullet from Clay McCord. Somewhat awesome, but realistic. I must admit that despite my initial mistakes while watching "Spaghetti Western", I finally enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it to those who love Westerners.
