While I am in the film distribution business, I do not usually comment on movies, but I should say that it is always one of my favorite films. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. The film was not to be exploited or absorbed by the confiscated people for trying to "Hollywood" more. James MacAye is such an outstanding actor, I will not move away from him if I try. I was well impressed with Steven Robertson. I can not believe it's his first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role, but as usual, she is outstanding. We all are lucky to see everyone have a movie for this. If you want Awakenings and masks, you will enjoy this story. You owe yourself money to check this picture.
