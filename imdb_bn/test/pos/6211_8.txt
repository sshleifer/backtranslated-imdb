When I first saw Colin Moore, it was a nice series of silent movies called "Hollywood". There he was in 1980, in the twentieth century of his hair, such as the definition of "presence" was a very clear, malicious and charismatic old lady. Then I saw his fabulous silent comedy work in "Ela Cinders" and "Orchid and Armin". Then disappointing Monday's talk "The Scarlet Letter". And now he's here in "Power and the Garyry", with great ability to show off, Spaniard Tracy is one of the best actors in Spanish Tracy as well as working efficiently. <br /> <br /> I saw the light of this movie a little short story-based, but Moore and Tracy gave a brilliant performance that the story seems very rarely. Both young actors in the middle of the film - and they mostly work with make-up and hairdo acting alone. Moore is almost unknown as an elderly wife, and in the scene where she found out that her husband is seeing a small woman, I saw one of the most nicely performed scenes. He did most of the scenes without conversation, where his silent acting experience gave him the edge over the trace. When he is struggling to offer to a young girl and Tracy, compare her silent comic with another continuous sequence of play. Wonderful! The film reveals more than anything else, it is shameful that Hollywood allows this extraordinary actress to swim through her fingers and spend most of her time with her retirement.
