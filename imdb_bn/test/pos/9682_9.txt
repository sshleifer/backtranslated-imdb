"Family Guy" is probably the most sturdy sitcom ever produced. From TV shows to family drama, it can feel like everything's breaking skewers. Finally, it is one of the few TV shows of today. This is actually fun. <br /> <br /> This show is surrounded by Gryffins: Peter, a thick father whose plan is limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, who is less or less than a mother family member, though Peter feels himself to be. Chris, the son of the fat teenager has only a few brains as his father. Meg, but the joke of everyone is the black sheep of the family. Steve, the child who killed his mother and planned to take the world. And Brian, family dog, who often voices the causes, but is often malicious. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" employs many techniques to laugh at the audience. The most notable is that the frequent cuts have been made clear. They are arbitrary time, and how effective they are out of the game. "Family Guy" uses spoofs to get humor, usually from 80 TV shows What really makes the show so great that it does not have to be familiar with a person's spoofing. I'm sure it will help, but the material is fun enough in its own right. But the show does not stop there. It just does not spoof about everything, it skewers its own spoofs! The show is filled off color humor. People are the only reason for this show about surgery, because it makes fun of every race, gender, and other commonality. There is nothing sacred here, and nothing from the ridiculous jab of "family Guy" and nothing is immune to nothing. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of time and effort on a number of songs in a film and it is a big risk. But "Family Guy" has some great songs. All well written and performed, and of course they are delightful (probably the most famous one, "The Freakin" FCC "is both interesting and violent because it hurts ratings bats, where it hurts). <br /> <br /> Voice Characterizations are right Sheth McFarlane is very talented, he provides voice for Peter, Brian (which is his own natural voice) and Stewey. Sound and creative, he can deliberately change his pitch, so it seems to have actually been spoken by three different actors.Alex Borstein is perfect for the character that Lois brings a nasally drawl. Seth was unaware of Green Cris's (I did not look at IMDB, I never knew that it was.) Lacey Chabbert invented the role of Meg, and when he was good, Mila Kunis was in his character Kunis Meg raised the character with a new, sharp edge that he was with Chabert. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" has been compared to "Simpsons," and that fully understands (and they are not produced Only by fox). Both Sailor's blue-collar and "The Simpson" are good, but the "Family Guy" has sharp edges. The show is completely fearless. There is no true holy cow. Show lamps are handicap (physical and emotional), race, TV shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religions (especially Catholicism), drug use and addiction, all kinds of sexual humor (including S & M), and something beyond description. "Family Guy" does not throw everything to the audience's work, but overall, the show is consistently fun and often sunny. <br /> <br /> If there is any flaw with "Family Guy", then Jokes will sometimes run too long. Especially with "painful moments" jokes, the sequences are extended for such a long time that it is not only fun, it becomes very annoying (and long) that a fast-forward button is strengthened. It can be effective in about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes crosses more than two minutes. Someone can claim that this review revises its rules according to the plot and it often (for example, Brian often works like a person, but he works like a dog if needed for the story). But this is not a problem because the show still works. <br /> <br /> Some people have argued that the show has been fun. Although I agree that it was not as effective as it used to be, I think defect is false with Fox, McFarlane and not his crew. The show is produced by Fox, but after some poor ratings and audience turnout, it is canceled. However, the DVD sales were big enough to pick it up by adult swimming. The show became an instant success, and it was again bought by Fox. However, the show is so big now, because Fox is afraid to test the authors and try to do something new. Although it's still funny, humor is not fresh and lively. <br /> <br /> Check this show for sure. It's awesome.
