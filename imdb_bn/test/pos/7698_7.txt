The plot of "Sally of the Sawdust" is a normal maildrammatic stuff - an orphan, scandal-to-riches - but the film has taken the maximum silence of three people: <br /> <br /> It is not, of course, Master Graduate of DW Griffith, But it shows her filmmaker's intelligence in full maturity. He used all his inventions, the ability to change the ability to act as a player nowadays: close-ups, cross-cutting, a mobile camera and a theatrical acting role of cinema mistress. <br /> <br /> C. Fields also show their skills - not the signature of their signature guru, but their extraordinary skills as a physical comedian. He did some innovative joggling work, cut very small to fully appreciate, and some very stolen pickupting, but it seems that every prominent comic effect in reach - cap, rattan, car roof, dog, cash goes to manipulute. He is a joy to see. Finally, there is a carol dempster. There is a lot to say about this actress, but her performance here is quite ridiculous. He then plays a teenager at the age of 22 and his attitude towards the role is the combination of grace and absurdity that can not be completely credible, but when he is on screen he is really involved - especially when he is dancing. She is not a beauty - though she is positively bright in one vision, where she is embroiled like a talamous sister - but her plain joins only with the character of Sally, especially at many moments when she is her guardian / "father." Small actors, if they are, can compete with Fields in the comedy, but Griffith gives every opportunity to match his top lady with his co-star, and the dempster is in his own hands.
