The river edge is not a beautiful film to watch but it's an incredible one. Many years ago I saw it, I really think it has the power to re-release or rebuild or may have some disappointment. Perhaps this film did not create any movie in the absence of young sub-continental disgust, such as a horror scary movie. It is based on a true story, it is even more annoying. Very well played and vague to watch many times but a small known masterpiece and a really important film. All highschools should be made mandatory to watch the nationwide display. Fantastic
