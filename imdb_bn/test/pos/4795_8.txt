Spanish director Luis Bonuell has played for almost 50 years from 1929 to 1977. Finally, during his exile in Mexico, he made his best films - from the beginning of the 20th century to the beginning of the 60s. There he had to deal with a very cheap budget, and worked in the industry, mainly to make commercial films slower to the overwhelming audience, yet he was able to create interesting, thoughtful films, which stood in the examination. This film is based on Spanish novel Benito Perez, based on a novel by Glodos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, although this setting turned into Mexico instead of Spain's 20th century in the early 20th century. The dramatic heroine, a priest who tries to lead a faithful life determined by Christ, is faithful to it. Many would ask, would such efforts be made without the coercion, animosity and humor of your colleague? As it happens, he is suffering from a lot of anger, yet he is steadfast in this purpose (up to the controversial final shot). I think Bunuyel wanted to show Nazrul as a somewhat ridiculous personality, but perhaps unknown, his disappointment (at least to this observer) comes as commendable. In any case, a great film.
