When I watched this movie I was in my middle age, and I got hurt due to the beauty of the young waves as well as love cinematography and easy concrete of the story. I am surprised to know that Alvinja died recently, that Barry has apparently not worked in the film business for almost 30 years, and both of them will be in the 50's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw the movie poster, billing it as "Dix Enfants Quis'Aiment", which clearly means "two children who like each other" - the short description of the English language distributors was wise! <br /> <br /> 15 year old son Paul, an English businessman living in Paris, shows an orphan Michelle in the zoo. The two take Michelle's late father's rural hut as a holiday holidays, but he is separated from last year and stayed there for a year. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant, and is alone in their home. After the baby was born, the police came to Paul's work and took him away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " So sad that "Friends" was not released from the DVD.
