No reviews (critics, IMDb users or mine) will not let you influence this movie. I just read the evidence of the plot and became the plot. After watching, this opinion, in my opinion, is definitely worth seeing. It gives a view that many people probably do not think. But Liland himself does not say that "a movie that can be wrapped up with a bow and a free package". Other users' reviews on this website claim to have a mental background and the story is not valid. In most cases they miss the whole point of the movie, which is frustrating. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the story does not look good, but if you think that the movie is not good, you miss something. My opinion is unqualified for identifying it as "Art House", but our society likes labels, it probably fits it. If you know that you know everything about the world ... I suggest you skip this. If you think the movies should be a form of escape from "the world" ... you can not find it here. But if you see it ... you can find something in yourself.
