In addition to a tricky and well-developed diversity on the superbly popular horror section and an excellent formula for attracting potentially new fans, I have always considered "grandfather" every decade as a massive monster veneration of the genre for decades. Although not only targetable to younger viewers and / or those who only show interest in the latest horror movies, there are obvious and low-quality references to classic and influential titles in each single episode. From that point of view, the authors call "Duel" (Steven Spielberg's acclaimed debut) and "car" before paying tributes to the film, and especially for the time 70's milestones are payable to the movie. Being a bright fan of these two films, I've enjoyed the "Route 666" even with errors and flaws. This episode is intense and atmospheric open on the remote Missouri street, where a black man is hunted and eventually dies behind the wheel with a maceing monster truck with the driver. The victim's daughter may be the ex-girlfriend of Casey Dean, and she calls on Winchester Brothers for help. Before the sudden appearance of the ghost-truck, the brothers can not withstand two similar "accidents", as well as returning to the 60-year-old ethnic conflict, as well as some of the prominent residents of the small town, along with Casey's parents. Here are some of my fellow critics who tend to label some of the weak entries in the "Season 666" season, mainly because the script is very publicistic about racial problems and shows a different and more emotional aspect of Dean's character. He is usually the strongest mum type, where he faces the incomparable romantic thing from the past. At a certain stage I agree with the racial debate, but it did not really bother me. The authors had finally given an explanation in the presence of the ghost truck, and as much as the racial conflict my concern is acceptable. Regarding Dean's Emotional Weakness, I was able to see how the writers constantly tried to provide depth and detail of the main characters. Dean's behavior towards Cassie actually sheds a whole new light on her. Alongside, the fact that this episode is actually counted is surprisingly terrible truck and its deadly attack. It is an impressive and overpowering vehicles, producing obscure lighting and grisly engine noise. If you worship the bright "dewel" before, you certainly will have some pleasure in the series of chase pictured on "root 666".
