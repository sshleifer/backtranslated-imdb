One of the best silent plays I've seen. Whatever the German Expressionists produced, like dark and galactic, but the characteristics of a different and natural performance for the day. No strange smile due to any camera mugging and intelligent eye-waving histrionics. Szostrom has given a strong performance as a narcotics, money-rich and fearful David Hall. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Less use of original lighting and annoying widespread. <br /> <br /> There was a feeling of deep, and generally scandinavian, disappointment and disappointment of the story: The film started rather rather in a rather serious presence, and then we talk about the story of David Hole in a series of Flashbacks (and Flashbacks for Flashbacks - 1921 A beautiful complex story structure), where his character has been given many possibilities for release, a  ন্তু তিনি সেগুলি গ্রহণ করেন না এবং আমরা জানি না তিনি তাদের গ্রহণ করা, কারণ আমরা তাকে মাতাল মরতে দেখেছি এবং দুঃখী ও বর্তমানের মতোই গড়ব। I saw all the scenes in the movie, like the darkness of darkness. <br /> <br /> Writing and instruction by today's standards is strong and intelligent. In many cases, Sjostrom skillfully sets up the listener suspect one thing, and then pulls out of a surprise. The last few viewers may not be so surprised, but I did not see it. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely restored and DVD releases are eligible. Even a bogus budget released. It must be out of order so that people can see and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which is up to 10/10
