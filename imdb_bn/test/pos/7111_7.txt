One year after the publication of the average "Frankenstein's House", Universal releases another mind of the mind, where all their famous characters will be reunited. The "House of Dracula" will reconnect Dracula to Frankenstein's creature and Wolf Man for their final war, and eventually stop an era for the studio. Ail c. Again, the "House of Dracula", directed by Kitten, introduces little but significant improvements in the previous movie, and gives a better (though still flawless) story that is perfect, better off than the previous movie. <br /> <br /> This story is " House of Frankenstein "ignores most of the previous entries and presents a new angle in the story Do it. Tired Drakulah (John Carabin) about being hidden during sunlight, famous physician for biological research. Help Edelman (Onoslaw Stevens) Adeleman was fascinated by Draculla, and soon started a trial treatment, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), Wolf Man, at the medieval time, met with Adeleman to get rid of his curse. Soon Adeleman realized that Dracula was a demon that had to be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood also developed a disease in him. When discovered in the Catacombs near Frankenstein's giant (Glen Strange), the bright scientist may show more misery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The almost straight-forward Gothic horror of returning to the dark frustrating nature of these films and moving away from comic relief from previous entries Provides The story (Edward T. Looye Jr.), has many interesting themes, such as Dracula and Talbot (both seeking healing, but for various purposes) and Edelman's growing frenzy. Probably the most interesting themes include Nina's character, it is an extraordinary but distorted woman who said. Help Edelman help to cure his condition. <br /> <br /> Director Errell C Kenton again came back. At this point, he finally took the dark complexion of these three letters, which is a nature that was apparently lost in the previous movie. In spite of the low budget, Kenton creates a gothic horror, which makes it easy to present but effective and old partners in such a new way. Although it was never at the root level, the "House of Dracula" was restored by the glittering of the Universal Studios that Kenyans had ensured that at least the monsters got the chance to be bright. <br /> <br /> This movie was very good, Carsrin, Chaney and Strange reiterated their role (though Strang's role was quite small) with more enthusiasm than the previous movie. Unsoul Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha Odyskol take the Cast Tragedy and drama back to the series, Stevens Dr. Adeleman has a great acting. The Lionel Attil's small cameo and the presence of Skeletton Nugs are full of old stereoscopic old world-class films in one of the oldest years. <br /> <br /> An excellent addition to the series "House of Dracula" series. , Especially after the medieval "Frankenstein House". Canton looks very nice to look back as a terrible movie, and although the plot is quite original, it is not only due to budget, but the film tries to run very low runtime very badly. No results. It is true that the characters are all the lines of the most innovative story, but the film dedicates them for a very short time to develop for everyone, and the film seems to be very slow and disturbed. <br /> <br /> Even though it is perfect, it is also the worst series. "House of Dracula" is a wonderful bond of the best times of horror, when the ghosts and horses roam around the clock in a time, and the mad scientist gives life to demon monsters. Later, the monsters will return to "Bud Abbott and Laou Costello Milan Frankenstein" (1948), but this is a completely different context. After the frustrating previous entries, the "House of Dracula" is easy to dismiss, but this is an opportunity and let the giant walk around for the last time. 7/10
