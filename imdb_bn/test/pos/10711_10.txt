I just love this movie and it is shown on November 2 to record it again on my TV. It's really really love story with a twist. The song that is played at the end of the movie is not a big hit, but it is a song that is on your head and I am now trying to find the song so that I can hear it and play it. I really do not want to listen to any styles or songs from the shows and open to me to open something new to me. I want to say that there are some parts in this movie which is not to see the whole family. This movie shows skin. It's Kinda like a lifetime movie for women, for women. I can watch movies and you just like I liked it.
