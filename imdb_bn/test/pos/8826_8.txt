Each time the supposed explorer and we, the listener, preferred for establishing the first sights of its unique new worlds, for some unreasonable reasons, the filmmakers "Emergency" or some false alarms or some artificial dramatic suspensions. Instead of enjoying the AoOr page quietly, or instead of focusing on standing on the saturnine or focusing on comets or asteroids flying by asteroids, we have become disturbed by the concern about fitness and survival. Big Letting Down !!!! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem to be uncertain what they want. Our documentary of the natural wonders of the solar system, or a mysterious thriller, is more concerned about the characters than the audience. Come on. <br /> <br /> Hello. If I wanted suspense and tension, then I would like to see a real dramatic movie. <br /> <br /> Of course this is a doc-drama. But characters and their survival (such as a mission will be risk-related topics). wait. Yes, the risks of such mission are an important part of the issue - since it is about a space mission not just a solar system but a movie. But we were frustrated and confused by the invention of new ways, we were going to enjoy. <br /> <br /> The film was extraordinary for giving a real feel to the human element, a quarrel, tension, responsibility, close fatal errors, sacrifices etc. in a spacecraft. It will fit very well in hard-cipai-fi-subgeners - this can actually be the best, because the science is closely followed here. <br /> <br /> But confusion was awful. I do not see the effects of having space for astronauts for many years after landing on earth. Not even that
