I found this library's DVD based on a jacket note, perhaps it could be interesting: a black comedy was set in France in 1940, just as the Germans are running. ("Boy, these must be rolling in them. Aisles ??") but it does! This is a tricky, original, suspicious and funny movie. Do not recall I see something like before ?? Foreign or American writers / directors can find laughs when we get to know part of the results (Germans will occupy France for four years) Excellent She enjoyed part of the joy of it with such charm. Even before a couple of serious moments start up as a black comedy and fluff ?? A cache of "heavy water" (which was the primary research part for a bomb) and the introduction of the Critical Vechea Government, introduced the History 101, which in most cases would rule south France. German occupation * But no one is scared of you: The film is coming forward with fun, charming and romantic and endless clips. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is that we have seen many times the combination of actors (Adjney and Depardieu) and others we've never heard of before. Along the way, there are two ways to create stars: Virginia Lloyden and Gregory Dangerz. Both are impressive, but Mr Derang√®re is especially so. According to IMDB, was he in ten films before this ?? But he won Cesar as the "most promising actor" for this role, so obviously he was not even well known in France. Is he romantic lead and comic actor adjustment ?? And he makes all seem so prevalent. Can you remind Kerry Grant "Up Benefiting Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace" ?? Comedy can be hard to find because the reasons are very risky that the actors may come to look unexpected. But Grant was charmingly pulled off, and this guy too. I think we're going to hear more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> Be sure, this picture will not please everyone ?? There are some violence, although you do not see anything on TV every day. But if you are looking for something original, then you have seen that you have found the cinematic gem. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" in this comment
