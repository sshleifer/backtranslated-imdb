Acting keeps you guessing the first rates and intrigues of a great suspenseful thriller. This well-performed and directed movie is based on real story and good evaluation, when Joe Penny is very well cast and Anne Jillian is a strong believer as a worrying and fearful sister. Joe again proves that he is amazing in acting and finishing well done. It is valuable to watch, hopefully they will repeat it on any channel, I must record it. It's worth your time for Penny and Jillian fans. If you still can try to buy it, rent it. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great one.
