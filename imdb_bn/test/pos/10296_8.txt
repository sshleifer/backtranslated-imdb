The recent terrible American remake was forgotten, which sadly damaged the fame of the French due to the involvement of the director of the two. It's a packing-drawn romantic 90s with many twists and turns in the silent. This works well in the hitcoak rear window as the gallery ode, because the cruelty concept is a continuous theme that removes complex screenplays. A story like Picasso painting has been incredibly appreciated, proposing many perspectives in the same event and claiming participation by the audience. Excellent contribution from setting, music and hunting scores wonderful as well as cast. See it once.
