As listed and stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and components in its credits. In fact, it is seen and seen again more than 20 years after it was originally sent, and it follows a huge global fan, which indicates that the creators of this series definitely have some rights. <br /> <br> The brightness and extraordinary appeal of the series depends on inevitably written dialogue and uninterrupted characters? Which is brought to life by all the wonderful actors. Characters are especially surprising due to their complexity. In contrast to many other Robin Hood adaptations, and indeed many other movies and TV productions, good people in this series often make mistakes and errors can be seen, although bad, though bad and ruthless, often understood and seems too sympathetic to the occasion. This too Sherwood Robin makes multifaceted, a story about real people ?? Rather than good and bad people ?? Something which adds to its uniqueness and extraordinary appeal too. Also, although there are a number of action-packed series that are composed of many amazing stunts (which are extraordinary to show themselves, it's today's computer animation, green screen, and much earlier created). During the castle, the horse, and the fire catch, in fact there is a real person who at any time set a fort wall or a horse or a fire), there is always a wonderful dialogue between the different characters of each episode. In the final analysis, however, it is usually the series' Baddies ?? Nicholas Grace as Nottingham's Sheriff, Robert Eddy as Gisberg's Sir Guy, and Philip Jackson the Abbott as Hugo de Rennol ?? Those who get very good lines and who often have more intelligence to steal the show with their arguments full of intelligence and authentic. "It's a wedding, not a celebration!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> made for television ?? And apparently not with a great deal ?? For the benefit of small children in Great Britain on Saturday afternoon, to provide entertainment. In cute locations, shiny, with amazing scripts and featuring extraordinary stunts and superb performers? Many of these show their performance in this program? In many ways it seems to be professionally produced and more production value than the Hollywood movie.
