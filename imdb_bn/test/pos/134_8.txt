(Edited for this place) <br /> <br /> The new movie on Chan-Uk Park is a complex film that is not easy to categorize. Generally a horror movie, central character is a vampire, the film actually contains comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural attack (and analog to the body of viral attack), romance and other things. This is a movie which is almost too much of her mind. The film takes its own subjects and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Emil Zola's "Theres Rakien" It's a weird mix that is not always jail, but there is no incredible power to lose. I have seen it for 24 hours, and my feet are growing rapidly by seeing the Lincoln Center (with the discussion of a post by the director). There are not many things that are annoying, its more elaborate stories and their themes bark many hours in past observations. <br /> <br /> The choice of pastor of this photo is deciding that the best way is to volunteer for a medical examination to find a cure for mankind a terrible disease. He eventually died and died after being infected with the disease, but he actually survived because of the blood transfusion (not explained by this) infection. As a miracle worker, the priest goes back to the hospital where he is serving the sick. Unfortunately not all good. The priest found that he needed blood to survive. He found that he had all the problems of a vampire, and it is not possible to go out for the day. Things became more complicated when he became acquainted with his childhood friend and his family. The priest, some of his creates awakens awakening with his friend's wife. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By an opportunity event and finds that he is no longer He was This is a movie that you have to stay at the end because the film is always evolutionary in something else. It's a movie that has played a great deal on her mind and has been playing with themes. They are constantly searching in different ways <br /> <br /> This film is going on quite a lot and probably people can do this, write a book discussing the picture. <br /> <br /> Two of the most powerful parts of the film are bright and vampire parts of the story of his romance story. How does it make such a perfect concept of ground rules and "sad" nature that it keeps aside old vampire ideas? I saw myself as astonished by how well I affected myself while sitting in the theater last night. The events that I play less or less directly on it are so shaking the earth. Here is a vampire who just wants to get a normal life. Contrary to what happens, it makes it clear that the livelihood of the victims is not really going to work. It's not the dark world of titles or lost boys, but it's something else. I personally think that the movie changes the field from the hip cold idea or dream to more real and realistic. (Power where kick power is just great way) Romance is also surprisingly managed. Definitely sexual scenes are steamy and good work, but it makes other things, looks, conversations, gestures beyond sex which makes this special. I see love, forbidden couples being hungry for each other as hunger and unable to work, both real and suspicious betrayal and frustration, and potentially potentially crazy emotions. This is one of the great screen romance of all time. It perfectly captures the feelings of passion (passion and desire) and deep emotions. If you really loved me, then I guess you will get some part of your voice on the screen, I know I did it. The statement "I just wanted to spend eternity with you" is a sad poignancy. It's both a motive and a statement of what the depth of passion is. Sad romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great. The pieces are as good and almost all are not great (especially the actors I fail to perform incredibly uncommonly failures) always do not come together. Different styles, thematic components and tones occasionally holes against each other. Often I was wondering where the movie was going. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The choice is more than a piece of film. It screams around my head, and I guess it will do it for a few more days. Likes or love is irrelevant, because it is a film that should really be seen because it is so much running that it will supply you enough material and talk a few days later. One of the year's most sweet and most filling films.
