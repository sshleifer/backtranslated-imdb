I did not know much about what I'm going to do about this picture, but I learned that Cain was a wrestler who did not make me thriller but hey, I liked "Santa Slay" and there was a wrestling in it, so what is hell? The story starts very curiously and promisingly, but after a while your ideal teenage is not much more than a terrorist flush, although the settings have helped some. A group of criminal youth became round and took to an old hotel that is used as a luxurious palace, but now it is a dump, to make it clean for preparing for homeless shelter. The driver is a man with a traditional hand, an elderly man in the opening scene of this movie, where he faces this big glove that killed his partner and blinded another woman. Teenagers, all are fools intelligent, they are objectives for all practical work, but they are part of some unique co-editor program, yes, of course, a great idea. Some people suspect that someone in the hotel is hiding that he will save some money from the state tax payers on his own little way. Of course, this is a guy who likes to collect eye ribs, and he's got a lot of collections. There will be nothing much to do that the horror fans have not seen before but there are some brutal scenes and enough grooms to satisfy the hard-core fan. The old hotel setting creates a perfect spot for a slash flick and has some short sub-stories, meaning meaningful safe money and children's search, because these co-editor workers are evenly matched. At the age of teens, it is very dangerous to work so well. Much better than silent hills, but not much better, or when a stranger calls, and probably better than anything else I do not want to see. 10 out of 7
