In this impressive comedy, Chadlin enters the WWI archives, which never disappoints the horrors of the war. Rain, Mud, Explosion - These things are there, but Chaplin seems odd to them unconsciously. He is in France for one thing: To fight with the Germans, he does something incredibly successful. It seems almost like an extended ego trip to Chaplin - it's a very interesting one - that's it - until the last moment when it is raised in a new dimension poignancy and makes sense to everything. <br /> <br /> What is probably the dream of all the soldiers before the war?
