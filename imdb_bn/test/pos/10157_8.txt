James Stewart Dr. Ben McKenna played, who is touring an Arab city with his wife and son. They were caught in the middle of a murder scene. The victim blurts some of Dr. McKenna's ear, and is asked to do something. <br /> <br /> Later, his son was kidnapped. The kidnappers know of being a man and a woman, but that woman is a little soft compared to men. <br /> <br /> The song "Kui, Best, Best" (Anyway we'll go, we're Stuart's wife of Doris Day, and she's singing the song mentioned above. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
