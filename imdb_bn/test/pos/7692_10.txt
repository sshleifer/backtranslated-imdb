I watched this movie when I was young and have been looking for it since then. Films showcased by Americans of African Americans must have rated it with The Sky, Stormy Weather, and Carmen Jones cabin. Local Los Angeles TV stations will have a movie of the week and some stations show the same movie for 5 days. Pourgi and the base were among them, and my whole family was removed in the 5 nights in front of the TV and there advertised there. South Pacific, Oklahoma and Sound of Music are all music classics that you can get to a video store. It is embarrassing to forget about forgetting this collection or locking the Vault in America's best talent. Please make the movie available to the public.
