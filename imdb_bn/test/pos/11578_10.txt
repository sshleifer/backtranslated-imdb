I have seen 'The Sea Soo' today and I like it. The film's actors are wonderful (of course, especially Javier Bardem), but I thought that Ryan would have a good role to play. Lola Dayunas, Clara Segura, and especially, the Mabel River explains excellent. And I can not forget Selbo Buglalo and Joan Dalamau (hero's brother and father). <br /> <br /> I love the two technical aspects: Photography of Aguareserbeb and Amenbar's score. I like the song 'Negra Monday' ('Dark Shadow') with the song of Carlos Nunez's song "Los Cassal". <br /> <br /> I think the Spanish Academy will have to choose 'inside the ocean'. Order for the Oscars Award Competition I liked other Spanish productions, such as 'bad education' of Aldodawar, but Amnabar's picture is much better than them. There are all the prizes for 'inside the ocean'.
