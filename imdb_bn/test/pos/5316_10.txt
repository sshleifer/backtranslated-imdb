My God, Ryan Gosling has created many deep characters in his career, it's one of his wonderful acting deeds. For me it is a very deep movie, because it is not difficult to see, because it is not difficult to see, if you understand it, but if you put your shoes across this shoe, though everything is there and a famous father who is a writer, he has a deep mind, You can not understand why he killed this poor child, until you really hear what you said and you start to think, at least to me, that many Chu he said is true. Simple child, sweet, very gentle, natural like a teen, but he is suffering very much inside, because he has started to see the world differently, then he realizes why he did what he did. I recommend this movie to those who love deep drama.
