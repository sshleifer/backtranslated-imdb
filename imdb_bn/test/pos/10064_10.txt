I saw this movie before, but I could not remember it was fantastic: it was a fun plot, with Momona Pumas fumbles around the city etc. And the music is just perfect! And happy! That girl is a great choice for romantic people like me. In my opinion it may even be the best Madonna movie I've ever seen! 10/10
