I was very impressed with this picture which was directed (Luigi Buzzoni). The story was a young translator who suddenly lost the last three days and had nightmares of moon astronauts. He can not explain how this happened to anyone. One day a postcard for her from the island of Hermag, where she went. Curiously though he was never there before, though people seem to know him. The moon's astronauts also come back to him. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very weird Italian movie, which seemed very disappointing at times and there was also a weird picture that you had been living with. I would recommend to see just how good this picture is to humans. Highly recommended!
