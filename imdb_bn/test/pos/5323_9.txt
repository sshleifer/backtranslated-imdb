This is a movie that really lets you think about your life, our culture, family structure and the situational work. I do not plot this post, I think others already beat me in it. Despite reading the comments on this site, you will take the opportunity and watch this movie for yourself. I went to see this picture with my husband and friend and I would say that there was total silence in the theater after the movie was over. After a few minutes I looked back at me and all went on the screen in the theater, lost in the thought. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What is all? <br /> <br /> My questions are not intended to endorse or humiliate the activities of the Leyland. I do not want my opinion about that which you would take from this movie, so that I do not give it. See it for yourself. I still think I'm trying to answer many of my questions from the film. I enjoyed it extensively and hope you too will. This image is not trying to answer questions, does not take any action or punish any punishment. This movie is trying to evaluate our lives and stop the pink glasses that most of us see the world. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 9 out of 10
