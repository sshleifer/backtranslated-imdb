An impure person, known as Bill, lives in a small dairy flat with a poster of Marilyn Monroe from the wall and his typewriter company. Only people can not think of anything to write. He followed the people and wandered the streets, to see where they went. Maybe this will write some inspiration to him. She started following a well-dressed man holding a bag. He followed him for a few days. While in a cafe, a guy dressed up sitting under a table opposite the bill and inquired about why the bill was following him. The man wearing good clothes named him Cobb. Then surprisingly the bill said that he steals and stole stuff and even bills in the house to steal things; Although Cobb insists he does not just go to other people's homes to steal others. He said that he wants to inform the people that he is there, and they stop the things they grant. For example, he puts the duplick in another person's trousers, from another stealer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo is also called Flashback. The director used this technique to broaden abundance in his latest feature Memento. Bill finally decided on Cobb's advice, cut her hair and a suit dress. He met a blonde lady in a club, who owns a cold man, who uses very dangerous dates, he says. We have seen a scene where the lady of the neck uses elephants on the man's fingers of a man's fingers. Directors show us that some of this piece of the puzzle is something, and when we reach the wonderful conclusion they will be suitable everywhere.
