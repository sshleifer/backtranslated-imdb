This is the best movie ever, but that's my opinion. Some people say it's Chess but I really think it's a beautiful film. Chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Sozez is not like any other scene, and it makes movies so perfect. I always wonder if these two actors do not exist, then what will happen to this movie, because only one did not do this for me, they both did. If you have never seen this movie, then you will understand when you understand it. The Dirty Dance looks like it has been to the heart and it sounds like magic- and soundtrack seems to be real for love. Besides, two main actors Soundtrack makes the film a beauty. You can say that I love this movie, and I know you too.
