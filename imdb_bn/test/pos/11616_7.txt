Well, it's safe to say that the subconscious is a strange movie! An insight into insight into the human mind, the subconscious crew is composed of four macabre and wicked stories of the extreme. The first part, titled 'OwenIan Iball', is really a warm up, but it is good to see what the audience can expect from the next three categories. It only shows a nude female equipped on a table, another woman cuts it in her stomach and pulls out of a man's eye! I've got no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes for visceral viewing. The following story is the best of the bunch, and the "old favorites" of the lawlessness take the sick movie theme. The segment follows a man who lives alone in his pregnant sister. She was disturbed during her pregnancy - yet she wants to have sex with him, and naturally she gets her way. This story is stark because of the boring and 'material affair' description - which fails to provide flashbacks. This segment is well-behaved, well illustrated and easily subconsciously highlights pride. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the next two sections are not as good as the second; So the only way down there, but the director Karim Hossain still managed to pull out some of the bags before the end of the film. The third party is the weakest of the film, and he does not do so because only many people show sexual relations to the soil. This is very real, and therefore memorable for the same reason; But there does not seem to be many points, and I was in the mood of some second after the second division. The film ends in the end, but when I'm not quite sure what the point was - the final segment has the best imagery of the film. This section focuses on religion, and of course it is not valuable for anyone! Director Karim Hossain has achieved something - although this collection of four 'extreme' stories is not fully integrated, the film is often thought sensitive because it shoots in a rowdy and attractive view. The director seems to be imitating highly respected guest director Luis Bu√±uel, although with gore, rape and turmoil; And if you ask me, he did a bad job at all. Not for everyone, but a look for extreme fanatics is definitely worth!
