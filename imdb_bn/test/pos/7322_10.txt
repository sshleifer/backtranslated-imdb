This is a specific Stuoad shortcut which actually uses slapstick, a annoying mockery. As mentioned, the title and concept of this short story was "borrowed" from the same year as a feature film by Clark Gehlell's "Man in White". It is basically the trials of trial and trial and their sacred reasons for "duties and humanity". I recently saw it and almost treated it like a stag version because it took very seriously. In any case, the Motion Picture Academy has nominated it as the best prize in the 1934 comedy, not to mention so well written, directed and not to mention the original, it did not take any ideas from Chaplin or anyone else. It is lacking in some strange words "La Cuccaraca" and stole the prize. Some producers will have to be on the board of the Academy's father-in-law. "Men in the Black" Max Broos is always the only way to have fun with the overall concept of medical practice at this time. Can not be a fair comparison but I can see Marx Bros in this brief. Actually there is a scene in their character "Race at A Day" where "medical matters" are going on and they naturally create anarchy. I guess this short summary was judged with those lines and why it was nominated at first place. Actually try it out: See this short piece first and then watch "Duck Soup" or "Day at A Races" with Marx and then see that the comedy does not have the same great quality.
