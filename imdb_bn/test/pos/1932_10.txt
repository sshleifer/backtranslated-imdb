This is an event that has been printed more than once and before I can see this movie in Sheffield before Christmas, I used to read two books 'Away Voice for Madman' and 'The Strange Last Voice of Donald Crowhurst'. I would like to say that on Sunday, 1968, it has exceeded all expectations in all the stories of the Times Golden Globe yacht race. These men started doing any work which could not bring the world into a supporting pots, wooden boats, satellite phones, a GPS, and a piece with only their wit and expertise. For one hour, the molten southern ocean, little sleep, and in the boat, often a few months of travel around them literally was not mentioned. <br /> <br /> This documentary brings together my opinion, with a well-educated, well-read description. Archive footage and interviews bring interesting and life stories. The footage of Claire Crowhart's interview was specially published and ongoing because she left her husband Donald Kroherst's departure from Tigenmouth, doubts and fears in her mind, and her reaction as a response to the subsequent events. I was removed and tear the tears or both of them until the credit started, and screamed other people by expressing similar feelings. <br /> <br /> The two books mentioned above are useful for more detail and back story which can not be applied within 90 minutes and I will also recommend them. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of people's courage and human weakness. Must watch for a sailing, adventure, human effort and anyone interested in real life heroes.
