This movie has two new features, with the same message published in the film about death penalty and death penalty. The drama driven by the parents of the victim is also given - because of which the annihilation of hatred and vengeance vitiates or diminishes the fear of representing the death penalty - and the Christian view of all questions refers. We certainly see the convicted person in this film in other films related to the death penalty, is not a simple innocent person who does not give up on the idea that we do not do much more than the punitive legal killings. Ultimately, at least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight in the last moments of execution with all the catharsis displayed by the last words of the death penalty and parallel to the details of the details of which execution is executed. Standing in the pressure to impose scenes of murder in the forest, it seems that we are consistent with other murders, but as soon as there was later, in a cold and supposed "legal" system.
