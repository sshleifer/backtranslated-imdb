I recently bought "Big Trill" {1930}. This is an amazing, amazing film. I knew it by fame but it is not expected to be so great. My version is a shot of 35 mm and I will talk about that again. When someone is thinking of western myths in the film, the nominee is John Ford and John Wayne. Well, here you have half of the teams, but the whole economy is present. Raoul Walsh has given us an extraordinary epic, which is the real struggle, the struggle for the expansion of the western part of the nation. <br/> <br /> There is a centerpiece of a romance between Break Coleman (Wayne) and Ruth Cameron (Margaret Churchill), who played the role of Tyron Power, a classically played Red Flyck with the original villain. But can it almost advance the quality of the advances against incredible obstacles? Both natural and human? For example, the river crossing, Indian war, and the burning desert. Just after the war, when a doll dies a faithful dog on the tomb of his head, a doll is placed on a doll's tomb. <br /> <br /> Great panorama is full of energy and activity. The wagon is preparing to leave the train, the intermediate of Square Dance and the great buffalo are some of the early spring spells. Wonderful use is shooting the location across. Another feature of this great movie is that, in the great struggle of West Bengal, men and women have been given equal pay of their parts. The women face terrible hardships with the same consistency and strength as the work, the fight, and their male opponents. Coleman and Cameron have a strongly raised experience in the final, as well as joining the huge junkyard in order to start their new life. <br /> <br /> acting is quite acceptable. I've already mentioned the performance of the scenes of the power of the tiren power. Talley Marshall is excellent as a streetman of Coleman, and Marguerite Churchill firmly develops a woman's inner strength that she faces in her own problems as well as her own external problems. Comic-Relief is the weakest aspect of this movie, but these scenes are not common and have been engrossed in film's extraordinary love. <br /> <br /> I have criticized Owen's performance ?? Some even blame their "wooden acting" for the failure of the film at the box office. I think this is inappropriate. Owen had his first major role and of course "stagecatch" did not improve his performance charisma. But he still plays a role in a job that is definitely going to play the second puzzle of the wonderful over-arching theme. After "The Big Trill", Wayne played a small low budget B Western. I have this number and one can see developing actors among them. When he came to "stagecatch" he was ready for it and "Big Trill" was a significant part of that beginnings. <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier that my version is 35 mm a shot. It's still impressive, but to get some idea about the effect of the 70 mm version, I set the TV screen 16: 9 which does not create any distortion. While not having the full impact of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to get me after me. {In addition to this, there are several additional scenes in the movie that is shot in the 70 mm, which are not ready for the general theater display}. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is the best in any list Western ever made.
