*** Spoilers ahead *** My late childhood had two cinematographic icons: Star Wars and check talent Karel Zeman this picture. Zeus Vern encyclopedia, where the fine images of XIX century live in black and white photography, combined with stop motion and conventional animations. Verne's spirit of courage is fully present throughout the film, as well as a very modern question about the moral limitations of power and advanced technology. In fact, it comes with a very elliptical and elegant way of bringing the atomic energy of Verne's universe. A (possibly nuclear) explosion sent in his hat flying over the ocean, along with the death of the volume is glue and elegant. The film's determination is symbolic and very satisfying, today is very rare, when many films do not seem to end up with themselves. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to resume this gem. Local TV at the end of the 70's: It enhances my love for fiction and film fame. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
