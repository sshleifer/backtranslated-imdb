This video was my first guest role, and I could not stop playing it for the last three days. Visuals are less dynamite and more innovative and technically complex than I have seen on the big screen or small. <br /> <br /> But losing the DVD point in addition to the new song point. The real residents' music is different from what you have heard, and really will keep your brain in the best possible way. But the new music is equally spontaneous and in most cases rather bad than the classic track. Also, the incomplete holiness fat video seems to be very incomplete, and I can only understand the plot of the story of the widely read disc notes. <br /> <br /> To tell disc notes, this DVD features are quite cool Easter eggs which will probably appeal to residents for long time. Hint: Find icons on note pages that should not be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical perspective, the disc is one of the best DVD transmissions. There is virtually no visible pixelization, and the slightest slightness in the opposite direction is quite small. <br /> <br /> Kudos for a top notch presentation. These discs really deserve your attention.
