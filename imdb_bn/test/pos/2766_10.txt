Susie Q is a great romantic prom movie. Emmy Joe Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I have done a great performance. I hope the Disney company can keep the movie in the DVD for a while. I think it's cool and a little ridiculous. It is very sad when the CJ question dies at the beginning of the car accident. It wants you to cry or mourn. But in the middle when it does not suspect Susie Q, it becomes fun and surprising. There is a mystery in this movie but there is not much. However, if I still enjoy the comedy, mystery, or romance, I would recommend this movie to the whole family. It's awesome! I think Sumie Joe Johnson is a clever guy like Sumi.
