This is the only opportunity to bring the magic of James Joes's life to life. His novels are all impossible (in any real sense) and he wrote this long story. It was John Houston's last film and did not reach the screen until his death, and it is easy to see the touch of his greatness. In his view of the Dead Screen poetic, we can tell more about Ireland and tell us about "troubles" compared to any modern film of IRA. Hopefully many more people will see this movie and experience both the experiences of John Houston and James Joyce, and perhaps you can see this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever).
