After watching and enjoying the original, I had my reservation to see the return of Lonesome Dove. Without rebuilding its role as Woodrow Call or Angelica Haston as Tommy Lee Jones Clador, I would not think it's fair enough purely. After seeing 'return', I can honestly say that this is a worthy successor. The actor really makes shows with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder, and Oliver Reed, preforming them all at their best. I admit that this story may not be as intense as the first, but the 'return' must explicitly divide and make the romance of the old West like some other films. Anyone still having reservations may be sure that the return of Lonesome Dove has succeeded in achieving 'feeling' of the original and will not be disappointed. Find yourself a favor and check it out, Ol 'Gass will be proud!
