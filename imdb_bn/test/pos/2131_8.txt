Although this film director and screenwriter deprived Michael Simino's career and United Artibrets, it is still one of the best films of all time. There are plenty of reasons to make sure the film is made prematurely. Among them: its length, its technical problems, the extensive torture of animals on the set - and goes on the list. And yet, for all of these, it's a film that holds something. This is one of the best examples of Stringen's analogical story - its moments can last forever until it is submerged for the real movie period. It seems real, in the moments of anger, love, and war (and hopelessness). This image should be seen by anyone who appreciates movies and stories.
