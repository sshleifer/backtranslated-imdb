This movie keeps you from opening scenes and never lets you go. After coming to America, you keep an eye on John Tszie's excitement. She is a likable fellow. As soon as his fate changes, when his desire is replaced by ugliness you still can not help him to love. You know that in its circumstances, you will be forced to make the same choice to survive. This movie commentes on the beauty of the society and all the themes of worship and it is even more true in the twentieth century culture. Janos himself became the victim of this philosophy when he said to his blind girlfriend "You are young and beautiful, if you can see, you will be in the world." And many modern gangsters take a powerful revenge when they face security threats. Her innocence is not completely lost, because she claims herself equal value, because she deserves his fortune. <br /> <br /> <br /> Only some actresses can perfect the transformation of this character from innocent to cruel criminals in eight seconds In Lori, it produces an original pair of all actors and not just a car for a star. With a little less publicity dialogue, this movie will be 10. Highly recommended.
