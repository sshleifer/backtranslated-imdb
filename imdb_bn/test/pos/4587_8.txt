You can read all kinds of references in the world of Ishashi. This concept is among other examples of HG Wells' "Time Machine" and Aludus Huxley's other "Currents New World" coming from a future-era technology by kissing-dawn, self-fascinating slogans. <BR> <br /> At the beginning of the film, a narrator has explained the rapid degradation of humanity for more than five hundred years, but it does not fulfill all the empty technologies already coming from future technology. Most of this funny (and funny) film criticism surrounds this boycott and the worldwide accusations that the world is not "realistic". Such "realism" has never been a satirical quality. "Brazil" is realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Hell, how about "Gliwice Travels"? I did not think "Idiocracy", though not perhaps indicated as the best style, hits the same note and usually works so successfully. <br /> <br /> Also, I could not find the future technology to be a problem. Mike Judges is satirizing the current trend towards automation and easy product interfaces, it is fairly easy that it can even use them even total stupid. As "brave new world", the film society seems to have reached the automatic self-sufficiency at some time in the past (apparently now created by extinct intelligence people to create increasingly stupid public)), the worst of the humanity is the worst, most selfish feelings are covered. They may even go away and they may even be stupiders. The film can be the last odor of humanity, because everything becomes better. It may still be "unreal", but if so, it's a brand of great brand that is unusually great. <br /> <br /> Stupid people mostly take time to screen, but of course they are victims - they do not know any better. Michael judges defend his true hatred for the power of the intelligent man in power, who died at the beginning of the film, but in the 21st century, who is very alive. Like scientists who follow "hair growth and prolonged curvature", without any possibility that for some reason their snake-oil treatments can make profits. Like politicians, who allow corporations to purchase FDA and FCC only. The opinions of the media officers and their stupas develop stupid people who are able to instil all cultures, morals and health in a hurry. <br /> <br /> Finally, those who really blame, Morlocks or? Paris Hilton, or the bright executor of the world and advertisers that keeps him on TV and reduces our cultural standard to leave us there? All these "idiocracy" though are intrinsic. Here's a line, there is a hint (the light-hearted auto-doctor gives testimony that literally works all over the healthcare system). This is a few aspects of the movie which does not spread on the ground by an unnecessary storyteller. It's not for the audience to choose or not, but it's one of the most appealing themes of a movie that is much smarter than any other comedy of the year. <br /> <br /> So many people who leave the film, it seems to be shown behind the back of the farting and hit the lane. That stuff is not very funny, and probably it's not a mad. But "Odyssey" does not seem that it's easy.
