Christopher Nawalan's director debut is a memorable one. The film got very well and helped land agreement to create 'memo' and so it is perfectly correct. <br /> <br /> A great example of how a movie should be made. No fancy effect or blood-topping ... just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan managed to fascinate us with his writings again. Actors, all unknown to me and I guess most people, bring bringing a good working character. All of them were believable and that they would be all in. The film is confusing because it plays a lot with Croatian, but it is ultimately very rewarding. Although the film is a little smaller than a full-length feature, any extra length destroys the style of the film and the brightness of the writing decreases. Although brief, the film has an aspect that makes the film attractive (IMO): a playful start, an exciting middle and a wonderful ending. <br /> <br /> I boldly said that I often like Memento, his best film. Bachelor Culture Both the pictures are equally brainy, amazing plot twists present and very well played. <br /> <br /> This image is made only with $ 6000, but more than most of the quality (almost all) million dollar box office hits. For bigger and audible audience, B & W can be a hard pill used to make, initially Nalan has demonstrated his skills to studio owners :-) And what skills do they ... rarely have I enjoyed writing many as 'follow'. Even PI does not even come up to the IMO, although it is very good. <br /> <br /> This film does not guarantee that it can not be missed by a self-respecting film lover. If you like Memento, then 'Follow' is definitely for you.
