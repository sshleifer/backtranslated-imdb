Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes Flying (Letit Jururvali) is a proud part of the film. From the screenplay of Victor Rozov based on his own play, Kalatozov dreams us of the war and the rest of the people living at home. Show boundaries and killings in front of us with endless war movies, the matter itself is tedious and can be avoided. However, the story of how this Russian jewel shows how the pain can be said otherwise; We hate every one of the soldiers directly in front of a soldier, they hope that those who have died have done for a cause that will end the peace and war, we see WWII's new perspective. Our youth volunteers to stay safe instead of staying safe in the house instead of keeping their loved ones safe, volunteer, family and family for peace for the sake of peace. Our current situation in the Middle East and so much hatred towards the people are being killed due to their will, it looks beautiful to see a movie that shows how neutral and heroic these soldiers are and are waiting for their return as well. <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how all involved were in war. Boris could have volunteered to go to the frontline, his father was the chief doctor of a hospital to help injured wounded soldiers and his sister is helping him and his daughter Veronica, which he could keep away from his mind. No letter has come from her love that is true. The celebration comes from a complete city to send off the boys. Even Boris and his friend Stepan work to send delegates about the gift of gratitude for the factory. I do not know if this is Russia's glorious appearance at the beginning of World War II. There is no demonstration or bad campaign of these boys risking their lives towards any country, it is all praise and thanks. Some in America can learn an education about this because only if you agree with the war or not, in the name of protests and losses in her name, only these women and men are sacrificing every day, they only waste. <br /> <br /> Acting is pure absolute everywhere, but some deserve to singling out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova, a small role as the Grand Prix of Bonnie. He is a member of the family who can believe and his sadness is clear in his face and in his body language. Vassili Marcurev, as the patriarch Fyodor Yanvovich, probably comes up with the best performance. Finally spoken, often parents will have to cry hidden tears, Mercuryeva reflects those feelings. He touches a tough outdoor, especially the cracking joke and his son when he finds out just about a few hours before his volunteering. But when Boris went to the rally station we sat down with sadness in the table and saw the true pain of the people. He loved his son very much and although he would not be able to show it to him, he showed his work across the film to the audience. Alexey Bottolov is as a happy-lucky young man and idealist Boris, doing what he believes is right, and Alexander Sauerine is just as good as the famous Mark for his talented piano skills, or perhaps a thief to steal. The love of his cousin That love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really attracts the thirsty glimmer audience of his sorrow, seclusion, and hope. The true star of the film, he will go through many passions on the journey, where he will lose his way, he must return, hoping that he hurried to get back to Barish's return. <br /> <br /> <br /> As well as refusing to use tragedy across the theme as well as the reality of the story, I like the visual style of the movie. Sergei Eruzowski's cinematography was amazing, especially considering the film was shot on full screen. One thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen screenroom; It's a square frame so completely different. From the beginning we got a nice static shot on the path of a rolling walk along the water, which is a bridge in the upper part, because our two lovers are going to the screen and far away. The camera has multiple perspectives which are still behind the obstacles, allowing the action to be seen, creating unique spatial depths and interests. Intense corners are used, as well as to block overhead shots and frame letters to allow for too much synthesis. <br /> <br /> Examples of real shots are long shots. Veronica has been used well at the end of the returning force with the force of returning soldiers, before she got married before she got excited when telling her loved ones goodbye, when she finds Boris, she needs to talk about her own goodbye. The plans of this shot must be broad because they are in and out of the people, while the camera couple kisses, people shout to each other, and much more, to frame at certain moments during the camera. Everyone needed to hit their mark properly and it became a shining piece of the film. It is the only part of the overall skill of tone and style; Flying Cranes shows the viewer how successful the place is and Mike N. Schen shows it as easily as possible. Composition and professionalism can perform wonderful work from actors and crew, huge sets and special effects can not add anything that can never do.
