Star: Danny Davito, Billy Crystal, Ana Ramsey, Kim Grist, Kate Malgru, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. <br /> <br /> After college, Larry (Crystal) is dead to his ex-wife and Owen (devito) his mother (Ramsey) dead. When Larry came out that he wanted his wife to die, Owen knew what to do for him, to help Larry kill her mother, to return to her. Davito is sticking this scent of scales through his mother's poisoning of his mother and his head as the dead wannabe author of this brain that is absolutely delightful as this. He has a child who thinks he is a misleading man rather than a murderer. Because of his extraordinary performance like the old Mrs. Lift, Ramsie was actually nominated for the Academy Award. Apart from being comedy, there is also the heart of the film. A scene between Davito and Crystal started seemingly close as a joke, but deeper, actually making me a little sad Danny Davito conducted the film and did a good job by getting dark tone from his side. I recommend this for a fan of a fan. <br /> <br /> My ratings: B Plus 84 minutes PG-13 for language, sex and violence
