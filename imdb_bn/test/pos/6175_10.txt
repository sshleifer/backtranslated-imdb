I was "on" in this film by my flight instructor and is now surprised how it was about five years before it was discovered. If you have any love of flying, especially the attachment to the WWII planes, it must be fully seen, it is higher than the "Parallar Harbor" and there is a challenge with "Battle of Britain's War". Thirty years ago In a while when you think that you think Wingman is flying, you ruin your leader's shell casing as a roll on me 109 or 111. <br /> <br /> This picture touched me deeply as thousands of brave poles, Hungarians, Slovakians and Czechs had suffered for decades, who fled their homeland in 1932-1940, turned into England, became Western civilization Fought bravely for survival, and then after the war the "us" was undoubtedly abandoned, when communist They were arrested after their return to the country. I stand on the Monte Casino in Italy and was moved to the tears by the cemetery for the Polish soldiers, which was a storm on the British and the Americans who could not take the mountain. I traveled alongside Prague (the most beautiful of the cities) and studied their history. Their story is abandoned, I believe, today we should have a lesson about the responsibility of our brave alliance. <br /> <br /> But return the film. You love flying, see this. If you are interested in WWII flight, you will definitely see it. Without the doubt, the most cruel, direct, and awesome fast-paced aircraft scene scenes are never copied for the film. And yes, if you are looking for even romantic romance, there are heartwarming details. <br /> <br /> Assistant Director Bill Forsten WWII Transcript "Warbird" P51 Mustang "Gloria Ann"
