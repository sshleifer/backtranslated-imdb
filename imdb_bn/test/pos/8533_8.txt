On Monday, at the beginning of this week, I was under the influence of the sweet page in July, and I want to be a horror fan, want to see something scary. I was thinking Ammityville Hurry 2, but I got some way better. I was at my friend's house, and he was VHS Evil Ed. No cover or anything, he did not even see himself in the whole thing, but he told me that "a guy who goes crazy and kills many people." Well, this movie was very frustrating, I did not see the actual cruel nature of the actual violence until this movie, it killed both Ted Bandy and Ed Jean! It's very fun, very cool, with the references to The Evil Dead Trilogy (and everywhere in the Evil Dead 2 poster movie!) This film is Edward, a ruthless, compelling, nice person who can be a film editor. Then he was sentenced to another section of the building and was sent to the clothes of Sam Campbell, Splatters and Violence in the Gore division. Eddie's new boss, Sam Campbell, told the ADC about the big break in the series of his cinematic, scary Luge Limbs, and he needs Adie to make the film a bit violent, so that he can be seen throughout Europe. Eddie expressed his sorrow, because the pictures and scenes he had shown him from the lonely house were sent to work, and then whatever happened from there, really happened at night. Imagine yourself in your place! Acting is great, too much sunny little funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often found interesting with other actors). However, overdubbing work is quite good, I give this movie a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to the sub-genre of Gore. Well, tonight, Bloody ....... You just have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> I quote from the movie: "Where is ** ** My Beaver Rape Scene?"
