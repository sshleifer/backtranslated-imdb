Don is already one of the best slashers that cools down your spine and sends each visit time! This movie is amazing, great acting, very good camera work (Excellent work, Mr. Liberman!), Which creates a very well-made slash! Although it's less than the Gore for the 80's, you still have an impact on it. Opening fell (machete through Crocch) looked so real! And in the face of my face surprised me! Overall I gave 10 big stars of this 10 big classes! If you are looking for a gore-fest, do not look here. However, if you want to cool your back sent, see this one. There are 6 people dead and you do not see any of them, but how do you think he died? The violent theme reminds me of the mountains in the mountains of 1977, which follow the same concept, but cannabals in the desert. But, still slasher fans, to give this forgotten jewel, I promise you, you will be at peace!
