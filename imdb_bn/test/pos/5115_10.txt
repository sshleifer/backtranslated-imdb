This movie brings so much memory to me! When I left, I was a little too young, but it seemed as if I had seen it for the first time! My father and I always watched "Ernest Cinema" together. We have seen many of them in several years and I found them really a couple really cheaper. We saw them and could not laugh. I love all "Ernest Cinema", but this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Spoiler! <br /> <br /> The part I think is the "magnet" part. My dad is not yet an electric chair scene! <br /> <br /> & Spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is a very Chess movie ... but a great! It's suitable for the family (it's not like lots of trash there) but at the same time adults can also laugh! If you like physical humor (facial faces and how people are removed) then it's a movie for you!
