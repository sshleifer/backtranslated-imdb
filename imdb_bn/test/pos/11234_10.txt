It is quite clear that you have spent many nights alone. If you've seen 5 minutes of the actual show instead of listening to commercials, you've seen the best television shows in Canadian history. Too bad you have been watching it alone. Perhaps because you hate it ... no game. What is VIP, ridiculous, light and funny Friends are going to eat this show. My game is tight and I can wait rarely to get this show. The girl was hubut and kicked ass of the club. I'll watch every week. It makes me wonder why it is not creating more great shows like this. Now it is clear that Canada's talent has the ability to produce American standard television.
