Basically I'm a Tennessius D fan of their first album and naturally P.O.D. And was rather frustrated. After watching the movie, my view changed. It was a stupid story because of the attitude that the film portrays KG and Zebles, although the film was very interesting from the beginning to the end and it involved myself. <br /> <br /> More entertaining and enjoyable than the movies that were recently viewed in theaters. Ex. Looks like Katino Rouille (Homo-boyfriend's path) that I really enjoyed in the past. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the borat, you will enjoy the world's greatest band.
