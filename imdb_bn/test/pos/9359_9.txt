In March 1947, Crossfire in the New York Times article was one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to "face the question of racist and religious prejudice so that the audience gets more accurate than expected." RKO was producing crossfire, making a deal with Quarter-Century-Fox Gentleman, another story of Antisemitism. A few months before JetTL Gentleman's contract, Crossfire was defeated by many "Bailhud" Fox in the theater. In July 1947, ARK also displayed crossfire for the Los Angeles religious community representatives. In addition, a number of surveys designed to calculate audience ancestors were conducted before and after the movie. Crossfire both received praise and criticism for the portrayal of antisemicism in America and there were many editorial issues. Academy Award for Best Picture for Crossfire, was nominated, but lost to Gentlemen's contract. It was nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Asham), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire was called the best social film in Canes. In December 1947, the African-American publication Absolute Magazine, awarded the annual award for the "improving international understanding." Love this movie. If you have a chance to see it, see it.
