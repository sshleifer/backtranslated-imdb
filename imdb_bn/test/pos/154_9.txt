For any punishment purpose. I'm not going to loot anything about the story, but you already know that the main actor portrays what kind of character is safe. And of course being a "naughty" when a priest exaggerates all that being. Plus it's the most erotic movie from Park Chan Uk. <br /> <br /> If you watched the previous work / movie of Wook, you know that he is very visually (well) and it looks here again. Although it goes away from the theme of retaliation against previous films, it still remains hidden below the heat. And when that boils, several bad things start to happen. But there was also light (fun) moments through those darkness. A very stylistic and provocative movie, that lives outside of mainstream and does a very good job ...
