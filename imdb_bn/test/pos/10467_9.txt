I saw this picture this morning and I found it a great exhibition of faith prosperity. Gave another way of looking at his father's life; Not a replacement, but an enhancement. He shared all that he had with him. I see the story of God here. He sent his only son to the man. People probably can not give anything that equals that. So, for our small sacrifices, we are given a final treasure and it is converted due to it. In this picture the rebel townspeople have eaten themselves with a small explanation of God. Babbet showed them that life and God can actually be beautiful in its full sense. The love that God has shown to the Son is to show love, to each other and to our life, that will be rich for it. Even a metaphor for the film. It seems to be slow at the beginning, but with detailed attention of the investment, over time it is rewarded. It was really a banquet.
