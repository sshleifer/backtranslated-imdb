Halilua !!!! ?? Finally, a true Colombian movie crosses the border, showing how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombia and French heritage, sick and tired of seeing Colombian crookedly and tediously portrayed by Hollywood and others. <br /> <br /> How many do you know that Columbia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy? World (after the United States), or is it a vibrant film and television industry (-Galty Betty has nothing to say), that it is the capital, Bogotá (Pop.9 million) "world capital of book" or that this beautiful city is the world's largest theater Festival host? I hope Doug Limon, Simon Kimber (MR and Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemkis, Dean Thomas (Stone Romancing) visited Bogota one day, to see how wonderful it really is and draw attention to the cultural life and variety of Bogotá. In contrast to mysteriously created movies such as the Mario Fools of Grace, which Joshua did not quite gain (for this horrible film) without profit, his film would help to protect Colombia from its "incompetent weak image". /> <br /> - Anyway, you'll enjoy bluffs at least! - Oh, and thank you for your invaluable / great work IMDb !!!
