During the lunar eclipse three children were born at the same time. They started a killing before their 10th birthday. A general slasher from the beginning of the "bloody birthday" 80. It's quite nice things with lots of nudity. The evil children do not create any danger and there is almost no doubt. There is no horror or fear in "Bloody Birthday", but the film is modestly entertaining. Unfortunately, there was no real explanation for the sudden killing of children. Murder scenes are, for example, quite suddenly, we got death by handgun, baseball bat, rope and blister. So if you're a fan of the 80's slasher movies, give it a look.
