I go to the movies for entertainment I was very modest with the first film in this series: DaVinci Code. It was twists and turns across the whole to make me very interested. Angels and monsters are no different. If you enjoy DaVinci code, then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Angels and Demons, like previous movies, are mostly made with similar styles, but fast packed, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me in my seat without letting my seat be disturbed for two hours. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this movie, although it was obviously fantastic, but they made enough real history it seems very believable. If there is such a thing that I do not like about this film, it is that this plot is very incredible (do not want to give a spoiler). But hey, this is a movie. I was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied what I saw.
