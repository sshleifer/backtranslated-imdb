I saw "wiri spindle" I could not laugh about what was happening on the screen. Wiri got a lot of games from both boys and women, but why did the actors playing Wary in HS why I was confused. Was 10 years old. Then the actor changed the age of 20 when Wari played when she was a senior of HS ... but whatever, I thought it was funny.
