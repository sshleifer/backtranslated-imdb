I've seen this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and every time I see it, I'm dragged into the film and I came back in 1963! When I see the movie, I will take me to the nostalgic holidays. <br /> <br /> I think the important thing here is that I was 15 in 1963 and I can remember that "President Kennedy came before shooting and before Beatel." I can feel myself saying something like, "I have watermelon . " And then I realized how foolish! Jennifer Gray Francis plays the housewife in "baby" dirty dance. College collapse is going to start college. He goes to Kellman for the holidays with his family (mother, father and sister Lisa). <br /> <br /> Another staff dancer, Panny (played by Cynthia Roads) is another employee (a pregnant one) boys run by Max Canter) and has an opportunity to have a miscarriage, but it is one night that she and Johnny (Patrick Soze ) Is scheduled to dance to a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> Thus, the need for a penny dancer for a penny. Johnny is inspired by Penny and her cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that she can teach the baby to dance for the show. Penny and Jenny to learn the steps to dance with a wonderful child! <br /> <br /> The child's father (Dr. Jake Hussman, operated by Jerry Orbak) came to rescue Penny during the time of an abortion. Pregnant during pregnancy During pregnancy, during pregnancy, during pregnancy, pregnant dance was brought back to me in history. This time (1963) most of the girls actually died from such abortion - but then she did not have much choice for the girl. <br /> <br /> Lonnie Price got Jack Weston's highest rating (Neil Kellman) Kellerman. Knowing Brunker did a great job as a child's boring sister, Lisa Hussmann. <br /> <br /> The music is great and the dance is excellent! "Dirty Dancer" is absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel the children's surprise when I first see her dance and say, "Where will they learn?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Swayze is perfect with their respective roles together. Patrick's song, "She's Leaked the Wind", every time I hear in this movie / I see tears come to my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie ends up in an up note, but I want to know what will happen next. Baby and Johnny's life. Dirty Dance Every time it shows something new - it messes up with Nostalgia, it feels like feeling again from 1963.
