This show is awesome! I love all the actors! It has great story lines and characters. This is the perfect drama. James Kahn and Josh Duhamel have great dialogue. They both can be really fun. I miss Venacea Marcel in General Hospital, but he's great here. James Lace is awesome! She might be ridiculous. Molly Sims plays a dimwit very well. Awesome to write! They keep an excellent speed up. The show is one of my favorite components of a show which can really leave you hanging. I can not wait until the start of the new season This show made it to the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show will be for a long time. People know better, it will be. I do not want to end the show. Ever.
