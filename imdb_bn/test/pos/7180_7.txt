If you do not grow up in France, you can not see the same movie (or have spent at least 10 years, like me). I do not know what it will do outside the French French Cultural Border (I include Belgium and Luxembourg here). You can not translate this kind of fun - every name is a joke (how many people outside of Paris can understand the name of the Roman legionier by the word "kularorebas"?). But Monica Bell (El?) Ucci is so beautiful, I almost forgot to breathe her around and breathe.
