I've seen this movie live performance of Buffalo Philharmonic, and the music has two of my experiences which clearly make it clear; Especially, after the war, the song where husband is searching for his husband was only devastating. The other thing that stood beside me was the war of ice, a few strategies were made by the creators of King Arthur in 2004. Also, the war is forever (half an hour?) - has long gone. I can not think of another promotional movie that shows less war than glamorers. I'm surprised Stalin liked this picture well; I do not want to go outside after watching it and fight.
