I would be honest, I was really he was watching a good time. Despite being a normal teenage comedy or if you can switch to sex movies but it has some pretty smiles that I think no one can get. Adults and thirteen people will enjoy this movie alike. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is your ideal rebel teen who acts as a man and dresses like a man, and when he is trying for the son's football team, he shows his brother's face to prove himself as a football team. Decided to take. Of course, love met his brother when he met his brother. She has a girl chasing after her. Well, the tag line says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a funny little teenage drama which I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bones proves something in the film, it's really hard to work like a man. : D OK, that's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
