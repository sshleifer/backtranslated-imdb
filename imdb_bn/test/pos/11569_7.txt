Okay, the show was a little disrespectful, but I still loved it. I found the main two bunnies boring, but Hampton and Plucky is always amusing. <br /> <br /> I really like the children's plucky episode on DVD (or even VHS). <br /> <br /> Particularly "ribbon year" episode was broadcast on 11/22/91; The "Gove up" episode published on 9/17/29 and the "Minister Golf" episode on 11/92 <br /> <br /> They are the funest bits of the whole series and even after a decade, we still have this bit reference ! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing to say, please reduce the minimum of 5 lines and reward us!)
