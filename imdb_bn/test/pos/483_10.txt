I first saw it on Themes Television and liked it. Later I saw someone who had seen or did not see such horrific education. So, I bought a copy and then bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available in Paul VHS or Zone 2 DVD. The Australian version is great, but it's good! I could buy another .............
