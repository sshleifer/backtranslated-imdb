Since "Harold and Mound" committed suicide, a successful love story has been used as a theme for love stories. Acting, horrible by a top notch. With a good structured script, things progress in an enjoyable speed. There is a black comedy moment, but as a unique romantic comedy, "My Sweetheart Sweetheart" will be classified, with the touch of dark laughter. The relationship between two mentally challenged lovers is both touching and engaging. The movie actually questions you, what is a normal relationship? I highly recommend "my suicidal sweetheart". Find it under the heading "Crazy For Profit". You do not have to be frustrated. - Mr.
