Finally, a movie that manages the feasibility of alien vision with appropriate depth and loving warmth. If only we are not alone, I believe that these visitors are too much tourists to take care of us and they give that terrible bunch to the man-centric guides of their evidences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and body by a superior entity. That's quite unexpected and rather obsolete, but we're dealing with a movie here, right? So admission to the Prote Hospital is just a trigger for the plot. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges do great work as usual, but the shifts moved The role seems to him neutral, believing and lovingly "mad". Eating deformed bananas, sitting in a tree, gives the doctors a tough time with the quickness, knowledge and stunning quotes (most of the greatest!). They thought to me for a few hours and thought. <br /> <br /> This is an inspiring film, at least to say, and Edward Sherumur's soundtrack is just beautiful. Just go and get a copy. A bee caught in the light. now.
