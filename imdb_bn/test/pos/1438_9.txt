Great book, great movie, great soundtrack. Frank Sinatra shows in this film that he can work when he tries to try. The end is a bit schmaltzy, but for the time it wanted a happy ending to understandable studio. Heroin addiction is a plus of graphic nature (groundbreaking for time). Add awesome soundtracks and you've got one of the great American movies.
