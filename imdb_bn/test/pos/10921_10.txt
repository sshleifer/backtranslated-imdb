Howard Bryckett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is going to marry. Then, one of his former students won an Oscar for a photo, where he congrats Howard to a gay soldier and in his acceptance speech, he even feels gay! Journalists followed after the fall of journalists in Howard's village and tried to convince them that they were directly satisfied. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, it has some really delightful moments and it always leaves great feeling with an enormous grin on my face. As a result, this is a movie that I enjoy watching as much as possible. If you have not seen it, you are missing!
