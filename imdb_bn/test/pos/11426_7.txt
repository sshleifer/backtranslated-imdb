Laurel looks without a hardy in a movie, it seems weird, yet it's all the same entertainment. It became a nice silent film and it looks very well at the stars in Stan. His pictures were fantastic with Oliver Hardy, but he described his idea about how efficient he was at your skill and how he could have been to the tradition of Chaplin as Cantona and Chaplin's own independent star. Dancing with his real-life wife in the caf√© scene is the best part of the film, and there are some interesting bits to go with Laurel's excellent dance steps. And bullfight climax takes a stick from a jewel, even bull bullshit. And I like the mockery in the scene where he is buried and his familiar Lorele and Hardie Bowler are wearing the hat. As much as I love Lorel and Hardy's team and think there was no fun comedy screen on their screen, they were good to see themselves in a while (see Hardician made with Hardinge Duke.) Another example is Dell Roloff.
