It's a pretty interesting test to see. It is the first, still existing attempts, to combine the eye with the word. It shows two men dancing to a violin player (probably William Kiel Dixon himself), who is standing beside the Edison Recording cylinder, which holds the word. <br /> <br /> The sound and the pictures were not connected together yet. And it has not been connected technically to word and image until recently. This is probably why people do not hesitate to claim that this film is sometimes a good image. <br /> <br /> This film is William K. L. Dixon, an assistant to Thomas Edison, who ordered him to come up with a way to combine pictures and words. The answer he had given was Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (basically a wooden box with a yellow in it, so people can see moving images) inside it with cylinder phonographs. This is the first, which we know, survival in the film-experiment that coordinates this strategy. Using this same technique, all the subsequent movies were shot as silent movies and sound effects were later recorded separately. So Keyenphone tried to make words more effortless with words rather than attempting to synchronize words and images. In some cases, people can also choose from three sound cylinders, combining 3 different orchestration performance with images. Only 45 kinetophone have been created so that you can call Kainphone successfully. Also after this experiment, focusing on film projectors mainly focus on other movie tricks. <br /> <br /> So the first test was not successful on experimental basis more than 30 years ago. The words are created and released commercially. They have not been technically synchronized till now and could still add the word and the image together and even if they could and the strategies were available, it was also very expensive to do. It is not actually the most influential or historically significant movie outside of cinematic history but it is very interesting to see how people constantly tried to improve the quality and the techniques of filmmaking and film making. <br /> <br /> 8/10
