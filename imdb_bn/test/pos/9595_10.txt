A critique has already commented, it's never been made for TV comedy in the best soccer parody in between. But .... it was first promoted when it failed in the video, I am not nearing it any format now. All right, so this date has only 17 votes, but the average of 9+ seems to be something special. Basically, I think if you miss it, it seems to be a fate because it is no longer available to watch !! Aaaaaaaargh
