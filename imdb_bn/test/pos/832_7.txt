This film is good in its genre and the style is naturally the only step with a low / average budget. It seems that when Van Dham managed his good director, he provided better performance. Your basic times are brawl, lane view and a lot of gun fight. Some basic plays, but nothing too deep. If Isaac Florentine ignores weak plots and holes in it, then it's OK to have an effective step. But the person who stole it is: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins I do not know how this guy will not come, Andard Ireland Showergenegar's eligibility star. Director Isaac Platinum has created a movie with Scott Adkins, known as Florence Special Forces (2003), among which there are some incredible martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanded Kung Fu enthusiasts. Another amazing Scott Adkins feature is incomplete. 2. Check this guy and create a noise, this guy will get super action star status and he will get it now! <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Movie? It's stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work in Van Dam. No Oscars here for sure, but you already knew that. But in less cities it is not low and I do not find bad ways to spend my time. So I'm giving it a solid 7 out of its style 10.
