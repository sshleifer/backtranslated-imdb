I saw this stage show in 1983 when PBS was being broadcasted. I was involved in a local theater at that time and I saw some fantastic incredible things from the Dell Array players, but Bill Irene screwed me up. <br /> <br /> I could not enter a man in his shape (he was quite tall and torch) in a very small box, it was restless for adjusting and even at the time of death, even without sound, move it to the stage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who saw this show will remember that when he got up from the box and entered the floor with a long body and angubo toe, he dragged himself into the upper part of his head and dragged himself, but his entire ballistic point? And it did in a fluid, seemingly conventional motion. Just like a series movement of energy, grace, balance and attention should be taken for them to be done as well! Add her firm and credible characteristic skills to her physical skills, and have a consummate actor / actor lying. My jaw fell in the movement and my heart was broken into a puppet illustration, which was more determined than just a useless thing in a box. Unfortunately (yes ?? "tragic" will be a good sound) In the absence of this piece of home media form, I've noticed that PBS's work is not available in many tapes or DVDs. Sometimes, PBS shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately after a broadcast, but they will rarely be on the market. There are exceptions, of course, but these are mainly documented in science and history; Rarely have an arts piece print ?? It starts with as soon as it starts in VHS / DVD. I do not know why this will happen; Of course, PBS can use the income from their show's home media marketing, but they do not take advantage of it. It's a shame. I have seen a lot of things in PBS that I want but are fragmented as a "flagged off flight", I'm afraid, once a shot in the lifespan, will not be repeated in PBS again and will not be available to buy the home media. That really sucks. I'm not lucky, when I did it. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes ?? Our local library received a copy of "Flooded Off Flight". And yes? It is stolen.
