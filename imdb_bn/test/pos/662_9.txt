OK, so the following review is actually more than a summary of holding a spoiler, but it's better to be safe than sorry to avoid being blacklisted, is not it? Right! Automatically warn yourself, and read ... <br /> <br /> This parody / tribute to the greatest time in the history of horror films - In the 1980s - a group of fools gathered together to bring together the infamous Maddar McGee, who had been a few years ago He destroyed his whole family and buried them behind. I'm sure you can guess, things can become worse than bad, which you can say "Where's the cow?" And usually in the horror of the film of 80, bloodshed, dialogue is known to be death, and beautiful women take advantage of any of their garments. Good time ... <br /> <br /> No cycles or horror movie Clich Characters of 80 are not present here. In fact, no stone was left to flip in at all ?? We have a cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, Goth Chick, tough cold (think John Bandar), hot blonde who loses his shirt, shy dark in love with hot sari, which loses his shirt, some gorgeous half-naked lesbians, and two big geeks . <br /> <br /> You can clearly see, Cast is quite big. Generally, large casts where things can be quickly separated, with one or two yeast buggering up the whole barrel of apple. Although not in this case. The single cast member did not disappoint me. The acting is done very well. By his thriller Jacket cooler hero Jovan Meridith, who played the Gaurav Goth Cook of Rene Doorni, Gaikon One and who played Async and Jonathan Brett? They all play straight, bring their game and get them out of the park. If you are fond of Gary and Watt in Wired Science, then you will fall in love with Geeks immediately. <br /> <br /> Director / Co-Writer Jeff C. Smith, watch for a man in the future, believe me this. If he can do with a low budget, there is nothing better for him if he gets more money for his future projects. The letters were dead; The atmosphere was perfect; Smile was huge; Blood flowed, and squirted, and sprayed beautiful ?? It was like watching a horror movie since the 1980s. Call this one "The night of the flight club demo meets" !!! The tag line tells it all, and it speaks honestly - "Awesome Volens; Grateful Noodury; Zero Budget" - There is no false advertisement here, people! As a fan of this genre, we have to look at the Indians and support these hardworking people who are coming up with our basic stories, so that we can not bring true stories to us, so that we get permanently stuck in the world filled with waterfalls-PG-13 Be there The 'horror' or unmatched remake like heater. No, thanks - it's nothing more for me. <br /> <br /> To stop, I really want to say that strong TEENAGERS DIE! The best indie flicks I've gotten the pleasure of watching this year is by far one. It's a bloody good time, and holds on repeat view. From clothing to clothes to clothing ... Even the end credits of the credit theme (which does not let laughter fit back, but reminds Rio SpeedWagon at 80 power balls - Let's start with the letter 'R' spoken on every word - then I If you are a fan of fear or fear of the 80's, then there is no hesitation in this - this is your collection of Flickr !!
