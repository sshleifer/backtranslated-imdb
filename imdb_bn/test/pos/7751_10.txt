I have no words to really describe this series. <br /> <br /> The concept behind this concept (a very supernatural girl who has a weird personality, which surrounds a strange team in her presentation around the world, which was the result of Haruhi, since she wants the world with aliens, espresso and time traveler ) A new wind breathing in the world involving repetitive anime series and innovative TV shows. <br /> <br /> The letters are well developed, and you will end up loving them, something other than others. The term describing the animation work does not exist, since it is really short to describe how "nice" it was. There are so many fun situations that will make you laugh or throw on deep thoughts. Do not fall for the first episode, as the novels have not yet arrived, this is the glacier's hint. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Definitely, one of the best series of 2006.
