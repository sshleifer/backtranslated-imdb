The film is a very good movie. Which is the best from the film Yash Raj The command is incredible. The screenplay is bright. The story is amazing. It speaks of Rahul, who fears the friend of his college Kiran. She has completely swollen. Saiko was doing something to talk to her mother by calling (since she died 15 years ago) etc. Kiran is associated with Sunil. Rahul is doing everything so he can get him. He even tried to kill Sunil but he survived. He even goes to the place where they are going to honeymoon. The movie is delighted with every joke. Shahrukh is fantastic, it is fairly good, Sunny average, unmatched, and Tanvi, Dalip did a good job. The movie is SAARC. Conversations are brilliant (more than Shahrukh and extremist and comedy is not so much). "Magic Door" and "You Me Same" is a completely protected track.
