I did not know anything about this film, both of it and its stars, Chris Farley and David Speed, and I say that this film is a comic classic. It is so stupid at times that it can only be sunny. Farey is a smart fool who, on the way to the street with father's right tool (equally spectacular spade), is looking forward to finding out the fund to save the family's 'auto parts' business. Calm down, keep your brain in self-pilot and roll up fun. Brian Denhe (Cocoon), Rob Lowey (Wayne World) and Bo Derek ("10") are a great supporter of film favorites. Highly recommend for a good smile.
