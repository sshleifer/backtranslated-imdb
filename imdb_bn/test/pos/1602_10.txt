The superiority of the Visconti! I admit that I am unfamiliar with most of his work, but I can not imagine his other work beyond this extraordinary film. Last night I had seen Venice's death after being absent for nearly 25 years, and what I saw was completely affected. This impression was a pastiche made up of many ingredients: Fantastic shots run in Wisconsin, mainly its long, decorating shots containing human food, swimming, walking and passing a significant character passing through this mass; Brilliant interpretation of the selection of shotgun shot winner; Apart from the above conversation, the principles play on the street, and the scenes show complexity by facial features. This is true: Young people watching this movie for the first time, they must be a unique film, a movie that can not be made in 2006. Film director and financier passed an artist's license while the hundredth century and a few minutes of a century in the first century of the century ended. Most of the recent IMDb commentators wrote that the film was a long, annoying (very little step) and provoked in their judgment. I guess by the value of the Hollywood pap, this commentary has merit. Unfortunately they have undoubtedly minimized the extraordinary beauty and depth of this work, and others like that year. <br /> <br /> Please, if you have not seen Venice's death, rent a copy and fade yourself in a movie and story. From another time. You will be rewarded.
