This is a pretty good 'what' will be made for different TV flicks. For example, in this case, if terrorists explode a 'dirty bomb' in the big city. Many people say that we are setting up in an emergency, which then reveals that they are not telling the complete story. Anyone else is ready to do something like that? You can not defeat It shows elements of material in the country for bombs, bomb making, secrecy and double life, behind them etc. It shows all of the people (i.e. firefighters) to protect the people. They are not getting any help when the government does not want to send anyone else in the affected area. It also shows how 'preparations' have become weak for such an incident, the government is making everything objectionable, but opening up the face facing the arrival of early tragedy. And could this well happen here in the old American? Well, unless you have been living in the caves for the last 20 years, there is already something else and nobody will be ready to do something of this nature. It's fairly realistic and yes, even scary. Hope to see good value but just like this really nothing happens. 10 out 8
