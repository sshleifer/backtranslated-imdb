I liked the movie but it should stay longer. Actors did a great job. Portia de Rocci is a fabulous actress and Crispher Polaha Hottie. He did not look like 100% but he loved him from a distance. I look forward to seeing her more on the big screen. He was not John's charisma, but he definitely has a charm about himself. She has beautiful eyes and a great smile. He reminds me of my boyfriend alot. Mrs. Bissett was very painful for me. She should check that asthma. I'm going to comment on the character of Darryl Hanna My mother always said, "If you can not say something good, then stop hell!" So what I do I will do <br /> <br /> <br /> Molly
