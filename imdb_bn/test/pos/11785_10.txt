So interesting is the perfect way to describe this 12-minute Spoof of the original Star Wars. Hardware war is incredibly fun. It is presented as a space epic hardware battle trailer. Comedy: Imagine star actors played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. Characters include "Intergalactic Boy-Wonders" Fluke Starbaker, "Ass Morsari and Intergalactic Intelligent People" Ham Salad, Darf Nadar, "Villain" and other fantastic characters. It is impossible not to laugh as you see this 12-minute treasure. It's stupid but fun You will laugh from the beginning to the end, and you will feel the need to meet it again, again, again and again ... and you will laugh again to see it !!! <br /> <br /> 10 of the 10 best all-time 12 minutes. You will last a minute!
