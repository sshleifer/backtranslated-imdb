Cloud side I've seen strange ways in many ways. The application of its culture, not just for its ideas, but also because it is not about creating a great composition of the movie. Binder the Clouds was directed by one of Italy's most famous directors, Michellejo Antonio. However, if you only supply this movie a quick clock, I think it is a musician and often one of the unmatched romances. This movie deserves great attention to all its cheese hug points. By cheese I do not mean a piece, but a brick full of a sheet! The music is like some Italian, like stories and dialogues, it comes from Japanese soap and metaphors are so obvious that you want to put yourself on your head. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To pass all this, you are engaged in an existential work in the industry. Cheese feeds on fine filming and draws our attention, completely, what we need to know. Four sections of the basic plot, unrelated, and all about love. What we learn is that no matter what is said or what is said, people can not communicate with each other. Instead they can only communicate through each other. I think conversation and plot are so much chessy, because the conversations are too illusory because of lack of functioning and excessive response to human response. <br /> <br /> I was thinking of that picture myself; Probably all life is a big melodrama. We judge our feelings for others as real and motivated. Because I hate, because there are my reasons. But what does hating think? Maybe they think my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodymatic. <br /> <br /> So the melody is actually an existent function. A genuine romance is the only people's interaction under a magnifying glass, which enables us to see who we are and the futility of what we do. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I recommend everyone!
