I am very impressed with the performance of the moon in the moon. Before I started to see it, I did not expect it as well as the Lemon Dove. I could not believe how well the actor is choosing to represent all the characters. It's my role in how well they play each role! In my opinion this was almost as well as the Lonesome Dove. It is difficult to compare any film from Lonesome Dove. If you do not compare, I'll give this a thumbs up. It was very entertaining! I do not post many comments on this site, but I felt that I would get my opinion there. Amazing! Perhaps I would make every single list because I did not want to stop naming every actor I was brilliant. My favorite was Steve Jhan. He hit the nail on the head of the captain Gass. His behavior was perfect.
