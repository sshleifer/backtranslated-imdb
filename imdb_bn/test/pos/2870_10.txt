Cain is a murderer named Jacob Suvartri, he is living in the old hotel, where eight teen criminals go to clean up some. Most of them die without 3. In my case it was never the best writing or the best. I still thought that the murder scenes were really good. When one girl likes to go eaten by hungry dogs. She was the best when the blonde girl shoved the cell phone down the face. Why was a serious horror movie actor, he watched this movie full movie and it will never change. That was the whole film, his only appearance. Great action and killing scenes, I do not think I can give 10 full 10, but 6 seems to be good.
