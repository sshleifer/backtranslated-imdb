As a kid I like the song "Do not smile at the crocodile smile", and if I find myself in this situation, which is actually inspired by true facts. The smile will be the last thing in my mind From the opening set up, I have ever been so excited, caught and tired, when I saw an independent Australian horror film in this limited budget, nearly three people from the Northern Territory were trapped in a mangrove swim in waiting for a deceiver crocodile. Water below them It really made the film alive, how realistic it was for viewers to handle the fear and uncertainty about character conditions. Semi-documentary camera-work with a great eerie backdrop and authentic performance-effectively taking out your comfort zone. What we have is a patient survival story rather than attacking the characteristics of a bloody, all-out animal. Think of "Open Water (2003)", where its budget and time restrictions have been confirmed that it will be at least, but this minimum hurdle will increase the experience. <br /> <br /> Slow story can be black and white, but it can not be flexible enough to be disposable, or formula patterns. Not only in most cases, and connections between characters were also associated with a bare, simple-forward script. Although you can say "less than", actions and expressions enlighten their mind with annoying thoughts. Suddenly horrible, because the threat is very alive and never seems to be loosen up. This is the film's chaotic Adrenaline, and it ends up very late (even when it is buried). <br /> <br /> The author / director Andrew Trouki and David Nelil's economic direction alters the audience and reduces their psychological features with smart striking. Static pressure increases, fixed presses, and shocking images among certain patches. The way the nights sequence is executed is extremely cool and pulsating. Crocodile manipulative toy smashing with his fresh meat in a sadly suspenseful approach. Sure some moments seem unlikely, but it does not get in the way or the confusion. Sound FX is what, and sometimes the lack of starvation you eat. Rifle May's musical score is not frustrating and it does not really enters the mix, but when it creates a biological sound quality John Gillins's cinematography is nicely designed, and when the mood changes, it's aggressive. It always continues and is claustrophobic, but none of these shocking movements. The editing was conducted intensely and the effects were presented wonderfully on live comedian footage. <br /> <br /> To sell some credible stories like this product, they have to rely on cast and they do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodorida, and especially Moeve Dermdy is provocatively good. Many responsibilities fall on the dermandi, and they are strongly influenced by the motivation. Now this item can compare comparisons with the other killer crocodile "Rog (2007)", but they can not be different from what they want to be and how they can end. Although I wanted to choose, but I would like to look at this photo. Thank you very much for this. <br /> <br /> There is really a chance to look after everyone involved with the extraordinary effort at all the front.
