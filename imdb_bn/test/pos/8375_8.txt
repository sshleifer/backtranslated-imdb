This is a good driver in Vienna, a good movie set about Tony (Donald Buca), who steals the identity of a passenger while sitting behind his cab. This identifies him as an illegal immigrant, but the name of the victim must be prefered as a precaution before getting the flight to the United States with a ticket. Mrs. Manley (Joan Camden) rebuked her but her husband was accused of having mental problems due to her husband Claude (Francis Ledder), concert Pianist. As a result, Tony Hook is closed. The cloud does not want to take part from his wife, but she goes away from her. Several plots twists and eventually both Tony and Mrs Maneli run it together - they both are trying to escape from their lives in Vienna. There is a tense, ultimately exciting build up. Are they going to go away ..... ?? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the quality of the photo is not fantastic and a line that moves the image down a bit. Cast their role is very good, especially Francis Ledder Claude's screenplay. The story is also as important as Heine (Manfred Inger) owner of the cab company, Marie (In Connery) as Tony Girlfriend Girlfriend and Inspector (Herman Aarhard). <br /> <br /> This is a good movie.
