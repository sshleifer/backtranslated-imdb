Although I did not see most technically advanced films, it was a fun and enjoyable few hours. The original characters are sweet and you really get them like them, and have to remember when to go to Susie's question, but feel good again when she returns as Maggie. <br /> <br /> Lots of stock dialogue, and a consolidated plot line, but most, lots of fun.
