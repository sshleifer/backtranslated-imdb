* Small spoilers * For those who just like those orthopedic movies I wanted to say, this is definitely my top three. Just think of the Little Big League and the Major League, I can compete with this one. I want to appreciate this photo's authors to create this funny conversation !! Not to be too specific, I want to say that the line is very suitable for each letter. Tom Selleck seems to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. His hatred towards overseas sport in Japan, his new team, ridiculous with the dragon, set the tone for yet meaningful interaction. He must adjust his life in Japan ("Firstly you will wash, then you will take a bath!") He has finally kept his eyesight in the eyes of his coach and set his goal for a final episode of glory, although imagined in a different environment than that! So for any baseball fans, or anyone who wants to see a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball will not disappoint you!
