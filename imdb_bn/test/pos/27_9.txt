Albert Finney and Tom Cortenine are bright like Sir and his drawers. Of course, at the beginning of the game, brilliant and theater can not be compared with communalism and colonialism and I think you hear better in the theater; But on the screen we become more intimate, we get more 'up close' than the theater, we see subtle changes in the expression, we see better "better". Both games and movies are wonderful: running, intelligent, enlightened - in the back story of the company, in the context of the historical context, two main characters, and parallel characters of "leaar". If you do not see it in a theater (I do not imagine that it has been produced a lot of days), please do yourself a lot and get the video.
