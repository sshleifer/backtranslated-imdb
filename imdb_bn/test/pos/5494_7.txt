Much of Eastwood's films mix currents, action, and romance boxing with "The Guntlet," "Firefox" and more. Now Clint's acting range is quite familiar. This one, he taciturn and a satirical, especially with women and superiors. There is no surprise in his performance. But the movie itself is a wonderful thing; It's above average. <br /> <br /> <br /> Clint Frank, a secret service agent who might have been unable to catch bullets by killing JF at the moment of suspicion. Then he drinks, which removes his family and now does not contact him with the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovich, calling himself "booth", who is related to his fate, confusional conviction based on his conviction Build up. That is all meaningless without inspiration to escape foolishness and predictability. Now, it is rather an unwanted collection of actors like Clint, but he has done better than less robotic than usual. And he thinks to carry with him, the burden of the stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He is testing half through this movie again. He kept holding the booth and hanging from the roof of a tall building, and he pulled the pistol and ordered the booth, who asked him if he was really willing to shoot. He must have protected the President if he tried to kill the CIA-trained killer, he would have spent his own life in this way. The booth by touching the hand of the hive touched him about the situation. And with Clint and Fail's failure to save the president in Delass, Rene also spoke briefly with Rousseau. "If I knew fast enough, then I could take that shot ... ... and it got me right." It's at least, but his voice chokes slightly, his eyes water, and trembles his lips. This is one of the few scenes in Clint's film that can be correctly "moving". We know from his new determination that he will take this opportunity to take bullets during this time. (It is ironic that he does not like the current president, who could say, "Color the nation to a nation" in Colorado, did he not do the same in Las Vegas?) <<Br /> <br /> It is often said that a movie Just like her villain. This is not true, nothing is easy, but in this case the argument can be made for its true value. John Malkovich's revenge from the eyes of his Tatar is amazing. <br /> <br /> Talk to embarrassing. Well, she can do a bit ham, soften with humiliation, and even plug two innocent hunters in the eye, but she is interesting on the screen. There is a little to Renee Russo. Fred Thompson is now back in politics as the Chief White House Assistant, a relief for filmmakers. If Clint's acting range is limited, then Thompson is few. The films that he has, he has the same serious and dissatisfied expression, as if he is plagued by some volcanic hemorrhagic disorder. <br /> <br /> The direction of Walfgeng Peterson was exactly as it was "slave boot," which is pretty good. In the final shootout there is a great deal of normal suspenseful cross-cutting. And when Clint and Rousseau embarked on a passionate hug in her hotel room and fall back on the bed like two adulterants, then Pietersen plays with her as well as their legacy as well as not only the usual dresses, but also the legacy of landing goods. Handcuffs, guns, beepers, pump pilots, dick tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. Cluttered and clothed in bed lying on the bed said, "Now I have to return them again." <br /> <br /> Good writing and valuable.
