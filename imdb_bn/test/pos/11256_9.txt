This movie was amazing. I have never seen a movie before that it has come to me with the harsh reality of using most of the drug. There is no glamorizing, sugar coating, or glorifying heroine. This movie is a real struggle, pain, and it gets reduced by people while working on this drug. Good film, acting emotionally emotionally packed, and a great story. Many watches! <br /> <br />
