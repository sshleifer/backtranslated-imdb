Numerous TV shows and memorable appearances from today's mega-stars (4th of Davis's screen debut) keep flatlines still wisely. This plot follows a mad idea of ​​discovering secret information about death of five undergraduates under non-academic research and what to learn after death, then return to life again. Yet the plot was not designed as attractive as the plot idea. <br /> <br /> Flatlines have a popular stereotype for developing regular tin-slash scripts. Nelson who created the concept of death decoding, beautiful but in-depth Rachel, Gordian cut off the knee until David luckily fired from school, the female 'Joe Joe and finally smart guy Randy ("I did not come to the school because the school does not matter to kill my classmates. may be "). They join hands in an experiment where Nelson's heart will be closed and rebuilt. Then on the campus night they decided to continue to keep this test firm. After Nelson's experience, for a long time, everyone began to compete with the lively and longest death experience and risked one life after another. Nevertheless, they soon realized that their daily lives were influenced by their experience. The afterlife inspection brings back their criminal feelings from their childhood memories. Using their deep subconscious caution, they start somewhat confusing and visual hallucinations. <br /> <br /> When the concept of unconsciousness comes, then hijacked director Joel Schumacher who has a subconscious personality that they are not aware of. . This inner personality keeps one from changing in identity losses. If you lose or deny this subconscious personality, you must lose your identity instead of refreshing your childhood memories. I wanted to add it as a movie mistake, which was already mentioned through the critics of the 90s. Evidently here in this movie, Shuva has played that it has been least influenced. So why do they hesitate to continue testing after their lessons, such as the design of death can be found by God? David was introduced as an atheist, now he turned to believe in God when he remembered a flashback from his childhood. After giving evidence of David's 180 degree change, it is clear that Shumamar's film was so conservative and lily-lively; It is not finally classified as why it works in science fiction. Alas! It was a good possibility. The subconscious attempted to provide maturity from the experience of death, death is so natural that it is the only part of death and it is the only part of human life. <br /> <br /> What was more than that, it was also memorable to remember what was with the movie. As a cinematographer, John De Bont, who worked almost always with the gospel, made a dreamy environment as a gothic horror movie. The green color schemes reflected in the faces of actors provide the first class in light, which is perfectly suitable for the film. The shots near the campus house buildings, the folklore in the walls, the fresco, the stop-motion camera, and dynamic camera speed all included the skills of the bunts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The music is part of the clip. During that time the speedy and multi-genuine video music clip was growing. This style was very rare in its subsequent years of its predecessor Tony Scott's "The Hunger (1983)".
