The Garshwin family and the Goldwyn estate are shy to see this great movie, which makes it impossible for the public to see the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed in a movie movie. <br /> <br /> It is true that Sydney Poetier and Dorothy Dondridge were dubbed for this movie, and this was not used for any reason that Gershwin's film is to be redeemed again. <<br /> <br /> While film flaws and creative differences between gearsby and goldwins, this movie has some outstanding performances ever committed on screen. Sammy Davies, Jr. and Pearl Bailey are particularly appreciated. <br /> <br /> This film was the Swan song of the great independent producer Samuel Galvin. It was also surprising, the best shame in Guerwins. <br /> <br /> Finally, the loss of great black actors in it. We can not see them anymore.
