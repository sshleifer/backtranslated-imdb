<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nicole was great .... Jod was enough. They did not give him many lines ... Is there any reason? Generally, he is a pretty good actor. She is so elegant, her character is so the country pumpkin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Long. They could tell the story within two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good location, good filming Character actor was great.
