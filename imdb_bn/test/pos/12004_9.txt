I saw the episode primarily when I felt and agree with it when I saw it in the resurrection. You criminals were fully colonized throughout the scandal and he treated him like Down syndrome. And ultimately, Colombo threw them to death and when they arrested them, they saw their shocks. You get a realistic reaction from the proud preppy killers. They still will not give their impression to Colombo and they will say that he is lucky. I like a formula where there is a widespread crime, the killers fully evaluate the Colombo, and then you get their appreciation that Colombo is playing the culprit completely. I remember the first few episodes of the 1989 post, they did not follow that source and I was satisfied with this first episode.
