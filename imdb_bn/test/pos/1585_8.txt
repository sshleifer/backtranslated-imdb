After the death of Commander Craig-Scott, all senior officials of Laundry and Moral Corps, they are broadcasted on the order of the InterGalactic Spaceship, owned by StarCups Corporation. Its main goal is to find live planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. <br /> <br /> Craig-Scott and his second command, Chief Blaster, has prepared himself for the command, except for the Enosfer, because they can fully enable the crew's peculiar cleanliness - which does not reduce the importance of clean Andy, especially When unfinished commanders make the same identities as regular dirt, they are regularly dirty. <br /> <br /> These episodes are presented as a brief, 2-3-minute report for Commander-to-Earth. Humor is a brain mix and harmful physical comedy. Remember the minister has fulfilled the red dwarf, but in the shoes-string budget. Science - All the common Plot Devices are here - Alien, Nuclear Weapons, Computer Errors - But each high grade laundry detergent is improved by the fresh Lemonade fragrance. <br /> <br /> Commander's logs are of course low budget, but some Chess effects and props fit the odd proofs of the show. Remember that the old batletture wore helicopter hockey helmet in the galactica? Is still visible with brand name? Okay, there's a lot of commander's log-in, but it's nice. <br /> <br /> Commander's logs are not high-end, but it is not what it is trying to do. It's just a little bit of fun to off-off. That's a good job.
