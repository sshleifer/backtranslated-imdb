Thirst <br /> <br /> I saw this picture nicely made. Cinematography was excellent top. Even though I could almost frozen any frame, and you would have yourself a fine picture. The color usage stands to the highest. In many cases the camera was gliding through the scene and the job was secure. <br /> <br /> The aspect of Park Chan Uek was fantastic. He was incredibly confident in my remote universe. There were several touchs of oral and visual smiles (a darker nature) that added another depth to the whole picture. <br /> <br /> I did not say anything extraordinary but it was good enough to fit the film <br /> <br /> <br /> For me, this film lacked only the story. Occasionally, I would not lie, going into letters was not only sensible. Sometimes the flow of stories was clunky. Overall, I was frustrated with the utter narrative, and I thought it ran a little more. <br /> <br /> I still recommend this movie, its views, its visibility, its dark humor and at the end of the day, it is incomplete even an interesting film. 9/10
