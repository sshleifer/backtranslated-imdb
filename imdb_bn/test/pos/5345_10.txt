Who can ask more? My 2 and 4 year olds were at risk of taking children, I admit. But good value. They withdrew from credit to credit, as well as their parents. <br /> <br /> I've come up with mixed results with kids' films: very scary, very boring, very sophisticated, whatever. However, with this movie, I was happy to see a smart movie with the emotion, emotions and style of the screen. A movie that produces 5 (!) Years to do good or bad, it is brave and deserves some respect for patience for such a film. <br /> <br /> o I'm a little awake. Then why not get excited? Remind me of the poor quality of the film that is distributed today through the list of movies. For at least moments, W & G has made a good movie. Perhaps fundamentalism was not the most inspired, nevertheless, well-told and well-paced. <br /> <br /> Very adult humor? Many sexual references? may be. Although my kids did not catch much. Absolutely young So, in my case, I have not really noticed. <br /> <br /> Well, not saying, I like it.
