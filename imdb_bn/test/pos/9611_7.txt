Crimson starts with some cool jazz music, so I like it immediately, but when I wear the film, I started to wonder that the music is not a good part. Some of our thieves are pulling an ornaments and when somebody makes a mistake, the alarm begins and the police go behind them and when the vehicle is blocked by the road, one of the thieves gets the shot (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whom he lives here). Now, he seems to die, but with the help of drunk doctor and his crazy-scientist friend (and wife), he survives some nightclub owner's brain "The Saddest" in the brain. Saddam is unfortunate that the person who was kidnapped, lost his knife in order to kidnap him, so to insult (or, in this case, death), they use the train to remove the head, find out the body for the authorities, oops. Once the brain is replenished, she wants to snatch any woman near her, because she now has her donor attitude. Well, of course, these seemingly unlikely and the purchase of radio equipment seems like medical equipment, and overall it is quite tasty and lazy. However, it's good to look good in the 70's and it feels good and the music is superb. It's not such a horror film, it's a thriller and a lot of cold mess and kids and other cool-style fights, but it's a strange way of entertainment that I can not start to describe. 10 out of 7
