After all, those who are obscure in the heart, of course this film should be avoided. Even like me, those who are mostly graphical and sensitive to sexual activity in movies, should be cautious. I'm not saying you walked away from the film, but be aware that you're going to see some annoying stuff. Definitely not to see a pleasant film, but for the quality of the shocks, nothing is done strictly on the screen. But I must admit, when I saw the second movie, then after the "Razor blade scene" came I had to go to the next chapter. <br /> <br /> The main character I think is one of the most disrespectful sympathetic characters, but after the humanity of its character, we start to understand the second act of the film better. In one scene, when he becomes nervous in front of the audience after being disgruntled by his visually disenchanted performance in his jacket pocket, and his broken glass stuff in one glass. The student goes to his pocket and shouted with pain, he looked at the blood-stained hand. Razor Blade was beside the scene, which made me quite annoyed. The student's mother is not more sympathetic than her. When the girl says that she can not play, she talks to her, as her daughter tries to torture her daughter to be kidnapped, her hand is also injured. <br /> <br /> While the film made me plot and in most cases took my interest, I started to explain more about Hupper's character in Isabella. When a woman is fascinated by Sondomosiocystic pornography and draws herself on that behavior, then you want to understand the problem origin of the problem. Establishes the film that he wants to love very much. So why everybody's hateful attitude? Why does he get sexual pleasure from pain? <br /> <br /> acting is extraordinary and I like shiny, stylized lighting. Above all, this is not a film that you would recommend to be entertaining while entertaining but I said it is very exciting. And I'm sure if I've seen it a few more times, then I'll be able to spot some things that will cause more stirring on film aspects which I did not initially understand. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
