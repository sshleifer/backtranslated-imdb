I want to "hack." "Lone Ranger" The resurrection as a 2000-year-old cab driver, a great but faulty man in Fieldelfia, who was suffering from his problem, when he tried to solve past problems in trouble and you got the summaries. David Morse is almost perfect as Olshansky. He helped the man, but rather instead of riding "silver" in the old West, instead of handing over the silver bullets, run a cab through the middle of the contemporary Fillie. Supporting cast first grade and above average. Occasionally, the malicious dialogue reaches the 70's classic series level, "The Rockford Files". This show expected a good time slot compared to Friday (East) 9 PM, deserved a return.
