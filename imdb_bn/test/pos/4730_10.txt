After reading this documentary, I hired it and saw it with my teenage children. It was surprisingly balanced, giving out the perspective of each side and leaving many answers without answering. As it is supposed to be. I did not see a documentary to know what to think. I see it learn and draw my own decision. After that, we took a tour of Weiko and we visited the branch's devils at the site of the conflict. This was a powerful lesson to see for yourself. And it increases fundamental underlying honesty behind the "WAQO: Rules of Inclusion". If you just open your eyes and look, the facts can say for themselves.
