Yes, sometimes "unauthorized love" is encouraged because it encourages - as it snowflakes - similarly the most unusual use of thematic elements and characters from one story material. Actually, for the second time I did not see this movie until I think PJ Hogan is trying to work with this playful, unusual flash. Perhaps the entire film is the metaphor for unconditional love, for which Grace (Kathy Bates) describes and describes the next part of the film. Grace says that without unconditional and qualification, unconditional love is just right. So I saw "dishonest love" again with that feeling. I smiled much more than ever for the first time, I was more involved in the characters, I realized, sometimes, the story makes it unreasonable. Performance is often at the top, but Hogan is nothing more than the need to fit the weird and grim outlook, a vision that makes me smile tears, desires and divisions. Yes, Hogan is asking a big deal to its viewers. But for one, I truly love her film - unconditionally.
