This movie was a comedy between strange humorous ... I can not believe that these people can take it. Johnny Noxville did not cross the line ... he was doing all the stops! This was better than the first ... all THA way! The thing I found about the first picture is that Schengen was somewhat like the one on TV. Show not now!!! They totally made 180 degree flips ... the whole cast is not that outstanding and crazy crazy ... but the music basically fits with every situation ... good work !!!! When you go, do not forget to use the bathroom before going to the theater, keep strong stomach and rimbo to spread your nose to your energy ....
