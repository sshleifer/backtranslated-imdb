I heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not called a horror movie but he would also describe himself as a psychological horror. I firmly subscribe to it. <br /> <br /> It is not clear why she travels to this place, but everything is lonely, no bright color, no laughing, nothing personal. Everything is ordered and everyone seems satisfied with living this kind of life. Our "hero" seems wrong since the beginning and feels himself. <br /> <br /> This picture makes it so important and good that in today's major cities or even in countries, there are remarkable similarities to life. You must work, not let your colleagues know about your weaknesses, you have shown your wealth, your car, etc. and you lack the true love of life in your life. Naturally, you will not see kids or old people in this movie - they just do not fit into the strong staff society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone - and make sure this ostrich does not come true!
