This BBC series is excellent. I'm not a paleontologist, but this series I've ever seen provides the best historical presentations of dinosaurs. 3D animations and animatronics are very good and you believe that you've traveled back again. The BBC has also qualified for the stomach behind Team Henes, along with the series, who spent a lot of time in reducing the series.
