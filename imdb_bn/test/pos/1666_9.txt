I heard they were going to rebuild this French classic in 2007, and I can see it developing for 2011. This is shameful because Hollywood has expelled writer / director Jules Dasin for his infamous blacklist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> (Gene Surreys) comes out after a nicole, and after bitting her old friend (Marie Saborrett), she plans to make a big score with her friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Joe (Carl Mohner) Doing this, it is a great attention to detailed plans of a copper flick robbery. You see that George Cloni reflects the vegas capper. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, after running out of it with Mario, they kidnapped Joe's son. Many fly before the end of the shot. <br /> <br /> A great director is a great movie. Other copper films are measured by that value.
