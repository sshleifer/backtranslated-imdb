I have seen Operation Cleopatra Estrich and Obelix, which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic. The whole film, like comics, is based on junior, junior poker and slopstick gag, which rarely falls flat. <br /> <br /> The Estonian and Obelix Gauss, the French who used the power of Roman Legionians to fight their natives. To prove the Egyptians as good as the Romans, the Egyptians helped them to build CÃ©sar's Palace (Yes Penalty) within three months. <br /> <br /> I chose this reason because Monica Baluchi Cleopatra is good but the role is a bit more than a camio. However, although he was rarely in the film, I was not impressive from his shiny and the jokes were so funny that I was in the violence. I love it I love so much that I do not understand why the American film was not released. <br /> <br /> The import DVD is in English Dob - it's good, especially when you consider it when you see it in the French version puns (and therefore Jokes) are not always clear after they are in-house, So if you read the wrong names, the joke is lost. Most of the jokes in French version and small English dances seem to be similar, although sometimes things have been good and sometimes they have changed for bad. Personally I will be with Dobb when I will be able to take this watch jokes and enjoy humor again. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it you would like to see it. But cute humor is a great comedy
