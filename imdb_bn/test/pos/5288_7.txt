Hayo Miyazaki has captured the imagination of young people and old people all over the world, and his latest movie work "Panoo," from Little Mermaid, is the story of children's children with storytelling. Of course "Spirit Away" and his last film "Haoul's Moving Castle" "Panoo" is full of creativity like other Miyazaki classics, which can only be really appreciated by adults, but it is obviously more stories than children. Those recent efforts It is a magical story that is described as beautiful and loving, which aims to make glasses instead of conflict. <br /> <br /> The story of the "Panoo" buggy in the same name, a girl undersea magician, who turns from the sea and becomes a little girl long. When he did, he quickly became a young boy friend named Sosuke. In this process, he has achieved a strong magic and has unknowingly made the earth unbalanced between the land and the sea, and the ocean storm has settled with his mother in most of the mountains, and it threatens to end the world. <Br> <br /> Like "Hawl's Moving Castle", Walt Disney chose "Ponio" for an American release and dubbed it with an impressive selection of Western voices, Disney bands selected Brother Brothers Brothers Brothers and even Homemade Products ( Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) respectively, Sosuke and Ponyo respectively. Also Liam Nisson (Fujimoto, Pioneer's father), Tina Fay (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (father of Sosuke), Kate Blanchet (Goddess Mother of Pioneer Sea) and three comedic women, multiple actress Batty White, Claris Lichmann and Lily Tommylin This effort must be made to appease the film to the American audience and to stop Disney. <br /> <br /> But voices in Miajaki film are a bit of significance, all of which are of creative creativity. A transformation transformer and animation fluid and fluid motion, partial results should be made under water to work with Miyazaki and perhaps a delight for his whole motivation to choose this story. Highlights include Fujimoto's living waves as well as the waterway, as well as other glorious sea animals and breathtaking storm scenes that wake up as a "Pinoo" like any Miyazaki film. However, as a child's choice, "piano" concentrates on attempts to become adorable. The true friendship between love and love between Sonny and Panini is heart-warming, even if Nancy Cyrus screams in childbirth, even if Ponya embraces human life, it can be a bit annoying. But the content of the imaginary elements and loving relationships is as pleasing as the slightest opposition or danger. There are clear villains in the past Miyazaki films, but as the story goes along, the conflict in "Panoo" has decreased. Sasu believes that he has lost his mother in a moment and in his background the world's concept is frustrating and people will have to be ashamed of pollution in the sea, but "Panoo" is mostly tension free. <br /> <br /> "Panoo" will definitely satisfy Miyazaki's fans with his imagination and the newcomers are still hurt by his simple but visually. Aspiring storytelling is not enough, but it is clearly more than the children's children's film, for the family and for others who do not like the formality, the form or the goal of the viewer. Not only is it what you expect from your recent work from Miyazaki, but it should be remembered as one of his favorite stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
