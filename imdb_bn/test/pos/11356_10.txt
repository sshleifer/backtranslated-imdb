I think the New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell in Review for the best one line of profit, when he said that it "is distraught with the romantic spirit which is missing from the movie forever." How true that words are! Truly romantic films are so rare these days, even though movies have large amounts of sex and nudity (often portrayed in a trick and ineffective way). So, this cinematic climate has been given, the latest movie of Wang Kar-Yi feels like the breathing of fresh air. In the mood for love, two neighbors ("Mr Chau," Tony Leung and "Mrs. Chan," played by Maggie Cheung), whose husband has an illegal relationship, "be like them." But after lonely night, to quarrel with each other After (when their spouse is taking care of "business" / "sick soil"), they become crazy in love and can resist temptation too far. <BR> <br /> There are a number of reasons to create a love mood that is a new classic among "romantic melodramus", in the best sense of that word. First, the film's specific period (eg Hong Kong of 1960) was reliably recreated in degrees. The clothes (with lovely dresses of Maji cheung), music (eg NAT King Cole), and the overall atmosphere of this film invents nostalgia for that time. Secondly, Christopher Doyle won the prize, the sensationally beautiful cinematography created an environment that does not engrave only two of its main characters, but each of its sculptural metriculations matches the romantic desire in the framed frame. Do not make any mistake about it: In the mood for love was 2001's most beautiful movie. (It should also be noted that Wang Kar-Yai's usual hyper-kinetic visual style for this movie (perceived) is just as colorful.) Third, there are hunting scores by Michael Galasso, which includes slow sequences, including Chan for his elegant dresses, Chan and Chouk cross each other alongside each other alongside stairs and other beautiful scenes, which elevate itself in your memory Ole, walking crime. The main score - which makes the sound of his machines literally crying - is heard in different parts of the film, and it shows two main characters' feelings and longevity. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheng both provided excellent performances (won the award for best actor in the ear) and they managed to create genuine chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> The above elements combine and work so nicely together. Create a movie that feels timeless, "dizzyingly romantic," and, a word, magical. Love Mood In, probably more than any other film in 2001 reminds me why I'm going to "movies". And I suppose that is the highest praise that I can give a film. <br /> <br />
