Even with the very popular title of this movie, I like artwork and canvas layouts in one of the Japanese national islands. We see some of the great rolling green mountains and some oriental houses in a coastal town. Immediately we see the beauty of the theater widescreen on the Pacific beauty. And to prove to me how accurate this film is, I would be proud of Charles Darwin. Evolution class teachers and biology department teachers will fantasically support Hai Miyazaki brand's new movie "Panoo". The title character, as you can see, can be the perfect animation icon for media representing all the classrooms and auditoriums. In addition to all the scientific aspects of <br /> <br />, let's immerse yourself in the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a skinny, old and powerful magician named Fujimoto, who lives in a plunge and expresses concern about the expansion of city of mankind and the industrial waste pollution. He wants to take control of the sea and live a beautiful aquatic vivacious life with fish and animals. Fujimoto, whose blood is made of semi-human and semi-anxiety, is similar to both the anti-sea protagonist and opponent; James Bond villain Strouberg like spy Hu Lvd M, who runs an Atlantis-dubbed underwater city. <br /> <br /> <br /> Her daughter, whom she treats as a caring pet, is called Ponyo. She looks like a big goldfish who already has a beautiful red-haired girl. Parents banned him from the real human world, it is dangerous and excessive demand to handle it. But quite obviously, the quest of curiosity of Pen√©o is strong like his extraordinary nature. Finally, with the building power, like the wonderful scenes from Nick Park's "Chicken Run", he got rid of his father's rocky and fossil wetlands, swimming in Japan's water page, and taking care of his good luck and happiness. A young man named the ship tanker called Sosuke. <br /> <br /> A beautiful beach (or rocky sea beach) living in the front of the ocean, two acting parents of Sosuke, a senior home worker Lisa and the tanker Barz Kochi's first companion. Lisa is angry with her to stay away on the street and leave her for all the housework. Even more, the black magic created by Panoyi creates a mysterious chain of events: the moon encompasses the Earth very closely and tides swell wave from the imbalance of the interaction energy, and many tsunamis are peaceful but empty cities. However, this curse seems less valuable and seems literally more powerful than the supernatural power, friendships between the old-time Captain Sasuke and the Red Headed Poyoia, are strongly related to friendship, who want to be more sensitive than just a reserved fish. Like the violent and free-fans in The Lord of the Rings, Ponyo reminds me a little bit. <br /> <br /> I can write about this amazing animated film, since the best "Coraline" was in February theater. And now, offer your eyes on more than 10 grades from Hayo Miyazaki, your Animation fan, Graham Abraham. Year 2009 may be filled with animated films; However, Ponyo should be the most beautiful film of many environmental beauty and dedicated to the world as a new wonder.
