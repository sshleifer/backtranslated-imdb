One of the most famous serials of all movies! It is still interesting although it has an "old movie" look like it. The second serial looks good but simply does not equal this one. The actor has a good time, especially in Middleton and Lipson. Great editing by Universal Expert crew. The musical score was tracked from Universal's "Unknown Unknown", "Invisible Man", "The Black Cat" and "Weorolf of London". And it was great action music! There was always a choice for the best serial, this should be (arguably) # 1.
