Yes, we will bring it out before starting: * After the resignation of Roger Moore in 1983, Sian came back to the connanny. * It's the last picture of Connie. * And yes it's a (kind) remix of Thunderbolt, but more of a movie inspired by it. If you think all bond purists are out I'll be controversial, you're right. Bond is one of the greatest film series ever, but this does not mean that the series will continue forever. This, I think, one of the two movies where they could work themselves on a huge side and end the bond Saga. Still not angry? Then I'll be continuing ... Hey, if you think I'm indecisive about Bond Flix, you're wrong. I grew up with my mother as I grew up. No extra moments, bonds and its antics will be on the TV. The rules of the bond, and 'Never Say Never Again' (Irvin 'Empire Strike Back' cursor) is the best one. It may not be 'Goldfinger' or 'From Russia ...' and may not be in the same Production House as everyone else (which I have heard why they have refused to accept it! Head and Shoulders are standing on the latest Brooding Instruments ... (If you do not spot on screen then read) Characterization !!!!! Many blockbuster movies have forgotten these days, but for a good story, Essentially, after 'adolescence' since 007, 'never' has played a great hand 'Dr.', he has become 'somewhat frustrated' and therefore has to do something like a healthy farm - direct orders from 'M' (!) Yes, If you have not seen this movie then I will not go too far with the plot because A) loads happen and B) Clearly, I want to see it for myself. My 'old bond' will not be abandoned by the publication, Connie still charges a lot of pretty set pieces, swim, punch, speed, destroy, and snog his way. A legend of the people, and this is one of his most enjoyable outings as picture bonds. Lots of high tech gadgets, some great villains and a wonderful supporter cast (including a fantastic camera of Roman Etkinson) made the movie higher than the audience's expectations. <br /> <br /> It could never be the last bond film, and it has been a team to remember. The retiring talent as a secret agent or a retired person was a refreshing stroke - the last scene covered things completely for the series ... ... but still we had more, and more, and more and more a moore . However, if you search for everything about "Fatima Blas", get this movie. Then at least at the end of 2007, with Kim Basing's weapon, he spent his last moments as a secret agent of an advertisement and started laughing at Mr. Binte. (PSS * Another picture that I think could end it all?
