This last evening I had the opportunity to meet at the local film festival. Harjog started the film and later made Q & A an hour long. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant "documentary"; Harzg later explained that he did not consider his films as true documentary in the real fact of disguise. Instead, he has inspired some scenes and advertisements to present a new piece of script which can be missed if following the outline of the original story. <br /> <br /> Little Ditcher, in contrast to Timothy Trudeau, that you are in love with a real person; You are glad for him, he feels that feeling. After 30 years of being captured by Viet Kong, he appreciates the joy and joy of living here. You are frustrated to hear that Deeter has not passed long ago. <br /> <br /> In most of the heroin movies, the picture is exciting with the wonderful selection of background music. Particularly the battle scene taken from the Vietnam War archive, but fix the line of Ditare's story. <br /> <br /> The original part of the photo comes back to the director where he enacts his journey with a pound and he re-locates some. Heroning to see us, I can not imagine what she felt because she was bound again. <br /> <br /> One of the better movies to illustrate and discuss the nightmares of the Vietnam War. It should serve us all as a lesson.
