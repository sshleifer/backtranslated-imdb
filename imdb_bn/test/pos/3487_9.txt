A very mysterious giallo from the director of "El Antichristo" (1974), it starts with a brilliantly organized sequence involving a pastor, a small girl, and a broken doll. However, about the main story puzzle (David Warbeck) married a deadly lubricant life to kill him for his money. This plot, though not original, is really suspicious, the acting is good and there are many efficient and lethal killings. Francesco de Maseer's score is quite effective, some of which will be heard at Lucio Flachi's "The New York Ripper" (1982). Frequently recommended for fans of Italian cinema!
