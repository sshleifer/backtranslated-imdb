Bit is the "movie movie" case, or the theme is the virtual game here, which is the reality or the more horrible reality that is "real". Like a craneberg, there are organic things such as pods and surprising ideas: Organic guns, bones and tissues made up of arms that shoot the teeth. If there are some slow moments, there are set ideas, designs and ideas with some ideas of revolution. The movie can not be liked because it is quite unusual and sometimes annoying but it is certainly worth it.
