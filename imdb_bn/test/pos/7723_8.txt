This film is a perfectly adaptation of the novel of Prosper Marymeyey. In the novel, Mary herself is a character, Don Jose Navarro (northern Spain, and historically a Basque country region, they can speak Basque). They are Seville (Andalusia, South Spain) and they speak Spanish with Andalusian accent, they can not speak in Basque, Carmen Don Jose said that he is living in Narara. You can not believe it, however, this version of the book, you can not be critical with the movie about this, stay with the book! You must separate the novel from the Miramie and the budget opera, and this film is an adaptation from the novel, however the opera Don Jose is still the Neighborhood Spanish, he is never French. Why do so many people think Don Jose French? I do not know but I guess because novels and operas are in French, although Spanish is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The only important difference between the film and the novel is that the film also kills Don Jose Carmen's "Torrero" boyfriend and he is not in the novel (nor opera). I think they want a little more emphasis on the movie! I think movies are pretty good, however.
