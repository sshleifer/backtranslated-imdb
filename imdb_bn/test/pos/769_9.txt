Driving lessons are a small film that can be torn off on you. The first one is a bit of a sculptor's Nonsense comedy, a classic story of British style coming to his age and the need for significant friendship between both young and old. The author, Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Brown', 'Charlotte Gray', 'The Last King of Scotland'), has directed its own play and the result is a combination of engaging, progressive and interesting characters, each performed by Sterling Actors <br/> <br / > Ben Marshall (Rupert Green, who established himself as a developing actor in the Harry Potter series), with his lotus for seventy years A quiet, little little poet, watching Vika's parents (Nicholas Farrell) and his unwanted compulsory, harsh, evangelist guilty woman (Laura Linnni), where the hateful cross-dressing Mr. Fincham (Jim Notton), is the home of the people in need of family: Mother Using Ben with the father (Oliver Milburn), his cover is way with an affair as well! Saad Ben is among the other things he is trying to learn to drive a car. Her mother is a poor teacher and she needs professional lessons and decides that she needs to get a job to help the poor Mr. Fincham need. Ben follows an advertisement and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly actress who has ever created a character. He rented Ben and started firearms. Through various events, including the camping trip, EVA wants to demand from them, the absence of the nature of each other's lives: Ben learns self-confidence and self-confidence and finds real friends of ive, who is his staging rage and <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rupert Greene is the right choice for the final upcoming Ben. Chemistry is flexible among the classic film 'Harold and Mood'. Laura Linney is always as a great actress playing a role from her normal repertoire. And a panorama of subtle characters throwing support. This picture is a delightful surprise and one heart to warm up and those who love delicate writing and instruction and acting - and love to confirm the message! Grady Harp
