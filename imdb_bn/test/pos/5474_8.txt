Wolfgang Petersen (Dash Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting movie where actor actor John Malkovichov goes to. His crime rate was credible and conviction for the killing of the President. <br /> <br /> It does not reduce the effort of Clint Eastwood and Rune Rousseau, even Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays with White's actual jolt, House Chief of Staff. Eastwood was fantastic, and I love the movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < That alone makes it worth your time.
