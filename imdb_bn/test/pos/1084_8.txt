Abu Rak Chappan is a fabulous story about a police department in Mumbai, India. Sada Agas, a hard-working, hard-armed police, who formally designated criminal gangs, instead of locking them in jail, police killed the dangerous criminals in a clash and made a name for themselves. His loyal officials obey him without question, but one officer of his staff, Imtiaz, was frustrated with the high status of Saddu and competed secretly with him for murdering the criminal. A new appointment was pushed into marriage and Imtiaz became angry when Sada led his first case. Further changes came in the form of a new police commissioner who denied the technique of Sadu and everyone was caught in internal politics. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see the well-directed Action Thriller from India. Camera work is excellent, the story is well called and the drama unfolds when the excitement is high. Acting, speed, and political missiles firmly believe that they are watching blood, sweat and tears from the intimate and personal view of the wall, and the incident is based on the reality, which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film, though it Perhaps the director, Shimit Amin, gained independence with the real information. Yet, A Tech Teaser is a highly polished piece of film making.
