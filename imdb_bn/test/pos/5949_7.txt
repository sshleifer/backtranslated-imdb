I saw this step in Paris in May 2006 ... I was debating among the impossible missions ... I am so glad that I chose the Osse 117 because it was fun but could see a French movie while in France. I had a great time ... it would recommend. The French Society of Today has something to understand for enjoying some movie humor ... I can not wait to get the DVD out ... I do not know some 'Zeu de Mots' will be translated into English, I will definitely buy it when it's over! Again, I've seen 'Bryce de Nice' who is acting in a movie Dzurzdin that the children were speaking in France. This movie is a comedy but can be imagined without imagining ... than both movies, I want to say that Dajardine did well in OSON 117.
