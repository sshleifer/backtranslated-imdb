I remember this film at the age of 13 and I fell in love with him and I was a great fan of the movie and the characters I enjoyed. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holika), because he laughs me when Fred (Cameron Dye) did not see any interest in him who really liked him and I hope that they meet together, then his boring lover, Ralphi (Christopher Murray) He ignored him and quarreled with his friends. I love the cast and the story. While always trying to stay together with Fred Stacey, I always love that part, and I always remember him when he drove him around the car. But it was very good. I always remember that my teen years cherish that. Now I am 33 years old and I will be looking forward to picking up my copy of DVD and watching it.
