That's right. Wahawan (painter and main character) is an exceptional person. The message that can be sent to all your people is the biggest blow to me. And the message is sad. It says that without considering the government, establishment and other VIPs of this world, it is very difficult to do something amazing or even gifted. Even if you try, you will not be able to tolerate it. It's about a single person's war with a system. With many systems <br /> <br /> This wonderful Korean director is a great movie. If you have an opportunity please see it.
