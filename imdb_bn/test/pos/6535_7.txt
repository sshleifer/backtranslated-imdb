Arak Karter Pop star (J. D. McQueen) played this movie. This is a common movie where Jane McChwin's huge crush of leading female pop star (and many other girls) is a lucky one, who is living with JD and has a relationship with him. More like a fantasy. Jay to visit his summer D. Who has to go to a public school to keep a grade of mathematics. Problem jd Mathematics is not good. She found out the variant in the school (Jane). Knowing Tutorials and J. D. J. D. Love falls in love again and falls in love but J. D. Screw up and the girl has to do everything to win and to make a summer trip.
