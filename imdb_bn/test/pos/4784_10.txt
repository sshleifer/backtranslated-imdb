As a son of Marcelin, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on the scrap of farm; Later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he painted an angle in front of his car. In Kansas City, alongside artist Ub Weaver, Walt created a primitive animation studio that provided animated advertisements and small cartoons for local movie theaters. Always inventive, Cartoonland series breaks the ground to establish a live image of a cartoon universe in its Alice. In 1923 Business Reversals sent Disney and Weisars to Hollywood, where Walt's elder brother Ray was a businessman and consultant in his lifetime. When a lucky rabbit was robbed by a light successful series distributor with Oswald, Mickey Mouse's character turned into Walt's imagination, ensuring the immortality of Disney. Mickey's screen debut as a happy arrival of happiness technology, Stambett Willie (1928), is an extraordinary audience success with the use of rich music. Soil Symphenes appeared soon, and the growing crew of Walt's wonderful gifted animators quickly conquered new territories with the complete development of color, depth illusion and personality development, which is a place that Walt's genius was unlikely. Mickey's skill, naughty behavior captured millions of fans, but soon joined other animated partners: Mood Donald Dock, intellectual-challenged Goffi and Energetic Pluto. All this was ready for Walt's grandest dreams - feature length animated films. Against the flurry of the culprits, Walt is perseverant and happy in the next decade with the courage of Snow White, Pinocchi, Dumbo, Bamby and Peter Pan, children of all ages. Walt never forgot that his fate began with the mouse, or always stopped the little simplicity and hard work of the message.
