The story of a Token Black Man on Putney Swaype, a major advertising director board, who accidentally voted for the chairman of the board when the owner of the firm was very excited about the scene that he was trying to leave an idea. Of course, Putin takes a new role in her heart and shoots most of the agency in the agency, hires a new crew (a token is all black except the white guy), and can ask a question about the most offensive and non-PC ads. For Now it manages to be successful in some way when it is instead raking in cash in spite of a hottie crew and cash in it. I like the scene where potential advertisers are being freed from cash bags and then say "come out". And after their commercials, do not follow them like them. The story is good but the highlight here of course is one for the nasty business, especially "face off" acne cream. It's rather dated, but still a fun movie, and full of sunny moments. Robert Downey was working for an advertising company advertising advertisements at that time, and I guess it was a finger between the Madison Avenue company. Very good and pretty damned fun. 10 out 8
