50 years ago I saw this movie when I was released on minor movies in the UK; And memory remains a great musical score, and story tragedy. I recently saw it again in the video. The sound track was poor and the pictures were grainy; But the next day I saw one of the two pictures, the other gladiator. The music theme is extremely tragic, and from the beginning it is known that it starts with failure or death. Of course, George Sander is one of the best performances; To return to the black market a man lost in the war, but the generosity is waiting; Patricia Rock plays a refugee from Eastern Europe eating with frustration. He is attracted to her, willing to help him selflessly, and then falls in love with her, but she is very proud and hurt to accept help. Their love destroys them, and inevitably girls and doctors (Herbert Marshall), who brought generosity. The storyline is complex intertwining destinyies, where helpful characters are not present in the stars. This is a movie which critics disappointed and struggled at the box office; But for the teenager who has seen it, and retired gentleman who once saw it, it is one of the greatest films (considering his age) whose story is more like the opera.
