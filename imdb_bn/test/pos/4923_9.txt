I see this movie at the beginning of this summer, and it does not make me entertained. Here the jokes are packed near each line of dialogue, which gives you more rumors than the average Simpsons episode. The joke will get a little flat or just wake a little chocolate, but others will let you go rolling away and then stuck in your brain ... "Visitors are now deaf." <br /> <br /> Video knows this is a video, and anything else makes me curious about it. It's easy to sit down and start the comedies bomb blast. A good mix of slopstick, pop culture and tongue-in-cheek comedy ensures that there is something for everyone. I first saw this video when I was in class 6, and I must admit that I still think of being a cheerful start of college. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, Christmas or "Easter / Passover" you can see "this is an extraordinary life" of Ten Commandments to see this summer. More than that, it's fun like hell
