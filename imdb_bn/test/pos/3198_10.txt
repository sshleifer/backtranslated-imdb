I grabbed it as a part of the Cartoon Nire package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was only brilliant; Save grace about what was wrong to forget about another wrong mistake in the film. <br /> <br /> Excellent, yet a perfect use of dark black and pure white with easy animation, it's just a story chasing the cat moon. Funny, charming, and touching. Cat Lovers, a small piece of paradise for romanticism, and anyone appreciates how easy simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it. This is a short admission price price.
