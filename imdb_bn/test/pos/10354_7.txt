I felt compelled to comment on this movie because it is listed as the fourth lowest rating scientist in IMDB. What!?!? Of course, this movie is painful, but it's Hillary! It's not horrible on an ad wood level, it's more real and infinite. <br /> <br /> The film has some classic moments. The brain's operation is fairly elegant - even when you consider that the film has been rated PG rating! Behind the back of the back of the rear behind behind the back and behind the back. Jankar Bharakf's discourse at the beginning of the film- "Before the Aamir, there was another weak race to struggle to get rid of the permanent feudalism of the ink century!" Angelo Roseto has some great lines- "No, no! No!" "Do you want this key, no, in my love?" It is absolutely wrong that it is the fourth lowest-rated movie on IMDB, because it is being entertained. How bad a movie is, it is still strange, playful, unrestrained, or not operated in entertainment, but it is worthwhile and it is not worth the dump and cancellation. I will not protect most of Al Adamson's film security, but Dracula V. Frankenstein and the horror of the Horse horse, are amusing enough to prepare for their horror.
