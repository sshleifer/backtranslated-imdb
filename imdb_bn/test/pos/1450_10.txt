I watched fifteen years old and thirty images of Sinatra's film (TV shows and documentaries videos are not counted) and only two of them are obsolete. "The Clouds Roll By," and "Bell's Character" does not really count, but considers that the first thing that he does is "All Man Man Revivant", and later he does not have my pictures, favorite shows, TV shows and movies It changes with Sinaatra almost every day - for each watch, different and different things, and sometimes it seems to be the best thing to do. And sometimes the worst, until the cycle comes around again, but relatively few things exceeds that. In the movie, "The Mandane The Golden Arms" manages this list. Anyone who knows about the hymn knows that it was his best- ever acting; He was nominated for Oscar; This was the first serious aspect of drug abuse; Etc. The jazz score is unforgettable, despite the fact that Kim Novak is a ridiculous pronunciation, Alan Parker is boring and very dramatic, turtle - such as Arnold Standfire, but more embarrassing during the time, and Darren McGavin creates a surprisingly addictive drug dealer, sets disrespectful - at first glance it is a weird Mixed bag is great with an off-center charm with auto-promotion It seems to be united. <br /> <br /> Then you came to Sainatra. Everything else in his life is good - in addition to songs - his performance reports are divided into almost half-parts. All directors like Fred Geneman, Frank Capra, Billy Wildor, Stanley Crumer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich, and Otto Pringing all agreed that Sinatts had worked hard to sing in his film, he was among the greatest actors in the world - if not the greatest. Humphrey Bogart even said, "This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." Not bad for a person who never played in his life, at the same time he created such a composer by creating "the greatest singer of the 20th Century" and took almost all his scenes. <br /> <br /> The direct confrontation with all of these is curiously about the other reviews and biographies of this senior actor and how many "bad" films he had made. The question will not be answered because of the debate among the greatest assets of satisfaction, and both arguments are playing in his hand in a sense. In any case, at this time, this role, Sinatra great. One study said it "can not be the world's best senior actor, but there is no one more interesting to see." It does not matter what you're doing in a movie, which is very easy to close your eyes. Of course, this is a "charisma", which I have seen among just a few other people - Orson Wells, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift - perhaps James Cagny There is no real definition for it and it makes it difficult to determine whether it is really enjoying a function or simply spelling, but the quality of the display here is the movie that produces. Sinatra uninterrupted writing, real, intense - ten times and thousands of paper-doll stars, which can be said. Like it or not, it's one-man show with some character actor hanging around in the background. He shouts with Kim Novak's sweet, lonely softness, from the scary shock of Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!), In the pain of "cold turkey". Sinatra was right - this is his best performance. No question <br /> <br /> I was eight years old when Frank Sinatra died. Album with album and post with "Swinwen Lovers" album, "Kennedy, Vegas," I have been Bobby-Sosers and "Anchor Away", "Mr. Aww Gardner" ring-a-ding-dong all year round. Concert from Bassi and Mia and Reagan and Madison Square Garden to the White House Sands in South Africa. I can not say that I like Sinatara because I heard him on the paramount or because I heard "My September of My Years" autobiographically-the usual excuse. And my excuse? When I was 11 years old, I saw a movie called "On Town" ...
