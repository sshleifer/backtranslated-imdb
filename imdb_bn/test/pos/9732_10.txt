This is a movie that you are incredibly tired when renting, or helpless in some other way ... acting in this movie is so bad that it seems deliberate and to tell you how bad the particular effects are when a doll is coming alive where you keep the doll Most of a hand can see, moving with it. The film seems to have been portrayed by Camcoder. When I first saw this movie, my friends and I were calling each other from this flicker when it was a fatal incident, how terrible it was. You enjoy being crazy in movies, but I recommend it to you, otherwise, if your life is dependent on it, run away.
