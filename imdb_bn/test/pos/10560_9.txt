I did not read the book Sarah Water. Although I did not read the book, but the 3-hour movie is very funny. It starts with an interesting storyline with a twisted end. I have to say this 2 actress is amazing. Sally Hawkins has nicely portrayed the character of love with her boyfriend and betrayed her love. Their romance gradually spends more time together as they flower. The scene of love is very flexible and emotionally, well played. The last is quite a curiosity and this is a blessing which is to end together after all, which they have together. Overall, it's a great movie to watch, a very interesting plot with excellent performance.
