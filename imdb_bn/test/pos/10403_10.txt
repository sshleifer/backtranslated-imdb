I, for one, absolutely loved this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a "general Asian awful" where you will see a terrific looking ghost (usually a female) that scares people. You can see a ghost for most movies, but this movie keeps you interested in the plot and the characters are gifted. This is not a movie for you if you are in Gore (for example, a hostel) or "Wonderful fear" where the stuff pops out on you (Hollywood horror, Slashar film), but there is an insightful "obscure" factor throughout this movie that I Like it Noure is a progressive and somewhat experimental method that is a ridiculous resurgence, and in today's society, Hualien is released by Hewlett-Pack <br /> <br /> Please do not let the documentary-style of filming stop you (why it should?!). This is very different from the Blair Witch project, because for one reason, acting in Norei is brilliant and it really makes you feel like you're watching something you do not see. <br /> <br /> Noroi is certainly one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Only a few movies have made it into my Top 5 horror; And this movie holds a hard # 1 spot on my list.
