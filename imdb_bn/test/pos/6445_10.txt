I have seen this movie as a child and have been in love with it. This is a sweet sensitive story. Some children can appreciate. I liked it as a child for my daughter. It's definitely a movie I would see with kids. It reminds me of a great deal of story of a Disney-style story like a belly dragon and Mary Poppins. Both live action and cartoon features but in its premises. It is a good story to show kids that if they say the truth they can be believed and the adults will listen to them. I think all the kids should see it and enjoy it. This is because of the breakdown of this violent film of bad taste, many children see these days. Today's movies do not have such charming qualities.
