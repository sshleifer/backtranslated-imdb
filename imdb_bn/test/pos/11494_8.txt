I like this picture! It has a great heart and great bone. I stumbled onto it by chance and I did not have any recollection of this movie, even an inkling, from the promotion or review or sound words. Many years ago, I remembered, a journalist who commented on the cost of watching movies without being polluted by the pre-sentence judgment or false rock of propaganda. And these critics seem to be the single source of negative reactions to the film: it failed to fulfill the expectations of a comedy, or a part of life, or character. I did not have any expectations about the film, and so it was ridiculous - but I only smile once or twice - without a comedy; It was about a person, but so awful that it was not part of life; It was about a character, but the character was so smartly optimistic and believed in his innocence of life that it is not a progressive transmitted melodram like American 'serious' film - as I wrote that I was able to have fun with the author / director Lisa Krueger's image of this authoritarian husband ! And very clever! And the Kruger was able to finish the tired image from the screen, when the deviated, not fertile, the husband returned with his tail shrinking in his feet. Bravo, Mrs. Kruger, Bravo! (Now I will see this movie again, because it is better and better to be reflected on it.) <br /> <br /> Graham's performance like Joline is brilliant. I was able to illustrate and fully express how much I fully understood his commitment to his words and deeds - he knew that he was the band, or the friends, or the husband that he himself had set himself up for laughing And / or the promise of a frustration that he was capable of Was not acceptable. But with that power, he was fully involved with humanity, and took the fully grateful heart with their weaknesses and failures. Jolien's character played wonderfully, and I wondered the picture that there is no memory of my nomination prize. Well, do not be surprised, American rewards go to women in 'serious' role, meets the anti and correct nudity, which is not in the film. It was a lot better, which disguised itself with the help of this new woman, the heart and self-rescuing Shaman. <br /> <br /> I accept to be a soft touch for the poisonous characters who manage their specialties in spite of being honest and true even when they go through matching fields with 'proper' social behavior and 'acceptable' interpersonal statements. So, if people have to adhere to the naturalness of your world, then this image will not be your choice. And it was, it seems, one of the common threads of criticism. <br /> <br /> When I raise the question of man's behavior and moral / philosophical values, I'm always hungry for a good game. Until this movie I have not committed the emotional relationship between committed (no reason or fidelity or something) and committed (an insane shelter). What commitment does the truth and the personal feeling of action become the only way to become crazy? It sounds like it is a simple question, or easily dismissed as ornaments. But what is it? And still some of the critics - I think maybe two, this movie has been commented directly or indirectly. <br /> <br /> A beautiful picture. 8/10. <br /> <br />
