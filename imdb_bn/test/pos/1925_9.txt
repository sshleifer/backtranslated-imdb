This is the story of a journey that a man once dreamed and crying. Donald Crowhart was an English businessman and amateur sailor who took part in the Sunday Times Golden Globe race, single handed-out, round-the-world yacht race competition. <br /> <br /> I was very curious to hear stories, a radio interview by producer John Smith, who was a producer of "Touch the Voed", one of the first documentaries to achieve commercial success in 2003. I went to the movies with great hope and historical facts with previous knowledge, and I was released that it was not me down. For 92 minutes I led through a hunting story and came out with a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> Without any feedback, this image made great use of limited audio and video archive footage and it was a compulsory story that allowed audiences to understand Crowhurst from personal level. The story was published directly with direct links to his wife and his son, and the last winner, who was able to bring it back to 9 participants, Robin Knox-Johnston gave his own account of what happened 40 years ago <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, a man . When Crowhurst's body was found, another competitor Nigel Tetley drowned after just a few weeks to claim the reward for a quick prize for three years after the success of Yacht's rapid circusavigation failure. <br /> <br /> Everything can take its toll, especially the sea. <br /> <br /> Director Luis Oasmand was in the question hour session after meeting with producer John Smithson. I did not have any idea that it was a female director and that came as a very nice surprise. This image gets limited publication in the UK (few days in a specific movie). Hold the movie in it unless you have a situation in the sound system of the sound system that you can rebuild the sound ocean. Then I'm sure it will be in the DVD soon.
