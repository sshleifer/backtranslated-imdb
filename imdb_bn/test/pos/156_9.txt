This slip vampire flick comes from Oldby's director. The star as a pastor of the Kong-ho song, who has suddenly changed into a purple, is cured of a deadly, mysterious virus. His vampiresis and priesthood are quite contradictory, but he is able to survive by robbing the blood bank and unconscious patients of the hospital, who can not remember some bloodshed. Because of his supposed miraculous living, he came into the life of Han-kun Shin's family. Shin has cancer, and her mother believes that the song can cure it. Unfortunately, the height of the song's vampires raises the rise of its level where he can not help but Shin's young wife, OK-Vin, falls for Kim. Kim Vampirezimm is interested in the world's deep interest, and has become two lovers. That image is strange, which I think should be experienced for myself. What should the channel of Chan-Uk Park really be mentioned? My God, I've rarely seen such a great visible artist at the top of his ability. The main drawback of the film is that it is a little helpless, especially at the beginning. Park is very interested in telling her story in visuals, which can be difficult to follow occasionally. But when it works, man, do not fly it. The picture is opposite to the sun shine The final sequence, easily one of the decade's best, is heartwarming and delightful ridiculous together. Ok-Ohin Kim will be the world star after this photo. He gives one of the best performances of the year.
