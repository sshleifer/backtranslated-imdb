I was very impressed with Martha's description and was drawing attention to the audience's heartwarming and how it influenced the family. The back of the story was well done and usually I did not enjoy the movie with flash-back / flash-forward effects. I felt during the movie's full evolution that "Of course Tommy did it". How do they completely separate each other from your life and leave you with the feeling of having no desire to answer this question, "It's 10 o'clock." Do you know where your child is? " And more, "What are they doing?" !! Or "I care?" !! Getting away with wealthy, wretched brats literally killing Or did they think .......
