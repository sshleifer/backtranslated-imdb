The end of the film Why did Shan Connery's men not fight with the French instead of the Germans? The French captured Algeria in 1830, because the tribes of Morocco and the Algerian tribes were dispersed in the French military and civilian settlements. This film can be consistent with the historical perspective where the French seized Rusadli, its followers will not attack Algeria, and its followers attacked the French to liberate her. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical of shootouts still between German and Americans. Americans shot the Germans, their guns (even pistols) sound aloud, loud bloody bullets create wounds, and their enemies shot and shouted. When the Germans fire Americans, their guns do not make big noise, do not cause bloody wounds, and their enemies do not shoot or make no sound. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ The cross was not reliable, was not reliable and the rifle bolt was always jamming. German was one of the best rifles in the fun world. We were so impressed with the Spanish American war that we made a copy of it and called Springfield Rifle. Finally, the people of Morocco had artillery term for their dispute against Morocco. When Rushdie felt stupid, I did not like that the artillery word was not in the Muranic vocabulary. Instead, Rasuddin said that Europeans had guns on the ants that made the soil.
