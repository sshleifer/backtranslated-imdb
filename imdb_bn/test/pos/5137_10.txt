HOOT is trying to save a bunch of these three teenage kids who are burrowing uprooted. Now I think that they stand up to what is right and what is wrong. In this photo Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lurman) moved to Montana from Florida to a child's name. And once after a bus, a deadly name, Dana Millson, finally started rape, the next day convicted Rauf and carried the bus following the mysterious moving boy. Ray finally finds the son of Rolling, whose name is Mulllet Finger's (Cody Linley), whose nickname Betriss (Bry Larsson) gave her nickname because she could catch mullet with her bare hands. However Mulllet Fingers and Ray became friends and they joined together with Beatrice to stop the construction of a new Pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers all happened that one of the broken back and after he got the bits by one of the dogs kept there to guard the dog. So they stood up to run the bulldozer and everyone turned it into a great movie, because it shows that kids can distinguish life by standing right and wrong. That's what's great about this movie It teaches many about wildlife and how important it is.
