I saw this mini series in high school. I remember as being absolutely brilliant and compulsive. At that time, I did not know which British actor in Syria, but since then we have learned that some of today's stars are San Connie (among other roles in other James Bond), Judy Dunk ("many other roles" in love with Queen Elizabeth "Shakespeare") and Ilin Atkins (Probably the most familiar for creating "upstairs / downstairs" but also great acting roles). Like ntabyakarira, I want to see it again. I'm not sure that would be timeless, and I hope it will yield bhieicaesa or DVD will be released. If you get a chance to see it, do not miss it.
