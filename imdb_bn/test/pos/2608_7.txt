A cute picture of this "Aung Gang" comedy starring Spankee, Alfafa and Bakwit. Setting in the south during the civil war, Bakwit, as Spaniard's slaves, may seem a bit weird, but this film is as compelling as the best of shorts with the same cast. It was our only gang feature film, and I highly recommend it to rebuild Lilly Rescals from 1994.
