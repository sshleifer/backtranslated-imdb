This is a very "right case" movie that lets you fix almost everything on your face. I liked a Christian and film in one way. It had some mean performances from the original person and you could definitely see it as it was a low budget. It may be a bit longer, but the film has some nice cars that can retrieve it from my low ratings. It was quite good as a Christian film, but maybe a little right message. The film works best on a big screen. * Speaker * The fight scene with two brothers can remind you of the scene of the fight between the two brothers of Eric Roberts's "Mary Street" Christian thriller. * Spiller's end * I can give it 7/10.
