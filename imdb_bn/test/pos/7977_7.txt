I really enjoyed looking at hell to pay salaries. As long as I can remember, I was a fan of Westerners and in the 1960's it reminded me of the West (though I was too young to meet at their first run). There was a constant music that was disturbing me about the movie. It was confusing at times. I noticed one thing, and I'm surprised how many fans of Gansok have noticed, this was the name of Talk Taylor's character. This was a game in the name of Gansouk Doc Adams. Instead of Gayle Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. The surprise of his choice or Chris McEnter? However, I would recommend this movie to western fans. Do not expect anything too "deep". Just plain old entertainment.
