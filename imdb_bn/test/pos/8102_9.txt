By the end of the 1930s, Charles Chaplin's attention towards the creation of Nazi power in eastern Europe increased his reaction. The catalyst has probably expressed a campaigner referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created parody of Hitler's death, which is interesting, because it is sometimes horrifying. This image marks Hitler's experience in the German army from World War I today. At the same time, Chaplin plays a Jewish sailor who has been wearing a trump-like dress after a long time, only to discover how much different under the universal Nazi regime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> While playing, a Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish dress. Jack Okey's superb, Oscar-nominated supporter role is played by Mussolini Lac-Eli (Benzini Napoleon) who fits Chaplin's Hitler character Adinod Hindkel a lot. Henry Daniel Adenaid, Chief Adviser of the Henkel, is his natural stabilizer. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and acting. The picture was nominated for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Chaplin forces force for some obvious reasons, and some are not known. Due to this, he threw the entire film at his own risk, and until then there was no other major film about Nazi Germany. The film spends one month with Chaplin for a year, even after the rebuilding of the set and shooting a scene to correct something. During the liberation war of October 1940, Hitler was waging a war in Europe in one country, so before the film began, it became more popular than the film's release. <br /> <br /> There are not many plots in the opposite movie; The film itself seems like a series of comedy sketches and / or clash of collisions together to achieve the independence of the film. The last third of the movie is a few examples of how to meet Henkel and Napoleoni. The scene is very funny, but it leads to the place of the plot. Likewise, both Barber and Schlutz repeatedly introduced mistaken identity to Henkel for giving the opportunity to publish to the audience at the end of the movie (via sailor) in Chennai. On the other hand, is a better way of pointing out the wrong displacement of Ariyan excellence than the Hellenic error? However, the film has a lot of humorous moments, such as assembly speech, development of new warfare (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), dance globes, pudding scene coins, and Hennkel and Napoleonie (with Barber's chair scene). The whole scene is highly recommended by the movie. Chaplin could not forget his first conversation, the anti-Nazi film, and the risks of financing the film. *** 1/2 of 4/2
