The critics do not always listen to what this cute, charming little movie said about. Madonna is great in this cute comedy. I've been working on a video store for many years and have recommended this movie to many customers - no one came back to me and asked me to bring it back. Everyone always enjoy it. It's actually a great movie for kids, too.
