If I only saw the nurse Battier poster, I probably would not have touched it with ten-foot poles. But when I heard some positive thunder, Kanas made some noise, I decided to try it. A really enjoyable movie based on a very funny plot I got to do. Rene Jelliegiger impressive in his role ?? Nurse Narsee, who follows a terrible experience, is sent to a confusing psychological mountain. I do not like Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and lazily surprised by actor Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This picture comes out regularly in comedy, drama, romance and thriller. Yet despite this obvious identity crisis, it holds up quite well. I started waiting to get glued to my eyes screen always waiting for the next twist to end. If not spectacular, the entire cast is strong. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Psychological influential influences He cut our throats during the scene of every emotion! And he's going to standard "Let's take a few small letters and ultimately pull them into an unreasonable and unnecessary romance", making sure everyone gets home with a smile on their face. Why do directors and authors behave like their audiobooks? <br /> <br /> But this exciting annoyance is very enjoyable to enjoy the film a long way. A very suburban year for movies, 'Nurse Betty' ranked as one of the more beautiful surprises of 2000. 10 out 8
