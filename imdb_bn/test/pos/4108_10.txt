I do not see that wrong with this movie. Believed, the lead singers may not be Luciano Pavrotti and Maria Colas, but they certainly can carry the melody. Bert Bechratch and Hal David are talented songs writers and I think their songs, especially "World Hall is a Circle", "which I will not miss", and "question me answer". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's curiosity is terrible and that snowy mountain sets seem like plastic making; I disagree with both calculations. I saw powdered snow before and those mountain views snow looked realistic in me. And most importantly, in this film's defense, it is suitable for a family audience (at least I think it was on Christmas Day a few years ago.) With all the rage of sexuality and violence in the film, I think it's gotten the movie's g-rating Qualified. And the ten movies they saw are not ten minutes as naughty "F". Thank God. So even though this movie may not be the cup of each cup, but it has some ransom and I gave it with ten possible ten points. It's my story and I'm sticking to it.
