I have seen a lot of Shah Rukh's movies and this is a very good role for him. He is versatile, but he plays a positive role mainly. Like Rahul, he is very dark and annoying, but I show him his sympathy with most of the movies. If you do not have anything else, watch this movie for Shah Rukh. He is very very very complex and plays the real character. The story has been very common and has been done before, but the development of character is very strong and entertaining. Opening a little confusing, but ultimately, it does not matter. I get very liked music and give insight into what the characters are thinking about. Very clever I think this movie was very good and it was suggested by fans to Shahrukh Khan. It must be seen!
