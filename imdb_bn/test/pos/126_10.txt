There is "speaker" information. For a while, see this director's other film, "Earth". This is a good movie, but it is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist outlook from Indian filmmaker. It features an engaging and culturally dynamic movie viewing experience by portraying heritage, ceremony, duties, confidentiality, and harsh sexual roles. The marriage bed of marriage to all of the married characters lacks "fire" with their husbands. A husband makes a spiritual "adultery" form by giving him love, respect, time and respect for his heavenly and his religious husband (guru). His wife prays for solitude and warmth and softness, which eventually finds her with a close lesbian sister who comes to live with her unfaithful husband. This unfaithful husband openly loves her Chinese mistress but is forced to marry her (unknown to him). The only lesbian woman in her house is the only sex after losing her virginity. <br /> <br /> A servant lives in the house and finally reveals that two female lovers. Another notable character is the elderly native language which can not speak or care for itself due to the stroke. However, he used a ringing bell to contact his needs as well as to dissatisfied with family members. He can crumble through his neck or his mobile phone to know what is happening in his house and how much he is insulted. <br /> <br /> In the end, the truth about everyone goes out and the two women lovers end up running away together. However, there is a psychological view between husband-addicted husband and his wife directly before him. His sari was caught in the fire and at first we thought he was dying. However, we see two women together in the last scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The author / director of this movie challenges the tradition of his culture, but he shows us different people who fall prey to their culture. And gender. We really come to take care of the letters and we do not see them as stereotypes. Each of us wonders with their humanity, obscenity, mildness, anger, and spirit.
