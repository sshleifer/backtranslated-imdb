The third image of the Fiji Film Festival, I saw this wonderful drama of Japan. After escaping from prison, nine fugitives planned to find "the key of the universe", the tenth plaintiff said without refusing to stop him. As well we know each of these men well. Each has their own dreams. For most movies, it seems to be mostly comedy, but the film is transferred to the end of a tragedy. The actors give all the great performances. I can not say anything more without spoiling the film, but do not say that you feel somewhat of this person. For 2 hours, this picture is a long-term tud, but fewer ones are better. I have no warning that it has been carefully recommended that it has some uncertain violence for the flexible heart. Toshihaki Toyoda runs home run this time, and it wants me to find out her earlier films and look forward to encouraging her future. <br /> <br /> My grade: A
