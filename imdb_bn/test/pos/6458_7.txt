Excel Nordman (Cassavetes) looks on a job looking for New York Dockyard, but with a hidden past. He got one on condition that he would return the kick to the owner of the simple crew, Jack Warden. There he made friendship with the black people Sydney Potier, which, unfortunately, we learn to lead a moral conflict of atrocities for a person who we learn, usually from his problem. <br /> <br /> The image looks like the Oscars, the waterfront winner, looks like On the Waterfront, and most importantly the 1954 Cajon production plays it a lot. However, the ground for its ethnic theme time is broken. The respect of each of the black poitier and white Cassavetes is regarded as equal. It may even be the first name of the black-white "friend" photo that will later be able to master many action films. <br /> <br /> It helps two players play better than each other. However, the central fault of the film is that the crew failed to mention why Pierre Pieri broke the friendship with Door Casavetas in the first place. He really goes out of his way to new cheerful friendships. But why is he ever ever really able to overcome the ethnic barriers to make it. One possible explanation is that other crew-bosses in Pottery want to use a pancake cassette in its competition with warden, but then actually comes the same way as the man. It has an indication of some suspicious reactions in the Casavette, but the relationship appears to be incomplete. <br /> <br /> I could not make it clear if the entire movie was shot in a single stage. Everything is done on the seedy location of New York, except for the addition of normal movies. In this sense, it responds to the scene of a non-Hollywood movie, with a night-watch scene with nightly views, even in the nude club scene. I think sociologists rather call the raw material life as "a glimpse of the poor." <br /> <br /> Yet, for all its attributes, many of which, the film Brando- Kazan movie for comfort. Here, the friend of a freedom fighter daughter, Warden, a fine unknown actress, Catholin Maguire, played the role of the corrupt worker, when Castro, like Brando, would have to face a bloody grave injury before returning to her moral status and doing the right thing. Still and above all, despite the nature of derivative, the horny urban drama keeps the original strength enough to meet an observation.
