I'm sorry it's rated low by many people. The series started very well and it was not good after the first season. <br /> <br /> People forget at the beginning and only look at the end. It's not good to do, you should see the total results, not the end result. It is unfortunate that many of the "normal" letters have died, but we have received many beautiful new characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please understand that when I died, I did not like it, when the odd died, but better ... it needs to be done. Can you imagine that everybody always holds the whole series when they are in danger? Come on, face if they do not die, they will be unknowingly. That's how you always keep the tension, will he survive, will die? I understand that people attach themselves to characters, I do it too. My favorite character was Agur, he can get every computer he wants. He was a mysterious, he could not do anything else with the computer. <br /> <br /> I want to give a statement to all those who vote negative, deserve a low rating such as a series that starts so well? Should we look at the final season rather than the total? How good will we look when the series started? We will not see how much we enjoy?
