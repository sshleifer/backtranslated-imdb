I was amazed at how emotionally I invested in this movie. Peter Boyle is the social conservative intellectual of the working class, joe as a tour de force. I actually sympathize with some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the underlying historical socio-economic reasons for many of his ancestors. This film provides an interesting insight into the rapid change that American society is going through at this time. Recreational medicine, casual sex, and parental authority became a challenging progression and respected respect to God, country and seniority had been replaced. Susan Sarandan fans will be happy. Joe is debuting his film. He also provided the audience with a visual behavior at the beginning of the film. Recommended, 8/10.
