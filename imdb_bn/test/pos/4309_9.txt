If you have not seen this picture, please do it. It's not a genremix I have seen another. Some very real scenes, some ridiculously funny things, a silent film collapse, a number of musicals with a swing, sex scenes (the second best-acting orgasm in the movie, only received by Sally), a pitch articulated in Osson Wales. It does not have to be least logical as the work of art; at least not logical for everyone ;-) I owned a TV copy in VHS but it lented to a former girlfriend and now I can not get it back. But the film should be out of the DVD on 10.06.03 in Austria and sure, I'll buy it.
