I saw Teen Devian on television television on TV show on Friday night and rarely believe that such a great movie was ever made in Bollywood. Was it mind blowing ?? A movie with a "modern" storyline, superb music, three beautiful women and my kind-hearted superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual story, do Dev fall in love with three women? Easy Nanda, great imagination and sophisticated simi. They are also stupid with him and want to marry him. It seems to be a distraction of the deity (the story of which the cruise) will marry? He welcomed an angel who looked at Dev's crystal ball and said. Gods found the answer and married Nanda. Beautifully operated (most probably Dev Sahib himself and the official director, Ajitajit) is the B & D classic's evergreen music ?? Some of the SD Burman's (well-supported by Ardie Burman) Best Composition "Oft kitten Thadni hi iy rath" is probably the most sexiest song produced in Hindi films. To write memorable songs, Majumaha Sultanpuri should be given credit. Tin Devi is a modest musical instrument that perfectly fills the style of the happy, and has done full justice in the role. Unfortunately, Tin Dewien never gained recognition and popularity. This is not suitable for any Hindi movie, I will rate 9.5 eternal darling among 10.
