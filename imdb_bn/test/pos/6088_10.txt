It seems he worked in African power, where he met a beautiful married woman named Catherine (Christian Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Catherine said it would leave the disappearance. Even so, under the circumstances of two heart-wrenching, we will meet again. In the meantime, Hanna himself falls for Sihak people in the British bomb squad. Yet, the war is steadfastly raging. When can the world's turmoil exist? This is a great movie based on a fantastic but complex novel. There are many lines of story that the plot is stitched together, each of them is unconcerned beyond description. The script itself is elegant and has many memorable lines. Fiennes was a mythical as a burning victim, and love was a legend as a people. Scott Thomas is quite fine as a woman who wages against her passionations. For Binoche, she deservedly Oscar that she was presented, her nurse is a brilliant example of hope in an optimistic situation. The scenes are completely fantastic, such as clothing, direction, and production. If you miss this movie, please correct soon. For centuries the English patient has one of the greatest achievements of the film.
