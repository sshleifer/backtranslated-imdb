An extraordinary performance in this movie, Marilia Para and Argentine Hector Babelo made a stunning decryption. In my opinion, the best Brazilian movie ever made. The film was depicted in Felicus with the child from the Brazilian Gateo. The child was not the actor and Rio was cast by the banbanco in the city of Jeniro. The story is that criminal children were arrested in a correctional prison, which seems worse than Alcrase. Children are constantly raped and beat up the police. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction, it will happen in Brazil until today. One would see for those who liked the movie. But take your mother out of the house, because it's a tough movie.
