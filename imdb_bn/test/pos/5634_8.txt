To the end, what this film gives to its personality, that is the truth, this is the end, this is the truth. Although it's an engaging and comical documentary that borders the piece in some parts (are they on the stage or is it really funny?), It seems a bit late at the end. <br /> <br /> It's the place to be in the movie it is funny, and flowing relatively well. Memorable for Christopher's guest movies, if you like them or adaptations, then I suggest you keep an eye on such an idea. <br /> <br /> B +
