A deep multi-layered story for a movie and other sophisticated elements is a proof that it is not a good film. Even if the story can be extended in many ways, especially in more social ways (greedy for money) it seems that it is the right one. Through a sudden change, visitors take the view of the screen to the viewer without any illogical complexity. <br /> <br /> But acting for me is not so good. Without the exception of Lindsey McKeon others were average or even worse. In some scenes they are just empty in front of themselves. Lindsey was more believable in the exceptions. It's just a really simple movie for laying back and enjoying it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
