After all, I believe that this film is very much appreciated by the audience who actually read Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" book, which was the literary basis of the film. That said, I believe that this movie is surprising. This is a wonderful war film that does not pay much attention to the conformity and violence of the Vietnam Conflict, but it does not pay much attention to the psychological toll on young, inexperienced "kids" sent for war. Coppola has shown the genuine talent in the film making industry, using a lot of visuals to tell the story. I felt the acting was definitely almost all around. Marlon Brando's part in the film actually got me acting. At the end of the film, his precision to Willard awakens you and expresses the atrocities of the person you have heard about and want to see throughout this film. Those who consider this as just another war film, they have to give a detailed description of all the literature elements associated with this film, because there is a lot of money behind it. In my opinion, it is one of the most sculptures and best-made films of all time.
