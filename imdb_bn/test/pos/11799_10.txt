So happy I have HBO now. I did not plan to watch a movie today, but when I returned home and saw that the next movie in HBB, I decided to give it a shot at least (on the basis of decision). I'm very happy I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie was caught by me at a weak moment (I got a little pressure, got a huge test for studies), but it certainly gave me a lot of perspective on friendship, which taught me a valuable lesson of sympathy. I am currently graduating from pharmacy school and one year away from the whole scene involved with the doctor and nurse was certainly a learning point for me! <br /> <br /> However, I wanted to post to let the world know. This is an amazing movie and will not be missed. There is definitely something for this movie!
