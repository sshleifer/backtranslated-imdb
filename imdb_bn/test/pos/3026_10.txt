"The Cell" is an exotic best composition, a serial killer is just a dizzying trip among huge minds, but one of the very talented directors. This is a perfect proof of what can be achieved if people express their unmarried fantasies. The courage of this work, to fall between the formulas and cliches and push aside thinking of creating something really great. This year's best film. <br /> <br /> I have complained all kinds of complaints about this film, there is no element of weaknesses of character and bad acting from all styles. Negatively, the issue of criticizing the film has to be missed. This movie can be a landmark, a tradition where future films will hopefully follow. "The Cell" has opened the door only to one of the world's imagination. So can we slam the door in his face and tell his director Tarsem Singh that we do not want anymore? Personally, I welcome another movie from Torsem, and nobody wants to try to challenge him. <br /> <br /> We've heard about the serial killer going inside, and yes, I agree that the "section" is a bit overworked. Films attempting to describe how the serial killers made the lizard in the 90's were full; Some of them work, but most failed. But "The Cell" does not enlighten the same trail, we are given a new turn, we are physically moved into the mind and sometimes present some less interesting than the interesting story of the most mysterious subject. <br /> I try not to explain how this movie can penetrate the brain of another Jennifer Lopez, and does not push us with too much scientific words. Instead, she lies down on a laboratory table and really feels like long twizzlers wrapped up and jaunted in another entity. "The Cell" wants to "see" everything about it and "how" to tell all about it and I guess some people do not like it. Actually, I want to explain to my movies, but when a movie comes across a new ground, you have to do it and you only have to accept it. <br /> <br /> I saw how the film was very dark, when the bright visual contrast was displayed inside another's brain. Yet, the set design was simply amazing. I would not be surprised if this image was taken on cinematography, best costume, best director and a few Oscars. If it is near me, then at least nominated for the best picture. <br /> <br /> I noticed that I repeat myself. There is nothing to say, but I did not think how fantastic I was because of "The Cell". You walk the film with a very open mind and take it to the wonderful and eye-popping source, but you have confirmed a good time. I had this picture very little for some people, writing it as "strange" or "crazy". I was too much into the psychology and imagination of the human mind, so it was okay in my lane. When I left the theater, I told the member of the audience, "The movie that has been confirmed made a lot of good drugs." If so, I want him to smoke. <br /> <br /> **** (out of 4)
