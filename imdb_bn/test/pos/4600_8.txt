Start by telling me that you are expecting fine humor, you are in the wrong theater. It's bent and heavy hit. But he did not get your funny bones out. He's got to find a sledgehammer and he's drawn a beam beside your head. But do not be afraid. To go to the movies, this is a fairly gentle education. Oh, also, heavy on the oath, but again, Mike Judge, Fred Rogers is not. <br /> <br /> This movie is called 'intelliocracy'? F *** The judge who makes the judge is that he himself has the power to make people laugh. Bevies and Batthead were most popular with teenage boys who did not have much fun <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Humor super cute. Maybe you're too smart to get it. But he does not notice you. He aims at your average Joe. And he got a message: Get your work together and study for God, Botany! This is a little obsolete and may be a bit annoying after a while in the statement, but again, this movie is meant for people who need lots of words ;-) It's fun. This is a message that we want to make sure we all understand. <br /> <br /> I asked about the casting of Luke Wilson in the role of a person with 100 IQu. Sometimes, he is not able to play on the level of his character (what he got, such as 104?). Slightly forced <br /> <br /> This Kado in Dax Shepard. He looked at Jathurra and thought, "These boys seem to be fools." In this film, he makes a great ass. Maybe I'm Psychic <br /> <br /> It took a while to warm up to Maya Rudolph, but I made her a little lighter. After all, he had to play straight people directly to the planet. But once he gets a little screen time, he makes a strong contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Cruse played the same psychological, offensive character, which he played many times, but he did not lower the first-rate president. <br /> <br /> Another bonus is that the place was actually empty. My girlfriend and I count, there were literally six in the theater. We could have a barbecue pit and a Mariachi band. So, no annoying people are talking, just like 'conversation-to-TV' age seems ideal. <br /> <br /> A good courtyard and efficient delivery aimed at everyone. Many smiles spread all over. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie scary that when we got out of the theater, the film was still going on. We saw so many stupid people around us immediately, maybe we got to the theater to be more clear by the dose .... <br /> <br /> They are all pods, all of them!
