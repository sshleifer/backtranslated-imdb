Yesterday I saw this black and white comedy silent at the London Film Festival. Structurally, it has been compared to PL fiction, but it is probably close to the structure of Amoros Pereos and near the dark mood of Clark Smith in Kevin Smith. Four stories intersect in a French motorway diner. The first Vignette Franc (Edouard Baer) has a hold bungling in the diner. Waitress, Suji (Anna Maogulis) expresses regret and tells her story. In the second, two abducting abductors, Leon (Bully Lancers) and Paul (Sarge Larivier) take a teenage girl from her wealthy family. Unfortunately for them, she is not suicide and her family wants her back. The third is a conversation between two growth rock stars that embrace the diner (Alain Bashch and Arno themselves). The final part is about four former criminals who have taken their old partner into hospital to go to their old secret place. Dinner. An 'epilogue' Frank and Suzie return to complete their story (really an epilogue, not a more conclusive). <br /> <br /> The structure does not really work. The stories are not adequately connected as a pop fiction. Dinner is not important for the activities of at least two stories that do not have significant car accidents in four stories of Amores Perez. The values ​​of individual stories are changed. The secret story is a beautiful concept, with some good gags, but it does not stop; And the rock star reconciliation is in vain and dull. On the other hand, the kidnapping story is a sunny, though its connection to Diner is small. One of the most balanced and successful stories is Frank and Suzy. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not completely successful, there are interests and joy moments. I look forward to seeing the work of Samuel Bencheritrit's more author / director.
