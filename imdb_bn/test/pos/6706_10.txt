Based on Colin Wilson's book "Space Vampires". This (my modest opinion) is one of the best pieces of Sci-Fi Harry to come out of eighty thousand. The effect (done by ILM) is still kept by today's standard. Most of the British and British actors appear to give more depth to the film. <br /> <br /> The image of these critics was panded and sadly the box office failed on both sides of the Atlantic. . Tobey Hooper blamed the promotional work of being promoted as the main reason for its low transaction before its promotion. But for any reason, it's still a great cast and a great movie with well-seasoned plots. It does not get disconnected from it. <br /> <br /> Not over-looked.
