Stuart's age did not disturb me in this film, although he portrayed a very young person. I still remember my fascination with the story of Linnabar and when I was fully adult during this biopic, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> This is not a great act by Stewart, it also gives many interesting technical information, which I think of myself as a technically challenged. <br /> <br /> I love this painting much earlier than my birth and revive the idea of ​​my plane's plane and travel for air travel.
