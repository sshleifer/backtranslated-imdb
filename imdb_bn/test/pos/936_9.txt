The last film of the greatest director of film history - Krijijatf Kis≈Çowski. He intended to retire after the film, so it's his artistic conventions. He died a few years after the film was made, and although it is said that he would like to go back to the direction, Destiny decided that this was his end. And what a film! <br /> <br /> The last picture of the three colors 'Rouge' is actually a very Swiss film in the French triangle. Switzerland's retired judge Geneva has a set of two main characters, and Dormit immediately comes to mind. But there is more Switzerland in the cooler environment, due to lack of communication of letters, the arrogance of life's cruelty. Some letters starting with a little relationship will be combined together at the final stage of humanity, which can only be a great artist. <br /> <br /> It can be said a little more that it has not been told and hundreds of times. Yes, the film starts slowly and fans of the American Style of Action movie or melodramus will first become frustrated and lost as a spectator. They deserve it. The film gets quality as the progress, and so is the hidden message that is real life and real people more interesting than the action and characters of Hollywood cartoons and plastic. The film's value is very original, the headline shows, the picture is 'Study in Red'. Acting with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trinigant, it is a great role to play in her old age. <br /> <br /> is a great movie. It's probably seen again, and I'm happy to record it in tape. 9/10 on my personal scale
