I was covered up to see many other people enjoying this film. At first I was at my first teenage age and then delayed several times late. Then sad, no more I'm now about 49 and so willing to get it on DVD. Why not Best Anthony Quinn role, no one was better suited for his part or parts - I mentioned buff in other movies of the same age, no one remembers me. WWII and the next generation (and I am deeply impressed by that generation) As a generation's daughter, I think that at this time the film gives insight into a wonderful film in my heartfelt content. A stand out of this movie for the classic final scene.
