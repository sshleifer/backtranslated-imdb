... it's scratch. As the African-made styles of ass and the Virgin Islands poured oil drums on the delightful steel bands of ear, African DJs excavated urban DJs in search of a new approach to creative expressions. "Scratch" will take you to the heart of the Hip-Hop / Rap movement and discover the origin of Turntablism, the character of Scratching Vineal and the final DJ / MC Synco entertainment expression. The film reveals surprisingly intelligent and explicitly "scratch-takers" concerts and amazing unique skills of competition where beetles meet in the streets. The sound industry is good thing for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto garter movement. (B)
