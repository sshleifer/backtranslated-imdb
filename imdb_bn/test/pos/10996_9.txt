I would recommend this movie to a person who is searching for a relaxing, fun-filled, thought-provoking movie. The most inappropriate evening sex, lack of indecency and violence. I particularly enjoy the scene of Buffalo, but perhaps I am a little away from it. Even this image can be produced in a city; This is the theme that is so important here. I am just grateful that the manna from heaven humiliated us. Try ... you like it!
