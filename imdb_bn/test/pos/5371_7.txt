Everyone does not like this movie. It is still the best one about the movie "You need to think" about the devil. It is irrelevant if MTV-erang jump or not in every seven minutes. Also, talking about a person who knows the true devilish, part of the movie (rebel alert!), Where the Brotherhood exchanges their old bodies for ancestors, there are some real horrific scenes. The chapter where (second explosive alert) Stuther Martin's change is often exaggerated, using a few special effects, a hologram of this movie is. McEveety was seldom given a big budget but was often effective. It works in this case too, too.
