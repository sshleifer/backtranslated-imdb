Cell (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Cells like Antz, will be praised twice. For the first time I saw this picture, it seems like it was medium, but after watching the film there was so much lasting impression on me, I decided that I would have to rent again. I did, and I found the film more favorable. The cell is not for everyone, but it shares its stories with quality and is a visible intelligent film that dreams of images and plot concepts do not match. The film script can sometimes act as it can, but visual impressive and engaging stories can bring an exotic and playful life. Oscar nominated makeup is also bold and cautious, while the beautiful dress and fully bright set decoration went invisible. Suras Singh, who runs the music video, becomes completely crazy in his direction and gets good results. It has its main talent and if you give it a chance, then this movie has a lot of potential. Overall, The Cell is a strong, annoying and very strong tool that makes it a great, fun watch.
