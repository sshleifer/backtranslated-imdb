This spark is weird but I like it a lot. About a good girl who loves her bad boy and honeymooned up her messed up. She does not love her behind and she is an average boy of a bitch. After some hacking staff, I do not want to leave him in honeymoon. Its weird yes !! But I think a good way is different than other movies. I did not know it but it's a love story. But there are lots of fun stuff too. Get to see James Franca in such a wig. I like the notebook a lot and it is felt because of the love story. But the rest of the way is different. Nothing like that. Sienna Miller is really good. I saw this movie on a test screen because I loved him a lot and his fashion. I like her daughter in the factory, but it is a better film than that. Her and James Franco are really looking at love in this movie and I hope they are together in real life but <br /> <br /> <br /> See it !!!!
