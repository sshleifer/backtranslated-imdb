The historical mistake of this photo has been proved. It was not a serious history but was willing to be an entertaining Saga and it succeeded there. Errol Finn was not good as this role was solved for him. Olivia DeHavilland was no longer beautiful. And Arthur Kennedy is not terrible. More reputation than Arthony Quinn as Crazy Horse. It was so humorous and rock and held your interest throughout the whole. What happened on the Little Big Horn was a historical perspective on the "Last Stand" which was the most serious mistake. The film version was not pictured in a desert which was a river in philosophy. However, I still consider it a great entertainment of the golden age of Hollywood.
