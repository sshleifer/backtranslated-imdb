This movie was much better than I expected. After some of Will Smith's films, I did not look like a robot, he thought it was a favorite and fun. Smith plays, hits, a date doctor. Most of his films teach Albert how he surrounds him and tells him a date with Algra Cole, with whom he works with rich celebrity celebrities. Albert does not have a klutz and cave and tripping over his feet or always. All the hits are taught to teach him to do more cool work and not to be so nervous around Allegra. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All this time, the hit Sir met, who was sworn in a gossip, who swore men. Hit her charms, of course, they go outside. But, hits can teach other boys to study for them, they do not believe in love. She was not really a girl because she was dumped in college. However, he likes Sarah, so he continues. Sir's friend hit him, in whose mind he went to the doctor. So all the doctors tracked, just to learn their hits. So of course, he thinks he is a pig. Then it has become a hit to explain what Sarah and Allegraa mean, so both of them have become forgiving. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The last word, some smiles, and amusement. I recommend it
