Before the release of the Norfolk (VA) film forums, we saw this image preview, and there was a general agreement between the two issues: In the early drama plays were two titles and outstanding performances by others and secondly, marketing movies should only bring disaster. We saw a Lurder poster with discipline and incentive commentary, including some disciplines of sexual relations between Samson Jackson and Christina Rixie, where the film has some deep depth and some thoughtful ideas. Sadly, people can see that they take pictures in search of the closest screen, and they will be disappointed because it will be "heavy" for them, but those who really enjoy it will not be able to walk dead in the drama. Showing it very bad. A good film is spoiled.
