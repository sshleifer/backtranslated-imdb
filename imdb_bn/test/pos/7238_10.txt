This movie is really unique. It really captures the spirit of the game, but modern generations makes it entertaining. Romance between Troms and Juliet is not credible, and erotic, drawn by many adaptations. It's so ridiculous that I almost cried with laughter. <br /> <br /> Add to your face, banned topic, pregnant and sex with most trams, and still some good acting and Shakespeare plots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> refs. And Lemi describes from the motorhead's house. I gave this image to a friend and it was almost impossible to get back. Tromas at its best, this movie is really a jewel, and I go to the best of all my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not your opinion that you can meet your mother and blame some people. For someone who is unhappy with the run of call movies, you will certainly see this picture with a humorous feeling.
