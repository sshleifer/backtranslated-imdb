I'm a cheerful Julie Andrews fan and I'm just the first director for DVD - this is the Director's Cut Version. I was surprised that it was rated G. How do they get bedroom scenes, an alluring story line, two strip tejas acts, and war / shooting / blood in a G-rated? Mysterious I'll rate it PG-13. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The story was a little weak, except for the gaps filled with some good conversations. The scenes were not too much for me "just talking, just walking" ... I liked to see the relationship between Julie and Rock Floss, so that the intense love could be more credible.
