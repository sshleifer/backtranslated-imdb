The film is really good, it does not use violence or gender as a way to sell itself, but instead using a truly impressive plot (based on the Michael Keyen's origin) and some great actors create a fun, action packed film that I I've enjoyed it perfectly. One thing that helped me to enjoy this movie was more than that of Edward Norton (which I finally saw in the 26th hour), Jason Statham (transporter, enjoyed it) and Seth I think green is great, Shaun Fanning His role as a roommate "The Napster" is ridiculous and his hacking skills are a great part of the original hust, which is a big traffic ja in LA Near the remains. Car Chase is really decent and high tech equipment used by thieves is attractive and very impressive. I really did not see the original, but I really liked it and I would highly recommend it to everyone, it's not a movie where you want to like that particular genre, it will suit everyone, I feel good after this movie. It was really good end and was absolutely fun to watch. I give it 8/10. See it!
