Eisenstein realized that Marxist filmmaker was a filmmaker who could achieve a film, and how to hold some special and special theories about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Similar period in the United States; This film comes from one of the world's continental film schools, from other continents, it comes from a completely different aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Please try a bit more to appreciate this picture, try searching for Pondvinin and Kulesv's Montage theory. For example, or read the Wikipedia entry of Marxist film theory. If you really feel brave, you can even investigate quadruple forms of hegelian dialect. <br /> <br /> If you have not understood anything about Einsteinstein's ideas and ideals in this film, then you probably will not find it. In Alexander Nevsky, the main characters are not playing themselves, they mean to dissolve their national character. Nevsky and his generals look deliberately larger than life, because they represent artistic, heroic aspects of the entire Russian people. <br /> <br /> Not played wood, it can be a little bit. It represents a completely different school from the more natural, descriptive style, which Hollywije quickly took. Eizenstein's films have been specially designed * not * realistic. If something seems "obvious" to something, whether it is light or language or by an actor, it can mean that. Eisenstein was one of the first producers of the film, as an art form, not just entertainment. <br /> <br /> If editing is sometimes associated with the collision of pictures, this is the idea. To contrast the shots with each other, Eijenstein's films contain elements of a political / philosophical argument, such as Marxist dialectics and connect them. <br /> <br /> So sit back, at Russia and his man-hero's patron, Boro courageous nobles and Titan attackers, and enjoy the difference.
