If Christopher Nolan had made the memento before he followed, then all the errors in the fix were corrected. In Memento, Nalan made the switch in full time. When we were past, it was able to say, etc. When it is present, etc. However, Nalan did a little experiment with it and it does not work. Although he had a small budget and could not use color (which Memento did one thing), it was very difficult to differentiate between the periods. DVD is a feature that lets you play scenes in the Chronicle. I wanted to write my review after watching it, so hopefully it would be more sense, but, of course, it was not working. <br /> <br /> You can not blame Nalan for bringing the original ideas. A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decided to follow random people on the street. She is one, Cobb (Alex Hau), that's especially interested in him. Soon, Bill became friends with Kobb and entered the house and robbed him. Then, a sticky young blonde (Lucy Russell) enters, and the movie becomes even weirder from there. <br /> <br /> The last one I saw was the most disappointing one. Sure, there was a wonderful ending in Fight Club, but the way the last game ended, it was amazing. It seemed as if someone had put me on the head and gave me a consolation. There is a thing to do with the nipple finishes (well, maybe not, I can guess from miles intimate miles away), and can really create a great story. Following or following can not be easy to follow, but it's a well-made, original story that suddenly disappears, that you probably want to see all of its 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R for language and some violence.
