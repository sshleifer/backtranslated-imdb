I need help to identify an episode of Queens King. It starts with a scene where Doug is talking to the phone, and he advises that they agree to finish every conversation with "I love you". However, it's hard to put up and he ends calling her behind, just off with "I love you". This is a very clever moment and I think that much about the relationship is going on for a long time. I think (but I'm sure) this is the same episode where Doug got some local construction boys <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I did not know what the network saw it. Can anyone say this episode's title and season?
