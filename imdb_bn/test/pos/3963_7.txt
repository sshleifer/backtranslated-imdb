This movie is one of the most popular movies of its genre: intelligence and good message. Rejected by the story of the acceptable, reputable child (Justin Long) that applies to him in college. Her father is incredibly harsh, frustrated and frustrated. Therefore, the land facing similar problems and some students start their own counterfeit college, like their parents in college. Everything goes to the plan, and the movie is winging about them. But it seems ridiculous behind this plot, the American education system has good message, morality and new perspectives. The college that they created by the "South Harmon Institute of Technology" accepted those who were not accepted elsewhere. The message is that you do not need "money, tradition, or fancy books" - you need a desire to improve yourself. They are a complete overwhelming school, but what the movie teaches is that it's still ok - and different (this is not a person or school) is not necessarily bad, and not everyone should give them the opportunity to do better - despite what they are 'weird'. This is a message of incompatibilities and has anti-authority traces. But the messages are not too big - its sunny! Yes I was laughing very hard. Humor may be fine but can be blatant as well, and a great mix. Beware of Fraternities
