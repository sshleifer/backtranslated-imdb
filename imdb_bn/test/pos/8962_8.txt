Charlie Wilson (Tom Hans), a strict partisan, without a strict legal record, is a Congress member of Texas. In 1980, he saw himself being interested in Afghanistan's plight, which is through a cruel war with the USSR. His old flame, arch-conservative Texas socialist Joan Hering (Julia Roberts), traveled to Afghanistan to assess the situation and was amazed at what he saw. He returned to the United States to help the Afghans, only to find out the condition of his colleagues extremely indifferently - and under the investigation of allegations of drug use itself. Regardless, Wilson Herring and the lazy recruits CIA agent Gast Weekakotos (Philipp Simmur Hoffman) to start a firm arms deal involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and most unknown US Congress. Finally, the Afghans defeated the Soviet, but America celebrates their victory, Wilson and Avakakots find their alert about the unrest of posthumous Afghanistan's deafness. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's battle is a brain-torch, a truly handsome film for more intuitive viewers for average film-gear and fun entertainment. The film brings together a wonderful array of cameras both front and back, and promises a hell of a good time. The only error in the film is that we can reach later. Examining the unlikely ways of the biggest secret battle of the 20th century - and perhaps examining things done by the CIA and other intelligence agencies - it's interesting <br /> <br /> The movie is a number of levels interesting. This story depicted in the film - all its rogue bilateral agreements, secretive secret operations and perhaps the greatest success - is so dissatisfied as a work of fiction that it can be easily ridiculed as ridiculous. But things really work in this way, at least reasonable borders. The film portrays our three characters in an interesting way that conceals their faults and demonstrates their attributes. Wilson is like someone who is not irrational about his ethics (even embracing them) - still intending to embrace a godly cause. Hering is something of an Eliteist, and the closure of her birth anniversary of righteousness - she is still deeply committed to the Afghan people. Avrakotos looked at the reason behind the background of his "street" - a CIA exotic with an attitude problem, yet the country is unwavering its love and hatred of communism. This strange three can play a major role in the fall of the USSR, but it does not prove that anyone can make a difference, but the truth is unfamiliar with fiction. It is very interesting that all of this is played as a comedy - not very surprising, to our writer Hron Sorsin, but it is an interesting way to watch this story. <br /> <br /> Although the film has a drawback, which is a bit surprising. The film seems incredibly celebrating the achievement of Wilson and Co. It's OK - there is nothing wrong to defeat the Soviet Union? - Nobody thinks that the Taliban around Soviet defeat in Afghanistan and finally al-Qaeda came to Afghanistan. In spite of US accountability, this happened, and the film's Wilson success story is almost unacceptable. To be fair, the film finally resolves this issue, with Speech's speech on Wilson's ability to clean himself after the US, but it is done in a third party that the average audience will probably not accept anything more than that. Overall impression will help these three extraordinary people defeat Afghanistan Soviet. It's not a serious flaw, remember, but it's a problematic aspect of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film's talent is amazing. Legendary Mike Nicholls distributes the production of a sticky, gorgeous look; The material is perfectly suited to its understated, wry directional style. Sources also distributed another brilliant screenplay; The film has several quote lines and classic sourcing exchanges (the "Scotch Bottles" discussion between Wilson and Avacakotos is the best), and behind it some of the political and historical perspectives are kept. Filmmaking is a wonderful thing: Tom Hanks gives fine performance as a loving rogue with a reason, Julia Roberts is quite charming and humiliating, but reactionary like the Javan, and Philippe Simu Huffman steals every scene (normal) as a rattling gass. As always the lovely Amy Adams Wilson's long sorrow assistant, and in support of Neid Batty, Om Puri, Emily Blant, Christopher Denham and K Stot Mead, take another step in her street. Charlie Wilson War is a smart and fun movie, light entertainment than a light entertainment. This should not be kept against the decision not to exceed it; How is it bright? <br /> <br /> 8/10
