It's not too much top-classical "top guns" or "freedom day" when it comes to provoking militant jet. Yes, anyone based on a fantastical example below from the movie peak, how anyone can pull up rescue, but it is great because it breaks all the traditional rules. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the movie I feel about it the same way. I think it's basically a lot of fun but it's probably impossible to buy something. <br /> <br /> Again, I liked it, I saw the people I saw it, so they liked it and found it to be your own decision. Put it this way, I think the top gun was one of the best fighter pilots and I liked this movie more than the Top Song. Do not miss, watch it, really inspirational movies.
