I've heard a few comments, especially from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is historically incorrect, and it's frustrating. Perhaps it's for things that actually wanted to live through this thing, and worse. But for the rest of us, how the prisoners are treated by the Japanese during World War II, there is no real idea, Changi is an extraordinary role. But not the Changi war document - if it was, then the historic precision aspect was the maximum. This is a miniature drama, fictional characters and imaginative situations (though I've heard and read, depending on the real events) - and the standard of friendship in the story center. This group of young Australian soldiers, captured Japanese prisoners and fell into terrifying situations for years, became partners through disaster and continued their friendship after the war. It is a cultural study of differences between Japan and the Western world, including its music, sport and entertainment: in 5 parts, when it is becoming clear that Germany will lose war after surrendering in Europe, the colonel of Japanese Jail insists that the people of his country must study the culture of captives - To defeat the people in order to defeat their culture - and to do it N, it must be understood. Above all, rich tradition of exceptional television miniseries production continues in Australia, and this is an outstanding global leader in this regard. Writing for the AFI award with Changji is my adaptation of Brother Jack, George Johnston's novel and a worthy winner. In recent years, the Ministries of the Rose Day (story of the investigation of the train accident in Glenville), Grace Custells King (adaptation to the historical accounts of her pioneering ancestors of Mary Durac), Kangerborough Palace (a group of friends from friends) in Australia, who travels and changes in London and separately ), And Bryce Corten's strong novel, The Potato Fay (Little disappointing) adaptation of the curator. Less recent: Long-time singer of Nancy Kato in Marat - all royers run; Cusack & James Brighter novel about postwar life in Sydney - Come in spinner; Colleen McCullough's outstanding progressing singer - Thorne Cat; King of kings; Roth Park's novel The Harp in the South; Badilline; Eureka stockcade; ANZACS; Etc. ..., etc. ... (Of course, there are some awesome productions - for example, Moby Dick, Do or Die, Bech, Thornbirds: Missing Years etc ...) Generally, if Australian Minniers come to your way, make sure That you see it - and it doubles for the charge, a great guided masterpiece. Ratings: 9/10
