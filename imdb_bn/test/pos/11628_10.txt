I have seen this show when I was small. It's a really good show to see. It is very educational for children aged 1 to 8 years. Barney is definitely super de duper. Bj. Pretty funny Babi Bopa is very intelligent. The kids are very quiet. This show is like a sesame street, a variety of shows and characters such as Barney's Purple Dinosaur, BJ. The yellow dinosaur with a baseball cap on his head and a beautiful golden dinosaur with a pink bow of baby. The first one looks very old Barney and friends at the beginning. But then the second episode was different for the new episode. Also in 2000, the last time Barn Park was a new scene. They have a show of Berne Universal Studios in Florida where you see Barney, BJ and Baby Bob, and then you can meet and meet with Barney, after the show ends. This is a very good show when you love this movie and learn about Universal Studios Florida live show.
