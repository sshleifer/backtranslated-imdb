Acceptable One of the best teenage comedy I've seen in a long time is one. It is an original script, gifted cast and it provides pure, unpleasant, one and a half hours of fun. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a high school graduation, "B" profit (Justin Long) who did not apply to any collages, so that he created a fancy collage to avoid the disappointment of his parents. To try his parents' stupid, he created a fake website and started a mobile psychiatric hospital in a school. Everything else goes smoothly until many other "acceptable" students do not come to his house. Now he and his friend have to find that collage for others, not for themselves. <br /> <br /> Justin Long is as bright as a lead man, her character is as natural as possible. Supporters are outstanding - Jonah Hill as Sherman Shader, Columbus like handset, Marie Theere as Rory, Adam Hashman, Glenn and Leves as Black as Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> Humor is fresh and simple and most importantly fun, starting from right after starting. Plot is so easy to develop that you will start gigging the next time you laugh at the fun time. Along with all the fun, the film comes with a general focus on our attention, such as collage learning. If students of the film are generally united against the school government, in this case they can unite and learn by mutual desires to go to school. <br /> <br /> However, this film does not brand all other schools wrong, it shows only one other way. What you say is that if there is a will, then there is a way to do it. And sometimes children can know what they like better than their parents. <br /> <br /> This movie is an incomplete story of great opportunity. .
