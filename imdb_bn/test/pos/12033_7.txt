I found part of this movie rather slow, especially in the first part; The second part started to move more quickly, but why was one thing faster than the other one was not completely clear to me. I somehow managed to find it usable. The performance was good, the writing was good (still obscene). It was another good aspect: It was easier to understand than to say Godfather's film. You know who was on the side, and so on all, the movie was not half bad.
