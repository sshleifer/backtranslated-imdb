"Streners on non-train" was one of those movie classics I've heard almost always, but almost never really got to see who really was. I finally watched it a couple of weeks ago and always with hitcoc film, it was not just standing in the test of time, it surpassed most of the thrillers ever produced. You can see inspiration for future action movies here - Climatic ends with out-of-control Marie-Go-round and two villains who contradict each other reminds me of the bigger verb sequence at the end of John de Bont's "motion." Of course, the word "strangers" Speed ​​"is forty years old and has no modern special effects, but there is a vicious thrill - Hitcoat is true I had talent. <br /> <br /> In non-gay-intelligent gay Bruno (a wonderful performance by Robert Walker) many other psycho-stars alk-eleven took shape in future films. Consider him a male version of "single white woman" Jennifer Jason Lei. Before he meets the train, he knows about Guy - we almost feel that their contact is not relevant - and soon he is completely obsessed with it. <br /> <br /> He likes Audiopial elements in his movies (see "Saiko" for more blatant undertones) and there are many. Bruno hates his father and wants to die, so he can stay with his mother. Although gays are not allowed to portray in the "supposed" film in 1951, their incognito methods and obvious homosexuality have certainly been reduced by censors - but the message is very effective when Hitako looks very well in the telephone lounge. Non-monthly clothing, flirting with Guy and responding to his mother. <br /> <br /> You can come back again and again by making it a fast-graduate thriller at the deep level of this movie - unfortunately it's a big budget Hollywood production, but after watching the original I really cross the mere white-flop threads of this movie. Can not imagine anything.
