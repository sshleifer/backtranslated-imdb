There is a comment about this continuation in the "Gough" section of this movie that there is a mistake in continuity, where the previous show was seen in the shot that the car in August was parked elsewhere. It's wrong. One of the scenes is from the flats of August, the other from the street valentine's flat. The whole purpose of this segment is how Valentin and August - can be made for each other - almost cross paths (several times happen) but until it does not, until the film finally gathers them on the ferries. (And here Joseph used things that he has in the boat in August, saw Valentine's tickets that he had booked on a boat.)
