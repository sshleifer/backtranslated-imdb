This is a film that has to be taken in context. If you do not see the first two films, you should not see it, but the kind of people who see this movie probably will be the owner of the set box, or at least nobody knows. And you should not expect the blade runner; The budget of the film does not extend so far and it is a lot more passenger journey. <br /> <br /> It is basically a science fiction in the future Yokohama of a society (shot as clearly as in Hong Kong). Where it is illegal to procrate. Shaw Iqaaa reviewed the same role from Death 2 or Alive 2 and Ricky Takuchi Birth Control is a detective for the police. Tikasi Mike is not the only one to give you all the reasons for a plate, but many can assume that due to population, population growth and more, there is a law of reproduction law (providing people with pill). Interestingly, the dialogues in this movie are mainly Cantonese, Shaw and Ricky (who share their parts, always play brightly), speak Japanese and speak some English. People have criticized English like wood, but I did not find any problem in it. Also, another person found homophobic themes across homosexuals; Said that Taqsi Mike was a homosexual. He may be very good (and not all artists will be leftist), but I can not see this picture as an insult to homosexuals. Homo or bisexuality was more common when he simply calls back to ancient Greece's philosophy. The film has an aspect ratio of action-packed and shocking moments in Doa 2, although the action in this film is based on more martial arts and it is done in a very good Hong Kong style. Filmy cinematography is a very good control over the eyes, very good shots in the eyes, and the colors are very good on the colors for air polluted, and these days are very rare in Hollywood which are very nice to see. Basically, there are a lot of things in this movie: Humor, exciting steps and some very nice moments are good ideas. It's a great finish in the series. You can criticize it for a little scream, but are not that part of the charm?
