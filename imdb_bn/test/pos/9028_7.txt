This is not a serious movie and it pretends not to be, but it's not bad as some of its reviews, it's title, and you expect in the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is very stupid, but the light heart performed through this photo adds fun and encouragement. Characters are played sympathetically and when they are usually associated with teenagers, they generally avoid the ill-conceivedness of the film's continuity. <br /> <br /> Unusually set in London, sympathetic to Gaiy, if it happens to be a good price; Do not forget if you want some tongue slurry silliness, and suspend your unbelief.
