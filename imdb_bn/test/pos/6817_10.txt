I was lucky to see the screening of Joshua Little Leonard's amazing little movie before his premiere at the 2005 Syndes Festival. In twelve short but very fine minutes, Leonard takes a diversified journey into our lives, because he searches one of the most controversial contemporary social and moral issues facing our society. The pictures embody the elegant direction, moving performance and a heart-pigment story. Kelly Garner and Lucas Houth develop like two lovers. And, in the dramatic story of his first venture, Leonard proved to be a director with a well established future. I think this feature should stretch into a feature film. It's hard to describe the talent, but this first movie shows, when you see it, it knows!
