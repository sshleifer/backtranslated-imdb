Three things you can say about Spalding Gray: He is certainly marched to beat his own "drummer"; He was never a loss for the word; And she evidently felt that those who saw her and heard her would be interested in their view of life, experience and thought - how insignificant at any time <br /> <br /> Most of us are not very far away "wall" as he was. Many of us are not interested in sharing the smallest part with ourselves - even in one or more groups, stay alone in phases. <br /> <br /> It does not create any less attractive and this distraction, listening to and listening to abnormal people. And after seeing one of his performances, we could think more than most of his sensitive musings were probably more relevant than our own life and thought. <br /> <br /> He is a "New York / Avant-Gard" personality type, and undoubtedly a bit "weird." (Whoever describes it as "New York" and weird "was unnecessary unnecessary.) <br / > <br /> I give her "10" to give her the talent of this talent, which is her specialty.
