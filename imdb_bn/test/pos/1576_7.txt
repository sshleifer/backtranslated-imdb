Just finished this impressive nutrition and until I could remember that it was as good as it was, I could remember that it was my opinion. It was still effective, and at times the burning nervous and ugly bad piece of jealousy caused J-Trash. Her story tells a poor girl to find her sister, who has been raped and taken into custody by Yakuza Scammagg's, and a helper doctor who is ready to take revenge for her, working wonders for a terrible fashion after rape and drug mugs. Oh yes and there's a little more straightforward sex, sadly it's all soft core, under the belt nudity, according to Japanese overwhelmingity, but the pixelation is short, in fact only a sunny blow-job scene is just significant. Although writer / director Kazu "Gaara" Kamiju fails to make especially compulsory stories, at least superb amazing stuff, ammo ammunition diving with this wonderful rude rape (this incident makes it worse, although I'm sure he was of age). Also, in most cases this is quite professional looking material, probably not stylish, but it has a certain flash and the content is handled very well, especially in order to employ a lot of pixelation, the koodoo is used. Most of the sexual / rape is based on two-thirds of the sharp runtime and if you can enter this rental it is quite visible, it becomes slightly flexible after a while, but women are easy to eye and it is very difficult. The music of Joechi Taqahashi is sometimes effective, although it rarely shows few scars, but enough work is enough for me at any stage. Nobby Kogo has seen more dominant effects, when it appears, it packs an impressive splattery punch, helping by the crazy nature of climatic Schenanzes. Things even pull up to an oddly affected end, making sure it does not cry or anything, but for a film it's guitar level for most runtime, it's relatively stupid. Overall, this great enthusiast is a great entertaining diversion for trash fans, especially those that taste for Japanese Rapie events. I could have possibly done possibly with a long revenge section and more gore, perhaps more of a point / brain, but hey, it is keeping me watching and it is nicely stocked nicely with WTF moments. So if you dig this type of digital junk, probably your time is worth it, do not expect to be second only.
