This is a must see movie. You laugh, you'll cry, and when it's over you'll want more. Well written and compulsory, this movie holds you on to draw and tighten. The welding was perfect, the letter is objective, and the outstanding performance. "Grandmother" is a criterion that all women must maintain themselves: strong, forgiving, protective and never-ending. To me, "grandmother" should be a Christian mother and woman: a true pillar of the community. If I was half the woman, "Nani", I'm asking myself to fix. I'd been devastating if "Nani" died at any time in the movie, but I would not buy it after coming out of the DVD. I hope the story will continue and Ruben will try to rebuild the city again, Lekwana will go back, cut into pieces, and the person breaks himself.
