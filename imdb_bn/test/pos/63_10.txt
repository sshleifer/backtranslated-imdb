It's a really great movie (after being able to ignore the Black Edwards' Pink Panther references that she feels very vague and very fuzzy). Julie, as usual, surprisingly - played and brilliantly played. It seems to be releasing it in the Oendon movie in the Heamen in London. But UP premier stereo lack of July! The most unfortunate of drawing the sky shot for Ireland's Darling Lily and (apparently!). He had appeared in any of these aerial shots was a reasonable excuse but he did not. Two box office flops in the row have destroyed her film career for several years. But Darling Lily, similar to Star! More public praise than this.
