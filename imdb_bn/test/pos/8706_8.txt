I saw a late night sky on TV, like I was a Vampire fan. I must admit that I was expecting half to be a B-movie disaster but I was wrong with it. <br /> <br /> Bays about the family of the vampire. When a vampire Lord dies, his two sons, the handsome and the Nobel, Stefan, and his brothers, the evil, the terrible rhythm their right to birth, began to fight each other on the bloodsteps. Vampires are a sacred specialty for vampires and it sheds the blood of monks, which gives blood pressure to those who drink it a very high drink. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Like <br /> <br /> I said, I do not expect much to go to this film but it was one of the best low budget movies I have ever seen. Set and location (Romania, I think I've been watching it for a while) is very nice and the music score judged the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was enough, but the evil ray (and subsequent growing Sequels) that steals Anders Hove's movie Hove performance like a twisted vamp is really exciting and makes the film look perfect, beautiful @ @ mn good!
