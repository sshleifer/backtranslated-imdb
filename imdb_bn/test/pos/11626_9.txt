Waters (Heaven Tonight) has his best role with Larakakin's love interest and, among the best known and most loved of Australia's smallest artists, has managed a wonderful Australian cast in both of these groups. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is a remarkable production, although it does not try to see everything continuously, and it is remembered as an excellent illustration of life in pre-federation Australia. Ratings: 8/10
