Great great! Harry Kallahan received "dirty" West Coast, received the East Coast Sharky. Bart Reynolds plays sharky on a sharker machine and I enjoy every minute. A macaric drug in Atlanta on the police forehead, GA just wants everyone Instead of the suspension, he sent the vice-squad. Like Dirty Harry movies or any other film, Captain is always going to be a mess. When I was a kid, I wanted to know what that means "sharky machine" in the movie. Well, who knew who I played sharky, I wonder what his machine is. It was his group of fellow police. He went out after finding the murders. When it turns out to be a big time crowd boss, do not play around the sharky. When he gets another brothel safely, despite losing his fingers in Hungary, sharks struggle hard and well. And I like the part where a plate goes away from the temple with a glass window. That was the bomb! Randy Crowford's "Street Life" really keeps the film in perfect mood, and the film is really a great hit to me, always! 5 out of 4 ratings
