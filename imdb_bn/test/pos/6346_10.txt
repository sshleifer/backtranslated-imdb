I saw Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk, and The Streets of Laredo, and now Lonnem Dover returns. If you are more hungry after watching the Lemon Dove, then it will fill Yer's belly. Great cast, great story The lonesome dive is most definitely a second second. I will be purchasing this movie to add my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite actor John Voight. He calls Captain. Lou Gossett Jr. I do not mess with someone playing Isom Pickett, he's a bad ass with perspective. William Peterson works well as well. Rick Scrder is back as a NewTA that NGPD reminds me about its program in Blue. My only problem in this movie (and it's really favorite drama) is that I think the call wanted to be the "first person to feed cow in Montana", and it is clear that Donning has already been there a while ago. Slightly inconsistent, but ignore as easily as you lose yourself in fantastic stories. I particularly love the rise of Jasper fan and the clear character of July Johnson. I have seen this movie several times and ready for other signals.
