I own this movie. I'm actually the same city as the director of brother But that film is no good. But, if one day you do not see anything serious and do not want to see high and high expectations, I strongly recommend the demo summer. Yes, Lines Chess and Plots are a nice one. But it's a horror / comedy main element. I just want to see a movie full of kids' influence in some small town. And I say "Bravo" to the Campbell brothers. They are now making more movies and have continued the long dream. Demo Summer Films is a movie that will help them start their career with a great future. Speed ​​Freak Productions and compound pictures are described in one word: Possible
