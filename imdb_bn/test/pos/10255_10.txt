Cooley High is considered one of my best movie all the time. It certainly reminds me of the days of childhood, midway, and the growing youths in the Cleveland and Chicago cities in the late 1960's. What happened to Brenda and Putter? Someone needs those two tracks down below. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for her innocent intellect. Even after 31 years of the film's release, they both deserve to be recognized. I think many fans of this movie want to know what's going on with them and have played those funny movies. I must think that this film should enter any type of movie off of the fame. All cast of this movie was great. My opinion is that "Cooley High" is back in hand, during those fun years.
