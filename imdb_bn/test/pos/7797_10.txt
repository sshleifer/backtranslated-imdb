This movie is a wonderful comedy .. The script is very funny .. If you have seen it once, then you will enjoy it more. Although comedy is sometimes stupid but it really makes you laugh !! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their role. After 1994, I did not come across a Hindi film that was so funny.
