I saw this picture when it came first and did not forget it. My aunt Antonin is much more than the sum of his parts. The movie is frustrating, about the pre-teens sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are complexes that appear to be less or less common but there is a current building below. The MUA has a leisurely pace but has patience, the prizes are coming. I believe that this movie was a sub-title and I have seen all non-English-speaking films that it is better to avoid a dubbed version. Inevitably dubbed movies reflect the views of a new director and actor, which is a bit more suitable for a lip-synching line that is not perfectly fit. English-speaking mycord is a barbarism, for example, sub-heading version singing. My aunt Ant√¥nis find it good to find and watch in French.
