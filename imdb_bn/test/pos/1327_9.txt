I heard that after the first ocean movie, the sequel started to go downhill. I believe that this is not the case (at least not for this movie). This photo is better than the first photo! They returned to the original crew after three years of successfully looting Terry Benedict's casino. Now, Benedict every one of them is personally asking to refund them in two weeks. To do this, they have to couple couples in Europe for money. <br /> <br /> acting is very good. Expect all star cast exceeds. Perhaps this is Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Kathryn Zeta-Jones best in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this picture. But it is not a matter of some misleading moments. However, this movie was made just to make fun of fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great hit movie. I rated this movie 9/10
