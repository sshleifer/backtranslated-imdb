Smart written, well-played, intense and suspenseful This event lives in the real world, not as fantastic as "24", (and I officially have 24 huge fans). It has credible characters and in many ways these styles are the smartest ones. It tries to present both sides of Islam. So far, I have seen the first 4 episodes and can find the story equally well. Terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional. And as a result of that balance, terrorists become more fearsome than ordinary villains portrayed in movies and television. Last but not least, the hero is heroic without really cartoon. I recommend this show for anyone who is 24 and a fan similar to anyone.
