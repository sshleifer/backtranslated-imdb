With the help of unusual camera work and intense but intense scripts, this young filmmaker has got a talent to keep its audience fast. The idea of ​​combining animations with live footage has been uncommonly effective and the soundtrack is very good. <br /> <br /> The decision to publish the film in twelve parts makes every episode attractive to the director. Enough to invest in purchasing every upcoming episode of the audience. I was just committed to all the motion pictures committed to their audiences in their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
