Seeing the story of this hilarious retro but very entertaining career girl, I was floating with the first appearance of Joan Croftford. At first I thought, "My God, this is the same face as Michael Jackson in his notorious booking photo!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes in the movie, Dian Baker and Hope Lanz emerge from a cab in the village of Greenwich. After they get down on the street, you can see a sign piece behind them for the Stonewall Bar - a breakthrough "riot" scene that is considered a trigger for the modern gay rights movement. <br /> <br /> While talking to the unemployed and taxis, when he became one, he used to laugh and said to the cabbie, "56th and Sullutan Place, please - and beware of irritants." Can you imagine today's Manhattan driver's response?! She said, of course, because she is pregnant and does not want to hurt the fetus. But when it can be found that he needs to have an abortion, Bob Evans will not find him out of a moving car! Well, he had to find ways to defeat the child (1959 and all). <br /> <br /> Carouson, like Marie Agnes's, is delightful. Why was this his only movie? There is no biographical information on IMDB.
