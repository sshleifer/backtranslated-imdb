Being advertised as the most expensive movie made in the Czech Republic, it automatically thinks that it will exceed the magnificent and cleared (budgetary fears). But with the budget of $ 8 million, with half a movie budget in English it was not a big budget, high risk movie. <br /> <br /> There are a grand epic story surrounding our two friendships, the small Karel and the old Frantisek. As the German war pilot, when the Germans attacked before the start of World War II, they fled the country in England to join Rauf. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> But the bonds of friendship leave only being friendly. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for Czech Republic and their country's attitude. Remember that they were not victorious, only the Russians were defeated by defeating the Germans. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorite fighting movies, funny, exciting, playful, beautiful, sad and enlightened. Most of the time I enjoy the British way they are amazingly loving and the British army gives a wonderful insight that wars with WWII. <br /> <br /> Forget about the recent American effort (Pele Harber, Private Private Ryan), this is the best WWII movie for a long time.
