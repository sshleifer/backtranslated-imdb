A fun movie with these delicate purposes. His off-bit comedy is lonely for me, my friends are lazy. The soundtrack is perfect. <br /> <br /> I own it in VHS and I have seen it many times because it is a fun and funny love story with great performance by all the principals only (though using a young cusack, her talent is a nail for a big hair I know, I know, he was still young ...) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (see my VHS tapes Instead), and Kate in many important scenes Were sorry to be thrown down. And the copy that I saw, there was no special feature of the deleted scenes: it was not as if the deleted scenes did not exist! I'm very happy I bought VHS used in a chip market. <br /> <br /> Most of the dance forms were clear, this is another reason I love it much. Looks like great merit, talent and talent to move in scenes like Mercedes Roulele, Dean Stockwell, and Matthew Modain (see the scene when the grocery cars are assembled, watch out on the floor while shooting at the exit) Miami, Chicken Likin Frustration, Foot Massage, Salon Hair Wash.) This film has a very "theatrical" feeling, which can be closed for many Following the poor reviews that I know some of the audience who have poor performance and bad aspects of this style is misunderstood and mistaken for the superior performance did not understand. is not it. Jonathan Dame does a great job to lead the entire company and their respective roles. <br /> <br /> My first darling and first scene in the first scene is rank (other favorite opening credits / first scene: fly away from home). <br /> <br /> Very bad Matthew Modin so came out of the public eye; I really like him, and Mike Smith has found his cutting perfect in the role. In fact, the film has been well-thrown from soup to nuts: everyone is credible and true to his role. On the question of the audience's acceptance of Pizifar and Stockwell as Italian - why not? I thought they were dragged perfectly well. <br /> <br /> scream, fun, exciting ... do not like? If you want a little fun, see this quirky, colorful adventure-crowd-love story. If you are interested in more about organized crime and family, then tune to HBO's Sopranos.
