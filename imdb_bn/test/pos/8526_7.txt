When I first saw the tape, almost 10 years after the release, I thought it was one of James Bond's best movies. However, after meeting again in the end of the century, I was frustrated. <br /> <br /> I think it was just a little overwhelming because critics were very happy to see Sun Kerry finish 12 years of bond game. That they dare not criticize the film. I guess the end was disappointing to me. After investing two hours in the film, you expect less hokey, more satisfying finish. And, it may be frustrating, but I'm frustrated at not seeing regular actors in the supporting roles such as Miss Manpaney, Questions, Felix Litter etc. <br /> <br /> There were plenty of positive actions in the unique action scene, especially at the beginning, and the two villains were interesting. I think Claus Maria Brandouier was more curious than the two because she was too young and "looked at the next man." He was not your usual bond villain. <br /> <br /> It was a lot of "skin" for a PG movie, especially with the acting of Kim Basing, sometimes there was not an actress known for hiding her image. The language was very long, but most of the bond movies were very good in that section. <br /> <br /> To everyone, this is a "fair" bond and nothing else. Since Connery, it does not automatically mean well. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan prove that they can play a very good role.
