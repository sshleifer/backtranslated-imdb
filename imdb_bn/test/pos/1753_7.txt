Happity is an interesting subject which was created in 1941, considering the little fired animated film, it has stood the test of incredible time. Now I have to admit that there is a soft spot for the Hopptious to Town (this is called in the UK), which has seen our Vipas version a VHS version tapped on TV many times with our brothers. When I wake up, I am surprised this time it was just as fun as being caught in the channel (not less 0615!) In this morning, I think it's time to experiment with animation and a nice moral story that is for parents and children Should appeal. Similarly. Maybe one day I will share this forgotten classic with my own children. A nice running time (88 minutes) for kids and a simple but involved story here is really something for everyone in this story of a little man. I could really see this CGI being successfully remade.
