This movie is a gem! This is Juliet's story, a general general cleaning woman who works in the company's big corporate office, and Rooney, similar president. He does not see any notice of him, at the same time, if he gets hurt at the same time to detach his company from him until he gives any notice to anyone till the plot. He has lost, nobody wants to turn on and discover Juliet when anyone believes. As a clear woman, no one cares for her, so they say disrespectful things in front of her and can be skilled enough to use her helpless and helpless boss. <br /> <br /> I have been watching the DVD for years and my hope was raised in the previous comment about the release in September 2007. Well, I can not find any DVD, did anyone know?
