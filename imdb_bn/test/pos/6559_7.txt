<br /> <br /> Horror Movie Time, Japanese Style. Uzumaki / Spiral started from the beginning, there was a total fricfest. That's a fun freakfest, but at times it was a horrible rather rather reliant on kitsch. It is difficult to summarize the story briefly: Normal teenage girl starts to face / causes extremely annoying situations as she lives in small towns that come under the spiral control. The spiral is everywhere, the air, the clouds, the dirt and the everyday objects. The spirits take control of the people and the bad things happen to them. Oh, the other thing, people are turning into snails randomly. Why? Who knows or thinks, people are roaming in the fire, it is enough for me. It was not so frightening as the frustration, since it does not often attack many mysteries or jarings like horror movies. Uzumaki likes to tremble and crawl rather than Jolt. A favorite scene: A woman has fallen asleep in the hospital's room, when these long, thousands of piggyled chainsmen enter the room and slowly post the bed on the bed, pillow and in her sleeping ear. I cringed and curled my toes. A boxing fight in Uzumaki is really violent but that's kind of funny as well. For example, a man w / spirals are obsessed, he gets into his wash because he spins when he sees a spiral, he makes suicide spiral suicide inside. We have seen that the last shot is like all the cold and rubber in his body, the flesh of the flesh is in the middle of w / a messy single eye washer. A diverse picture. In Uzumaki, it is an impressive psycho-slicant slant that adds to its charm and fun. I love horror movies like this. It's not about murder, a La Slasher film, it takes an army of evil (spiral!) To force you to kill you, trying to kill you. Films like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to create horror movies and thanks for the goodness for it
