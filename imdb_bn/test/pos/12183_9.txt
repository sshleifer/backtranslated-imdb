*** Spoilers may have *** OK, it was not as good as it was expected as well it was a lot I wanted to be, but it has still turned into a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> I usually do not pay too much attention to that kind of music, but it worked perfectly in this movie (I mean, that he is a rock star) but whatever I liked Stewart Townsend and Alleh, though The small part of the movie was amazing. <br /> <br /> And even though Tom Cruise plays Lestat in an interview with a vampire, I acknowledge that he played the role, although I usually hate when I hate different people playing the same characters like the same series and stuff. <br /> <br /> Overall, there were some parts that could have been good even if the movie was great and I enjoyed enjoyed watching it. Great Vampire Movies
