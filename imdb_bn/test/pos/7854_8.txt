Perhaps it's Clint Eastwood's best film. Here's a short, action, but with lots of good acting. A Yankee soldier was injured by Eastwood and a female teacher and teacher of a South School, where he is hiding and taking care. Shortly after his recovery, all the women wanted to have fun with him, and he was successful with some school director (Geraldine Page). Lover scenes are coming in until the women discover that most of their "Macho" have shared them, so they get angry at the night of dinner. The Geraldine page, though somewhat old, was able to play a very advisory role as a female with school director, happiness and more failure in her life.
