The best robot romantic comedy uses robots as a romantic character, which leaves the short circuit outside this section. It was Andy Coffman's best effort. Barnett Peters shows her versatile with an amazing performance here. Although in many cases is not a great movie, I would give it a 9 award and award on quirkiness.
