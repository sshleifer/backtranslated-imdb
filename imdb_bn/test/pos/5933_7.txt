The Royal Rumble is traditionally one of my favorite events, and I've been a wrestling fan for good years now. There may be good matches between other programs, but I have always found a real match for cheating. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to publish the winner of any match because I can not see it justified to destroy the results of a review. I'll comment on their quality though <br /> <br /> Our standards are 4 matches, and then the big rumble event. Two from SmackDown and two from Roy. <br /> <br /> Sean Michael and Edge are open for judgment. This proved to be a good match from two talented guys. This is a match I would like to recommend watching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Orange ... this time Hydeneric. It's a casket match. Typical Undertaker Rental. See if you're a fan. I acknowledge, for the entertainment factor completely. It can very rarely be regarded as a classic wrestling match. <br /> <br /> The next two matches have matching title. Smackdown once for managing the road upstage. Their title match is quite thrilling and enjoyable, but with an anti-final and let's end it. Roy's match is a very nice and annoying thing, which is related to misery. I <br /> <br /> <br /> <br It's a pretty good one this year. It was a beautiful idea that we all won while coming to the event, and it can not prove a big surprise, but hey, it is very enjoyable. There are several different ways of being cleansed of people. There is a token guy who does not make it ring, intruder who is ridiculous and we all want to see the defeat, and nobody is eliminated by the elimination warring. It has its normal high and low, and I end up, especially like Vince McMahon entrance. <br /> <br /> I want to recommend this show. The top form does not have WWE, but it's still good. Add it to your collection.
