The movie seems to fall into two sections: Films that support existing social values ​​and beliefs and movies that challenge them. This picture looks like a Disney fantasy, compared to 180-degree shift from idealistic Rothic, as suggested by "The Longest Day" and "The Green Berets". "The Apocalypse Now!" Project, production, and outcome film, "Heart of the Dark" has been updated in a psychological horror story of modernist diversity at the end of the 20th century. Cast it and crew may be related to the terrible places that people could possibly acquire in the mind. In 1921, Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz came in literary form and later mentioned the references of TS Eliot's "The Holy Man" (Mistah Cartage, who died) in 1925. Although Conrad's "heart of darkness" (1901) did not account for the first account of Vietnam, "The Apocalypse Now!" Pushed on the possible envelope of the movie which stands as a masterpiece. "Apocalypse" is not just about "fear of war" like "platoon" and "deer hunter", but the deep sensitivity of human nature published through the raw and repressed conflict of violent conflicts over the public. Now the apocalypse! Not so much experienced as being experienced. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is the journey of a trained secret killer, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martyn Shane in a tour-The Force Performance), the US military boat travels in an unnamed river Vietnam and Cambodia's heart, where few will run in the west. . His mission was to serve Carl Kartz (Marlon Brando), a career officer of the Special Forces Division, who was beloved to the American military, until he went to AWOL and returned to a deep unknown forest in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has become insane, but with the incident being done, something happened to him that is far more dangerous than madness. Shane's mission does not want the American people to destroy the kernel. Some people are wise. <br /> <br /> The film is rather spiritual The journey along the river creates several vinettes, because Shane and his crew fill different self-reliant "aspects" of war at the ground level. American audiences in the 1970s probably have never been seen before making such a film, the possible exception of "Die Hunter" that was released earlier in the year. The first, and most notable one, is a Helicopter Battalion (Robert Duval in Oscar-nominated Performance) led by Corn Kilgo, who crosses between General Robert E. Lee and Richard Wagner. She loves to eat "Valerie Ride" from Wagner's "The Ring" during the bombing of helpless villages. One of the lines quoted from the history of the films "I love the smell of morning nap". Other encounters include an amphitheater where listed people will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Hefner and Playboy bunnies. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the disasters that produce this footage in this photo impeded, the extraordinary aspect of this film is its panning. Real redemption (not the next Redox version) does not finish the building, unless the audience is emotionally prepared to deal with climatic collisions between willerd and cartridge. Valueless lecture between Willerd and Cartage alone is worth the price of admission. And in some places Shane and Brando both shot some of the most harsh and awesome images produced in the film. Even Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Kreuzberg's choice, there is nothing to do with the horror of Coppola. Especially in one scene, Brendo's cartridge is so terrible that it seems to compare one of the worst movies, which comes from the inside without being afraid. <br /> <br /> Remote, Coppola's Climatic Moment Solutions is one of the most innovative innovations in the film. According to the documentary "Heart of the Heart", Coppola was afraid that the inevitable final scene would end in melody, and the film would be compromised in dark-colored atmospheres. Coppola encouraged his wife director to give a ceremonial documentary presentation of a cow practiced by local wives to make extra use of the cartage in his "village" village, until he could do it. After watching, Coppola had ended her, and it was one of the most boring and beautiful sequences in the history of American film production. Love or hate it, after seeing this scene, no Western visitors will be the same. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for all the taste, but the original novel of Conrad is not such a book that falls on airplanes. It's not just the continuity of violence and violence that is hard to absorb most American visitors. It seems to be the naked openness of human condition that seems to move from seated American life, which makes this film difficult to manage in movie-gear, which it should be. Coppola is not a family picture. However, if the audience could understand its greater point, now there's a lot of apocalypse gotten out! If you are looking for a film experience for the restoration of pre-existing attitude about American sensitivity and heroism, good stick with John Wayne But if you go to a place where you have never been, even without the explanation of "wickedness of war", "The Apocalypse Now" will take you to a world where you thought that you have never visited before, and you can recognize it from the boring part.
