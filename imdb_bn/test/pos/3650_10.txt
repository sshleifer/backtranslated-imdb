Before I forget, tell me artwork outstanding here. Until the huge cruise ship from the trash cans, the drawing is done nicely. If it is not animated, critics would appreciate the "direction" here because it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story: Silvester is becoming a favorite in the ship but the pixels are thin. While brushing at a large ship dock, on a farm he tweety spots in his cage. Tweety spots him very much, and you know his first comment - he always makes it when he spot the same cat. However, Sylvester runs out, opens porthole and says, "Hello, breakfast!" Tivi slam the parrotol window on her face, saying, "You're a bad old peeping tomato!" The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> Immediately Sylvester goes back to the boat, tippetts in his cabin, holds him up and is ready to leave - Vam! - There is "Granny" on the door with her umbrella. The old lady again finds a deadly sylist as protecting her pet. But, "Flipby Guby," said Greni, "I've dropped my glasses. I can not see anything like this. Where are the betrayers coming to Bettie?" <br /> <br /> Now there is Sylvester at the top .... And normal cat-bird-bird-bird Schengen again, like the glasses of the granie. Sylvester's most shiny work was to take his glasses and paint a picture of Tivatis, so when he wakes up, he sees the bird and thinks it's okay. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a very entertaining animated short that was very fun to see. As you can say by quotation, I like some dialogue in this old cartoon.
