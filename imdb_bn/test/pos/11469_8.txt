There were many compromises and downs in this movie ... The story is strong, while talking about the growing story of Mother Barker and her sons and her mistreatment with the FBI. Theresa Russell is very talented and through her beauty even brighter, among the enemies of the Ma ' As Barker Directed by Mark El Lester, "Not as good at the commandos of 85, it was very interesting." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alice Milano acted as a prostitute who quarreled with the gang. Frank Stallone plays a leopard in the gang, and when one of her exploits puts her mother in trouble, she knows herself, the way to the final, say so ... <br /> <br /> I jumped this movie I was confused, intrigued and angry ... so it makes me amazed that those other people who voted this have voted so low! Those who are surprised ... The FBI was actually bad at the beginning, not the Tamer guns like the outsiders, And in this way they were very inconvenient when they went on fire with the gang. All I have seen from 30 represents, I thought that It was more realistic than the other films of the era depicted ... It could be like the ruins of a train .. you w OK, but OK .. Enjoy !!!
