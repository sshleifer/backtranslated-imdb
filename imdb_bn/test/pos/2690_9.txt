I guess my husband and I'm a little slow. We often do not heat up to the series until the end of their production life. In this case, we do not start to see KoQs until around 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped from our radar so far. We are not big fans to watch "appointment" TV. Our schedule is such that we do not always like to commit to seeing the series each time (and we still do not have a DVR). So I think, until TBS began running on their daily lineup in the running evening, we could not start watching soon. <br /> <br /> As long as we quarreled, there were a few more seasons left. The series has been canceled. But we still see TBS this almost every day. I often like to see this series, because you can see more than one episode after day and it helps in continuation and what is going on in the characters without waiting for the whole week. <br /> <br /> But since the episode does not carry stories from weeks to weeks, stand alone. But it's good with me, because you can see an episode, then miss it a few weeks - and still come back. <br /> <br /> My only criticism was not always consistent. Some episodes will be fierce and then some will be funny. So, I'm not sure that the quality of the authors in it was Safefield or Raymond. But I like casting and all of the characters are quite credible and realistic. Kevin James just plain fun to see! Even if the plot is not that great, James creates the value of displaying body language and expressions. Leah Remini is as great as "play-it-straight" wife. I am not able to play straight character for laughing than comedy, and he does a great job. He has a pawn like humorous and insult like someone else. She is a hard cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father, who is with them in their basement. <br /> <br /> This is a great series and I was sorry while canceling. But big thanks to TBS, to keep the king alive!
