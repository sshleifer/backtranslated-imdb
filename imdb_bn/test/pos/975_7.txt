Much better than expected. Good family flick - catch it over reruns. The whole of his part is more than the sum total. Paul cheats up Gaymatty scenery - he has more talent ways then the role of qualification. Go to the top of a treatment to see the inspector from "Illusionist". Blue Man Scene was my 11 year old stitch. The cameras were very interesting for parents - but Lee Mazar and Urkel (umm, Jaleel) looked beautiful. It will be difficult to think of 10 lines for this movie, but it should be heard for a movie that promotes honesty among a child and their parents! Amanda Bynes makes a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting. I'm not able to stand up to Frankie Muniz, but she's okay here. Turning off the casting director - if only for recruitment!
