This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I saw a lot. I do not even have a Troma fan. Before watching this movie, I never heard Troma. <br /> <br /> I gave up hope of seeing a big movie until I saw "Tromso and Juliet". This movie is a dream come true. Shakespeare will probably be proud of this classic adaptation of his classic. There are gender, violence, humor and irony. It breaks many taboos. <br /> <br /> This movie is not hateful or stupid. It's hard to describe how the word is cute, fun, exciting, and diverse. Music is great and perfectly fits every scene. The characters are very credible and are great acting. I really care for the characters. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not for fans of Troma. This is for people who oppose the complete stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies, like humorous and credible and trustworthy entertainment, which do not dare to do this film. <br /> <br /> Bad reviews only prove that this movie is something great and exceptional. Either you love it or hate it. Like all true works of art, it is not understood and appreciated by all human beings.
