This picture is a funny little personal story that they are no longer made. It has everything: Tom Conway the Falcon, Goldie Locke (in a name), his intelligent growing side-effects, Luisa Bragana is the daughter of trouble, and of course there are female maidens, secret professor sources, bad people who want the formula, and after the flunk, the police inspector . There is a murder, and Falcons gets involved. Scenery night clubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxurious train, suburbs, and beautiful cars. See this little jewel when you watch TV in the afternoon!
