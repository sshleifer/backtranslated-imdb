I can not disagree with anyone who says this lousy movie. I and my friends went to see it during the Stockholm Film Festival and it was actually one of my favorite films during the festival. Dolls used in horror movies are not new, but I have seen that this movie has been done in many films as well. Environment, setting, actor, camera-work .. everything is beautiful And they really work well with each other. Now if you want to have another movie or a ring, you probably do not like it. But if it's out to you for a good, stylized scare then it's perfect. Although it is quite predictable and somewhat ridiculous, I still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks. Go see it. now.
