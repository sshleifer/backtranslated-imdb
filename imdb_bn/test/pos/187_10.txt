I dropped the word to describe the beauty of "The Crane Flying Flying", but I will try to write about it. This is a powerful and delicate love story that takes place in World War II. It separates the lovers (Boris and Varo√±ica) from the classic tale of war and what comes out of them. The pictures of the film are so beautiful, which will carry you - the film's strategy is combined with emotional integrity. <br /> <br /> Some scenes directly illustrate the war: a bomb attack - wind, light, explosion - the main consequence of the main drama will be the consequence, Veronica, who is waiting for Boris to return; And there is another scene in front, where we will be confronted by a mental / visual hurricane, which shows images of Boris mind. Another scene acts as the film's lettmoth and gives its headline - the Flying Crane in the Sky. This picture is depicted as a symbol of nature and its seasons and underlines the film's final message: hope for the future and do not give up fighting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is apparently stunning and it touches me deeply. This is not just pure technique. <br /> <br /> Titiana Samoslova is perfect as Vernica. What more can I say? The film overtakes the time - the action takes place during World War II. But it may happen any time, any time. There is a long war (great or small) and its message will remain relevant.
