I've come across DVDs entirely through this blockbuster rental. A fantastic BBC 2 hour documentary / drama about a future "Grand Tour" in Voice to the Granet Solar System. Adopting current knowledge about planets and spacecraft and the possible existence of existing technologies, this film refers to the stories of astronauts for the Venus, Mars, Wednesday, Saturn and Pluto travels. <br /> <br /> Special effects are excellent for a TV show. I found the credentials as the actor's astronaut. For the most part possible scenarios, and you learn a lot about the planet and the science of spacecraft! Only two minor allegations: I found some situations and dialogues at some time maudlin. Furthermore, I'm sure that the single crew and ship will be sent to a single expedition to see all the destinations at once. Probably, visits to Venus, Mars, Wednesday, etc. will be a separate mission. <br /> <br /> They did not try to quarrel with production prices at this show. Venus and Mars were actually pictured in the northern desert of Chile - the most dry area in the world and a dead pigment for Martin's landscape. Weightlessness sequences are portrayed in a diving Russian transportation jet. None of these could be confiscated by producers studios and CGI, but instead chose the original thing. <br /> <br /> I would like to specifically mention the wonderful music created for this movie. The thrilling theme of Don Davies is the first thing to start the movie, which passes the amazing shot of Pogasas and David knows that it is "the destiny of people to search for the stars ...". <br /> <br /> I am sad to see it on a small television screen. A romantic or better Imax presentation to watch it in a movie theater!
