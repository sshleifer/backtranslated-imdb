So Koreans are now knocking off the American horror flicks. But they're doing so with style. The nearest copy of DOL Masters, PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and a small children's play for it. Many young adults are invited to join a special event in a gallery filled with dolls, only they find a vengeance spirit targeted. The doll comes to life and the kids do some pretty nasty things. The Gore layer is reasonably high, photography and set design and production standards are the first rate, the performance is not all bad, and the fears are there. Dell Master may not be in the same league, selling two or even a dead friend, but it is closed. Give it a watch. You will not be disappointed.
