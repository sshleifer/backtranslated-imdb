I saw this movie when I was very young. It's my favorite time. I was unable to get a copy until recently and it was brought back to many delightful memories. I like the lyrics of Cynie Poiter's Porgy, she's like her character with strength and courage. Although part of Pearl Bailey was small, it was not like many family members. My favorite songs were still and still "You're my lady," "Pergi, do not handle me" and of course "summer". According to the guidelines, if I explain them correctly, I am unable to post where I can get my copy, sorry. That's why I registered so that I can share this information. The guidelines are not posted before the registration. <br /> <br /> Phone number, Mail address, URL Availability, price, or order / shipping information.
