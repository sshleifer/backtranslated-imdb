This is a movie where I was a little girl and never forgot. This is certainly not the best movie ever, but there is something special about it that I can not keep my finger quite tight. I love it I am a person who explains everything to me, though he has explained me and because of this, this film makes me crazy. <br /> <br /> <br /> Who is this mysterious witch woman and who is related to Tom? Why and how did he become a water baby ... Why is he raised on earth? These are questions that I just have to eat! If I read the book, I could get the answer, but I read an article that the book is "very different" book. So I do not know what the writer thinks! <br /> <br /> I still love this movie and I recently saw my two-year-old nephew. Although he emphasized on calling it "Baby Water" for unknown reasons about it, he loved it too much. She loves where she jump water and then declares "I'm all clean." (You understand that my nephew is the world's most clean 2 year old!) We saw that scene over. <br /> <br /> I am so happy that we can enjoy this picture together! More films like this should be done. (But what happens with gay assemble ?? !!)
