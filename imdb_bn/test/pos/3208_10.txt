Gilmore Girls is one of the most fun, glossy, sharp, scrumptious, and heart-warming television shows I've ever seen (only on my best television show, F * R * I * E * N * DS). Rapid speed and many pop-culture references confuse some viewers, but once you catch the way to Gilmos, your life will be ordered. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) season 6 and start showing wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far. I love Luke-Lorlai and all plays of different episodes (as always) are delightful. The only thing that I do not like very much is that the sudden bad attitude and unreasonable activities have been 'taken' suddenly. Unfortunately I can not find this very realistic, and hopefully it is not a way to stimulate some other plays to make the season stronger. And I can not wait for the next, though all the great seasons! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashly ak.a. "Tookie Clothespin"
