It's probably the most fun thing I've seen - starting from the beginning it was perfect between time, atmosphere, punch line, background music, order of war and other possible possibilities that you could think of. To be absolutely honest, I think this movie is funny as "funny" to them (Rick and Adie) - probably even fun. I've been laughing constantly throughout the movie and can only recommend watching this movie ... However, if you have not seen it (or favorite?) Comedy Rick Mayle and Eddie Edmondson before, you might not think it's all fun - but I I do not really understand those who dislike it - this violent focus !!!
