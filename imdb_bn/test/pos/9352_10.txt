What a beautiful picture Unfortunately, since 1947, the film script could not follow the book adapted, but in that era, gay homosexuals would have been very hot. <br /> <br /> I thought that the acting was outstanding, as well as the script, direction, bright black and white cinematography, the music and the atmosphere of the film Noua. I understand that in 1947 the film could not represent racism against blacks or bias. Against homosexuals (Robert Young, who had been an Irish biased accountant against his grandfather, who had tolerated this racism 100 years ago, was quite tall, but repeatedly indicates that this film can avoid further tests of racism.) <br /> <br /> I have One to observe and ask a question to the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young did not notice his gun when he was Robert Shot him dead and ran fast in the dark and was in the dark outside the story above the window. The goal? Robert Young's grandfather died in 1847 100 years ago (the film was made in 1947) and the young was 40 years old, the timeframe would not be logical. If Dada dies 50 years ago, the time frame will be realistic.
