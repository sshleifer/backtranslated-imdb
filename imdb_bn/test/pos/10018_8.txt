I certainly did not see all the films of Jean Rollin, but in most cases they seem to be bloody vampires nude female fighters, if you want it to be not bad, then it can be a big exit and almost croninberg biogeuse. Mechanical nightmarish stuff. It is certainly without going into the French with the subtitles. During driving in the street, a man comes across a woman with her chippers and snobbles and takes her away, although there is still no other female finger in the background. As they run through it, there is nothing wrong with the woman, so they forget about it as soon as it happened. Nevertheless, once they return to Paris and his apartment, they do not prevent sexual intercourse with him. People leave to work and some unfamiliar places appear in their place and take the woman towards this tower block, a large apartment building known as Black Tower, where some other types of heritage (which is 'least memory') are due to some reason Being Films and events are processed, which in most cases is to find out what is going on and try to get out of the building for this woman, and she forces Robert to call, the person who rescues him in the first place, comes to rescue him. Her What's happening is published in the last few moments of the movie, which is rather weird but sensitive to the end. Because of his "normal" formula refraining from being considered, Rolin has created, that's what I think is his most compelling and annoying film. I like this one too, check it out. 10 out 8
