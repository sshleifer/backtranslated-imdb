This western was set up in 1861 and was done with the creation of the first transcontinental radio line built by the Western Union. Nice guy, Dean Jagar, tried his best to accomplish this task, a bad guy waited to restore it to his own selfish reasons. So, until the day of protecting Randolph Scott or Robert Young. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the better westerners of the 1940s and it has won about 8 - it was good. However, for my life, I have no idea why Frat Lang was allocated to manage this film - finally, he did not know anything about the West. His form was drama - and I think this movie is a dramatic type - set in the old West. Curious, yes, but it started to work, though I am surprised by how this great German director felt about this work. <br /> <br /> It's exceptional for the rest of the film, great location shooting and acting very well. As usual, Randolph Scott kept another relaxed and realistic performance. I was surprised, though, Robert Young starred in the film, but it was a good casting decision - he had to be Harvard-educated predecessor. When I watched Burton McLean in movies, I mostly assumed that he would be "bad" and my thoughts were well established, because he had made a career in fighting! For scripts, it seemed quite common in most cases, but the final show in Scott and Burton McLean was much more than I expected - to finish this film at a very high note.
