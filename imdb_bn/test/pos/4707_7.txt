I give this film a strong firmness. Although it is not the greatest movie, even one of its best movies (The Filling Fields are Better) it tries to tell at least one necessary story. <Br /> <br /> I think the process of launching Burma's Laura was a bit confused. First, Burma is not the most easy touring country, especially in the late 80's. Secondly, if you make it Burma, your passport will not be lost. They were sure to know where a government person was always in their passport. Remember, I'm sure the script was poor, but there was some need. Patricia Arquette's performance was different, and I did not buy that I was just not a doctor. However, at least he does not overact the role, which often happens in the movie like this. Wu Aung was good, but different. The last is hard to follow, because most conversations are in Burmese language, with people translated for Lorraine. It has been difficult for Laura, and is also difficult for visitors as well. Another plus is firmly visible in Asian Asian scene, which was enjoyable to see.
