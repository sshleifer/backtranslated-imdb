All right, so there are always people who do not like movies because they seem to create a point that they like because they are good, but instead they may be depressed or annoyed, or they are from a foreign country. All that aside, one crazy Summer is a perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. Jokes are Slapstick (a LaBobcat Goldthwaite), Surreal (Bobcat under Steve Holland's inspired direction) and Dry (The most unsurpassed dry and funny actor of American men's comedy John Cusack) and there is no character in the dry film that does not provide at least one funny line (OK, without Demi Moore). <br /> <br /> Yes, it is unfamiliar, yes, it trashes a scale model like a screw-ball, yes, Bobcat Godzilla-like dress and a seafood restaurant. It's fun like hell See it
