Although the aspects of this movie that I felt were not good enough, I enjoyed it and would recommend to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their main role. The main basis of the film is that they were both in broken marriage when they were seen. Both, also, are searching for healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can cure each other. In the direction of the film, I wanted to see more play - where easy stirrings only offer themes filled with themes, such as forgiveness for mourning ones, and how Adrian felt guilty after being convicted of the crime soon after being convicted. A great opportunity to lose a chance for a love scene when it was only suggested that they were going to love the arrival of the lake. But in the end, the film is deeply grateful to my wife and the relationship I share. And the moment was that I moved to the tears. So, I'm saying it's good to see.
