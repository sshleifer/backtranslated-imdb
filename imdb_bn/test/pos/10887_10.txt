My personal opinion is that I think this is the greatest video game ever! The first year I played this game to my friends, the next day I went and got my own. From that day almost seven years ago I did not stop playing it. I just can not help it, I just can not bother it. I have been addicted to other games, other new systems but I'm coming back for more Goldeneye. Each mission is amazing fun and challenging, multi-player mode was like someone else. I hope you can be lucky because I have played four players in multi-player mode because my brothers and friends were together and this game will always play.
