Again, I was surprised that Thomas Gibson did not come to the head of the pack before his career. In this film, Gibson again demonstrated the ability to perceive character regardless of sex, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very confident gay man at the end of the 20th century. Yet lover is not afraid of basic principles, Gibson's character touches different emotions. Also appreciate Cameron Bancroft's performance. In order to oppose his most loved "gay conquest", his need for winner of hexoxoes provides unexpectedly the dynamism of relationships. Bancroft and chemistry of Gibson appear together from the first scene. There are many "panels" in this arch. Direct relationship from homosexual relations; From a different relationship in the search of homosexual love; Traveling across a wide spectrum of sex while having a story of a serial killer in the main part of this photo. My only regret is that before the discovery of this movie it is 6 years after the release! I look forward to seeing it again and recommend it to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or director Danis Arcond.
