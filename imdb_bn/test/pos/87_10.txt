The privilege of watching this movie on TV has kept me for many years. I just want to contact someone else to see it. I married a man with three children and had two Fatal Alcohol Syndrome. I did not understand it, but seeing this movie, I could understand more about their problem and how I can love them and help them overcome their problems. My step is now 35 years of age and he is surprisingly excited, yet there are still many after the effects of the birth of a mother-in-law. We talk about rehabilitation patients with alcohol and drug addiction every month, and this sharing has marked a significant change in their behavior and efforts, and there is no addiction to drugs and alcohol to start a new life. Please let me know how can I get a copy of VHS or DVD of this movie or they will show the movie again on TV. If you do not have these shoes, you probably do not understand its value. So thank you so much
