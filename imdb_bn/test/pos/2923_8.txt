Film historians have said a lot about the ancient epic, which has shown interest in many directors since the beginning of the movie. Such an epic, especially the biblical pioneer, Dr. Wai Griffith was his "mother tongue of all epics" (1916), and with Sealil B Deimel's excellent shiny, costume, and his daughter for a spectacular scene. Who can forget his ten commandments (1923, 1956) or cross sign (1932)? Nevertheless, another epic operated by Michael Cartridge, built in the 1950s, and "Egyptian" based on the novel of Mica Walteri. Michael Cartridge is famous for his famous classic CashBlacka (1941), which has already directed his audience to adjust his film, one of the most amazing times during the reign of Achanhan to implement the most important ideas and information from thick novels and to revive the life of the Egyptians. <br /> <br /> The first and most important truth for me in this movie is the psychological development of the main character, which plays Edmund Parrade. Sinahi, born into an easy family by her step-parent, became a physician. All his life, why he did not stop asking any question "why?" And search the answers. He received a courtesy Nefer (Bella Darvi) that alluring love led him to financial and spiritual disaster. He started repairing the wrong way through the hard work of the House of Death and building his reputation for nothing. First, he thinks that the only remedy is revenge. However, long runs, he realized that there is no solution to "eyes for eyes". Finally, Pharaoh's temptations to stand in front of him in a very strange situation. Yet, the answer to his question at one point has been answered to the question that touched him throughout his life ... The story of the main character, though based on this book, is so psychologically interesting that every open minded person should consider this aspect. The psychological struggle of the main character has become intensified in its time, probably for that time, probably for the first extended time, the power of the sword took place with the power of thought. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The cartridge holds a verdict that puts all the movies in its era: great cast and lavish set. Most British actors and actresses who give very nice performances. It is not possible to mention the ancient epic, Victor Mature's original. During this time, he was not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Hormahib - a warrior, a lover, who was finally in Farah. Jean Simmons is present in a very subtle role of the girl, a woman who loved her life in the sun, but when she realized that it was too late. Peter Ustinov, perhaps the most famous for his fantastic acting as Kau Viades Niro? Three years ago, Sinha's friend did a great job like Kaptahah. The film's royalties are also played by two great cast, Jean Tienni and Michael Wailing. Terni is a cool, powerful Bekertamon, excellent as a sister of Farah. Wilding Akhnaton gives an extraordinary performance as "insane". When I was at Liverpool in Paris and saw the real face of the carved carving Akhtar, he saw a lot as the actor of the movie. Born in Poland, Bela Darvi is a bad courtesy of Nefar. And there are also many actresses who appear in a scene, but it is difficult for anyone to forget, Judas Evelin Teia, like Pharaoh's mother. This voice, this eye! <br /> <br /> The sets are great. The director restored the most likely image of the outer temple of Amman, the Egyptians worshiped Ammanotope in the fourth kingdom. I also like the first entrance view of Farhora. What a magnificent picture that lasted forever! However, there is also one aspect that I want to attract everyone's attention to watching the film. Egypt is very similar to other epics, but it stands as a unique film. There are only a few films used by the ages of many interesting personalities. The first used iron is mentioned in the Haiti. It is also the only movie about ancient Egypt that is openly discussed with Egypt's excellent healing powers. It memorably reflects the contradiction of living, especially the moment of the death of the slave, for which no one cares for him after the announcement of the death of Phar'aoh and after mourning for him. Finally, "Egyptian" shows a historical fact: Jews (before Christ) were another nation, where God's spirit was shining in the hearts of some people. Yet, the only difference was that the Jews did not live like a long time because it did not have a powerful element. The death scene of Aknatan provides you with many biblical and Christian values ​​that you can remember that you are watching a religious movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Michael Cartridge's film. This is a great production at multiple levels: an entertainment for the epic fans, the praise of outstanding performances for movie fans, a soul festival for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that happened in the 13th century before the birth of Jesus Christ.
