This is a great Valentine's Day gift. When trying to beat the competition in a dress competition, fall in love with a superb guy and a beautiful girl. Very romantic I have been at Kat's Mandilar's original fan pick-beds since his day and he has not lost his appeal. Loren Holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together. Supporting cast was well as well. All the wonderful desserts that were created by themselves see a delicious view. I grouped that Costas and Lauren to win in the competition and love baking. This is a kind of movie that is all palettes, romantic and otherwise satisfied. Hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and this is no exception. The whole family can see this picture. Also shows love that sometimes conjures up on any disaster. I found myself wishing for this sighing and more for this film and those wonderful sweet I recommend this film highly for all ages. A great treat for all.
