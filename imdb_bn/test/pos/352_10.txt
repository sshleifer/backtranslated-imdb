Writing like some other people, I'm dead like Mariano Fan, and I like this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a bit annoying, but believe me, it's valuable. As soon as you start, you hooked! The levels are fun and exiting. They will hook you up until your heart is in trouble. I'm not kidding This game is alsochechestrated, and is done beautifully. <br /> <br /> To keep this fool free, I have to keep my mouth closed for details. But try this game! It will be valuable! <br /> <br /> Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (good!) Hardness: 10 Attractive: 10 Average: 10
