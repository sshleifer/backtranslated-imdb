The effectiveness of this image was proven to be a targeted preference, such as the thirteenth best. My 14-year-old boy has become so mad in this picture that I lost more than that of his imitative "Mad City". It debated our partner about the issues of homosexuality and the right discussion about loyalty versus problems. For the sake of alone, I rate this image 10! Parents should see this with their teenager and discuss it later. <br /> <br /> I like very smart conversations and continuous acting. I thought James Rimmer's role was enough, but the teenager cast carried this picture. Other IMDB users praised Corey Feldman's performance, which is really inspired. All in all, I give my maximum recommendation to these pictures. Get this one!
