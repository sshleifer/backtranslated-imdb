I was at a friend's home for Thanksgiving and saw a movie DVD of Eddie Monroe. For almost 20 years I was a fan of Indie Films, (I love Brother McMullen), and I am fascinated by seeing how good this movie is. My friend, who worked on Magna Sound, told us that the film was shot at Super 16. The photography was so good that it was like 35 mm shoots. In addition, the music was in the art of Fred Carpenter, in the industry. The storyline was original and we were surprised that we were very beautiful. The whole cast performance was good, especially actor actor, Uncle Beni. She was amazing. This movie was a beautiful holiday and I will be the first to watch a movie, which will be seen in many ways in the future.
