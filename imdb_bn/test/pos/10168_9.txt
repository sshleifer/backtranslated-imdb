Many critics think Man Who liked the original version of New to Two Much, which I had no chance to see. In itself, the '56 version is a very good movie. Between mid-1950s, Hitakoich films ("Rear Window", "Dial M for Murders", "Vertigo" and "Two Catch a Thief" and this movie) are one of my favorite time in his career. In The Man Who New to New To Hugh In, Jimmy Stewart always throws himself away in his role. Doris Day is very credible for the role of an antipilic hitcock blonde. I had nothing to fake about his performance. His character may not be as strong as the original, but he certainly did not diminish in the role of a passive, "yes, dear", Jimmy Stewart's hands are beautiful things. <br /> <br /> Some were really cute lines written for Hong Kong (the couple's son was abducted) in the opening scene- it is very bad, Christopher Olson reads their structure. Although it is rare to see good acting from child actors in the 50's. Most of the supporters of this film were quite skilled, although notably the killer (Regi Naldar's acting). <br /> <br /> This photo uses a slightly touching touch of Hitkochian - using non-English conversations, especially French (some hits use a "very large scale" to catch a thief); Use of firearms, killer while Arabic music in the hotel; Stewart and the day are talking to each other in church, singing them to the tunes of Geet; Albert Hall follows the scores of the scene, especially the musician and assassin's collaborator, as well as making the Pixianist compresses ready for tension; And finally the killer's gun as it appears from behind It's going to be so slowly and accurately that it must be mechanically (an impact used at the end of "spellbank") and may be. <br /> <br /> To everyone, the person who knew a lot was looking for fun movies. It is not a symbol of his deep film, and is not as tall as some of his films ("Vertigo", "strangers of a train"), but likewise it is one of the top five of my biggest hits.
