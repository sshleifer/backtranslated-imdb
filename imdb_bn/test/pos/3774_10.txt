I love this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More classic science / fay / horoscopes should be rebuilt in this comedy level, which in my opinion is very much above the line. A drinking drink movie, you smile so much, you will spread it on yourself. Can we expect more? So let's hope so. I want to recommend many movies for this kind of remake. Mel Brooks remixed some of the classic movies. He has made some very powerful contributions. A picture of Durian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope some producers or directors can get the idea and bring our new comedy to our screen. We need a good rebellion in our comedy to keep the previous level of our laughter higher than ever before. A good comedy fix.
