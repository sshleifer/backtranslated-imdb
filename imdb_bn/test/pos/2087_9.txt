This picture is probably the best one I've ever seen. I'll just put the second of it about Lily Chou-Chu because it gives me the same sibin ... '9 souls' Some 9 prisoners who fled the jail and found some fake money saved at one time. Capsules at Mount Fuji Primary School They later came to know that there were not many things and were set in their own way. The first half of the film is a time to present only letters and to specify the key points. It's a ridiculous yet serious part of the journey. In the second half, move me tears. As the movie progresses, each character goes away and tries to fulfill their dreams, but unfortunately ends a little worse. Finally, only 9 people fled. Each character was very sad to leave the scene and would probably feel tears in your eyes. A beautiful film managed fantastically. This is a movie for people who enjoyed Tussyk-itchy other films like 'Blue Spring'.
