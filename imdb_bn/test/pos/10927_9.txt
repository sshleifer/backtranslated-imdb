I just saw this brief on PlanetOut movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Star Crossed Love is very sweet, sad, short movie about two brothers. Some great, fine male actors have both acted. Often these movies seem to be caught between a plot and shock value of a plot that they have an actual story. Fortunately, writer James Burkhammer does not do this work, and instead lets play the story honestly. In the first love, the sequence of two boys is very sweet.
