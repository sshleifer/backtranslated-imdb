By comparison, only after seeing a number of films dealing with the problem of street children, teenage criminals, kids, Hacker Babanco's "Pixot" (1981, Brazil, pronounced as "pie-shot") (Tuffy's "The 400 Bursts" , Bunuel's "Los Olividados", de Sica's "Showshine", Nayar's "Salam, Bombay!", Brasson's "Mouchete", Nugro's "Leaf on a Pilo" etc.) Children's pain may not be influenced by the picture depicted in the film, after the journey of the emotional roller-coaster encouraged by quoted films, the "de-synthesisation" is followed. <br /> <br />, that would not be the case. Babenko has actually portrayed this picture in true sense ("fools", a film critic has put it in a positive light) and its central child actor Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 years old and a street kid himself), non-frills, injured performance , In its simplicity, the raw (the hard face, those lonely and energetic eyes) that does not break any way is difficult. (Such feelings can be achieved as an ambitious reality when someone knows that the child was only living but a small life, involved in street crime after filming and subsequently killed.) <br /> <br /> Almost half of the film, Pixot and His colleague street children and criminals spend their time in reputational schools governed by repressive states, where cruelty and Humiliation, rape and murder, ideals and cultures where they are forced to acknowledge their "crime". According to Brazilian law, communion failures are not "punishable" for their crimes. The suspicious freedoms in the street for these kids are even better than the harsh rehabilitation of these supposed meaningful authorities. Within the walls of this supposed Protective Agency, these young souls can soon discover that love and care from parents' statistics is not the same, if the degree is not bad. <br /> <br /> (For Pixot, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Back to the outside world - their "home" - the intensity and form of any such person can not think of the rebellion of Zen Viego's schoolboy rebellion in "Zero for behavior." It is only in "Pixot", "rebellion" <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < La Street (the second half of the film) comes back, they save themselves for robbery, pimping and drug-dealing, with whom they can meet Suleike, a mockery but a kind of prostitute Suleigh deliberately organizes four lost souls, thus giving her customers their Looted by and gives more than maternal care. (<br /> <br /> <br /> Street kids For irghadina a person who has found the love and warmth which can provide them lack in their lives lack. But these kids believe that this new street "street language" can not exist forever, with the suspicion that freedom is found in the street on this street. <br /> <br /> Envy, quarrel, difference, and murder separate children only - and good. And during the defined scene where the Pixot was raised by the situation, not only the Sulei's egotistical American, but also his fellow street shooter Shootin Ditto (shot more than a son of Soviets), then he literally returned to "childhood", because he lost the discouraged woman's right From his breasts, just there and then his longing for parental affection Implemented, the picture itself is both sad and uncertain. Perhaps, possibly a possible return Sueli is her "sense", sadly, Pixot returns her "nutritious" position and refuses her well. In this way, at a quietly twisting moment, Pixot, the young face and those fake eyes (not completely different, although Aleem Kimmov's tragic "Come and See" is completely different to the little girl's daughter), she finds herself, puts her coat and takes her gun (Yes, gun!), And do not go anywhere with walking on the train track and starting to show light in the morning. With that scene, in the "The 400 400 Explosion" Iconoclastic final scene of Babinco Trufett (among other revered movies available in various movies!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br>> <br /> Three years later, Antonio Doyle has become a little "Antony at Colette" (and three other feature films in subsequent years), we are now roaming in the dark about what is ahead for the piesoot. From the last frame, last time we will see this real-life street child (though fate eventually turns him into reality). <br /> <br /> "Pixot" can not be like "The 400 The Boys" or often as "Los Olividados" as deceptive, but it is still easy, because of the raw energy that stands between similar themes and textures films.
