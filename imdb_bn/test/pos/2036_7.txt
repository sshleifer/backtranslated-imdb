Rock Star / (2001) *** (Four Out) <br /> <br /> By Black French <br /> <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" The story of the story in which anyone does not gain fame, just to understand his dream living is not the way to imagine it. We have seen all this before (in good movies), but this human story holds the rock and roll world with a cruel, honest and intuitive edge. It garners a recommendation due to its visualization of the atmosphere. The script written by "Crazy / Prolific" director John Stockwell illustrates the hard-core universe with memorable images - it does not explain what it means to us. <br /> <br /> "Rock Star," the "Metal God" title Mark oyahalabarga Chris "ijaji" Cole as a star, the Pittsburgh office bikrayakarike supplies, the heavy metal rock group Steel Dragon's lead singer Bobby intense dream biyarasera . যদিও ক্রিস ইতিমধ্যে নিজের নিজের গানের লেখার পরিবর্তে ব্লাড পলিউশন নামক নিজের শ্রদ্ধাশীল শিলা গোষ্ঠীর জন্য গান গাইছেন, তবে তিনি শুধুমাত্র স্টিল ড্রাগনের দ্বারা সঞ্চালনের জন্য জোরালো পরামর্শ দেন এবং কেবলমাত্র সঠিক ভাবেই সেগুলি সম্পাদন করেন। His group got angry with Chris's turmoil and gave him boots. <br /> <br /> It crashes Chris, his supportive parents and trusted girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Anton from the TV's "friends"). Then he gets a phone call. It is the steel dragon band. They saw Chris Tape and recently replaced the exiled lead singer. Immediately, Chris Rockets suddenly appeared in the wonderful world of Starfood - the biggest rock fan rocket in the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it is not expected as it is expected. <br /> <br /> Inspired the idea of ​​a true story "Rock Star". Ohio suppliers Salim, Tim "Ripper" ounsa, primarily a tribute to the band after singing, the voice of the lead singer of Judas Priest had hyalaphordake replacement. The rest of the picture is perhaps fiction, but what has happened is that most of the other bands will have to present the experience. The film is a rock star having different chat details. Tour, personality differences, the dangers of drug abuse and violence, relationship, relationships, sexual freedom, and producers disagree extreme steps to convince the fans and the popularity of searches for the higher aspects. <br /> <br /> I watched all the movies in Mark Wahlberg, and this first got my affection. The former singer / model oyahalabarga "Fear," "Boogie Nights," "Three Kings", and most recently in Tim Burton's "Planet apps" for the restoration of the film was made. I'm starting to appreciate more and more young actors. Although he did not act in many successful films, he had taken many possibilities and played a number of roles. "Rock Star" date is his best film. I can not think of so many actors who could portray Chris Coal's struggle and desire. Wahlberg really makes "rock star" rock. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He created a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that inspires viewer participation. It is sad to see what their relationship is. We care about a great deal of these characters. /> <br /> film scene during the concert <br, director Stephen heraka (the "Hollywood Man" and "101 dalamatiyanadera" led live-action version) was made in a confidential environment. He captures scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable power. The best of musical numbers, rendering the film with the most involved scene. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Heracic can not sustain energy and germs throughout life. At the three-fourth mark, he reduced the skin because the film is shameless and unpleasant. I understand the fate of negative fame in terms of where to go to the story, but this movie previously lost everything which was for it. "Almost Famous", Better Movies about Rock and Roll, Even In Most Sad Scenes, Interest and Life. Here, it seems that film makers lose their emotions. <br /> <br /> The message is too late and suddenly in the story The film turned into the story of morality that wants to provide us with a moral destination. Filmmakers can close everything, appear on the screen and say: "Now the audience, the moral of the story?" We understand the theme, but it is very instant Personal search for Chris must be gradual. Thankfully, this happened in the last twenty-five minutes of this film, quite a fairly good twenty-five minutes enough features to completely destroy it. "Rock Star" is not a great movie - if you want rock and rock movies, then for Markie Mark, it's a curved point in his career. <br /> <br />
