Before me the commentator said that the film was the worst thing that forced him to be a child. Although I was a little young, I liked this movie and I still like it. The film has the best running theme of all family consolidation. Considering the film Liberation Period, I thought the movie was well played. I just wish I could find a copy anywhere !! This is my darling that I saw as a child in all the films of the 1980s. I probably saw at least once a week with my brother and my mother. I definitely do not know whether or not I know it. So if you find a copy of it I suggest see it! It's wonderful and hearty.
