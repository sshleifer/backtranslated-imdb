No matter how you feel about a Michael Jackson, you can not deny this video as the most unique video ever. There is no other video that has a remote location near the "thriller". For the first time I saw when I was 6 years old and it felt bad to me. Now I laugh at this because now I can appreciate the wonder that I now appreciate. I love this video and as long as the music video is available it will be very close. I think everybody has to sit and it will look a little while looking back and seeing how wonderful it was, especially for 1983.
