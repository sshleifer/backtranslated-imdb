Looks like a rip-off of Hu-Homme's cock in young and in love. This picture is concerned about three friends, Gary, Ricky, and David. School hours are looking for sex. When a new girl comes to town, Gary lowered her head in love with her. <br /> <br /> This image goes from a lazy sex movie to test teenage insecurity. It's fun and sad at the same time. It seems that promising to make every movie that does not completely give in the story of that love story. If you guy meets the girl, the guy loses the girl, the guy gets the daughter of the final frame formula. The man meets the girl after that formula is tossed on one side. Maybe I like this picture so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is particularly good and the finishing touches a certain tears. This is a love story that can be the most realistic ending I ever seen. <br /> <br />
