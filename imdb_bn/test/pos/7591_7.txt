Cantonie is right that the only excuse for listening to this little brief very young Judy Garland (fourteen years old!) Is only a few years old (in a year) with Diana Durbin. But I do not agree with the other things I say, including running time - which is just ten minutes, not nine (single-relayer). <br /> <br /> The song is not its best, perhaps; But it's enjoyable and definitely worth looking for ten minute Turner. Duvet is quite attractive with Durbin: Two contradictory styles which still have a reasonably dovetail. <br /> <br /> The brief is just a casting, but it does not seem to be a bad one as another critic. Really, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Duffed ab hug
