When I first came out I saw this movie. I was a teenager and I saw my daughter friend, who later became my wife. I think the movie made me think that it was possible to be intimidated. Cinematography is working very well if memory works for me properly. The boy was a little more, but the character of the girl was very interesting. I think it was very romantic and could be introduced for the first time with my first girlfriend. I did not see the movie and I was a pedestrian why it got wet. I'd like to see it again to see if it was as good as it seems. Elton John Soundtrack was excellent at the track.
