It really was a "nightmare" of a film; I have seen it on cable TV almost nine years ago and have not forgotten it. Pixot, a 10-year-old boy who lives in the streets of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) and lives with his teenage friend Lilika, Dito and Chico company; Every day they sell stolen, shrimp, medicine and kill to survive. Pixot's picture was captured at the first end of the photo and sent to an audacious Foster home, where he testified to all types of abuse from older prisoners and the rest of the children; One night, Lilika's boyfriend was killed after being beaten, so Pixot and his friends decided to flee during a riot. The rest of the film shows the descendants of Pixot in criminal life; He does not show feelings or remorse after killing anyone, perhaps he knows that he does not use a good feeling in a life where he lives ... but there is a gentle scene in the middle of the film; Pixot and his friends are there on the beach, absentee (and wishing) there from his friend's reformer. I thought it was a poetic and tragic scene among these terrible incidents ... The boys did not just want their friends, but rather a better life. Director Hector Babanco's "Pixot" is a bold and depressing film that does not turn away from showing many people the undeclared reality - involves themselves - ignoring or misinterpreting. This picture will probably open your eyes and make you a good and compassionate person.
