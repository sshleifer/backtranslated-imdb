John and his wife, Emily, went to the village with her childhood in the suburbs with her childhood, where the husband spent some time in his childhood. Death has occurred in the family and the public must begin to take control of an old Rummelhel home on the shore of the sea, and once an old man who committed suicide lives in it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the event of death, John removed himself from his family and from reality, kept his life in danger, and kept old age cloth which is now dead. <br /> <br /> The picture has changed - nothing that seems - its past people appear glorious in the Gothic / Hill bell - his wife is worried about his mental condition - and his son disappears between the roots. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not commit suicide, her death is very mysterious and weird. In the final outcome of the spinal cord, we have learned that this film did not really happen and the whole story was conceived by the little boy, Edward, who struggled to get involved in the divorce proceedings of his parents. <br /> <br> Modern love is full of high-profile films, a confusing and annoying fragile piece, vague advice and unreasonable red-deer. It is unreasonable and apparently incompatible with the current indie trends, which both give legitimacy to its creators, but it also sends it. <br /> <br /> But this film's weaknesses in Australia are completely fulfilled by its intense muscular cinematic outlook, mind and uncompromising precision and its oddball Euro horror. The scripts policies and lack of silent dialogue are obscure about Noror's retreat and outstanding performance, which should be admired. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressive strange Australian movies of the year.
