I want to say that I like campfire tales absolutely! To me, it was one of the original horror flicks with a rolled end. The contents of the movie were not intriguing or strange but you have to end. This is a very awesome movie and I am very happy that the 30th of August is released from the DVD. I will not hesitate to get my copy on that day. I do not think that this movie has received all the credits, because these other films came soon afterwards and admitted, but I did not know if I had no say about the movie for my brother. Which is, in my opinion, it is much better than "schemes", "I know what you did last summer", or any other horror for that time. So I hope you can see the movie itself and be able to see at least the difference. I like it, and being a horror movie junk, Campfire Tales was like a dessert for me!
