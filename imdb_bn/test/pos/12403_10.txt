This photo meets "Mad City" like "The Breakfast Breakfast". Justin Walker, Corey Feldman, and James Rimar have got one more plush twist after the great performance. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you do not like movies in "all the way" with violence, do not look past 20 minutes. My wife had to go to the room. Of course, I could not take my eyes off the screen. It's really a great, realistic teen drama. I can not believe it came from the King of the B-Movie King Roger. This film must be seen for people who are not heartless. Highly recommended.
