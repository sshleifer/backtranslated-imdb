It is simply a good ole Western fashion. Not too complex or long. It has been created but does not cheat yourself for entertainment. Yet, it is one of the Westerns that you can see once and finish without returning. Although Cheyenne of Ford is part of Rogers Bank's robbery, his friendship has a strong characteristic of the friendship of Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford (he stole Steve Upton's horse of Scott, for which he did not know he was stealing his best friend). In the Red Valley, a number of obesity is under heavy supervision for a robbery ending with the dead. Claire Trevor, a friend of Shenen, portrays Countess Malaita, who gave him and "Nitto" (Ginger's Big Boy Williams) the place to stay for that period. Cheyenne wanted to go straight, but when Jack Lester (Bernard Neadel) and his bad bunch wanted to loot the Red Valley bank, it became difficult. Actually, those who are behind Jack's assassination, but it's hard to get away from Cheyenne's boring past. He and Nitro will be charged for the killings (the cheat Cheyenne promised no promise) and should be recovered any day before killing the leper. Alison McLeod has a sub-plot of love for Cienne, including Alison McLeod (Evelyn Kiss); The mockery of the story is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, actually stole the banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) into a red valley loot town, in a luncheon planned conspiracy; Will your Will and Banker Clanton uncover the betrayal plan? Uncle Willie can do it without annoying her conscience? This image is a terrific Baroum cat and a claymatic shootout is a sandy. Colombia could not choose a good line to start the process of color because the film has some wonderful mountain shots, such as men pursue horses and backs. Do not expect to take your socks, but the film is easy and well-groomed.
