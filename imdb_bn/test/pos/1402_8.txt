This is a very strange movie for Harold Lloyd - at least in the 1920s and 30s he played a sweet character in the film. Instead of a wonderful man, he and Sniper Pollard are all men to loot the blind. Especially successful connotation, Chester has lost a "very valuable ring" and after a bit, Harold feels it is looking for a ring as it is a stog. The ring, of course, is cheaper than Herald and later found by Harold, but Stuigir's greed is so big, he "convinces" Harold to say something and sell "valuable" rings, and then they go to enjoy their fate (?). Once again they find Jattsi until they meet a woman who works herself with an intelligent woman (working with a fake sensing person). He configures a nifty cone and takes the money they've stolen - and stands to confirm that a police gives him money. <br /> <br /> If there is a fortune then two Con Convention at a Home When Lady's Shady Business Early, the lady comes back and messes with their minds - they show many dirty tricks to punish them by their wicked ways. <br /> <br /> Almost all, this is a completely curious and protected film, but it is also very funny, Jokes works very well and Lloyd and Pollard create a wonderful team. Alongside, surprisingly and weird, I like to see Pollard dressed as a lady.
