I do not really know why so many people hate this movie, I always thought it was one of my absolute hunger. Fight with the tiger and his men, fight with pirates with void, fight with rolling is skit completely with each attempt to avoid each other ... well so it was not necessary kick ass was the final clash but Manchester was quite good. I give it an 8/10.
