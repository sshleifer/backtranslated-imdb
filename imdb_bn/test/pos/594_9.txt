A bunch of full-length movies featuring Jim Henson and Co. have been created, but "The Muppate Movie" was the first of them, and the original trilogy was the first, "The Great" Muppet Copper "and" Take Manpot's Manhattan ". It was released years ago, so I probably could not see it at that time (for the first time I released her two times I did not see the heir.) However, I saw many muppets during childhood, mostly in Henson's premature death in 1990. I finally saw this film in the first 90 minutes after listening to the soundtrack, oddly, I liked it, and it was disappointing to reconsider it in recent years. <br /> <br /> One day, when the frame was sitting in the hole with his Benzo Reno Nebo Connection ", a Hollywood agent called Barney came in a boat and urged him to continue his career in Tinslawn.Kermit took his advice and went to the West, soon met Fozzy Beer, who is a failed stand-up comedian of a restaurant, and next to him. Confident to come, believe me to come. Dang Hooper, the owner of the bark leg restaurant chain, who wants a kamit to be his mascot, also noticed the frog. As a frog, Kermit is hated by this, so he refuses with Fozzie and leaves. On their road trips across the country, Kimmits and Fazzi met with other muppets who joined Miss Piggy (who soon became the love of the charity) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, they all tried to go to Hollywood, with Max's assistance, Doc Hooper, Chemette agreed to do something to make her restaurant chain's mascot, so Kimart sees herself in trouble! <br /> <br /> One song after another praised the song, and I understand why. Of course, at the beginning Oscar nominated "Rainbow Connection" and more good tunes have been followed, such as Kimmit and Fazzy's attractive street songs, "Moving Wright's Alang", and "I'm Going To Return Someday", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo. "Never Never, Never Again", while singing a song while Miss Piggy first appears, I think only one is weak, and their romance suddenly seems suddenly. The huppats of this movie are generally lovely, as they are on TV and give some of them digestion, including Fajji, her first appearance in the film frustrantly tries to entertain people in a restaurant with study-ups. And, well, if you are familiar with this famous Muppets, then you should know what to expect from each of them. In short, some live actors can be funny in the film, such as the "helpless waiter" as the Dum Deluge Barney Agent and Steve Martin. Also, this is not a 100% comedy. They also made the critical parts of this picture better. <br /> <br /> This original Muppate movie is seen again the first time anyone sees the movie "Space to Muppets". Released in 1999, after the death of Henson for the first time last year). When I saw that movie, I was very disappointed, which never happened before when I saw a movie or TV show featuring popular doll characters! The movie is not so funny, I think it's too dark and cruel for Muppets, because I said it in my review! However, I can not say that I am thinking of the similarity of the film's predecessors, of which twenty years ago was released. "Muppate Movie" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and it likes it, so it's not only for kids but it is worth understanding. I suspect that there is a lot to say about "suspicious movies", which has not been said in the last thirty years, but today it is a good family entertainment
