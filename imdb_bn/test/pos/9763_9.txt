If you have never read the book or seen the cover of the video box, this review could be a spoiler. So if you want to contact the film without knowing anything, but I love it without it, stop here ... <br /> <br /> Production prices are not the first rate but Lead is being played, and Shaute is in his novel (Although I like the novel) more romance in their lives. I am very angry at the opposition to the book that the film puts down some relations with the letters in the middle and in the end of the film, in the main character of a scene, there is some realistic dramatic excitement and a common plot device. A lot of this book is handled well, as a result I touch the end of the book more than the book ends.
