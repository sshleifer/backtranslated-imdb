Fine !! Simply put ... Aparna Sen and Conkana Sen both understand each other well or maybe both are very good. Perhaps it could be the best actor as an actor and director of Aparna. Yeah maybe maybe better than Mr and Mrs. Aie. Conkona plays a schizophrenic role. Shabana Ajmi Mithari (Kankana Sen) played the role of elder sister Anjali. Shabana Ajmi played the role of Anjali's character, because she had to play a strong, responsible, arrogant role of her elder sister, who had full responsibility for her family. Aparna Sen beautifully wrote Anjali's character, a powerful woman who had to devote her personal life, love for her family. <br /> <br /> Mithi's behavior was not a teen, because most of you can expect it from the Indian director for this role. Many research has to understand the role of a schizophrenic sweetie look like. Sometimes Mithi is a normal, sweet college girl, she gets scared when she gets ill. Both sides have been fairly judged and have been played. Believe me that sometimes you remind the exorcist girl .. that's terrible though .. Overall extraordinary piece of work by Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
