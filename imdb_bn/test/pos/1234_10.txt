Hey Denver fans! Animation is a cartoon classic and my favorite one. (And yes, it was also broadcasted in Europe, my small central European country Slovenia! :) :) How do I miss 80 cartoons !! Honestly, they were the best way to show today's children. More fun, more creative, good morality, more substance, great story, and fun with excellent voice. The lack of all of these features in the computer animated show today. So all of you who want to agree and bring back all the events, so that today's generation kids can see the entertainment brought to us by these cartons, please sign a post and sign back to 80 restart. Best cartoon! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com / 1 / We want to -80-child-cartoon-kids-show-channel <br /> <br /> Carp Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lezola
