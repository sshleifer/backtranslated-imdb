I stumbled upon this movie by chance. I was traveling a few years ago and this movie was on a few channels of the hotel in the hotel on one night in the hotel. I watch it for more than 20 to 30 minutes and get impressed until I decide to go to bed anymore. Not saying, I stopped and saw the whole movie. The plot was very interesting and would surprise you if you did not do SS or at least thought about it. I have been looking for all this movie. Even I sent and emailed the production company, but it was not sure that it would be made in DVD, but there was always hope. Drop a note if someone finds this movie where you found it, since I'd like to get a copy for a while.
