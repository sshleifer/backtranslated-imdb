British Copper-comedy A Gem Poor American Scalp Pinki Green (Richard Jordan, playing another bad guy, but an adorable person) goes out of British Prison and tries to go straight, but his job of maintaining his bank job is not very interesting for his ever reformed criminal friends. , Led by a really nasty Ivan (one of his last roles is David Niven). Pinky opposed, but all that money's iron is too much for him. Uncover and repeat things and it's all delightful to see. Jordan must have played 20 bad players in his career, but he never played twice - it is very easy to hate. Niven never played a slicker bad guy, all the oil. We've lost two good actors that I hope we're back.
