Perhaps the only political satire of his first film in France, As a title for The The Day of the King's Titurs of the Human "Crockers", his title thinks that democracy is flat, so they demand the king from Thursday to rule their land. When he sent down a stamp, the frog asked for another king, stamping but saying "political wood." Thursday sent a hungry snake, whose frogs swallow the city with intense eyes. Talking about the original "crocker" Stark's lip slide, he said his moral saying: "Be well enough." This picture has some beautiful crowd scenes of dolls frogs. StarWeek strongly believes that they can move it together by keeping the background together at the same pace and by animating only six frogs. Some dialogues and problems in some places reduce the quality of the repeat quality, but the significance of the historical significance of Stewart's life is important. Immediately after fleeing from Russia, his feelings for the government have probably been revealed in this film. In addition, the technical skills of animating multiple characters at one stop in motion-motion films are amazing.
