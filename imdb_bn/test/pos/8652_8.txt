Scandavian surrealistic collection is a very interesting addition. Recommended for those who love their movie complex. My explanation of the 'weird' end is that the end of Andr√©s will end in hell. She is empty empty under the purgatory bland consumer; One kind of 'living' but not progressing, that is not anywhere - even the metro trains of the city do not stop at stations. It's a metro system, as you will be able to escape, travel, freedom, but you can not actually do those train boards. She is unable to reach the perfume, sensitive heaven and continue the journey of her bus to its final destination. The Old Norse version of Hell (Heads, Knight Route City) does not burn hot like the British version, it is cold, cold, land of Niflu (the land of cold and misty). Andrade eventually seems unable to enter heaven through this tunnel.
