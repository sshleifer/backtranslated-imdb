So here's a little background of how I came to watch this movie. Perhaps you know, this is the original French movie, which was then revived as the Hickruer Wicker Park. I was released the first movie when a movie like Plague can be avoided, only because, I knew that there was nothing to do with Wicker Park and I did not know anything about living in Chicago, they did not see why they said it - it was illustrated as a crack in Canada! - b) It is a very difficult time to bother me with uninterrupted remix, because Hollywood thinks that we are not too inactive to read some subtitles (I'm afraid of Rephik fearfully) and c) I can not stand Josh Hartnet, 'Nuff said . However, I came to WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour, and first to say, until finally it did not understand in any sense for nearly half an hour, when it started coming together. To the end, I was really amazed to find myself in it, and then it is very good to be finished - together with stories, emotions and possible best musical choices (I've heard ??) <br /> <br /> Then I heard a lot about El Appartment vs. Wicker Park's argument and looking at W-WAP, I'm still saying it can do everything in Chicago, but it seems that I like it, so when it Again, I saw it again - unfortunately, I still lost the first part (I still see it!), And I was still very good at it. Hack, even like Josh Hartnet! But I was curious about the apartment and wanted to see what all these events were. So I waited and got somewhere in the apartment. Netflix let me down, so I ended up getting a copy from some websites in Ireland. And I saw it. <br /> <br /> It's really weird, but a little weird. A classic French film. Great acting, Roman Bohemian is an absolute jewel - sorry, but he works off screen of each scene of Monica Bellucci. Vincent Castle is a strange choice for lead but ultimately he works. And I watched Jean-Philippe Echoppey in many movies and I just love him - the scene where Alice puts him in the restaurant and he looks like someone tells him that his puppy is excited! But, I can honestly say, I've seen W.C. and the scene is expected to have a view for the visible copy (the remaining 75% of the movie was left - maybe differently, but let's talk about the glasses?) For the word sound !!), I have my unexpected imagination When I can see the end of L'Appartement !! I can literally say that I fly - hmm, like the poor old Lucian, there was some caf√© window! So be prepared, if you have watched Wicker Park and you are thinking about the real look like me, do not make the mistake of expecting the same movie, because you will be frustrated, or in a piece of French film history - how can you see a movie? The main example is, you're going to see a pithy happy ending, and at the end you can get the spin of the right spin At Definitely assume this movie. Oh and when you are there, probably not very close at the same time, but see the Wicker Park below the road, it will surprise you too.
