Here is another amazing surprise. Since I can hear a movie, rebuilding, I cringe. Films such as Gone in Sixth Seconds and The Day of the Jackal were rebuilt and the results were less than the stars. So, when I heard that the "Italian job" was rebuilt, I told it to be bad. Well, I had the chance to calm down, read some reviews, and finally I found the movie, and was proven to be wrong. Guessed, it's not real and predictable, but it's sure. From the beginning to the end, you are taking a very fun ride. The scenes are awesome with the minutes, and characters actually enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8 of the 10 lost is just a few details and a little lack of reality. However, you will not have the opportunity to stop and notice even if you get so much fun.
