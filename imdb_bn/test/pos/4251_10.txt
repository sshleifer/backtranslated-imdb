This movie got better with the time. I can not believe that at the age of 15, it was forty years old. Yes, all right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so no teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine how midnight Cowboys and Ponyi Swayep were for kids of my age. Imagine the time. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King were killed, but a man walking in the moon and woodstock next summer. The Woodstock nation's chance to stop the person who was Putin Swape You'll see where Robert Doni, Jr. has his sardonic brilliance. Her old man was an instant hero for kids like me. No punches are drawn in this classic, and they will be delighted by the aging hippies while releasing this era. Hopefully, new flower kids will strengthen it, and this present era of fascism will come under the same era in the same era which was under my era.
