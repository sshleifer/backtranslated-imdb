I'm from Germany so excuse my style of writing. For the first time I saw Chakki 4, I was surprised, I knew Chakki as 80-year-old Scarvivi, but Chakir Bray was very different from the older ones. Initially, there is a very well-known director Ronnie Yeh, who still remembers one of our Chinese ghost stories. Its visual style is a wired kinda way comparable to Francis Ford Coppola. Also a voice of the chook is very impressive. I liked Scrapplek very much, especially in the scene where Tiff Chimchambert threw a tray cat. <br /> <br /> I vote 9.0 for interesting, poor and progressive entertainment. If you have feedback about my opinion, just send me an e-mail. MFG Chavez
