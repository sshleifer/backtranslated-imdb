The next day was my second favorite pirot book, and I was afraid the story would be destroyed. It was not! The film was almost faithful to the sponsor's page, with the purpose of just killing! All the actors were wonderful, but my favorite Monica could be dragged, who played a great role as Miss Gilchrist, who is the companion of the last Ant Roda. The best pirot movie without any doubt!
