Every time you see it, it takes a rare movie to get well. Hey brother that's something and then. The first time I saw, I admitted that I never saw anything like this. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I'm in double digit with this great movie, they have never done the best film of the cohen brothers, Fargo and Hoodcomck proxy are coming in second and third positions with me. </ br> <br /> George Clooney played his career performance Ulysses Everett McGee, it is a fast-talking-it-all counter-criminal who does not really know so much. Team Blake Nelson and John Tarturo Clone's Perfect Side, especially Nelson and Delmar's screenplay, a loyal uneducated fellow feather. John Goodman Big Dane, my favorite bit character as perfect. It reminds me of his part in Arizona Raising, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also provide memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Coen are the master of their business. When they make a movie, they do not try to win Academy Awards, they just try to tell a story they want to say and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation to the Odyssey, and I mean you all loose for Homer fanatics. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most amazing part of this photo is the color. I saw how they got a dull feeling of film and I still think about it. The color became an important part of the movie. Great movie
