This film is usually 'I am fighting because I am responsible for protecting the fatherland. NAZI is all bad guy, I against them '(German war movie generally). How? Not talking too much about it, and simply mentioning war and POW. Yet I would like to see a German movie which is coming and see and will be something in the "Bad Naji" Dasha Boot. I say this reason because, apart from this film, German films represent World War II and German side. You can easily see some of German regional relations, which are different from many of the US Army. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that tries to come to see the real scene of Stalingrad, and I was not there and I doubt most people now, but if I choose a film that illustrates this war, surely Gates All American enemies will not be there. Why i say it Even the best soldiers are not heroes, and even if given the conditions they can consider their own lives instead of their parents. This goes for all the terms, and ultimately you see examples given von palle.
