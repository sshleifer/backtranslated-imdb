This is a wonderful movie about people. Strangers All of the characters in the film are a very sad past, so all of them have problems. Their problems have developed in such a way that makes the film's plot very foolish; But it will not make the movie even worse, it's even better, because it has been shot like a fantasy, so nothing is real. This review might be a little weird sound, but then again, the movie is pretty normal ... it's a ridiculous movie for so many times. If you do not see it, see it. Enjoy!
