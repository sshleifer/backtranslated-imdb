British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomniac), has conducted this weird film about a struggling writer who is scared of the following people. Although it proved to be harmful at first, the game became dangerous after taking a further step after seeing a psychiatric person who was broken and soon found inside the entrance. The two heads of a strange world involved in mafia and prostitution soon get on their heads. Jeremy Theblog writer and Alex Haoke have played the same psychological friend. Both are great performances. This low budget movie shoots total guerrilla-style and there is no permit for any place and no big stars, but there is not a lot of budget film, which is a clever script and creative direction. An impressive debut by one of today's best directors Good thing
