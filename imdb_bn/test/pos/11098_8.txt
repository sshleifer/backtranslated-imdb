True stories of Falcon and Snowman, two rich children of LAA colleges, who have become the spy of the Soviet Union. One, played by Penn, is already a drug runner up to his eyeballs of drugs. The other hand operated by Houghton is located in an airspace firm where its job is to provide a top secret cable. There he learned some dirty tricks employed by foreigners CIA which America does not like. Do not forget that the movie was set in Vietnam in the early 70's, and the time for watergate. Surprised by what he has learned, Hattan's character decides to betray his country and firmly believes in joining his friend with him. None of them are long on the brain, not long before they passed on their heads in any way. <br /> <br /> This is not a thriller, rather slowly ripe. If this is not a problem for you, then it is good to rent the price.
