After watching this kind of movie of most of my youth, I found it very easy to follow both unauthorized and spent versions (though this is too much for keeping this story together in a composite version.) But scroll down this film is a much more serious note and I think where It hit me. Animation is very original in grain, and I love the artists of that year that year I think the story is perfect, the movie is really hard, and as soon as the film progresses, feel the way you go along with the characters in this feeling. When they meet, they become friends and find their greatest strength. It gets a lot of heart.
