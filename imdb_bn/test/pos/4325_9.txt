Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experiences I've ever seen. Not only is this a coincidence, but every time you think that you can set the whole puzzle on your head, the story takes a completely new direction. For example, take this accident, the US Marine, which has been given the way to be tortured to Saeed, playing a character called Clans Brown, Joe Inman. In the last episode he is playing Hell's Desmond partner Kevin Inman. Fate, huh? Yes okay <br /> <br /> I think we all have to wait, there is nothing in the wonderful people of that wonderful island. Some of my favorite characters, Desmond, Saeed and Mr. Echo, there is a fuzzy fate <br /> <br /> I believe that alongside the 24's and Shield, it is definitely one of the best TV shows. , Keep the twin peaks in a special place.
