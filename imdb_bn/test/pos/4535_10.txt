Holy Shankai! This movie rock! Both Chris Farley and David Spade are both cool together. My favorite parts are "Fat Guy in Little Coat, Oh My Gosh, Room Service and more scenes that will be remembered for the next few years." This film has a huge culture, I wonder why, which proves that after 11 years Farley's Unfortunate death and he is still popular, he plays Tommy, which you will laugh while still watching him, he is a great comedian and missed by Mr. Spade Me Dan Ack Reminds of Erode, Chris pharli belusira reminds me of John. The film has more than 2 together. You must purchase this movie, and each should be snala fan collection.
