Japanese soldiers in the Philippines during WW2 hungry, dying, becoming weak and becoming more insane. A small group of soldiers, trying to survive, eventually resorted to cancerism. This picture completely depicts dementia, which takes people under extreme conditions. There are a few funny parts in this movie, but most of it is very slow and realistic. This is a painful moment from these soldiers, and finally after death. A very interesting movie, which shows death and horror, which can be the worst battle the world has ever seen.
