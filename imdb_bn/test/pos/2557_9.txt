Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), known as Ali for short, works in the auto-body repair shop, known as the Iron Triangle, which expands the crushing twenty blocks of auto junk yards and lazy car repair dealers themselves near the Stein Stadium. Queens, New York. Here customers do not ask the parts coming from the stolen vehicles or they can get such a big discount, they only keep their cash and hope everything is up and up Travel guides are not highlighted on this shiny coast, but Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani has made an impression on Chan, who received much affection last year in cancer, Berlin and Toronto. Following his acclaimed "Man Push Cart", Bahrain spent one and a half years in this position that F Scott Scott Fitzgerard described Great Graceby as "the valley of Ashes". For all images of neutrality, the chop shop is not a work of social criticism, but like Hector Bébánco Picosot, it is a neutral character, in which the survival of a young boy is bought at the cost of his innocence. At the location of the Queen's Wiltts Point, Baharoni realizes that you are there, hot and humid in New York with all its noise and chaos in the summer. The film's focus is on the charming, street-smart 12-year-old Alley, who is the real-life owner of the Iron Triangle Garage, without any adult support or supervision except her boss (Rob Soululski). Although Polanco's performances are raw and slightly abhorrent, she is still quite successful in the premiere of the premiere of the movie, including hug from Iran's director Abbas Kirstami. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His 16-year-old sister Isamara (Isamara's Gonzels), who works to provide food from lunch, is one of Alle's interchangeable spare parts .

In this environment, Ale and EC use them in any way necessary to keep water on their heads and love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and do not work their childhood. Barack Obama said in his book "Dreams from My Father", the change can come later when their eyes laugh and they close something inside. Already, Alexandre suppresses his earnings by selling his jackfruit bar to prevent his friends Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and street corners on the subway in New York, while the EC runs the tricks to save enough money for truck drivers. <br /> <br /> Although Ale is a "good boy", she is not up to stealing purse and Habakp in the parking lots of Shea Stadium, Baharani cameras have seen that the facts are without judgment. In Chop Shop, Bahrain has provided a compulsory antidote for Hollywood success stories by the dream of Hollywood and has given us great naturalness and respect for its characters, in many ways by Italian neo-realist films and recently the Kyrastami, Panahhi and other Iranian works. If the characters' results are too far away, Baharani has confirmed that we look at a giant billboard in the Shi'a stadium, "to dream", which we think, in Rumi's phrase, "the promise of drum of perception is beating,"
