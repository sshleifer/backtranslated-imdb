This movie's only imaginable error is titled! Close the first comparison! I make my first review different from the first. If you do not see the movie and are not curious then forget the whole first and discover a different name for it. There is nothing alone and it has all its own mood. This is a great exponent of the mid-80s comedy. I suspect this big actor such a big movie because they broke or even wanted the first remake. Anyone who ever wanted to give a stick to snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I maintain, the IMDB is the reason for its title because of the following 100 reasons. I usually hate such movies (like Adam Sandler, Willrell, Frorelli Bros ....), but this movie laughs me violently. I do not know, maybe it's like a bad relationship, which I can not find or just a ridiculous blissful pleasure. In any case, the only underlying film of 80 seconds behind this 'Stunt Man'. <br /> <br /> Robert Stack - we love you !!! (1919-2003)
