An incredible performance! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I know it's a lot, but I'm sure you will not be sorry to see this movie. <br /> <br /> It starts from the beginning to the last second. Acting (especially played by mother - Judith Lite) is so trustworthy, I have seen that there are not many other movies that can compare, and it seems impossible for people in this playback to think something impossible. </ br> <br /> A lot of movies are made every year, but if you have to choose some of your life to see it - take one of them.
