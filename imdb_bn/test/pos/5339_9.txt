I was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews about this movie. First, many said that they saw it on their 4-year-old daughter and granddaughter and they did not enjoy it. First of all, I do not believe that this is a movie, not a movie for at least very young children, not at least 4. This is a very delicate humor, but it is not suggested to be entertained quickly with Tom and Jerry or something like this. Many complain that it goes very slowly .... I guess that all those "quality" to "quantities" are used. Although I have a small quality problem with this movie and the movie that was not related to it as a small film, I still believe that this whole feature is well-directed for the movie. And how can people complain about joke ?? The joke was intelligent, timely and well-thought-out, never abusive, insulting or "your face". Wallace is extremely smart, yet the most adorable, smart and intelligent character that can be careful and grommit. It was a beautiful movie and the theme was very suitable ... for adults ... especially with the development of obesity and metabolic disease, there is no mistake in the promotion of vegetables and fruits in the world ... and it was done in a very transparent manner ... Although people are concerned with the views of vegetables, which does not mean that they are healthy or they may eat them more ... Indeed the rabbit is coming true What is the reason for the legend And those who complain about religious joke there, I'm saying ... come! Are you really Many villages, local churches, and the usual theme rolling about legends / premonitions etc., no harm done. This movie was absolutely amazing, yet some people made negative comments on it and I was absolutely stupid !!!
