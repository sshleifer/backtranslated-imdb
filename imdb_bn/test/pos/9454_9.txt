Based on the ad that I saw in the theater this movie is going to be completely lame. When my sister took a loan from a friend, I decided to see it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . I do not know ten minutes in the movie and I like it. Amanda was a great actor in the film, her comedy timing was perfect. People playing Duke were hot, simple and easy. My favorite scene was clearly when Amanda Mali and a fellow student suspect and she talks about her clothes with her mother - she pretends to be a man! I saw this part above again ... to shorten a long story, I thought the movie was going to be Liam - now I own it.
