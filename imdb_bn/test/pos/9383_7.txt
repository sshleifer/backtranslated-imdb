I can honestly say that "Death Bid: The Bid It's It's" was a lot better than my expectations. Allow the plot to be clear if the movie title is a bit unclear - a bed that eats. An evil bed It eats man Some unexpected women fall in the form of "waiting", terribly "empty" and eventually end up starving in their appetite. There is a yellow foam in the process of bed ammunition, so people inside it ... stomach acids; All are complete with chewing sound. It was a very strange ritual and George Berry's only film, which forgot until it closed its new culture status and decided to release it from the DVD. Not bad movie, if you can see lazy acting and enjoy the effects of hockey - the person who ate hands is the most ridiculous and he just leaves the plastic skeleton's fingers ... the sound like a beautiful dream is coming very, very strange and unrealistic - The whole thing involved mainly involving the back story of artist and bed behind the painting. If you want any budget weird, oddball flicks than definitely seek to find "bed of death"
