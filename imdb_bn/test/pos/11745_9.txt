The background and beautiful Hong Kong settings, this love story gives a unique and rather brave environment for its time. Even <br /> <br />, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song which is probably more than a movie itself. Look at the beautiful Jennifer Jones part and played an excellent Oscar nomination, which serves as a mixed-race doctor during the emergence of the Communist in mainland China.
