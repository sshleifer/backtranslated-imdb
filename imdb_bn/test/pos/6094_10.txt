In one of David Lin's most memorable genre, this romantic love story covers the equally sized screens of deserted areas across the space. This is a film that proves that love does not like, but does not like the choice of love, regardless of who, where or when; And more, it is a matter of heart that is often consistent on regular conditions and situations. And in this way, 'The English Patient' is run by Ethnie Minghail, the story of two people, which discovers emotions and true love in the most unexpected places and times, proves that when it is predefined, love can find a way out. <br /> <br /> This is WWII; Flying to the African Desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasi (Ralph Fiennes) was shot, his dual plane was wrong for an enemy plane. And while he survived the crash, he was severely burned. For his great fate, though, he was rescued by a tribe tribe and wind up in a hospital. But the existing situation is controlled in war situations and soon almassi is transferred to Kafaya through one of the many patients. After reaching Italy, he became very weak and sick, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliet Binoch), volunteers to stay with him in a abandoned temple <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hana Soon his charge was discovered by a mystery man, as Almasi does not think of his past, nor even his own name. Worried to be an Englishman, he refers to those people who have been in possession of a book after the crash, but they are also mysterious like the Hana patient. Gradually, encouraging Hannah, Almasi Bit and began to feel the piece of his life, and his stories began to be published. And his memory has been realized by the presence of a mysterious newborn named Curacao (Willem Duff), who suspects that Almasi is the person he is looking for - a man with whom he wants to score a score. But, burning out of recognition, Almasi may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasi's memories continue; Catherine Clifton (Christian Scott Thomas) - In addition to her memories of Catherine's husband Geoffrey (Colin Firth) And, as he is disobedient in the mind and body, he becomes the only thing that can prevent him with any hope, even if it seems like going away with every moment of his life. Alongside the direction of <br /> <br />, Anthony Mingilla also wrote ScrapPlay for this movie, which he adapted from Michael Ondaise's novel. As a result, an epic singer presented by Lian's 'Doctor Jivggo' and 'Law of the Arabs'; A magnificent film that is full of curiosity and sense with the unprecedented grandeur and beauty. Simply, Minghella's film genius is realized; Fantastic and distributed with a poetic perfection, watching it like watching a cash life come back to life. From the opening frame, Mingillah carries a mock spell on her audiences that are binding and transported, a story which has a mental beauty that is similar to the interesting and animated images drawn by John Seal's extraordinary cinematography. The figure that has virtually meets the screen of the audience as well as the screen. In every sense, it is a rare word of expression with a rare mental power that really makes an experience easier. Nominated in twelve categories, it received nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoch) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo, it will be 'superiority'. Even an extraordinary movie, but nine Oscars are not available without extraordinary performance; And the performance given by Ralph Fiennes and Christian Scott Thomas has exceeded the word 'Oscars' here. Best Actor nominated for Almasi (Son of Gold for Zofre Rash 'Shine'), Feence was never good, and achieved a mental depth with her character, which is almost clear. Personal and spontaneous, Almasi is not by nature of her, to whom the audience will be able to make a close connection; Fiennes, however, finds that a mental door enough enough for you to enter inside, so that you taste honest honest emotions in her. And it works. Alamasi does not want to find your friendship; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stoic faces face-to-face emotional contrasts in front of him, banned emotions that make him maid, and yet he gives himself voluntarily, stops his ties to embrace a love so that he can consume it. Reserve Catherine must maintain the sympathy of the audience, because Scott Thomas successfully digs the deepest deepest possible impact of his character. This is the effect that keeps you fast and keeps you fast, as you do from the screen, which is meant only for presentation and lets you feel the real feeling of the feeling of realization. Shaded with the intrinsic and subtlety, it's awesome work by Kristin Scott Thomas <br /> <br /> <br /> Binoche gives as a striking, dominant performance as well as kindhearted nurse, asana; It's his humanity, in fact, that defines love in his pure sense and proposes a balanced view of it in the context of the film. His relationship with Kip (New Andros) gives us a glimpse of another kind of emotion, which effectively contradicts Almaty and Catherine with intensity. 'The English Patient' is a movie that will remove you and mentally fill up; One does not want you to see the end. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
