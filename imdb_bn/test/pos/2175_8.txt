I read the story about how I will look at these two matches recently, and if you can believe it, then this movie improves on Balzac. I think, Kernel Chabbert is a man who has suffered a lot and still he comes home, not a hero, but surrounded the story as a great story. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned that if initially confused with Chabbert Martin Gherer's return. No It is firmly established by Belgrade that Chabbert is the actual deal. It is not interesting, but he is not, but how his wife and society behave with him. <br /> <br /> I think it's a free story that is going to fight for them in the country and when they come home at home they have left behind behind. Chabbert is a tragic figure that is even more rude by the amazing Gerard Depardieu. I do not think he is in 1 million films, he's impressive. <br /> <br /> Fanny Arthur has an awesome character. Once prostitution, used to use her feminine wiles to climb everyday social ladder. His feelings are true for Compte Ferraud? I think they and perhaps couples have started to feel some sympathy for him at the time and with his social position. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, her best French movie.
