Velvet Tipping is released in the UK just three weeks ago and I already see countless letters in national papers and TV guides as flood, claiming that it has a thin plot, poor performance and even weak scripts. <br /> <br /> You find me annoyed. This heresy <br /> <br /> I would like to express my first doubt by congratulating Andrew Davis for activating this awesome drama of Sir Waters novel, to enable Joefrey Sax. Glory. But I'm afraid I have to change the tech now. <br /> <br /> I saw a premier TV guide in the UK (which would be anonymous), describing Velvet as a "gay love love story". If they are, and I think they are trying to encourage interest in the film, then it is completely wrong about it (along with the description frustratingly incorrectly described). By saying such a thing, they are either a) who instinctively reestablish the "normal" issue, and B) attract a class that only sees some "serious girl-girl activity". Buy a video! Through this exhibition of critical unconsciousness, these and other journals are making a great adaptation of the greatest works of recent literature. Velvet Tipping Love, Emotions, Moving, Damage, and Depression. This is not a lesbian love story. There is no staircase. <br /> <br /> The end result is a stylish affair, all round with excellent performance (especially from Starling, House, Chancellor and May). According to the direction, it is drug and submerged - sometimes, fast, sometimes not - but it does not last for less than compulsory. Completely, it is smooth and well-distributed, sex is handled with softness and flexibility - and even though it will not be classified as the original "movie", but it will remain among my favorites for some time.
