General Tralene wants to play a little game with a super-enterprise crew crew. Very unlikely and unreasonable things seem to be happening, and Trailine is obsessed with human habit of war and murder. It is necessary to think that he is going to imagine a thrilling and created his human environment (though he is hundreds of years old) to play his fantasies. The atmosphere is undoubtedly inhumane, and the crew immediately begins to spot inconsistency. Very soon it becomes clear that Trelayne is just an unfamiliar God, but a very integral one. Regardless of how you feel about it, surround yourself with the twilight zone. It is well worth it. Many people have noticed that Trailan's character inspires a more advanced and fun running character - and you can see more than the levels of this personality of John Dealiencie, Trelayne of Campbell. It is comparatively different from how we have seen four captains.
