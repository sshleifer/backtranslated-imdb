Wow, stella shorts are great! State and Stella, many sponsors from TV shows. I never knew that if Stella could achieve any good, then they were in the TV show Stella or even the comedy Central presentations: Stella. I did not know the small comedies could be any better. My favorite people were to organize a meeting with Pizza, Racking Lev, The Woods and David Greg along with his long lost cousin. I think David is on the most fun that's all. It's fun when she's not funny I like shorts music Thats something I pay a lot of attention to They always had good taste in the music. I still wish they made shorts, that is or brought back to the sitcom. I hope they continue to make good and fun comedy.
