I've described this picture as wonderful ... it's true in many cases. Contents (black people are wrongly accused), characters (those you expect stereotypes often show abnormal attitude during filming), production ... <br /> <br /> All these factors are a refreshing unusual film, especially for its time ( 1949). Sometimes harmful dialogues and occasionally high moral positions can only potential spoilers. However, if you were not planning to see a film when you happen to do it, you might find myself like myself - having the midnight night is just to see what happens. <br /> <br />
