Mother and leg kettles flicks it as the first. Manger (Ma) (Mum) stole Shoke at any of her. Funny like EMi Moore, the fearful gentle lady of the train. God was always old; She was "Desk Set" and "Alfred Hitscoke Presentation". Their new room is also co-starred here - the future room with some great discovery that does not care for the foot. Love painting jokes. Keep an eye on Tom ... he played "grandmother and professor". Unfortunately he died in the real young ... Wonderfully enough, his last role was in the series "Death Cruise". Weird Operated by Charles Lamont, who not only managed a few kettle films, he also made a bunch of Abbott and Costello Flickr, so he knew one or two things about the comedy. Fun story, plain, simple humor. Even the date of the release was April Fool's Day, 1949. The story begins to chase us and show the countrymen (our neighbors and even the Americans), but the story gives us sympathy and respect with progress.
