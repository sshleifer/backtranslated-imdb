A good movie for horses enthusiast and most others. This is a horse racing movie, and it is a "small man gets his chance" film, and it's a "how far do you go?" Movie Walter Matauo again proves his adaptation as an actor. He was just like the Louisiana Kajun horse left Lloyd Bundel. This movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of racing by dragging Luciana Kajun horse. He has a young quadrangular horse who has a top racing prospect. "There was nothing without a filling station and a good horse." Bourdles collects opportunities to make amorous American futures up to horses from horses, Shadow, Ridoso, New Mexico. But Lloyd will win fame and fate? It is also memorable from this movie that Lloyd is waiting for the launch of Tobacco juice throwing and starting his truck.
