This event was so tedious to see and only two numbers can be found in Doubled World (love option) and in Paradise (not for me) and you can recognize it all. The opening of this event will be one of the most spectacular thrillers in history, such as a huge swivel that comes down from the rooftop of Madonna, on the stage through the crystal ball, and behind it, the huge curtains show horse-drawn images. Horse plays a role in this show because Madona is closed. Madonna's notorious scene on the cross is seen as more than 12 million screens in this show, how many African children are orphaned due to AIDS. Finally comes for someone interested in giving a website address. Then we went to the theme of the environment and again showed the picture of politics and religion. There is an interlude and then Shows I Love Music is starting again in this part of New York and Right Off Lights Show is one of my favorite performing fun hand movements here. At the end, there is a song number of discos Inferno music mixed with the song, and the dancers make more attendance there. After the end of the show with the lyrics of Lucky Star and Hang Up, it is related to the energy that is over again and at the end of the message, hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling "Did you accept?" Come on DVD is valuable for buying and when it comes, the show's soundtrack was added as a bonus. With this footage, Junas Auckland has done a great job that corresponds to the tourism style.
