Since 1981, Nintendo has created superb video games such as Super Mario and Gelda. Most ideas will be a bit annoying after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo do not seem to get annoying because they're always adding something new. It went from the arcade games to the Wii and I heard that there is a new version of the Wii for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is actually doing something instead of sitting on the sofa button. <br /> <br /> and I have more good news. Super Mario galaxy 2 released in 2010
