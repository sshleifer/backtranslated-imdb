Without the question, the film is a powerful medium, much earlier than ever, due to the accessibility of the DVD / video, which also reassures the filmmaker that millions of people will be seen in his story or message. The use of this medium connects the artist with natural responsibility, as the film can be educational, as well as recreational, which indicates that sensitivity and sensitivity should be communicated with specific issues. For example, a movie called 'Scandalers' list of Spielberg is important, it is important that it keeps memories alive, which should not be forgotten, and the history itself repeats, the Spielberg movie is a tragedy that repeats. This movie directed by Blue Slavin is 'Focus', it enlightens the problem of anti-constraint problem problems, which has affected millions of people for many years, is still unrecognized today and any manifestation of unknown prejudice, strangers, or ignorance will be made permanent. Birth of a genomic strain, it is a disease infectious society, which can be unabated, terminal; And with insightful insights into its condition, this film is an effective vaccine that can spread only due to very little help, and hopefully it can act as a step toward completely eliminating it. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Messi) served his country in the Great War, and then lived a quiet, traditional way of life in New York. He has done the same job as an employee director for almost 20 years and lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey), the owner of an average, middle-class homeowner's house. Lawrence is a kind of person who thinks of his business just fine and refuses to share his affairs (he thinks) with her. <br /> <br /> It's all changing, with the advent of World War II, Lawrence, owner of corner market, Mr. Finnmarkstein (David Pemma), inexplicably identified himself as the target of the nearby Geneofobo, who has associated himself with the 'Union Crusaders'. Now national bodies have been formed to show their fear and hatred on Jews, or anyone who 'looks' like Jews. And suddenly Lawrence discovered that he would not be able to stand up to the position and could not see the game; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Check the effect of the intensity against them; And when someone thinks that it is not just a fantasy situation, but a screenplay of reality, it is more tedious, even inaccessible. And it makes the film so effective that Slavin is a clear understanding of his subject, and his study of studies, which is concerned about its subordination. In the first scenario, Slavin founded Laurense's character, and soon reinstated it in another scene, which gives an opportunity to observe the audience and enrich how Lawrence's heart actually works. The process of thought that dictates his life Then, then, Steven was able to take his audience with Lawrence because his problems began to appear gradually. By doing this, he effectively illustrates how to raise the problem instead of focusing on the issue and focusing on it, which effectively enhances the emotional involvement of the viewer and ultimately increases the effect of the film. <br /> <br /> Slavin has an important point with this photo, which is not only a matter of secularism, but also a warning message about apathy. And for his achievement, he never strikes you with his head or does not look at the subject finger to make his case; Instead, he proceeded carefully, taking all of the great pain as possible as possible, that he was submitting for your consideration. His viewpoint is that of a cinematic diplomat; And this is a refuge that Slavin - and his film - works quite well. <br /> <br /> As Lawrence, William H. Messi - Best Actor in Business, Actor - Gives a Great Performance, Establishing the credibility and credibility of his character with a sensitive, honest and confident illustration. He does not try to break the personal flaws of the nature of Lawrence, but rather instead, which can create a characterally three-dimensional character, which simply does not believe strongly to it, but rather helps to repeat the picture honesty. The ability to publish Messi's process that is so compulsory, through which he examines his conscience, which successfully enables the viewer to share with his personal Epiphany experience. In the final analysis, it's Messi's performance power, more than anything else, which makes this movie so remarkably distinct. <br /> <br /> The power of another photo is the performance of Laura Darne, an illustration similar to Gartu's heart, which effectively completes Messi's work and slavin's work. Dore provides the extraordinary substance of his character, captures him physically and mentally, and his colorful jewel is a great contrast to Lawrence's reserve that works extremely well for his character and film. <br /> <br /> Recently, the acting act of 'Rock Star' set up as Shaun Combs ('Monthur's Ball') has made a good case against the handset, such as Frott, Lawrence's next door neighbor. It also proves that a true artist will create, to be given to work with any kind of canvas. <br /> <br /> Supporting customs include Michael Kappman (Karlson), Kenneth Wells (Father Criton), Joseph Jigler (Gargan) and Arlene Mdous (Mrs. Davit). The filmmaker is proud of his crafts, 'Focus', giving a memorable experience which is expected to be enlightened, as well as those who do not know that such conditions exist and still - even in this case, free land. 10/10. <br /> <br />
