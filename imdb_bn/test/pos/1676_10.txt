Playlip has fidelity, supported by the great aspect of Zeus Dasin, cast and superb movies. Gene Servais has outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with the principles guided by underworld rules. The famous long-term silence sequence is surprising and extremely fictional and in the history of movie history. I've never listed this favorite movie on the list of my favorite movies. My vote ten <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Riffey"
