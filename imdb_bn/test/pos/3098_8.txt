One of the most entertaining of all silent jokes is the crazy story of Puovinini's 'Chess Fawwor', a harsh intellectual board game that can hamper the most carefully planned central economy. Such an overwhelming ridiculous thing as chess is available in a previous outlet of this delightful short. The game of two young people, the artificial background, is a painstakingly play against the set. This is in contrast to the previous Lumiar shorts, such as' El 'Aurosius Arosse' or 'Repas de Bebe', where human activity was deliberately created by natural setting. Differences between activities (normal = feeding the baby, garden water; artificial = chess) Perhaps it is notable. <br /> <br /> This irreversible background and chess, uninterrupted game and chess play, on the original contrast of this film, and this modern reason causes tremendous emotions, the most illogical of deceit, from Melie. The intellectual game became a serious physical scrap, just as the aunty filmmakers were permanently disintegrated by the viewers 'crusader' claim. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing about this movie is how this graduation, but it's a way to make it, long after the initial joke; The way the camera refuses to agree with respect to the fight with attention, instead focusing on it, we keep on walking and catching spots in a crazy dress. The rejection of the film's edits is unsettling, so the humor appears to be derived from anything other than war, intellectualism reflects our need of physical contact on revival, leaving us stagnant. <br /> <br /> Especially bright brilliance, this high-grade fountain is characterized by Vallet, which makes them like two connective schoolboys, as if they put them in their ear boxes. If the owners might not have expected to keep their place with their decorations, someone would do it for them.
