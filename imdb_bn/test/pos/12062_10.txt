These were some shows that my wife and I agreed to the observer. I was very annoyed to hear that it was canceled, especially because I did not understand that the rating was so poor. As far as I knew it was working very well with many visitors. Almost all my friends and I saw most people saw the show. Now we are stuck watching crappy shows or DVDs. How bad was the show? Does anyone know the actual results shown? I know it was hard for me to get it on Thursday. Thanks * for the DV * D! <br /> <br /> It was a real surprise that "war at home" will not be there anymore. If any other network can see it, please press SHOW UP! Please!
