I originally saw this movie at the end of the detention at a movie theater in Times Square. Who would publish two consecutive sequences of this movie and it was thought that this ritual would follow. The time of the demo was like most other films. A group of horny thirons locked themselves in some local people and then killed one. One time in different scary ways. The formula is still being used to remember it and still I have seen that the second saw. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kikko in a Fangori conventions six years ago and she was so heartfelt! I guess this makes him a beautiful actress, if she can have a career in playing this demon-neighbor woman on these horrible flaps. However, I again got this movie in VHS cassette and this movie is still up to date. I remember when it first looked a bit slowly at the beginning but then quickly takes up speed. Around eighty horror classic and worth a look!
