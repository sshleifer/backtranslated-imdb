Japanese is probably the most poisonous film in the world and it is a powerful example. Running in an hour, there is enough sexual violence and the rage that can hate every single person in the world (even those who are victims of this type of movie). Three men and a woman are making an obscene film. After a few common shots (which are pixelated), the girl is tied and the madmen cut her food, hands and tong. Then they have a hole in their stomach and a man has sexual intercourse with his intestine. She has become very unconscious and her penis has been cut. Special effects are probably good for low-budget production (only toggle cut scene looks fake), and we can not talk about acting, direction or pornography. After hearing a lot about this movie, I finally was very happy to find it. The first part is quite annoying, but the second is entirely gratified by the "Tumblewing doll of fruit" in my mind F *** k, the torture and murder scenes I've ever seen, the most extreme and annoying bulls, but an unknown audience will not even have to prosper.
