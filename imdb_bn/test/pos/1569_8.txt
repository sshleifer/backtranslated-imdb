Although I can understand some points about cinematography (I used to think that the more purposeful method is to better support the feeling of low-fai, home movies) I would have said that the script and the performance of Alice Finding were excellent! Dean Bell has created a real gems that charms Judith Ivy with the joy-driven pleasure. Sandra is exposed to her performance, as a delightful - instantly, horror and romantic. We are once confused by its activity and repulsed ... and are not given more information than necessary. Bell's post-modern fairy tales got mixed with his and supporting cast effort. Emily Grace's Alice is infused with a die-eye magic. He seems like a clay-like mold in front of us, transformed into some kind of beautiful, lost animal. In the end, we are saying weird his mother, he is curious with the word. Codos will also be called Jen Lincoln Taylor - whose mother is a true tragic historical weight - and Justin Parkinson - whose shy first time John, Sam, is not the most lively, movie scene by giving sweet one. Bell has created a first-rate story and it combines a great deal of talent to create.
