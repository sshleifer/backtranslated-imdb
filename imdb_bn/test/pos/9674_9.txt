This is a great show, it makes me wonder why it has pulled the wind so many times. But I believe I'm here now! This show can not be compared to any other, Simpson was "on the verge" and before expanding the family, it expanded to exit the "edge". This show gets away with incredible fills. Watch the clock fully! If you love Simpson you love the family!
