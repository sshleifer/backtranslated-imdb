I really enjoyed this movie - I usually like prison movies (I'm not sure - I'm not sure that some of the shorter things can get out of him!) I spent one night in prison 20 years ago, and I knew then I would have to go back No - I got a different version of "Scared straight"! (I was locked in a secluded cell in Alcresse for hours, congratulations to Park Parker, but this is another story!) However, this genre is really interested in me. Rolling Stones soundtrack, especially "Couple sympathy", the perfect backdrop for the movie. On this day, I feel the "Jericho Mile" when I hear the song.
