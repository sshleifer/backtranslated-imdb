Do you know if a movie is good? It makes the difference that impact on you. "Dead people walking" a big deal made me feel bad. I saw it twice I do not know whether it will be strong enough to see it again. No, I did not feel good after seeing it, but the film was as successful as it was successful. <br /> <br /> Robins has done a great job to include all aspects of this controversial issue. He avoided making an argument that he could easily be biased or subjective. I hope many people will see "Walking Dead Man". I believe that anyone who supports or opposes the execution of the death sentence will see the film. <br /> <br /> I do not know what can be done to satisfy everyone finally that there is no place in this modern society of this remnant. <br /> <br /> The film does not give any reason for the death penalty or against him. It describes the reality. The reality is the best argument against the death penalty <br /> <br /> 10 years for great acting, good film production and for the most important movie <br /> <br /> Thanks, Team Robins! <br /> <br />
