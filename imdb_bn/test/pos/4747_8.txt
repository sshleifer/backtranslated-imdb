This is a good enough movie, and you probably will not be disappointed, but once again "Ray Screen" is called "Body Connection", it is playing a copier called Body. They use the same memorable Wheelman from "Bullet". First of all, if you think your face is still in your memory, then you have seen the car Chase. Car Chase is a great one, but as many car movie scenes, it has some technical and editing errors. Check "a chain doll" and "French connection II" for some good, long, intense effort.
