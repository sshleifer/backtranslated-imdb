"Hit and Run" is always a wonderful story of Margaret Colin's female acting woman who has played "everything about him" and a wonderful story until her child hits the scene. So the title. The tragedy is that he comes back for help, but he is frightened by the passers-by-rage-he thinks that Hitler has left the scene. This day someone was created when everyone was not a cell phone or the story would not be. <br /> <br /> Colin's crime and pain are obvious and she forces him to act so strange that a detective gets to the right side. Because of its lies and deep hatred sink into a profound hate hole, because its bad condition will be bad. <br /> <br /> This is a very thought-provoking story, and someone can help but can not remember the pain of the lady, she would come easily to greet her whole life. <br /> <br /> As a television movie, Colin and a powerful script thanks, it's a good top-rated TV movie.
