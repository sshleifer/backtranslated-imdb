Last night I saw MTV premiere of this movie and I had to inform everyone that this film thundered. Clearly, this film will be enjoyed by a great ingredient because it has a lot of in-jokes for the HBO series, and enough dues for new fans and enough of them to be transformed soon enough. Music is truly new with the new song "Kikapu" (which is much better than what it sounds), "Master Explorer" (probably the world's third best song) and "Dude (I miss you completely)" There is a load of nice scenery (car charging, rock closing, meeting) and Camio (including Dave Grohl as the Devil)! I could go for hours but I do not want to leave the movie. Go see it. You will not be disappointed.
