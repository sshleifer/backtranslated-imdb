Jake Audiard's debut novice Sin Who Hoole Paul Uk Rigard Le Les Hommes Tomber is our old friend, telling the story of the same story after being gradually united with two different stories. This is the story of the available dog of Matthew Causewits, which unfortunately, Cardiff Drifter Jean Louie Trinngant, who is asked to pay for his gambling loan, even sculpted to kill him. Meanwhile, within a slightly different time frame, John Yan's mountainous traveler has been increasingly obsessed with selling hit man who has scratched his friend's dead coma, his life, income and relationships on his forehead. Its victims are nearby. Although it can provide the perfect setup for a modern day Neo, however, the film is often more curious, character-comedy, and more interested in little curiosity of laughter (Dangerous captions and half-traditional thriller Alexander Desplat set pieces and juniors, half- Isolated score). Unfortunately, this film has been rendered ill with the worst zodiac of 1 DVD in recent years: The quality of the picture encoded in the synchronized disc is so poor that when you look forward to seeing the audience head in front of a pirate disk.
