I could be a sentimentalist. But I found this movie really moving. This was the first movie that made me tears. And it has done it multiple times !! I recommend it to both gay and str8 Religious or not! Associate co-star Jackie Bissett steals the show with a lantern in particular. The nude scenes were nicely designed as well, and all had good taste. The screenplay of the opposite deprogramming adaptation of the main character formed by Mormon Church was the most shiny. It surprised me that the world is still running. Yet I enjoyed this movie. This must be the best gay film from Torch Music Trilogy. And that's a lot better than other homosexual movies that year - Fluffer.
