A great film. Each moment masterfully managed by Toyoda and her crew. Actors deliver credible performance around the world. Visuals are hunting, beautiful and sometimes scenic scenes of natural landscapes of Japanese country and city. Japan band 'Dig' procession, band-made soundtrack It is curiously atmospheric and appropriate for the scenes they fit. Finally, they have used everything perfectly .... Well, if they give a trial for the story, then only that anyone can accept the fulfillment. <br /> <br /> 9 people's original glory compulsory story The prison is broken, maybe a lost series on this day, and the road travel movie is losing its appeal, which is becoming smaller in the world. But this story easily mixed a bit of these two branches. <br /> <br /> 9 people have been given freedom and they have probably been given the opportunity to regain their place in society. Will society accept them? Will they really be free in their darkness? And they can stick together and long enough to stay alive? <br /> <br /> Every criminal has an interesting history. Their crimes are varied as their apparent fate. The idea of ​​brotherhood in them keeps the story high on drama and provides ridiculously ridiculous situations. And due to the nature of their background, violence is always waiting to happen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
