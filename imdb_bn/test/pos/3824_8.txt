No, I did not see the original series and if I did not pick two, I would not compare. This series is pictured in Vancouver and British Columbia Victoria in Canada. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Something out there a little but most of the time it's story telling quality. In the context of the program episode with Clans Brown and Barbara Garrick and The Diggrammars episode, I have described the unexpected Brent spinner as a businessman in a world where people have become slaves of an incognito reptile species. It's funny how disguised and reptiles are like our favorite nasty aliens, but they give three people time to brainwash completely to serve any kind of human race in the world. The story is usually a little out but very entertaining to see.
