I saw this movie, and it's crying me. It's a beautiful drama about falling in love with two brothers, and I think it's a good idea, especially for close-conscience, to see it. I've come to love with a short film after just seeing a couple because they have a lot to do with you, and I must say that this sign is clearly sitting. It describes some things, that I never thought of that road, the turmoil for one. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I do not care too much for the last. Once I wanted to kill myself after the ward, I would like to see a gay-themed movie. They mostly seem to end the tragedy. Although it was 'tricky', how did they stay together, even if it died. <br /> <br /> I gave it 8 stars, and I also recommend it to everyone because I think it's an 'inside-look', this movie lets you enter. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening, enjoy.
