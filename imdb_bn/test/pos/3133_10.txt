Two horse traders reach the city and meet the leaders of the Mormon group, who are bound for the valley, where they can sit and live in peace. Word Bond and Ben Johnson watch the scenes of the city and bonds present their ideas (conducted by Johnson and his companion Harry Carey Jr.) in this valley, trains the best, among which are some of the best films, as a Johnson, a real cowboy, and Benders When he made a piece of wood in pieces. Once upon a train they bring Juan Drew, who might have seen John Ford in the Red River and offered him a better part of the film. Mormon train has a significant number of characters. Mormans are challenged by a truly subdued group who deviates from a peaceful party. Among the train writers, and later on with whom they face, the well-written characters of Ben Johnson and Ward Bond have left the film completely. The camera spent a lot of time with the viewer that the large image of the monument valinity is making the train, it is coming back to the crossing of some waters along the path as well as black and white, and then what is happening in this moving community is coming back. Pianor's sons are in line with the beautiful vocals.
