When, oh, someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground will release it in the widescreen DVD? Lee Arme, which I know only because of my rare / Vintage video collection habit, is a collection of my films that I will not be sitting alone, but actually enjoy watching. Clouse Kinsky top bills, but in small parts of the film, this is only small for me. (Although most of his comments express disappointments during his limited screen.) I can not say it is a good movie, a good mystery, a scientific epic epic, or some of the nature. It is simply unnoticed in the "genre" concept of things. It's not like a confusing, horrific (though particularly violent or bloody) dreams, it's full of great scenes and mysteries. It relies on the scene and emotion of Bava's "Lisa and the Devil". Both films are beautiful in almost every sense, but it is almost impossible to describe in a logical manner; They both occur in such a dream-like atmosphere. The Force on the back cover will not be disturbed by the video's summary. It is infinitely more complex and stimulating than that. Although the release of Force Video from 1986 (the only United States I know) tape is full-screen cropped, but even in its format it is still great. It should be remastered and / or letterboxed (it indicates, indicates ... DVD companies).
