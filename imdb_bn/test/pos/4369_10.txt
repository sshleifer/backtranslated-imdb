I have seen this delightful classic again after many years, after three years after the last film directed by Henry Cornelius, only three years later died at the age of 45 (the same year the film star Larry Harvey died 1973). The cricketer had three future directors: Jack Clayton (Associate Producer), Guy Green (filmmaker), and Clive Donner (editor). This film is based on the well-known British author Christopher Ishrude's autobiographical story 'Goodbye to Berlin', which became a drama in John Van Dutton, then turned into a film, then portrayed as a musical, 'Cabaret', and finally 'cabaret', which is amazing Liza brings the minaly world's attention, her voice which is to break a glass at a distance of miles Ray. Ishrude appeared as a character in his own film. He was a homosexual, but those days were illegal and could have put him in jail, so he misled his proponent by calling him 'an assured graduate'. It is the key to its platonic relationship, stupid, malicious, always pleasant and thoroughly unique character, which he calls Sally Bolds. The portrait of Sally Bowler in this film is a tour of young Julie Harrison-D-Force, which turns every scene into a magical and impressive web of amazing personal charm. What is a car for an actress with lots of her own fame! It played the great movie of the 1950s. Ishrwood played the fullness with the young Lawrence Harvey, which is a fine-tuned performance that does not let the comedy go beyond the ends and even the border between the slopstick border is 'almost believable' in any way. Larry is so funny at filming a wimpish hypochondriac. In the last year of his life, during his last year of bravery and brutality in the last year of his life, considering the total deficiency of hypochondria, which died from terminal stomach cancer and dealing with such a lack of dignity and accusations. I knew him well in the last three years, and he was a generous, warm and humble person. She enjoyed her little girl Domino, now unfortunately dead This film was his first film, followed by 'Room at Top' (1959), 'Summer and Smoking' (1961) and 'The Top' Manchurian Candidate '(1962). Larry often underestimated his life because he was very handsome, often casted as a cad, and glamorous boys are not always acceptable as good actors, but many actresses act against them and there is no doubt about their power, One of the important films was a strong leadership. If he crosses the middle age, he has gone from strength to strength and becomes a 'grand old man' on screen. One day while sitting in his home at Hampstead, he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel brought in a foreign house. I said that he always gave me such a delicious wine, what was it? He proudly replied that it was a snake that he chose in the vineyard of France and specifically sent it to the ship. Then he added with extreme extremism: 'You know, I'm waiting four years for someone to comment and ask me, and you're the first person who ever did that.' What status she was given to be recognized with the taste of alcohol, and her more interesting friends denied her satisfaction. In this film, Anton Deferring gives a tactical initial performance as a sincere young man (afterwards, he had to play a lot of Nazi officials, and a poor colleague), and the young Shell Winters played the wealthy German Jewish girl in his usual funeral, but the effective method, but it was not very difficult Because he was not a foxe Jewish girl. This image has an air of D. Vivro, it is a pure joy.
