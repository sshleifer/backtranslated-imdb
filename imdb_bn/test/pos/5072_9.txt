Some movies are designed to entertain you, others are designed to make you feel angry and angry at others, to make you laugh, or to cry or raise, to others, to get excited. During this movie I was angry or not, in the film, but the fact that it was true, America, oppressed in free, unreasonable scenes that it is doing it for better work. The scenes of torture of this movie were frustrating, the public's indifference was frustrating, the film was compelled by its logic and showed how wrong it was to torture people. Of course, now I have created a "liberal blood" label, which is influenced by others, who close their minds to these events and stop them from doing so. Those who do not understand this movie are victims of torture, ten or a hundred people stand up to take revenge. You get a growing cycle of violence. This image does not hate me America, although I can see how it can do it, but it hates me as a reaction to America's response to 9/11. There are notable citations in the film, we have learned that 19 people have died and 70 people injured in the bomb scene, the quote is "one American died" - which differentiates. You can not kill Americans, America can kill thousands of people, but you will not be able to kill single Americans, or they will do whatever they want with torture for justice. This is apparently American way. Call me liberal, tell me stigma (though I think that the tortured people seem to be fine) call me corrupt, say anything to me, but this is a wonderful example of what is wrong with America and the West. I hope this movie will be shown to all the students of the school at the lowest level. This film will be with me for a long time, I can forget the part of my will, because I want this kind of thing never happened, but I know it, I will never forget my other part because we need these shameful events to stop them from happening again. remember. Whatever the movie with me, this film will be with me for a long time, and I will ask everyone to see it, not to be entertained, but rather to be excited, because sometimes we all have to be excited.
