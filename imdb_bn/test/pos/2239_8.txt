According to IMDB users, I was watching 100 films below that I have not seen it yet and I found this small screen jewel. An event where you see a movie that is moved to the worst and you just have to be one of the few who like it. Darn, well I would guess here would be laugh and spat, but for me it was a fantastic good flick when I saw it. Even though it was a while, it seemed that it was used to come to Habee at night and I saw it two or three times and I did not really see it and I want to see Jolly again to know it. The story follows a cybill and a guy tries to escape this corporation and some grant hunter clutches after them. I think it's basically all, throw in a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movies. Here and there some good actions, and some blood and violence as well. Besides playing, there is a love story trained to fight in the context of female cyborg and love for each other. Sometimes the dialog becomes rather bad and it is not a top pure film, but it's really good for a B-movie. Although I do not know whether it was a theatrical release because it does not look like it's high quality, but if it is one of the other then it creates it directly for the video.
