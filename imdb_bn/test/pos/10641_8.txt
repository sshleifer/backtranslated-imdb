One of the best films I've ever seen since this silent era (sadly, I still see many things except Chaplin / Keaton stuff). Very visually bright, with insane dominant style in editing and composing. Really unique camera camera angle (especially for its time) and extremely serious editing. Of course, you must see for the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Negligence as part of the back). Also, this is not a "entertainment" film that is fine, but it's not something I'm going to see one billion times. It's art, plain and simple, not like it. <br /> <br /> The cost of A + for the impact of + alone, but based on personal enjoyment, I can give it an A-.
