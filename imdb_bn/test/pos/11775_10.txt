Talk about your classic! Ernie Fossilus (Faces From Here) Fully came with a tricky and creative trailer of spoofing Star Wars. This gem is so gadded with charm and jags I smile every time! Not only this, when Star Wars re-released the new special effect, the hardware war was the same! Talk about a drunk that just will not die! George Lucas has a reason to call this his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he "returned to Zedi" (do not trust for work, check his entry on IMDB!) <br /> <br /> <br /> My opinion, sometimes the best parody . I think the special edition was a bit more, but with reflection, I think it is perfect for the redemption of modern day Star Wars and it proves that sometimes it is a mess of messing up with perfection. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's just 10 minutes, but your time is good. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, cry, you will kiss $ 3 goodbye! Well, maybe for 15 DVDs, but you'll be really happy.
