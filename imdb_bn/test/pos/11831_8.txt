This early Warner Brothers book "The Gods of the Gods" (1930) relates to ethnic intolerance, which shows the Anglo-Saxon Americans looking to the Chinese. Chinese-Americans are treated like a second-class citizen, and they hold them back without any insult. <br /> <br /> A young, printed chamanman from Bradley King Rex Beach, Sam Lee (Richard "Angels Wing Wings Only"), who was initially a racial pre-emptive experience, when college colleges to bring to any group When they come to know about their traditions, they express their racism about Sam. Sam goes to his father, Li Ying (E. Allen Warren's "Gone with the Bound"), who is rich in office with offices in San Francisco, not New York City. Sam feels seriously injured by ethnic slurs and he wants to leave New York and where he can not be hurt by Americans. His patient father warns him that racism is a reality of daily life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. Sam still could not learn this lesson. He refused to take any money from his father and kept a ship in London in England, he holes on the board. <br /> <br /> During the travel, he needed some help for British playwright Bather (Claud King of "Aroskit"), who wrote a game about Chinese. Sam and he strikes up a friendship and equips him with cultural information about Sam Asian. Although they are comfortable in France, Sam met a beautiful young girl, Alana Wagner (Constance Bennett of "Two Face Women"), who became crazy in love with her. It seems that Allana and her wealthy father are having a vacation in the same Metro. All of Matela's people know about Chinaman as Sam as an exception. Sensitive about her ethnic heritage, Sam keeps Alanah at the length of Sir, until he believes that he can not change his mind about him. They are crazy to love together. Allana's father put a bomb on him when he revealed that Allan's mind was dealing with all the memories and coolies living in Sam A Chinaman and San Francisco. He raised a storm in the motorline dining room and shot Sam in public with a side crop in front of a riding in front of a ride. <br /> <br /> Of course, against this incident Sam is very devastating. She thought she loved her but she did not. About this time, Sam's father, Lee Egan became seriously ill and sent a telegram to England on the illness of Samuel, Secretary of Young's Secretary-Secretary, Eleven ("Iron Man"'s Milledred Van Door). Perhaps Sam is returning to New York to stay next to his father. Due to his public humiliation, Sam Anglo-Saxon has not pledged to show any favor to Americans; Isin is an Irish Catholic and possibly some of his white friends. Lee Ying died and Sam pursued his business control, and he practiced his anti-White racism, until he knew that he invented the Anglo-Saxon that allows San Francisco police super Lee Yang and his wife to be raised. The police forgot two busy busy social workers Sam until they were away from the yang. Sam Allen came to New York and became ill, and learned this revelation at the same time. During his illness, he repeatedly called his name in his sleep and went to see his fiancee father Sam and requested that Sam be requested to visit him for his recovery. Unknown to Allana, Sam visits her and she improves, but there is no memory of her inspection, only a lazy idea. Finally, Alana knew about Sam that she did not know and they got married and lived happily. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> In the body of a father-in-law, hours or holidays before the release of the blood is not being carried out in the blood, suddenly, the audience is caught by the audience as well. Regarding the reconciliation between Alan and Sam, their self-professors relied on each other, despite the love of undying love. However, the negative ones that came before it in the happy end will be removed, they will be able to work each other. <br /> Some of the moral strengths of Chinese film are damaged. Incredibly, "The Gods of the Gods" is a pre-coded movie that often seems weird; For example, Sam is an American, not Chinese! Constance Bennett gives an amazing performance as a petulant beautifies and she holds your attention when she whips Sam with her riding crop. Cloud King is better as Bathurst, and E. Believer as Allen Warren Lee Eg. Interestingly, Warren made a career out of filming Asian characters. Richard Barthelmace is flawless as Sam; He provides a highly nuanced performance. Despite his age, "Son of God" is a son of a good movie!
