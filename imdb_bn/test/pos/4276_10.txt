I just saw this picture and I recommend it. This is a very good plot, it keeps your full attention, acting fantastic, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was very good. Really a very good film, about great and unconditional love. The character of Tom Wilkinson is such a man who is not ready for the beginning, but he has taken the story as progress, and this great actor gave a performance that makes you feel the pain and pain of character. Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she only gives a quick glance and you understand everything. I will not say anything because it is good for you to enter the story.
