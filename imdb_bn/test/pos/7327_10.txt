Yes, it is "flipper". But the author / director Alan Shapiro has been a gem in a version together. Jose McNellie and Crosby, Steals and Nash's "Jads" veteran builders and hunting music and water photography are the truly memorable family entertainment. Shapiro, whose last film was unlikely "The Crush", and again shows itself as a very talented - and versatile - film producer. Rent it!
