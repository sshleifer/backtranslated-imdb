<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Pictured in black and white, it was a good time and was considered that it was a fight. If anything, then the authorities show how positive the campaign is. <br /> <br /> The movie campaign is a real-world submarine. Things are cramped and clustrophobic. Actor heroic feather is not being very aggressive appropriately grimy and sweaty look. Other commentators have already attracted attention in real little details about keeping the ship trim and forgetting to read the equipment and forgetting engine-room operations. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first movie which is destroyed by a debris (and a dead german) from an enemy destroying fool's torpedo tube. And this was only when I saw the part of the ship sinking in the ship - a risky gambling, if ever were a <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Through its way can punch. The dried speed was twice the speed of the human walk and the 'giving' of the net was a great deal. Also, the engineer was in the same work-station and the same liver had sunk over and over the surface. It seems very impossible because the diesel or electric engine was used and they were in different sections of the ship - or so called to me. <br /> <br /> There was too much play on the coast for my taste. But then, it was a promotional effort, and clearly there was a clear message for the civilians to remember their behavior because it could affect service psychology in contrast and for the war effort. <br /> <br /> Combine these, it is a beautiful adventure little adventure. Nowadays, these kind of cinemas will be displayed in the afternoon, although more modern and inferior movies enjoy the prime-time. But then; The battle for presence of our European friends (many of them guilty consciences), or our own leftist fascists (for which they have ever fought for independence, none of them ever fought), and is not politically correct. <br /> <br /> As a submarine film, it is very collectable. Better than 'strife', I think, though scattered less. In any way, 'Das Boot' is not so pure, but it is not fairly rough.
