For the first time, 82 friends had been billed for the first time in the hit HBO. When 14, after hearing back 'sleeping sound' - I was concerned about seeing one. (!) Boy - I'm surprised! That picture! I really did not fall in love with a non-special effects film outside Siradha Madras Treasurer - much less Hippie Flick ... but I grew up with Hippies - I saw the power behind Mr. Pen's picture. Four friends are definitely one of a kind. The script is so expressed - and that throw !!! Craig Wasson has very well defined Danilo Proser! He's just a 'writer type' personality from a tee - both smart and lazy (in the window view ...) and strong but still very risky. For me - he has taken hold of what he can do with warming for more than a decade and I have always enjoyed the character and the film. I was a companion of four friends of 80 - and whenever I could do HBO, I used to take the film - even if I have to stay till 5! And yet, always at the end - there is a feeling of loss when those wonderful characters are part of the audience on the beach. Jodi Thleen blamed this "girl" - it is not impressive on her. This movie really stands the test of time. Every time I check my video once or ... or show a friend ... and it still gets a solid response. I know women with absolutely love for Georgia! So much ..! Just an incredible little 60 pieces of humanity. Very special, very magic. I recently found four friendships by Robert Grosbach - and that movie even more details! The facts are real facts, etc find a real! And what's more - huh - I found the novel while roaming in the used bookstore ... Omaha, NE everywhere! Guess you have an eye for him! When I was in the LAB I was working as an additional 92 - I went to a dirty Lil Memorilia shop - and there was still one ton from the film !!! Unfortunately, I broke up and could not be busy ... but the boy, that photo of Georgia and everyone just went along with me! I met with the Sergeant of Skyrock in 22nd of the Epipeara Skylark in the summer ... and we talked to four friends - very cool! Also ... work in a video store in Omaha, 98 ... - A woman who was a relative of Jim Metzler waited for him ..! There were some kids in Omaha that asked to pass the word, who was just fantastic about this movie - and the greatest was achieved. Again - the film captures everything in the heart of Danilo's character ... great, great work --- one of the best efforts of Tesych and Pen. Steve Tesich is sorely missed. An incredible writer.
