I thought everywhere but there was a good movie here. It's two wonderful actresses, Susan Sarandon and Dante Portman, which I heard were together in the movie, I opposed it. After all, it was a beautiful concert film. It was at the moment where they felt like working hard to me, and there was some overdone and tiring material, but there was nothing in the movie that I hated at all. I also liked how I used pop-up functionality. Strangers Thorch Breach, and all small happy / sad moments touching and effective. If you want to watch this movie go ahead, because I do not recommend it, but it is not something you should skip and 5.9 ratings. I think my opinion is inappropriate.
