The title of the work was: "Do not touch the baby". <br /> <br /> Wayne Croftford became a successful producer, Valley Girl, Night of the Comet, and other movies, although he was not very dangerous at this little accumulation. And the lesser known Abe Zeuqu has achieved a lot of work from this movie but it should not be done. Illustrated at the Murbali studio in Hollywood Florida, at the same time Tarzan Films was filmed at the same time. This picture is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The movie was originally shot with some nudity and more graphic slashher scenes. Director Tom Casey was given a tab of bloody slasher scene LSD, only to find out the reason, and nudity was removed. Although this version is worthy of an appearance for this tendency, but in my opinion, the original version packs the necessary punch to complete it in Slashar's 70's Classic Classic.
