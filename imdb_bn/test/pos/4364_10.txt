I consider it an exciting but deceptive film because it seems so simple and straightforward: A Vietnam responder tells stories of his frustration and some stories are reviewed over the location. Critics sometimes claim that the presence of this movie of Hirojog is short, but how wrong they are. We know that all documentaries are "mediator" in some quantities and it has the fine hand of Herzug, especially the amazing music, the incredible expert selection of literary football and management of cascading images. The innovative power of this movie is amazing starting with its headline, "Revelation" and the opening voice card of the first voice-over book. It is a film that is surprisingly surprising, it is not a simple product available in the evening news papers with its favorite drink. This is a movie that you can reflect for your lifetime.
