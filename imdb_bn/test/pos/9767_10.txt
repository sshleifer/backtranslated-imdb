I remember this continuous observer in mind and at the end it was so frustrating. Since then, I have tried to find out if I can get a copy of it in a video or DVD. However, I was delighted to find this website in detail, only to be frustrated when buying, that the available videos will not play in English recorders! This product was so nice that it was just right with Neville Shoot's novel, after the end of the war, Joe and the post-life life together together - all the surprises - and I hope I can see it again, it's the main screening, it has been repeated in British television. .
