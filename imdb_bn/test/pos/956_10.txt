If you have seen the Telugu version in Gili "Okakadu", you will see similar to the storyline, but there are songs from Gilly and it does not happen in Tamil Nadu in Andro Province. Although it is a remake of "Okakadu" you will find that victory and trisha made a unique movie, Vijay and Trisha created a great pair. To win a gift for her, she had a few negative incidents in the blaze of thirtieth character to buy a gift, she would never apologize and she would remain with him till the end. Good actions and songs all this makes a great movie I recommend it. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10/10, the best one I have seen.
