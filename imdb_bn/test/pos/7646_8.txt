I like Armand Assange and my cable company seems to be attractive, so I saw it, already twice, and probably will be again. <br /> <br /> The first step is hard to follow, but later it becomes clear. I believe that the screen writer did a good job of dragging the loose ends. <br /> <br /> The acting was somewhat disrespectful, but it was probably because I was always expecting some type of dual cross. In that case, poor acting interacting with each other is characteristic of characters, so it fits very well. The important thing is that the carnival owner (Assante) is laundering money for a local casino and its snake charmer (Dogma Deminjic) wants to steal it. He complained to "Archie" (Ridas) about how terrible his life is and how he can help him get out of it. <br /> <br /> There are 3 or 4 plot twists (which might be the end for everyone, perhaps), and when you think that you solve the mystery, something else will happen. <br /> <br /> My 8/10 score is mostly for plot. <br /> <br /> I won and I do not say - I do not like spoilers, so I do not want to be one, but I believe this movie is worth your time.
