I saw this picture for the first time PBS. Then I bought the video and saw it countless times. Every time I see it, I can get something other than that. It is a real rule if it is good to live a life that is good, but now the world is changing. But you do not have to be old to keep an eye on the past, even young characters like small characters do not want to change. Overall tone and mood are excellent. Cast outstanding with all stars like Casey Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And Kevin J. Before they hit movies with more recognizable features like O'Noun (The Mummy) and Vincent d'Anfario (Men in Black and Law and Order: Criminal Intent - one of my favorite shows), they are excited to see the upcoming stars. . It's just one of the movies that reside with you.
