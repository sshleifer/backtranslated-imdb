I've seen this movie several times over the years and it has always found an entertaining experience. As a retired airline pilot, I am most interested in air films and it is also the best one. I know that Lincoln's historic solo flight of Paris was only 25 years old and while making this film, James Stewart was about 50, but Stuart was always one of my favorite actors and I could ignore this. One of its normal extraordinary performances as "solo eagle" <br /> <br /> There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the film and good use of flashback It helps that James Stewart was a pilot in both real life in military and civilian life.
