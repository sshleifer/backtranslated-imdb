"Big Arrad's belief is the invisible power structure that exists in reality, the most narrow definition of paranaia." ?? Slavaz Jizak <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hollywood "conspiracies thriller" condomor "and" all presidential men "with movies such as" Scene "," Zar "," Marathon Man "," Macquarie Candidate "," The Manchurian Candidate "," Three Days ", which is the age of Vietnam and Watergate. People are deeply suspicious of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> "X file" TV series life In the early 80's and early 90's, the style was quiet until the tagline, Tagline as "The Truth Is Out Out" and "Trust No One", the series shows a world of huge plot and government plots, with the grace of all the ridiculously planned plans. The only way out is "Battle in the Future!" As the tagline announced in the final season of the series, and it was our responsibility to inform Ranti, in order to ensure our own freedom for some confusing "truth" was discovered in. <br /> <br /> This trend ended sparkling Internet, Conspiracy Thrillers now "conspiracy documentaries". This generation of independent documentaries were released by the Internet generation "Loose Change" and "Zeitgeist", while mainstream Michael Moore titled his audience with things like "Fahrenheit 9/11". All these documentaries have a "secret order", a cabal believer to wealthy politicians and businessmen who reduce a human rights and enslave the world. They struggle to create a monotony, linking different schemes and secret agendas alone, which explain all the objectives and objectives and future of the future. It is necessary to "decorate the details" to reflect their more efficient "skilled", scientific community, who create "grand unification theory" and finally creates a "theory of everything", which is special from Quantum Mechanics. Relativity is mixed up in a huge formula. <br /> <br /> So in the end, the desire for people to be under the control of "conspiracy the thriller" man. The modern issue shows cruel discipline to the official organization, but at the same time believes in the existence of the plot (pulling an invisible other strings). The contradiction between these seemingly contradictory and confidential beliefs is strictly related to the death of bigger adults. We can create another (conspiracy) because of its invisibility to avoid the causes of disadvantage from disrespectful freedom. On the contrary, we do not need to accept big adults in other beliefs of others. So we are allowed to show grief and faith in equal steps. <br /> <br /> People thus want to establish control over a passenger universe, can create a parent of a parent (this is God, a mathematical formula, conspiracy theory, violence / conspiracy / murder / war etc.) meaning and Provides a symbolic order. Big offers reassurances to other believers. It is a "lifestyle choice" religion, which is dependent on mere irrationality in the world. <br /> <br /> The most "conspiracy the thrillers" problem, from the silly days of Hitakoop's "Topaz", two different spaces to modern rent like "Da Vinci Code" First of all, they are not wrong in proposing "wrong" among "elite" or "best people", but they are wrong in personalization and personalization of social, collective and systemic processes, which mean that it is a question of personal morality rather than just the social structure. Secondly, and most importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that Big Big simply does not exist. <br /> <br /> Some modern "conspiracy thrillers" ("Eyes Wide Shot", "Exsthenes" etc.) acknowledge their lies, accidents, truths and half of the web incompatible. Truth, nothing can be added, truth is not, true and desirable, true and desirable, all invisible, no identifiable ground without zero, but these are mostly film by the intellectual director. <br /> <br /> The oldest is positively compared to this modern "conspiracy the thrillers", "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman". "Marathon Man" is a gradual student (Dustin Hoffman) who weakens his older brother's business (Ray Square), which unfortunately works with spying, guns, double agents, diamonds and evil Nazi dentists. The skydiver Subhas, Hoffman is nice and some of the handsome visuals (Shellsinger) of Chelsea are hit by the release of our Eiffel Tower, but one of the most striking about the film is that it does not intersect its plot lines for 1 hour. Even then, it takes more than half an hour to make sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with a clinical showdown between villains and good people, solving everything thoroughly and explaining. <br /> <br /> "Falcon and Snowman" a little more ambitious. San PÃ¡n and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sold government secret in the Soviet Union. Hutton worked at a civil defense contractor and caused damage to his office and Penny, which is a small-time drug dealer whose KGB is not sold. Due to the disappointment of Penn American government (especially trying to exclude Australian leaders), it works strictly for this money and so secretly sells them because of how their country hates criminal and espionage games. In other words, the film is about conspiracy as a reaction to conspiracies. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" ?? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "Falcon and Snowman" ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman" is even better, the Pen turns on a memorable performance .
