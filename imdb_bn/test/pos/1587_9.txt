On Venice's death, Venice qualified as one of the most beautiful films ever made. When watching, we recognize that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Continual glorious death in Venice is of course; But in another important way, it is an unhappy film. Thomas insults humor and Von Aschenbach's literary career and writes from a distance of output; Its irrational system, level on its level of program, self-aware behavior When tadijo emerges and emotions are created, it is clear that there are fewer concepts underneath their Guild-Edged trophies and have lived their lives carefully. In fact, seeing the 'single' of Tadijo, sometimes Manna calls him, divides into two groups. Aschenbach No. 1 draws attention to a beautiful 14-year-old boy, then processes the process of biddy splicing in intellectual blood pressure as he works in the industry - a 'divine' will work in the industry. But asbank number 2 appears as a stencher, who has taken control of it, then he has replaced the ascendant number 1 asbestos. Like his original face, his sex-dopeljener has to die for human contact with his emotional object - and thus Taziji is a remote ideal remnant. Thomas Price has no mercy for this game. Each of the self-knowledge shred comes very strong and very late; Resistance to sexual flush tension is very great. That means that Venice is covered by diseases, Aschenbach does not mean anything - his game now has high occupancy. When she finally cries under her breath, 'I love you,' she knows that all is lost, and the unreal is waiting. Is this filmable any? Probably, and impossible to look away from Visconti creates a visual source. But there are errors: he and Derby Bogaard have made Aschenchen sympathized; Man, again, no. Aschenbach influences Pov film and we are expected to identify. But no man is scattered anywhere in the screen. Dominant in Bogra is controlled and ridiculously comfortable with ease - but what is the bottom? Bogard's responsive performance has no mooring. Manna writes a character who, in her imagination, is performing seven vel dances, is aware of the invitation to freedom, yet unable, and unwilling to oppose it. Also, Wiscun's screenplay does not actually make any characters - Alfred, a friend of Aschenck - to dramatize the discussion of artists and artists in Mannar. These scenes are difficult to see badly written disasters, and Alfred's illustrating actors. Also, Ascotch is a guild-educated tactical musician, which I think works for film; And options for the novels of Mahelar Symphony's Ashenchek Unfortunately, the great music of the mall has been recorded extremely badly and played very badly. Thus, the death of Venice, such as Wisacandi, gave us hands, it was not a complete success, but its power as a fully visible experience could not be denied. All filmmakers, especially cinematography, want to take a look.
