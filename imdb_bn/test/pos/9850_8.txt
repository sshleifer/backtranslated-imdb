If you do not listen to this movie, but follow the two refugee refugees from America in America from refugee camps in Africa, where they satisfy themselves, they will have success and wealth. Life is more difficult than the state, and the film feels frustrated because it is not working properly. Life seems to be so well captured in many moments because they are so perfect. Whether in the job, at school or in time, two guys, Peter and Santino are very honest with film makers, but some thoughtful comments about life in the state. This is one of the only documentaries I can remember that after it was over, I wanted to go for more than two hours. It may be difficult to find the film because it is not a great distribution, but check out your local "art house" or the independent theater and go to it (side note, if it is already on the video, then you are reading it, it is definitely a rental price). Ratings: 28/40
