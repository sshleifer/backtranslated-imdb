I love this movie a lot. I would get this in DVD I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can not read a written joke on the ward door. I am always amazed that Blankfield did nothing after that. He said Jack and Mr. Hayd made both of them completely believable. <br /> <br /> This movie is damaged by a low budget. (A shocking edit spawned in mid-word and was described in "Siskel and Ebert.") However, there are thousands of jokes, fine gags in fine references, more than compensating. I often find myself quote (or, "I did not find anything to hide"), and, from time to time, completely describes a scenario that matches some conversations. There are at least six scenes among my favorite comedy bits. <br /> <br /> Visitors who have no history of using cocaine can miss many gags. <br /> <br /> "Here, take it." * Driving visuals while closing the window. * "I said, is this seat taken?" "Nassan Burn!" ChapS, Headdress, Jackstrap, and Swimming Fin Visual. Yes, I'm fine. * "I am!" Women are trying to sell 'nuts' and they are trying to sell. * "Barney is going to love this." * "This is my leg, Jack." Black feet say. * "Why do we tell you?" ... "He's on the super market!" * "Ivy!" At the supermarket * Ambulance loading shopping cart in full. * Etc.
