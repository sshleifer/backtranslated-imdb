I got this movie a week after the death of Ichikawa's bride - I think, if there is a way to forgive a great director, then seeing one of his best movies, he will have to raise a glass of wine. Ichikawa was one of Japan's best actresses, but she was not often ignored by her specific style or theme than her contemporary contemporaries like Ozu and Kurosawa. (He was younger than them, but not much). He is one of the directors who deny the absolute theory - perhaps his wife (who wrote the screenplay for this and his other films) is probably responsible for the quality of the movie like him. But at the best of his time he was good as any Japanese filmmaker. In particular, he had great technical expertise, allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. But on the terms of the theme, this movie can be easy - war hell. Not really, its serious hell. <br /> <br /> The fire on the plane does not follow the rules of the general war. There is no real introduction - We begin with humble Tamura, which is regular (although it is meant to be more thoughtful and educated than others) - it is shown at one level that he understands English, but when he clams others ask him how he knows ) Has been ordered to go to the hospital because his unit is already in dire condition. The soldiers are defeated and hungry for death. They are not just army, but only an angry bag group of refugees - hunted by locals, and most of the Americans ignore those who have to fry big fish. The hunger and despair are being carried out on the outskirts of soldiers and mad. <br /> <br /> Typically, it's not all right - it's a funny part (certainly a very black humor). <Br> <br /> Lead me high points of this movie and the outstanding performance of bright photography. Characters in all humanity, but their complete loss of humanity, all very credible. This is a rare movie - which will refuse to remove itself from your head, even if you want to forget it.
