The team is still repeating every day in Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800 hours) and I'm still seeing it! I do not like this team ... I absolutely worship !! Justin is excited to see the former members of this team. Memories come back from the old days, when I was young, sweet. I played 10 very nice to you, but Justin thinks he is following a member of the former A-Team by himself. Of course, this documentary is the only bad thing. Do not look too bad for Justin Melinda Culea ("Amy at Allen"). But Mr. T. It's nice to see who came back. Very bad for him, he will not show up in the party at the end. But the party is very bothered to laugh again and see everyone again.
