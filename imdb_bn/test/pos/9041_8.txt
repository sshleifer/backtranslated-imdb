Can not judge the English language order of a film Faulkner. But they did a pretty good job here. Like Lucas Bouchamp, I portrayed him, as did Chik. Could the film really not go that Beowchamp does not like Negro people, because he was equally vivid. It is not a bad thing, but since the acceptance of the book that I had for the world, (from now on, I thought it was white society's racism that it started and turned into negro society, until she became her attitude. br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is that you can see Yoknapatta County (actually, Oxford, Mississippi) just as Faulkner writes about it (when Faulkner lives The image was created and was written)). It does look very different today. For this reason alone, a watch is worth considering the film being depicted in the backyard of Faulkner's house. A true Faulkner fans must see for sure.
