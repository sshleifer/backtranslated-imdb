One of the most attractive film makers in the past 50 years, Vernaar HeerzG pushed another commercial filmmaker to the limit of the movie. I have been familiar with Herzog for decades and I have never been influenced by man and his work. Last year, I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat amazed at the relatively mainstream of the film, but Herzag could not only make his actor and crew the real forest, but to save the film, but could imagine to save it. Any other filmmaker was amazed about the purity of the filmmaking process, and from the next production, Fictorkaldo was woken up in the cinema's legend. <br /> <br /> Today I was sitting in Fatah Morgan in Hajjag in 1969. Film that can be described as a metaphorical filmmaker postcard. Without finding the actual locations, I think it was shot anywhere in the coastal and desert areas of Africa, a region that once child children, children's civilization, can live on a child's life in the world. These sources, the Biblical concept of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse related to Heroes, are described by the statements described throughout the 79-minute run. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But I think I was a passenger on a deep ride. At the first end, the title is translated as "Miraz" and Herzag translates this translation into multiple airspace commercial jets with multiple repetitions. These images are distorted, their flat-level, drainage, heat waves and light aberrations crushed all over each other by a 3-dimensional lens. The effect has been concluded by me: things do not seem to be <br /> <br /> <br /> FM3 is divided into very distinct chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) Golden Edge. The section one is open with countless, lazy images, where silent, wild visible scenes, rolling dead animals, broken shells of broken crates and abandoned cars gradually separated into the desert sun. These uncomfortable landscapes are ragged, unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the deserted people desert. One time talk before life, the canvas of the earth was empty, and everything was heaven. When describing a simple, pure era, a young boy holding a fox-like creature by his throat is a portrait of a photo exposed to a cold illustration of people's cruel, ruthless attempts to apply an authority over the nature of a portrait. <br /> <br />> We are familiar with the similarities in the next chapter, but the images and the people seem more animated and compact with life and vigor. We've heard of a goggle biologist conversation that's hardly hunted for hunting like a monitor luzard in a living environment. He holds the jumping monitor, his tongue shines on the fly, he describes how difficult it is to catch the animals at 140 degrees. Parallelly well-known and Heroes continues to try the efforts of the efforts of the Sun, Desert and the efforts of the efforts in this harsh state, continuing to explore these concepts through individual paintings. He takes the theme forward that without control, people strengthen their control over their environment and are not always the most beautiful way. <br /> <br /> The last chapter takes us outside the desert blast furnace, and the more familiar Harzg region populated by stupid and stupid behavior. Nobody shows a more effective Symbian relationship with one of the most strange relationships in the world than Her√≥gog - perhaps in this place he feels most at home. Like Erlele Morris, Herzeg likes to choose a position as visually as possible to think of what her camera can do before rolling the film. His next film is with Herzgaz, which can lead to the shooting of the director without the point when most of the directors are shouting. Like Morris, this extended roll pushes the "on" moment behind, when the issues are forced to offer and through the discomfort of overtime, they face some real-life challenges. The most ridiculous portrayal in this chapter is that Herzag is the band of two people playing a strange, polka-like melodrama review in this chapter. The band's drummer wear the same goggles as a biologist, another person is pyrotechnics, begging the question: What's with Goggles? They must add some links to the film, but they have to consider whether there is any profound meaning or significance, or whether it is another example of the fullness of Heroesgame's play. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> ScreenTime, featuring two beautiful song songs "So Long Marian" and "Susan", along with the perfectly scrolling landscapes, joining firmly to the fact that we have really come along for the ride. At the end of the journey, Hurzg comes back one of the many shots that repeat throughout the film: Remote Desert Trance The meeting is filled with a water mirror filled by the distance which is filled with a water mirror. Despite the overall embarrassment of FM, the film's crossendend and the Mirage motif leave you with an optimistic soul, believes that against all contrasts, life will remain steady and will probably be rich. > <br /> The end of writing this post, I had a bloody coup in Hormuz only a few weeks after Saharan We have to mention ephaemake yamerune shot. His legend is true, harjaga and its crew arrested, beaten and imprisoned. Bonds, harjaga skitsosomiyasisa, fell ill and blood diseases. It is difficult to love such a hypnotic and orthodox film like Fatwa; The filmmaker knew that you would honor it more than if you are willing to die for it. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
