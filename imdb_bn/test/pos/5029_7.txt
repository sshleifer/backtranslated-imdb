A former critic said that Travolta stole each of his scenes. Identify the character? It was Vinnie Barbarino, everyone grew up and still a little bit scary, but still desired, oh yes! <br /> <br /> William Hurt and Bob Hosinsinz are frustrated, because perhaps their characters were badly written, or they did not care too much. I could not remember what Baldwin had in Half's role (which can not be remembered) because I lost Halt's incredible talent. <br /> <br /> Andy McDowell is a sweet but not very believable; Partially written. Development of Character Just this film was not a big thing. See it for the trolver, sit back and enjoy.
