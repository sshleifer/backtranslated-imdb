Call immediately to compare Les Amantes Regulators to compare with the Bertolukie film 'The Dreamers', in my opinion, the best movie about Paris's 1968 rebels was created. In fact, director Philip Galler compared his many famous colleagues, sharing the main actor and not even refusing to compare him with a direct copy of Bartoliqui's old film-viewer-eye. And yet, LAR is a different movie, and an interesting one. <br /> <br /> The story line also seems to be known. The film begins with a long view of the 1968 study, perhaps it may be one of the best works. The film is made in black and white, and on the other side the static camera's perspective or the other in the barricade reminds Eisenstein. Then, like the Dreamers, the action shifted to the flat areas of Paris where heroes of the defeated rebellion fell for the arts, smoke, dreams and each other. There is no direct social comment, there is no real interpretation of the revolt background. The film focuses on the story of love between psychology and the main characters in the character. It is like the prediction of the process of transitioning through the generation of 1968, it is true that all participants can not fit or survive. <br /> <br /> The movie is more than the characters. And it is only for the style it will be remembered for. Notable in the black and white film revolutions, but also on the evolution of letters. Many sequences are enhanced by a technique derived from Silent Films, which take long piano tunes. The effect is fine. Still, the length of the film is not just fair, it lasts for more than three hours and I suspect it could be missed in just two hours - I'm sure it's completely the opposite. <br /> <br /> Another aspect to remember about the 20th century France and one of the most important years of world history is to raise the depth and neutrality of Bertolookie's film LAR.
