I love this movie. Not as cool as "50 First Dates", but it must be repeated, especially on rainy days or with a group of girls. Yes, this plot was "cute" and even incredible, but so bad about a good movie. Due to the romance of Josie and his teacher, the drum is so sweet and brother baseball has made a great sense of well-being. With all the junk there, so good about a good movie can the whole family enjoy? Embarrassed to see your kids! Drrew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for one of the most portrayal. This is definitely one of his best roles!
