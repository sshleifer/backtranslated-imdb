Father (78) and I (46) both are seeing today's glance. For a guy known mainly for the serious role, De Niro is a heckuva comic actor. Of course, it helps to play against the image of its past film. Take a 15 minute role to play a role in dealing with media interference, and consider that there is an interesting set of comparison / contrast performance. <br /> <br /> Morifi played her other excellency character Foley sort. Shatna plays herself a potato, a parallel world self who was well-known for the TJ Hawker and not the star tray. <br /> <br /> The picture is interesting to see how the film has commented on the contradiction with reality. Fictional replica in TV and film. Shuttle speech is on the right way to slide across a car hood; Scratch the horror houn finish out of De Niro points. Surprisingly, along with the film's progress, the character of De Niro began to include the realities of TV-police reality in the real world. <br /> <br /> This movie has received inspiration from the source of enthusiasm, so one comment on it derivative. Well, so what? To present satire needs to achieve his humor. And in addition, the film is in the playful moment of originality. For example, I'm sure Wilheln's death method has never been done before. <br /> <br /> There is a quarrel with the reality of the weapon - were those guns not reconsidered? To enter the steel, there were enough germs to enter those bullets. And at the moment of firing the highest level of uterus in a bullet. So .... this tank-killer bullets should be returned to a volley firefighter's drivers. Oh, what's the hack ... this is a mockery. Perhaps the lack of rebuilding of guns is used ridiculously on the B-F-gun. <br /> <br />
