Faxscape is really one of those shows which is all this, great acting, great cast, great writing, set, chemistry, muppets ... it got something other than a house. This fantastic series seems to have been without it all and in the end. The TTPB thinks it is a series of series set sets that seem to be a series, when it is seen by anyone, it is a moving, an epic, love story, which has a last seen. If you have not seen any benefit for yourself on Farsk and DVD 1 will be published in October, then check it out ... and season 2 best! See the recurrence of the Saifai channel to catch and then the new season starts in January January when most of the shows go out to Haitise and make sure. If all is well then we will get to our end!
