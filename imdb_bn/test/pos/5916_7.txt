From Director Billy Wildor (Double Edmnati, The Seven Year Ich, Some Lake It Hot), I see that it is a bit of a built-in and intrinsic film that can be seen. This biography of Charles Augustus 'Slim' Linberberg (James Stewart), who wanted to be the first person to travel from New York to Travel Solo Flight in 1927, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to reach Paris with a small cockpit. The first half hour or whatever is allowed to be done by Linberber, and the construction of the "St. Louis of Spirit" and all necessary preparations are being made. Then the rest exceeded his dangerous journey journey, exceeded fatigue, saw the energy losses near and near the loss of feelings, but he succeeded. Murray Hamilton is cast as Bad Guerney, Patricia Smith's Mirror Girl, Barlettat Frank Mahny, Harry Knight at Robert Korneway, Rock Bond Model / Michael Conley as Dancer, Donald Hall, Arthur Space, Harlan Ward Boedker. And Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough Apparently Linnabar was a little small, so Stewart had a shadow to play him too old, but then again, you can not think of anyone else that could do well. It is Stuart (always as) excellent, Frank Wuxman's great music score and good looks of the Wilander, which is a good little good-looking jewelery aspect. It was nominated for Best Special Effects (this is the only award which was nominated). The number of James Stewart's 100 Greatest Movie Star is 12, he is 100 years, 100 stars - 3 in number, and as the world's seratom actor, he was No. 13. very good!
