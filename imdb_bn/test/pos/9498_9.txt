It is apparently the first movie featuring Gloria Swanson - a film that produces a breakout star. Although he was good at the film, I could not see how remarkably significant this performance was - but, still it is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The rich slob that continually grants it for granted. He cared little for his outfit, ate onions and forgot their anniversary! And, at the same time, Lothario comes to their lives and begins to pay a lot of attention to the gloria, and his evil husband does not give or give reasons for cheating him. Finally, she divorces her husband and marries smooth talk Romeo. However, when the movie could only be an exaggerated melody (it was quite common at the time), but it takes some interesting twists and turns and it's a fantastic and fun movie. It's a standout and memorable one I've seen, not the greatest silent film. <br /> <br /> DVD release from photo entertainment is surprisingly well - with a decent print and music. This was not always true regarding the publication of other images (especially how they conducted the liberation war of Chaplin).
