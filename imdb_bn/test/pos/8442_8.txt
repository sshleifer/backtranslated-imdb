During the liberation war, it was easy to cancel this film as a hyperbola. Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were called "left-handed", but the accidents on the Three Mile Island provided the threat to this fictional play in a threatening context. <br /> <br /> This image works on many levels, takes public utilities and TV shows. . The 1979 TV news featured the infamous "Happy Talk" format (see also "Ron Bergdi") and it shows all its glory here. Gold Anchor's Graeme "CakeWell Wells" (Fund) is a story about a veterinarian who happily makes a living (or is it "Aquarium?") The show's producer and the station manager dispute the content - or its lack - behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some technical flaws. PR Falk (James Hampton) shows Fonda and Douglas the necessary scale model of a pressure water reactor plant manufactured by the Westinghouse. Later, Lemon and Wilford Breamley (Lemons' friends / colleagues, who were diagnosed in duties and loyalty) fought against the sudden crisis of the plant's control room, apparently running a warm-water plant (built by GE). Small points, but curiosity, how much screenliters have got the right to consider. <br /> <br /> Similar to a good drama, the film raises more questions than answers. The real world accident in TMI proves the fundamental basis of the film. The title was originally "Power" for the film and you can see why. Due to the nuclear power-3 dollar gas being ready to return on this day, "China Syndrome" is relevant today as it was today 25 years ago.
