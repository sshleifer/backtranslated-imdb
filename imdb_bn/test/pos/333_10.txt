When I went to the theater, I thought it would be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. How nice! This movie is bright! Emotion is felt out of the whole movie is extraordinary! Mahavahan and Simran's great acting. Beautiful music no. Stainless Steel. Probably the most Tamil movie I have seen in my life. Mani Ratnam has still proved that she is best for making meaningful and heartfelt films. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> A young novelist (Madhuwan) found out about this young story and decided to write a story about him. He and his wife (Simran) decided to accept this little child, but one day he learned that he is not his real father and decided to search for his biological mother. <br /> <br /> This movie is really amazing. How Gemi Ratnam presented the picture is great. <br /> <br /> My rating - 10/10
