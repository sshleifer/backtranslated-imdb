When it was first broadcast at Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound effect on me. It is beautifully portrayed and played. I immediately read books by Mary Webb, and it remains one of my favorite time all the time. Jeanette Macteiro is wonderful as Pru, and I hope to be fully into the scene of the British drama. I think he chose to focus on the British stage instead. <br /> <br /> I hope that this film will be available to us again after a few years (with Tumblebucks) with the success of Genetic Mactiert American. Well, it's not yet released DVD. If anyone sounds there, please make this available again!
