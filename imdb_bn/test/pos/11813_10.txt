A fantastic film about AIDS AIDS. I have seen this photo about 4 times and it is very sad. I can not promise everyone to cry this tears but it's what you want to do. Very emotional and very sad, a course of treatment to see the movie. It shows you the meaning of friendship and love and it's a very great movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think that it will grow up and wonder why my mother always shouted at this. But now I know it's a stunning film that is so original and it is very close to real-life situations, which does not seem to be comparable to any other film. The word can not describe the greatness of healing, you just have to see it.
