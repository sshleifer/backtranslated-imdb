I like this movie. I may be favorable because I love dolphins. However, my 3 and 4 years. The old will sit and watch the whole movie .... It's not the Oscar material, but it's definitely entertaining. Dolphin cinematography is well-done with a beautiful backdrop of sea scenery and sunset. When the flip is "flips" in my favorite scene, Sandy can go out of the water after hit the head. This is a respectful fun moment which makes me laugh. On the other hand, the harmful banners of the killer boatman (forgot his name) are a bit difficult. And shark scenes are far from reality. Q: Does dolphin really make much noise? Or is there some serious dubbing happening? Bottom Line: My kids like it and keep it recycling through our VCR.
