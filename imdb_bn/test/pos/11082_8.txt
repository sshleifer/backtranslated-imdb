These two governments, most of the CIA, started selling secret information in the Soviet Union in 1975. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the views of people of two people, and instead of glorifying their growing personal problems (especially their character as traitors in America with the character of Penn, damages the credibility of the film in the United States, which is no doubt. Slowly became more cautious and finally frustrated and their lanes Paranoid as a drag and deep dig deeper into the treacherous region. Daltons became more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin, because he became scared, and on more desperation to maintain control over his condition, he has no control over it? ? On which he is already having problems with law. Reasons to guide the children and the people of Dalton to their way of living It is well illustrated and it can be assumed that espionage against its own country, even if properly thought, is only the main problem and the destruction of life? <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They depict deep depth and reality. <br /> <br /> - Acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is interesting, and of course, based on actual facts, it seems to add something. <br /> <br /> <br /> - Nice set. <br /> <br /> - The Soviets working with the children and the dolton are very well illustrated, and not only on the growth or bad consideration to show them bad. <br /> <br /> - The music is okay, though nothing is perfect. <br /> <br /> - Sound emphase a little while? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With the United States and the Soviet government creating age problems, could his life be dangerous ?? But it was not raised in such a way that it should have been considered.

The studio and the producers did not see American viewers accepting two American traitors in a comment by American viewers. Thankfully, it is illustrated and portrayed with high quality and quality. Of course, it is not heroically depicted of anti-brave heroes? Some other young people have made serious mistakes in their life's judgment. As such, it became a very human drama and one very well and very credibly portrayed.
