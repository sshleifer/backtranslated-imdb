I did not care what the reviews said anything, this movie was fun. The thing about this image is that you can not expect anything other than entertainment. This is not some intellectual comedy, it's a cute Popcorn movie. Three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. A standout, a former TV policeman, with Castro supporting herself, came with the character of Russo to train police to "TV police". Those are by far the funny scene. Check out this movie if you want to relax and laugh.
