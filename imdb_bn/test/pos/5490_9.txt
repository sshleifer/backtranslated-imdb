I was watching Perfect Storm, and thought about another Wolfgang Peterson movie which is very good. Although does not really depend on the true story, but the Inline of Fire should make a film. It has a terrific story with a great cast. As an extraordinary killer of Malcovitch, he won an outstanding Oscar for his extraordinary Oscar. Eastwood is as good as a tortured secrete service and ROSO is easy to eye. If you do not see it, rent it explicitly or as I bought it. Certainly one of the best crime thrillers of the last decade. 9/10
