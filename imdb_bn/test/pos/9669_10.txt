Commented on me before. The show's comic genius, the most intrinsic show ever 3 reasons why Because 1, flashbacks are fun, those who do not have anything to do with the story care, they give me so much laugh that it hurts and this is not a good comedy program idea? There are no ideas of just funny who think this is not funny. They are random, who care, it's a Tv Show up what you can do with what you want to do, and people are not realistic, it's not a cartoon, it's animated. Reason 2, Jokes usually are usually sunny, Seth Macfarlane, and other writers, Sueyuuju funny, all the fun of celebrities from Star Wars references, I love them all. And because 3, the lines of the story are only brilliant and funny, they set up all jokes with their insane nature and perky, just all the more funnier. <br /> <br /> I caught a late night on BBC2 and never returned, I have all 7 seasons, plus type movie stuff (Stuvi Griffin: Antoild Story), I have many T-shirts, posters and my collection Is still growing. I never received any TV show before but this was so funny I was just about to get everything. See only season 3 and believe me that you jumped for life, made fun show ever and I hope it will not end!
