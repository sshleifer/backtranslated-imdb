I have been thinking of a song for several years "just a castle's forehead" ("Dancing Chivalry, just a couple in the castle in the air"). I could not find the song, but I think it was supposed to work with cartoon bug. I located a reference to the movie on the web. When I watched the movie at the age of 9 in Logania PA theater. I was happy to see this with Guy Lamborro (I'm a tall fan) and singer Kony Gardner. And then see that it is produced by Fleisher Bros. "Gulivars's Travels" (also fondly remembered) has featured another very good full-length cartoon. The songs were also associated with Hogie Carmichael and Frank Losser who are very good. Wonder, I think of film, music, and colorful animation. As a full-length musical, it should be remembered as a movie which is the best of first full-length musical instruments. Now I remember, the plot might not have jumped the globe, but it was very well presented and it makes it easy to see abd lovely movies.
