This film's philosophical, ardent voice transforms it into a kind of form. I'd give it 10 stars for it alone. That's saying, though, what hit me with special power, I probably, wrongly, to be his art guide. Among the interior shots, a lot of color mixes are available based on the number of muncell color models progress and supplementary jokes. It may make the film possibly non-communal in contemporary eyes, but to me, it is as beautiful as a beautiful beauty. I think this movie is truly unique for this quality, and for some reason it achieves a full, careful, digital recovery. Fox, are you listening?
