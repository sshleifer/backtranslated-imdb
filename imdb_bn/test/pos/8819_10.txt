An amazing little production. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Actors have been selected very well - Michael Shane simply does not "get all Polaris", but he also got all the voices Pat! You can see seamless editing really directed by reference to the Williams diary entry, it is not only worth watching observers but it is a terrific written and performed piece. One of the great master's comedies and one of his life is a skilled production. <br /> <br /> Reality comes to home with really little things: the guard's imagination, which becomes harder rather than using traditional 'dream' tricks. It is very well done with our knowledge and our senses, especially the Orton and Haloil and sets (especially with the decoration of each surface of the Halleywall with their flats).
