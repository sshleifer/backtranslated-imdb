A story about love and hatred, tragedy and happiness, and maximum maximum, friendship set at very attractive times in the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in history, you are mentally involved and you will be forced to wait for the next episode. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the welding was fantastic. Many superstars have appeared in small comes, leading roles are handled by a large array of gifted wax - Kirsty Eli and Terry Garber should be mentioned here - this is a great example of simply producing a TV. <br /> <br> Do not forget about the low-legibility of the painting OD Kilbourne :-)
