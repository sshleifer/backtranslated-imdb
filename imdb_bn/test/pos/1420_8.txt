A brief history of time is not only a documentary on the outset and the end of the public and reality, we know it is a story about a genius known as a man and Stephen Hawking. It reflects stories of change in the history and time of universal history. The interviewer's documentary / editing style style starts and ends with a fast fade of black. Like penitence between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you a strange feeling, such as the view point of Stephen Hawking and the camera's eye. Running time is a little more than an hour. This is a short story, again, its content can be talked for day and day. An interesting and proud story.
