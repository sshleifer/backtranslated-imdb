Although filming is about philosophy and real life, this film is quite perfect: NUOVOMONDO has talked about immigration from the beginning of 900 in Italy, but immigration / immigration is still a focus when it still speaks. <br /> <br /> This is not a dream movie. <br /> <br /> Additional level acting, Charlotte Gainsberg is a star. A good challenge for Academy Awards 2007 <br /> <br /> After the first series, "Resiro", a psychic but very intelligent film, learned the lessons of Filinir and Taviani to name just two Italian masters. <Br <br /> <br /> Plot is debating, giving proper guidance, maybe a little less melodrama would be more effective. <br /> <br /> If Elmodovar's Bhola (next year challenging for the Academy Award) is always the bright director, NUOVOMONDO, because of his good efforts as a European film for American scenes. <br /> <br /> And it!
