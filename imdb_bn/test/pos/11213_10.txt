People have to learn what's on the screen. This is a great film that is based on the collection of detailed information related to this slow, carefully involved, which helps to establish personality of these two personality. The country's cousin Yusuf (Emin Toprak) has been described by the fear of talking to the successor of the woman. She has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young girl and lose all of them. Bachelorhood has been there for several decades before and probably also unemployment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mahmud isolated case He came out of the small town with hard work (we imagined), and his disagreement with the hairdresser like Yusuf was clear (he left the crumbs on expensive carpet!). We have shown a group of friends talking about Tarkowski among other things, and we think Mahmut feels remorse - but only a little sorry - his work has become commercial for years. The bay between the cousin brothers only gets larger and larger. The mouse trap theme is surprisingly bright, it comes with Yusuf's condolences and confusion and Mahmut's cold bloody problems. <br /> <br /> I reminded both of the Nuts' driving movies: Les cousin by Chabrol (Rich child with Hitlerian sweetheart directed by Brialy always thinks of me) and Spiderman Women Kiss (Why William Hart Why Does It All Mean Can not understand it). Nuri Bil Ge Sylan now takes her place among the active managers. I hope he will come to rely on partners instead of managing, writing and shooting his movies in the future.
