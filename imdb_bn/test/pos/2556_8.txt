A friend came to me with this movie and at first I was hesitant, the pace of the movie started so slowly that it was boring at the beginning. But the life scene was interesting, like watching it than watching. <br /> <br /> It was easily stunning throughout the film, how the way the director's life scenes were becoming confusing for the way, but was extremely helpless. It's like understanding the real life of a living person rather than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Alejandro Polanco and Miss Ishar Gonzalez have done so well in their role that it is like telling our own stories. Indeed they used their real name in the movie.
