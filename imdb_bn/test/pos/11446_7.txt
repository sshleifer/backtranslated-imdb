Much more than any other movie of that time, Demonstration Knits Brainless and Extremely Enjoyable Awesome Pastes. It loads nasty make-up effects, looking fantastic (and horny) and shameless fun with adorable clich√©-stuff loads. A group of animals, led by the Alternative Angela, carries an eerie urban legend which celebrates Halloween in a abandoned funeral home. It starts normal and "innocent" with all dancing, drinking and temporary flirting among the younger ones, which can not control their hormones, but the soon-to-be-released giant is present with the guest. In the most fascinating way you have seen, the rest of the cast may return to blood just like a living organism. Finding a better balance between the highlighted camp and atmospheric horror of this film that makes this film look better than the most shocking 80's horror films. Some sequences are really vague and the Demo Night supplies with a nice tone of funeral room setting. Director Tenny sets the set piece (coffin, a crematorium, continuous dark hallways ??) and his young, passionate cast definitely loves what love they are involved in. The effect of gorgeous make-up effects by a whole team of artists and designers surely poked out love, eyes and crushed skulls in large quantities of absolutely dominant parts of love and horror fanatics! Ultimate brilliant but Linna Quigly's invisible lipstick technique! This nymphomaniac bimbo shakes a whole tube of lipstick in her nipples and continues her sexually assault spree! Awesome! Demon got two signals in the 90's, and although they are still unable to check out, they give more attention to the comedy than the cold.
