I especially like the end of this movie - I really felt what the letters felt, which I think is a sign of good instruction. I was a lizard about how the new store rent came out - though its character was probably considered "small". <br /> <br /> I was also impressed by the fact that in the dark subject, free nudity, free from prejudice and violence. Everyone can be contacted (often good) by what is said to be unhealthy, sex and misconduct, but it seems to be truly "passionate" for movies and actors. Film producer Kudos for that.
