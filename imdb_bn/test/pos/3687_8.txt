Minor Spoils <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Bassley (Cathy Betts) is a housewife married to forty-five year old lawyer McBaceley (Dan Aikroyd) and violent and psychological leftist daughter, Mody (Medvedith Eaton). Grace praised Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who will present a TV show in Chicago, and give five marks in the first row in the TV show. Kate calls for mourning and wins a ticket, when Mac requests for divorce at once, claiming that her life is too neutral. Grace became depressed, and when she went to the room, the audience said that a Chicago serial killer, who used a crossbow, killed Victor Fox. With broken heart, he decides to fly from Victor Fox's funeral to England. There, he realized that he was gay and became friend of his former partner Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly back to Chicago, trying to find the killer. This movie has a delightful, original and weird dramatic comedy, bizarre character. In the context of July Andrews and Barry Manuelo, and with a joke with Nicholas' best-known poem 'Do Not Lik Na', it has a huge potential for a civil-film, when Madi wore a red rain dress in the suburbs of Chicago's suburbs. At the beginning of the song 'Hitcoo Railway' with Jonathan Price, it's wonderful. I repeated it four times and again. Casey has done a great performance, highlighting Cathy Betts, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and unknown Meridian Eaton. Actually, this movie is an excellent entertainment. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Amar a Toda Probe' ('Proof to profit')
