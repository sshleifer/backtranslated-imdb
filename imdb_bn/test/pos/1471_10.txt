Well, I saw yesterday and it was much better than any other brilliance of VH1, it was much worse than before, but you can see lots of South African stuff looking at old stocks. It's fun compared to this documentary that selfish greedy snobs are not the makers who work and spend all the time fun or relaxing (which kinda is adulterous because they spend quite hard on the show), such as Trey and Matt Portrays. <br /> <br /> It also shows the animation process of making episodes in South Park, interviewing more character in character with more voice acting characters and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of South Park then I highly recommend you this.
