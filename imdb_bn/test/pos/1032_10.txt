President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing in the world that history you do not know. Seven years ago, Richard Robinson was awarded a spineless "Push Pulitzer Prize Winner", a seven-part production miniseries of the BBC, "Oppenheimer", who designed and produced arms in the nuclear era, was studying a character. , Joining state science and technology permanently (and, in particular, the army), does not just make history, but changes the world forever. <br /> <br /> no production Casting is nothing but a miracle; It is not only the main characters, but also the remarkable resemblance to those picturized in the secondary characters, especially Sam Waterstein, the title role of US physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, who is in Los Alamos, NM, the laboratory Was personally selected); Manel Redwood as O'Leilly Leslie and Groves, who supervised the entire Manhattan Engineering District (the official name of the project); As David Suchet and Oppenheimer's ultimate generosity as a physicist, Edward Teller (after 40 years, Ronald Reagan shook his ear and our Strategic Defense Initiative - "Star Warsaw ") and John Sheldon as a key opener Came by. The details are excellent together throughout the summary. <br /> <br /> Part Thriller, part love story - and lastly a tragedy, this series is a chapter of world history - and science - we will not forget. Maximum recommendation <br /> <br /> (Note: Visitors who enjoy this series will enjoy Jacob Burnsky's 13-part series "The Assent of Man" and Michael Frane's "BBC Film" Copenhagen.)
