This movie is complex and interesting in many ways. It is a non stop stop of emotions and forbidden matters. Sex and love Men's sexual abuse, physical abuse of women, sexual abuse of children, new ways of religion in real life, and tied together with all very raw and strong blues music. <br /> <br /> I promise you that if you sit within the first 20 minutes you will get all the tie between the characters and the better. And the last will be more happy than you can expect. The song is awesome, the author is strong and it's brilliant to be played from everyone. There are some great features in the <br /> <br /> and DVDs, including those featuring Samuel Jackson's guitar and background blues. <br /> <br /> This film is not for children and I even warn thirteen kids.
