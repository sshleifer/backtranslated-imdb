I saw this photo with my mother in September. I was expecting a good movie, and I saw a nice one. This is my most treasured movie now. It did not leave me after I left the theater. The situation of this movie reminds me of my late grandmother. Merrill Strip and Rene Gelweger were equally incredible. This film has helped me understand how important family relationships are. Rent it I can not recommend it enough.
