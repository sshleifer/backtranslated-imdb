Bobby and Mikey are two young boys who came across the country to start a new life with their divorced mother. Immediately after living in the family, "The King" is married to their mother, especially to Bobby for the insulting father. So Bobby decided that he would "fly away" from the abuse of his birthday. <br /> <br /> This movie, especially the abuse scenes, was difficult to see. It was difficult to insult an innocent, curious little boy and frighten the naughty, and withdrew the young man. Acting is excellent <br /> <br /> I shouted from the last half of the movie. There were some interesting scenes in it like Monster Brew and a dog found in a pop bottle. <br /> <br /> I do not suggest a little kids to look at it. This is a movie which was painful to watch and it really has gone really far.
