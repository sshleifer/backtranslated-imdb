As a big fan of Dostevsky, I was always frustrated with the half-time attempt to achieve Russian romantic aesthetics of Hualiyas - in this case, as Dhul Brenner Dmitry Karamajov. I thought the whole problem was the decision of the poor counter, but then I saw Jhul as a Major Survey and changed my mind. When working with an intelligent script, she was suddenly alive and she was an ambitious, sexy and conflicted person who wanted to be a Naurotic Russian Officer! So he was a better Dmitri than Major Surov as May Dmitry. But for this reason, the author Toby is actually like a Russian officer in conflict with the Russian officer, as the line of a conflicting Russian officer, which is worthy of real literature, and has real money and paths. For example, people offer music, he laughs, "You hear a person crying in the dark and if you listen carefully enough, you know that he is crying." You are surprised, Lady Ashmore, despite what you have heard, the tractor and Marxism are the only Russians Not the only thing, there is always time for the song. <br /> <br /> Bright !!
