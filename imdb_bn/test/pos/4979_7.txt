John Pearl is a former union officer who sells his farm and plans to have a land on Wilckson's in Anchor. The problem is that the price is low and when they begin to betray Perish and his staff, his heart changes, especially when things are brutal for bad. <br /> <br /> After watching this one basically I had a sense of frustration, mainly because that cast was cast. When you are Edward G. in the same movie Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stenwik got you, hope you find a story and script that can be excel from. Sadly, they do not get the opportunity to produce a Western classic that is worth reconsideration, or do I expect it to be a disrespect? Well, I was sleeping in it and decided to think more about the picture. I think yes, it is true that actors seem to be able to get a better job from a good story, when everything is said and done, a plot that is milked for its value and then something But The Voilant Man is still an extraordinary movie which was not seen in the ruthless perspective. <br /> <br /> It's cool like Eskimo's nose like Green Ford Parish, and Bobs Stanwick is always cool while playing. A bitch because she's good at it. When Eddie G, when used to stay in the West, what is fine in the written part. Robinson, who resigned in the last minute when first choice like Lee Wilkison was injured, was injured by Broderick Croftford, he has changed most by the creators, even with Satan Wade Mattlock (Richard J.Cell) and Judith Wilson (a bright Diane Foster) Get something to keep the impression. But for this, Robinson's cratch "bad man" is the least memorable for the right reason. <br /> <br /> It's not ashamed of the action and guns, it's a twist and almost Shakespeare's tragedy, the film of Radolf Matte has topped Mundane, all of it nicely made by Benoit Guffey's stunning artists. Alabama's Lone Pine has been used in many western movies [see for more of its magnificent use now from Seven Men}}, but here the goffi is really reflected and makes every eye spectacular. The HeelCent Man is not a great Western picture and probably could give an adaptation to Mattel's fame, better than Donald Hamilton's [The Big Country] novel. But for every blasphemy and animosity I was personally with it, it really found two more reasons to really like it, so it must be confirmed, it is sure. 7/10
