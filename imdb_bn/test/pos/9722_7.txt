Despite its breeding, the most interesting thing about this series is not animatron or puppet, which is more charming, a little more than a favored, at least in the story I saw, a short story. In fact, although I accept it, the main pleasure of the event is the story of the oldest art story. <br /> <br /> <br /> A story about the story, sitting by fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. One winter day, hungry and poor, he threw out a royal kitchen by the nasty cook, stains a colleague beggar. This next in story teller giving them a nice soup. Angry, Cook asks the king to allow the dog to dig, but he is pleased with Starlet's intelligence, the princess offered him 100 years of rescuing, he should tell the king a new story: If he fails to do so, he will take him in the dog's hand Will give <br /> <br /> The story may be outdated, but it is said to be with the great guru. Anthony Mingler's script is astonishingly dramatic (enjoying as a playwright), malicious, and funny, with some annoying concerns, such as fear for the soul, or self-production of the culture of the story, which is related to ideological energy continuity. For a children's program, it is intelligent self-reactive (new verbal culture with new meaningless culture about film); Despite Americanized Style, there is a charming feeling of medieval explosion, its gravity and arbitrary terrorism as well as its magic and power.
