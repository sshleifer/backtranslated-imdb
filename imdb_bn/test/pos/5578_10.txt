I heard about this series in 2001, which was one of my friends recording off every week on television. I have never been bothered to monitor even though I have met the series with the magazine, which I have seen now and then in bookstores. I recently bought one of the DVD series and became addicted to this fascinating and original series. The first letters seem to be unlike, but how fast they grow and develop into integrated energy. They start taking care of each other, it becomes easy to care for what happens to them (note that this is just a TV series and they are fictional). <br /> <br /> But it's not a PC World Star Trek and so each character shows a good feature when they each have their own flaws and demons that they have to deal with. Combined with a variety of storytelling, personalized story lines make one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences that I have never experienced. I absolutely enjoy watching interacting with each other. <br /> <br /> We have portrayed this strange new world with the eyes of astronaut John Crichton and he is learning and being different from other galaxies, strange alien creatures, beside different cultures, being victimized by a character that feels him dead And being considered inferior by his colleagues, we can easily relate to his feelings. Since she uses her surroundings, it's a pleasure to see the audience and her sympathetic, strong-minded and brave character. <br /> <br /> I saw only seven consecutive episodes of the Ferscope season and are looking forward to progressing through the season two four and mini series. Maybe one day we all can enjoy the season five. Highly recommended and well-priced as well as time set as well as viewing. Buy and Enjoy! 10/10.
