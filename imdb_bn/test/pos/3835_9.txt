When Romulans arrive, they will not receive gifts; No, they fight with them - fight and win. As it is known to this episode, it was a redox in the fifties of the war film "The Enemy Belo". The obvious difference is that instead of battleships and a submarine (or an American destroyer and German U-boat), it is involved in lethal combat games, it has two stars in outer space. In the Trek history, about 100 years ago, according to this episode, the world was involved in the war of romulan. After the collision of almost 5 years, a suspension brings us and the border of the Romulan empire into an agreement and organization of the neutral region. Now, on this Stardard, the agreement seems to be broken, because we are being attacked and destroyed by vital energy weapons. Yes, the Romulans have returned, they are testing their new war toys, and Kirk will now earn his salary: he must make a decision that will affect the sector of the galaxy, to identify how to avoid it ... Oh, I know Not - a interstellar war, perhaps? <br /> <br /> I think this episode makes it so effective that it does not move away from the deadly battle of war, as someone would expect the only TV episode of the 60's - especially a episode of science fiction. For the amount of war crimes, Kirk is sitting with his chief officers, like the best war movies, it is very intense and disgusting. The authors and actors are not kidding here: this is a preparation for a terrible conflict, perhaps the start of another year's long battlefield. In the final analysis, Kirk's objective is to put this war zone on only two ships - but it is also dangerous and involved in possible casualties. In fact, I believe this episode keeps records of the death of the ship's record. At the beginning of this episode, we can see that the destruction of warfare, such as the war, can be safely protected outpost. Then start the game of cats and mouse fighting between the enterprise and the Romulan ships - the biggest conflict we have seen on the big screen is thrilling. Of course, if you are not in war movies, then you have to look for other things to appreciate this episode. <br /> <br /> How this episode raises more just what and what are the Romulans - it is a sort of an electrical shock Now there is more inter-caste conflict in our enterprise bridge - the war has made some people worse. Due to the still nasty attitude of this future nation, the tension has even been extended - Kirk has a hand in hand. I think a weakness in the story makes it a little easier to confuse the problem. On the side of the romulan, actor Lennard RÃ¶llellan made the first appearance of the Trek universe as Commander; Captain Kirk or Captain Pike's flip side, he plays a great role, can take your pick, look a little more spoken. Surprisingly, his character is not hungry for war as we hope, another eye is open for this episode. The actor will later bring the sire of the universe back to his father, so if he is not versatile, there is nothing. This is the first appearance of letters like Roaming that is usually seen as its best shot. They later showed "The Enterprise Event".
