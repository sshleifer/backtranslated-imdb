Recently found in DVD (11/11/08), Sevaro Perez's film ... and The Earth Did not Gilv (1994) is one of the most famous and discussed novels of Chicano literature. Thomas Reverer ... y no se lo trag√≥ la tierra / ... and The Earth That Devour Him (1972) is still recognized by most critics and critics as a classic chicone novel. Originally written in Spanish and written in English in South Texas, Rivera's novel continues to be an essential presence in Chichenko's literary landscapes. <br /> <br /> The Perez movie is originally created as a highly rated American Playhouse PBS production that takes some time to be released from the DVD. Only this thing can be astonished because its high quality is not a problem. Film, and now DVD, as far as I know, the only cinematic adaptation of any chicnic novel and obviously the incredible stability of the world. This cinematic version is particularly ethnic, even in general, I maintain, especially a deep deep root nervous attack. Perhaps the suspicions about the world may be raised because it is very "ethnic", very distracted from the mainstream American mainstream, very "foreign" industry India, which is limited in economic resources. However, in Perez's artistic version, my opinion effectively combines effectively, artistically, and creates an intensely illustrated collection of Chicano Migrant Collection, which focuses on everyday family life. Until its completion with relatively limited financial resources, its lovely cinematographic work and hunting music goes far beyond its available funds. The artist's (or DVD) artist reveals the price only to see the film. <br /> <br /> briefly, ?? And the world is indifferent to the blue-nature of sadness, distress, and chikniko migrant workers because they follow crops in the north from South Texas to Minnesota in 1952. Local priests beat these chicnic workers, bless the extra-broken vehicles who are unable to find work in this area and their agricultural standards must be followed. Uttar Pradesh migrant workers. This chiconi collectivity, like Jods of the Depression-era of Sticknback wine, constitutes an epic tide driven by economic needs, a survival of survival, and a disappointing disappointment and ultimately a little flick. A tribute to this people of the world, a collective hero, the DVD is centered on a focal family, and especially a symbolic family, a boy, perhaps twelve or a young hero among them. This work then works as a bildungsroman. Finally, the feeling of identifying the audience is generated through the experience, subjectivity and drama struggle. Poverty, separation, child labor, sickness (death of sunscrok and pregnancy), discrimination, absence of school (actually from the seed of inequality is spent in a lovely, peaceful grave by the son's son) Symbolically Even worse, the problematic conflict between the young man and his mother is beyond the socio-economics and political conflicts, deep into the psychology and physics. In a noble but artistically struggling struggle, the youth fight with their mother, a primitive Mexican-American traditionally, representative of God's will, prayer, resignation, comfort and recognition. The rebel youth can not believe in a God who will allow such evil and sorrow to visit them. How can God be so cruel, he asks, why his younger sister is certainly innocent, came down with serious illness in the field? At this point, the boy must overcome the barrier obstructed by poverty and discrimination. Now the problems include death, suspicion, and despair, and lack of money. And he has some resources? The power of character, its own power, its intelligence, and a strong survival instinct. Feeling the need to achieve this noble but artistic struggle, the unnamed youth, the central personality, the feeling of his lasting needs, the superior feeling of his meaning, and the audience hopes that this is an innovative and powerful life-style that is a chiconos and inspiration of others. <br /> <br /> <br /> This stringent battle uses a plotted device in the main role, which combines the main work: the absence of migrant workers from Mexico who die of their death No trace after this, even though this DVD is not with Mexico but Mexican-American migrant workers are also highly accomplished: pain and frustration; A search; A project is a focus; And ransom? Under all the prescribed social-economic and religious conditions, under free will. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many of his awards are confirmed. Producer Paul Espinosa is well-known and likewise respected for his work. The 1994 film is truly rewarded and qualified: the first place to be the favorite of the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; First place in the Cairo Film Festival; And many other worthwhile prizes. <br /> <br /> According to me, this movie and DVD, Perez has made the world the best chiconi film.
