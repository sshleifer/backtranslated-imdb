I have to accept a copy of the Bofors Cup that it is not really fun to think about !! It's good !!!!! Charlie Williams ... ate your heart. Match fixing ???? Never! Sloping the pitch at 45%? Who is Ronny and Ragy? George Best? Coach driver who thinks Potterfret in South Wales (that's all Ponty This and Ponty) of Barry Mason (Team Healey's) lucky cup hat !! (She is not that hostage) Sugar plate elf ????? Confused ???? See it again The innovative use of real footage with Bostock players was brighter and the producers should be proud to provide us a masterpiece. ITV Let viewers and yourself do a favor - show it again !!! Please>
