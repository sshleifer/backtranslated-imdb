<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a filmmaker and it is one of his very good works. And although this does not misunderstand many and is of course low, it is considered as one of the best movies of all time and I have to agree. In 1968, no one has done anything like that before, and there is no one from it. It was then an amazing event of a special effect, and it is not surprising to see how its effects are affecting today. About 40 years the film looks awesome! CGI people take notes. Using large-scale and realistic light, Kubrick sometimes made some of the special effects on celluloid. This approach has resulted in almost universal transfer of space due to the atmospheric shilling which is responsible for the music and realistic sound effects. I can not think of any other movie where you can not do anything in space, as it really is. Space is not only the inefficiency of the realistic word, it is used smartly as a tool for establishing mood and it works flawlessly. <br /> <br /> There are other reasons as well as other reasons for diverse special effects that are part of the establishment of film feeling. Praise the music, all the classical, what the eyes are watching, and you feel the significance of the journey of human beings through the evolution of space travelers from the sky. <br /> <br /> The story, though simple, deep. Continually, several mysterious black monoliths were discovered and originally triggered some incident in the film. What are they Where did they come from? What do they do The question is asked during the development and all the questions asked to find a way out. Though most people come with a general idea of ​​what happened in the story, but everyone has to decide their decision. In any way, a deeper solution decides to answer the results of this question. It is not fully explained until it is left, but in some directions it is. Experience it for more explanation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who have little attention spans do not need to apply. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, an innocent opponent's HL 9000, computer identity. A machine does not hold such a cool screen appearance. Which reminds me, there is a surprisingly little dialogue for such a deep ambition and a movie with execution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> is a personal favorite. Everyone should see this image at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
