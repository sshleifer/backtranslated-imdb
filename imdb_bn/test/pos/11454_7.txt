In the 80's, the decade was largely considered, among which the fun is decided to have fun. Sometimes, there were certain brains behind it (for example "Evil Dead II", "Cripps of Night" and "Living Dead of Return Dead") and then there were movies that were stupid but there was a specific low rental attraction and beer and friends Was perfect for a night with. Films like "Pieces" and "Blood Dinner" offer a small amount of money in the 80's and 90's, making the rental decorations clever, intellectual, or technical, but lots of silly entertainment. Kevin Tenny's 1988 film "Night of the Demons" is a tradition-stupid, poorly played and not the main bone of its body, but if you do not have a good time, it's a humiliating one. <br /> <br /> This plot is so easy to find that it came from 80: a group of mobile phones played by a group of actors in their mid-20 minutes, decided to go to a house thrown by an Angela (Mimi Kimcked) in the Hill House and Suzanne Took it. Skin Queen legend Linna Quigley.) Well, Angela and co. Decided to throw a s√©ance. Will Arnett's "arrested developments" character will be called a "huge mistake" because a giant energy soon takes up Angela and begins to get it along with others. <br /> <br /> Take "The Evil Dead", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", and the dead girls on your average mobile phone, throw them on a blender, and get the "Giants Night" you get. The film is original but some other, and indeed, it is not a good movie. The whole thing is a lot of derivative, acting terrible, jokes often flattened, characters are annoying (especially the character of Stugi) and the plot holes are numerous. That way, it's still a lot of fun. Then why <br /> <br /> One thing, makeup and gore effects are pure, with some really memorable moments (especially a nasty and odd bit bit with lipstick tubes only) which are really out there. Sometimes it feels very serious if it rarely, with the exception of some terrible puns, it does not waste time on the audience with the direct drama and winking self awareness. Plus, the whole enterprise has a certain power and enthusiasm that it is almost impossible to resist. Yes, this is not something special, but it also knows, and it can not be proud of the issue. This is a stupid party horror movie, and it does not pretend to do anything else. <br /> <br /> This may not be a classic, but "Demons of Knights" is the perfect example of junk food. It may not be very memorable or original but sometimes you do not want a fancy beer. Sometimes you like a Budweiser.
