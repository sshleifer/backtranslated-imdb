My count as those who are happy to see no hesitation in this episode. Poor people said. Watson does nothing for me, because he just throws down his every scene. Zap is often required for storytelling as official representation, and little fine is fine for Lemon Spices, but Hastings sneaks in painfully. Slow to overnered over different episodes. If I had to sit in a vacant place "Oh, I say there!" I'll take a gas pipe. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, you get more Poirot stories, better Poirot. Each line for hashing is taken away from the pirate. And I have never read a book, so I do not really see Christie's character. Many visitors / critics seem to have a problem distinguishing movies from books. If you want a written book, read it. I do not see the time of watching the television version if you know what will happen next. Do not anticipate the theater - do not expect a duplication.
