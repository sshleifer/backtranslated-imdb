The original story and fun compelling character went well for a teen girls' sleep party party (2 times now). I liked it, it was fun and quickly moved, no annoying painted scene. It's violent and it's a little language (though most of it is covered). This is a great movie. David Stratland was a terrific actor. Ron Eldhed gave an amazing performance. I watch it with girls every time.
