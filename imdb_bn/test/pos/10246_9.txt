A Japanese gem, where most of the world's best movies are being made today. Stylistically, this is not all that special. It's about taking a life of just about a common drama (with some comic overturned) people. Yuko Tanaka plays the 50-year-old spinster, famous for playing Princess Manoo, character Lady Eboshi. She feels proud of her health, spending her morning every day, she supplies milk on and down the steep hillside of Nagasaki. After completing this part time work, he worked as a clerk for a grocery store (known as the S-Mart, his regular work, which was created by the Darkness Fan Gogol). A 50-year-old man lives on his milk, whose wife is dying. It has milk women and men, a child service worker, date of high school, and each definitely has some other still a crush. The film actually has some major story problems. When the screen writer actually wants to unify two unfamiliar lovers, he uses a superb incredible douse ex machining technique. The climatic order is also really forced. But most of the movies are two small letters as well as many side-characters are beautiful and small. The film has several sub-types that seem to be ultimately weighing the film, but it will end without ending. I think the best thing in this movie is the heartening act of Tanaka as the only milk woman, who resigned herself to stay alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problem was, the film mostly exchanged them.
