I saw this because my cousin is an extra in the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that the loud and rudicic liberal message wanted to have fun in the movies, but in the end none of those movies were finished. Also, somewhat in the closing side of humor, Joan Cusack was too much for me, and someone owed a timeline to the Oscars. Yet, like kiss scenes, enough wedding moments, like wedding scenes, and the principals' view was more for this enjoyment. Always as well as the Kline, but for me, real wonder was Selck, I'm not big fan, but here pokes nicely fun.
