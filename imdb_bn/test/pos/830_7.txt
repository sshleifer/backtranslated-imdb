I enjoyed it. You go there, I said again. I even bought this movie in DVD and enjoyed it a few more times. Call me as an old but I like movies like Die Hard 4, which holds the box office and gets critical acclaim, because some of your old people save America. Van Damm is a guy of his age (47 I think), that gives kicks a kickboxer that reminds Kicks. If you like old school action and blasts, then watch the movie. One of the best works of this Van Damme <br /> <br /> I miss the chance to see our old school action stars on the big screen, because Van Dam and Steven Sigal have been releasing the theaters where I live.
