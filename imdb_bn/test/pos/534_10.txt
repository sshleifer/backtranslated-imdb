At the age of 15, I enjoyed this shake !! More about the character n August than most of the I My mother is not weird like Adele, but the feelings of loneliness are the same. This movie is perfect in the upcoming aspects, and with the addition of Natalie and Susan's performances so many links that I've seen the best screen disc in a few years. Their chemistry brings life into character, they become real people! Anyone I hope to get away will recommend this flick. Because there are a lot of people who want to be "somewhere but here" And if you can, watch this movie with your best friend or your mom. Tears that blend around everyone around you !!
