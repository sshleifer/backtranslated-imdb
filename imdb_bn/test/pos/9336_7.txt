In 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to create a $ 1 million horror music video with "American Werewolf" team and coordinated with Vincent Price's voice, then what he was going to do was right. And sometimes a music video such as sensation has not been created before or after ... When it was released on VHS, this became the largest selling musical of the shortest time of 13 minutes. However, you already know the intriguing things, because when it is the list of the greatest music videos of all time, it often takes the top spot. <br /> <br /> It starts with Michael Jackson walking in the dark. Down the street with his date to break his car. He explained to him that he was "not like another man" (extraordinary right), and then the full moon comes from behind the clouds. While her girlfriend stood there and shouted, and screamed, and then during a scary transformation sequence, Michael Jackson became a whirlpool as some more screams. He left behind him by the jungle, grabbed him and we ... cut into the movie theater. Ah, all this happened in the horror movie about Michael Jackson and his date of birth. <br /> <br /> So, we have no sign of the song "Thriller" within five minutes and still. Extra, too? However, you must know that you will definitely go away ... dance, singing ... cemetery ... Vincent Price ... Jumbo ... "What's the problem?" ... then the end of the credit. The last credit for a friggin 'music video. "The Thriller" is not one of Michael John's most memorable songs, but today's standard ensures that it is a visual experience. If you still have not seen it completely, then you must certainly do it a day soon.
