My local PBS station WHYY Philadelphia recently showed "The Elegant Universe". Three hours later, in addition to my brain injuries, I learned about pesticides, quantum mechanics and parallel reality and substitute universal. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the show was "String Theory" about physics, a semi-new branch of physics which is possible only possible many of the ideas of science fiction, but also possible. With "string theory" it sounds like pesticides, alternative facts and alternative timelines, and it can only be a matter of time until it gets the knowledge on us. <br /> <br /> Although it is not given any new information about the subject, I find very interesting and informative shows. It is easily understood by anyone who is broadcasting on this issue.
