Tribal musicians Eva (Liv Woolman) and John Rosenberg (Max Van Sido) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm on a remote island to flee the continent's civil war. They provide a couple lingerberry of costumers to raise some money and buy some supplies. They love each other and Eva is 20 years old and wants to give birth to a baby, but reluctant John, who is a weak and sensitive person, does not want to have children. When the rebels come to the island, their peaceful and peaceful life becomes hell, and they are in the midst of accusations of both parties. After Colonel Jacobby (Gunner Bjurststrand) Eve Stork, John changed his behavior and became a barbarous person and changed the hatred and indifference towards love and affection for each other. <br /> <br /> An anti-master Angmerman Bergman movie attracts the attention of some artists and does not listen to the news, but when the war reaches their country, their intelligent soldiers destroy their love, friendship and affection. Live Olman and Max Fon Sido were the best cricketers of all time and I did not think of any other breasts leaven in the movie. Affirmative and open-faced John Rozenberg's atrocity by war is an impressive and open open conclusion enough of a frustrating and dramatic story. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vargaon" ("Shame")
