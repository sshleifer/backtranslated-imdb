Well, if the first full budget does not have a horror genre, do not get bored with it. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An ancient curse is involved and a crazy end that I do not waste. The influence of Gore is full and real icky ... but the movie is mainly a big train trapped on a train out of the people scaring the hell about the gory gag. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some memorable and well-organized scenery .. Some played a little hammy (watch for surf dudes) but really did not point it out ... this movie has a go on a day. What to expect and do not regret it!
