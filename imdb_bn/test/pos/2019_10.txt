Well, let me enter this way - I've always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I've always loved rock music, and especially heavy metals !! This photo is like a gift from God! I believe this movie is one of the best movies of all time (well, without the New Everending Story and Star Wars ...). "LONG LIVE Rock and Roll" (DOO), "Strongholdhold (Ted Nugent), John Bon Jovi, Deep Bugulett, AC / DC, Jack Wild, and many other legendary rock bands, I like to hear all the classic. Will create more movies (otherwise it is simply "Brazilian cinema", such as "AC in the USA" or what they call it and "8 miles". Bulls ***!) However, I strongly recommend this! Staying is some of the Stratovirus-Songs! But besides this, it's one of the best movies! Ten out of ten!
