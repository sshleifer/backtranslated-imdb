About 1 hour drama about traffic drugs (about 1987). It equals three stories equally, how aphity emerges from Northeast Pakistan, how drug smuggled from Pakistan to Europe and finally, how people are affected by drug control. All three stories are said with reality and sympathy. You can see enough letters to understand how many letters are considered immoral, how much they can suck in the lives of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> This cardboard cutouts are not, but the opiate producer is trying to feed his family, a dry area filled with guns and other opiates. The drug smuggler is a rich German, but there is no heart but his wife (one of the three main characters) is a normal woman who has to choose her life through an "old way" or leave. Finally, the main character, the government's minister has the most difficult role to deal with as well as psychological damage due to his own daughter. He entered into the world of drug addiction and began to steal, suffers from illness, is mentally attacking his parents, so he can fill his thirst for the destructive drug (heroin) of his life. <br /> <br /> Traffic is one of the best plays I've ever seen on TV. The scenes of this event will be with you for a long, long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassy
