Every year the TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies. You can see Lifetime on Saturdays 3 or 4 and court TV can depend on every few weeks. So I started to think of Morrison Murders and knew very well about what I could expect: a real-life family's killing capability is less or less. What I got was a fine, beautiful acting drama that ended me from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Both brothers were completely convinced and Jonathan Scarf was perfect in Luke's challenging role. Georgia had almost every frame of appearance and feeling. If I had any complaints, then Gordon Clap was as Sheriff. He does not just act as a Southern law enforcer or acting in a small town named Byron Calhoun. He looks and feels like a midwife, and midwife is not right for this part. <br /> <br /> But it's a small chin: Morrison Murders are good for watching, and not just on Saturday afternoon. If you're going out, tape. You do not regret it.
