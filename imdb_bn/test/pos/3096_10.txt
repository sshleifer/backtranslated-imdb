Successful films on physics are rare, but Fata Morgan is a good event. You can create a bigger issue with the ambition of young people, but Herzegze does a great job. The point of the film is shown to humans, even from the perspective of the people, shown in the world. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into three categories: Creation, Paradise, and Golden Edge. The voices of every imagery are voices. Although the original text of 'Creation' (Popol Bhuh, Mayan mythology) indicates the mainland, the scene illustrates the story. It lives on waste, and destroyed various samples (fire, smoke, debris vehicles). What are some of the pictures from 'paradise', and 'golden age' ridiculous in the dark ?? Most cultures work on the strange street musical instruments <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Object, but the film does everything that can restore this trend. There is no mention of human historic time of its legendary structure. There are no human characters to speak. When an extended shot with a boy standing with a dog, the primary counsel is the boy's perspective; In the end it's a lot of dogs. Likewise, the disguise is a powerful character than the human, and the turtle partner rarely shows people with its big flippers. <br /> <br /> The anthropomorphisms of animal stories and nature documents are always there, but Fata Morgan does not have any of these. Of course the piece looks like a female body, but cut both ways of imitation. Probably, people can easily differentiate between their creation and nature, and there are mountains, lakes and waterfalls as well as airplanes and factories. People and civilizations are part of a broad natural landscape. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Hajjaj revived Nosephirto from Vampire's perspective, he took a new turn on this idea.
