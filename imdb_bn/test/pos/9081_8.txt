I just saw this step in Encore Channel recently. What a great film, as well as a great cast. Flatliners are very suspenseful and unpredictable. This movie establishes a scenic view of the ocean and life after death, which involves the story of strong progression. Therefore, Nelson, led by Kephar Sothreland, went through the first death examination and returned to life. Therefore it is very dramatic to bring back his wrongdoing to life from the past. Then all of the characters mentioned went through the same experience, except Randi Stackle with the Oliver Plate. Then the story shows a resolution and basic understanding about life and God's presence and meaning. David Labraccio, an atheist played by Kevin Bacon, asked the question of his own faith about God. Exciting to see Julia Roberts at Kevin Bacon, Oliver Plate, William Beldwin and Kefar Sotherland at the head of his career. Nobody can ask how we will not make such a big movie. This is one of the best productions of Joel Shuacha. I really enjoy this movie.
