It was the first release of this film, I enjoyed it completely, and on every occasion I saw it. Political dramas are effective, especially if new or inspired. It has been seen for decades that the cost of public spending is not clearly seen by a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> But I think its the most influential element is the performance of Jack Lemon's film. It's absolutely amazing to see him at work. He is gift to be able to be able to communicate many times, saying a word. The next time you watch this movie, do not say anything at that time, look at Jack's face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the film saw: like the last scene of Lemons in the film, She is lying on the floor, she feels a little shaking. Terror in his eyes is one of the most horrific images seen in any movie. It plays perfect, because it immediately reveals the threat to happen - if Jack's character is so scary, it's a bit awkward for sure to happen. And do it.
