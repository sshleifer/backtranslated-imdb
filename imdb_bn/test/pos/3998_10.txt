This movie may be annoying for some people, but I can find this movie <br /> <br /> Very interesting in trying to express a tradition. <br /> <br /> Director, Lim, has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this photo. Before the film, the film was shown throughout the film, and this film is trying to achieve the same thing as the background in a film like a painting. Another thing, the story is written in both the director and the philosopher Kim Kimi (one of the well-known scholars of Harvard with a doctor's degree) I'm not saying that educated people make good films but an expert in philosophical Korean traditional culture , So it gives more credit to this picture.
