I saw this movie because of Costas Mandilar and Lorraine Holi. I chatted together with their Picayot fences, so they were treated again to meet again. It was never the best movie ever made, but it was cute. Very predictable, but sometimes I do not want to have fun movies, all I need is <br /> <br /> Desserts were pretty cool, and I wanted to eat them all. I though that it's one individual to separate separately. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, this will not meet again, but it was a great filler for one night.
