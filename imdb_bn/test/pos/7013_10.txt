For most women this film is the final chick-flick. With its hot chemistry, sexy dance rhyneas and outgoing songs, I like the classical classic (I've done) my life time and surprisingly like the wind. I enjoy Patrick Soze in this movie and he sees that he can sing and it can dance so hot. He sang the song "Shakes Like the Wind" in the movie. Chemistry between Sway and co-star Jennifer Gray is wonderful. I dance to all and love everything that goes with it. But talking about this dirty dance 2: - Havana Knights is also great but Patrick Swayze's scenes make it. I love music, dance and everything about it but it is not dirty dance. I said it's a wonderful chick flick. Patrick's character loves to see what happened to Johnny, because please give it three days. Jennifer's character may be more sexy but if you mean I know that makes for Patrick! Great movie and I'm very happy that Billy did not win the role of Jane. I heard the sculptor for the role but they found that he could not dance.
