I saw it last night and I laugh loudly for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was there. Bruce Campbell has created a great movie! I do not want to give anything, but when the movie revolves and becomes astonished, it is really astonishing. After another interesting scene. Mr. Campbell and the crew drag my hat off at such a small budget. Bruce was introduced to the film and a question and working on it, which was a treat. Many questions people asked were pretty hair, but Bruce will turn over them and all be arrogant. He was great! However, the choice of film. I would be looking forward to seeing this in DVD later this year. Check this fall on the Si-Fi Channel. I highly recommend this one.
