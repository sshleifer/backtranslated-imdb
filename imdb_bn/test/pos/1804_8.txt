Valley Girl is a very well made film with great cast around. Although the dialogue is a little different now, it was a hip when the film was released. To date, I know many people (teenagers included) who can not make a sentence without using the word "like". It will leave the film without any doubt. For this, 8 ratings were given, for example, Best Movies.
