The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedy I really enjoyed. The subject and acting were naturally popular that Hollywood (and still) were out of cranking. But for a short time, small studios make movies about teenagers who are not too soft or soft for the clerics. The people behind the strains of this production were from your friends from Canon. <br /> <br /> Three teenagers are still trying to lose their virginity while in high school. They need to do something or something to achieve their dream goals. The group's sensitive one (Andrew Mansoon) will have to find the right girl, when her best friend will accept what she gets. One day, the child finds out his perfect daughter (Diane Franklin). But luck will play one of their dirty tricks. Her best friend gets in her and sweeps her off her feet. After killing her, the sensitive child helps her to get back on her feet and pays for her abortion. She still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile his best friend is very fierce falling on getting his dream girl preggers. Yet, he tried his best to love him. The night comes when the question comes in the night. But when his heart broke, he danced with his best friend. In tears, the baby party leaves. <br /> <br /> What I've been enjoying about this movie is that it does not break into fifty pieces. Rather than filling the terrible conditions, it was very realistic, honest and cruel. The movie is filled with funny moments and share of violence. I have to recommend this picture for fans of teenage comedy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
