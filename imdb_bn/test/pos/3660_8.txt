I am very happy that Hari Om will be released in theaters in 2007. I watched this movie at the Vancouver International Film Festival three years ago and are waiting for its release, so I can send everyone to let me see it. It's like traveling to India .... colorful, magical, thought-provoking. Along with this, a weird Hollywood style auto rickshaw watch scene is very realistic in this movie. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance cinema but it has drama and romance and humor. Interrelationship between Indian taxi driver and French tourists is a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophies. Characters draw a little broad but the acting was very good. Apparently this movie is a treat as you really get a sense of what driving through Rajasthan ... like dreamlike. Sometimes it's hard to believe what you are watching and coming ... The film is of the same quality. Very good soundtrack!
