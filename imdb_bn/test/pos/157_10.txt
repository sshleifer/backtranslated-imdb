I will not bore you with any synopsis, chances are you already know them. And hopefully you are already familiar with the work of Park Chan-Uek. <br /> <br /> I strongly disagree with some other commentators that "the park revenge trilogy blah blah blah has gone away." Because you know He has !!! The vengeance triangle was different from each other in the beginning, how can you compare the "secrecy of Mr. Vengeance" with the ironic and extravagance of "Old World" and the neutrality? Park Chan-Oak has incredible style, but his movie does not share all the same style! That has come true and the fact of the "thirsty" remains true. <br /> <br /> "Thirsty" is an incredible picture, it literally means everything you want in a movie. JavaScript violence, delicious pride, great humor, incredible mystery, and even realistic sexual scenes. The story is so crazy that at any moment you can guess what will happen next. I am glad that this is the fantastic dark comic-vampire-love-story to say back to the top form back in the park with the story. As soon as you can see it!
