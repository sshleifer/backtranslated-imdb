Both Andy Lau and Lau-Ching-Wain are both among Johnny Two's strictly operated crime thriller, which puts the majority of Western efforts to shame. Think of it as a 'heat' in Hong Kong, only good! Everything screams about the film; Soundtrack, cinematography script from performance. Tone is serious all the time, but the film has black-comedies, friendships and a great line of romance in her heart. Definitely, it becomes a bit annoying later, but it's a hard-hearted audience, who did not find anything good about this movie. Thanks to God, Hollywood (still) created and did not destroy a classic. Make yourself a favor and see this picture!
