I saw this picture in a branch of New York's Dune Reed Pharmacy in New York, and it looks like a big fun. And of course, the whole court is ridiculous beyond words - but it has become a completely enjoyable action film for kids and their parents. <br /> <br /> 10-year-old Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett) most of the time his father (Larry Miller) is very frustrated with the head of the cloud. As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and classmates fly a concert performance ... and again Ricky's mind 'takes' and suspected some criminal plot is happening. <br /> <br /> Helped by the best friend Sashi, who was a fan of hot sauce (which was a strange plot device) and they tried to try to solve the mystery. Oh yeah, and Ricky's skill The experience of 1,000-hour flight simulator was easy when he was called to save the movie's thrilling day! Eric Roberts and Mark Dacosks were good to see part of a family film. And watching DVD interviews everyone has found it very fun. <br /> <br /> I totally like junior pilot; Charming and good nature's performance, funny plot lines and a real; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
