I am a college student and I bought this movie in a used bookstore because it was really fun from the background details. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because you can see how stupid this Christian man is. They think non-believers really want to live in disgusting, dirty houses and can do nothing else than beer and neighbors can mean. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said Watch this movie now! <br /> <br /> I hope Rich Christian is making these films even more hot for us!
