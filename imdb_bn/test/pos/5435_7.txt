Robin Williams shows his studying talent and is wrong in American politics and is increasing his position as a comedian in this movie and how Hollywood can affect the people without disturbing them. Of course, Hollywood uses movies with hidden or non-hidden agendas. I think this movie is for people who like stand up and political discussions. And the movie trailers were only for everyone to ensure that everyone could see it as possible. Everyone knows that Hollywood is more liberal than democracy, so they will have to make these films anymore ... but perhaps it was obvious, at least I thought, to make a real change <br /> <br> Still great stand-up and new political issues and discussions ... I enjoyed it and thanks to IMDb.com ratings, I was positive when I came out of the movie theater. Was surprised, and yes, I laughed many times. Sometimes you just have to give it up and forget all the seriousness .... If you like good and cute stand-up or politics, then watch this movie and you will not be offended by a few references to how good things are not done now. Rent it if that does not match with you.
