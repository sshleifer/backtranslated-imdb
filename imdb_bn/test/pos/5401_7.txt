The NYT review says that the character of Sigarie Weaver is frustrating and frustrating, and later, she may be the sister of MTM's character among ordinary people. What is the ball No way. This lady was quirky from the beginning. Nothing like MTM among ordinary people. Sorry <br /> <br /> NIIT later said that 40-year-old "children of 60" Ben Trevis of Jeff Daniels, Sandy Travies from Sigarie Weaver and 40-year-old. Ms Waver must be a mess dancing. I believe he created a fantasy hero when he was actually at the age of 55. He was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> Corrected correction of the NYT perception, it was made by so young someone considering it was a very good movie. Clearly, Sijorini Beaver thought so, and Jeff Daniels did the same. The young man playing the team was extraordinary. <br /> <br /> I can make some critical comments about this script. As I did not understand why I missed Sandy Treviso his son. Because of his death, his different behavior was perhaps inspired by his death, but I used to think more about this kind of behavior through the marriage of the Strengen in my life, his relationship with the team and from where he came from. Pending problems, no one is grieved by his eldest son. Ben's grief was more clear. <br /> <br /> So Matt Travis was an idiot. Does his mother think so? Still, a very watchable film. Whether there is no role for women at any particular age, whether it is becoming clear and clear, rather what it takes is a director such as an old woman (MS Waiver) and almost her film is a tribute to her. An anti-Woody Allen dress up.
