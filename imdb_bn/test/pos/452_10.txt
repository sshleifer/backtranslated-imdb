"Journey" is a very good movie. Produced in Vienna in spring 1958 and released in 1952, the film was quite popular in its early years. Political problems, which have affected the success of the film (though the story took place during the Hungarian Revolution), "The Journey" is a very good movie, but not well known. I think it will be released immediately on DVD, because most people who have seen it want to keep it in the house. One of the most important aspects of the movie is Dobra Care and Yule Brenner's extraordinary relationship. All their scenes together are very important, but they express strong emotions and love in character, character (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality script, which is very well written. It was published as a novel, by the screen player George Taberi. The film keeps its tension from start to finish. Initially, we do not know whether Diana and other travelers can leave Hungary, because the Communist Major has discovered that Diana's friend Paul Kids, Hungarian and she can not leave the country. Major falls in love with Diana and, actually, the real reason is that she does not want to let her go. But he hugged him and gave him one of the most memorable kisses seen on the screen, and he kissed him, also, he let him go. And the ending of the film is one of the greatest dramatic finishes ever. Major and Diana, "Goodbye!", He came to the border with all travelers including Paul, when some Hungarians shot several times. He's dead. Yul Brynner very, very nice and Deborah Care is very nice, impressive, refreshing, just like an English lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of Golden Hollywood's greatest couples. A true moviegoer will watch this movie. "Journey" has everything that is a good movie-a great, fascinating story, interesting character, a wonderful aspect (according to my opinion, Anatol Litvak). Finally, I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studio, or those who recover and publish classic movies: Please, publish the DVD as "The Journey" as soon as possible.
