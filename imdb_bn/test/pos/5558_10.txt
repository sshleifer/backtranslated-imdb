Farscape Complete Rule! In my opinion it is very close to the series five though the series has only 7 main characters (included spaceship). Humor is excellent and the writer is managed to keep the show interesting, but there are many things in the ship. <br /> <br /> I really love and appreciate Phosphate, that is, they do not use CGI letters for foreigners or if they are, it is neglectful. They use the same lovable, crappy rubber animated dolls who used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something you definitely want to see, if you are not already.
