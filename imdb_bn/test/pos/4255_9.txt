I could be frustrated to see this film again after many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than his youth with my honesty and brave humor. In 1969, transition from a major policy of solidarity of African-American groups and the integration of a conflict and self-reliance was still quite new, and it was somewhat controversial. It took courage and skill to portray both images of the organization and the anti-agency as a painting that has been closely identified in real life. Arnold Johnson's performance should be specifically highlighted: He successfully avoided breaking his character in SocietyPathy or Bafurry. I'd rather see an old day than "Sir with Luv"!
