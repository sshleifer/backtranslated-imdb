The strange but acceptable crowd comedy of flirtating with the murder of the disguised masses (Dean Stockwell) with a brain-related widow (Methyl Papifier), a strange visual agent (Matthew Modin). <br /> <br /> The movie shows it's fun and it does not seem to go top from the director Jonathan Dame ("The Chills of the Lambs", "Philadelphia"), and it seems to be in control. That's good and it avoids too predictable.
