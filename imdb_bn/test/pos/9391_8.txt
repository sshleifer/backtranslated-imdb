"Death Bid: The Beat It's Eats" is a very horrific horror film that seems to be actually believed. This is an ancient four-poster bed that just loves to eat humans and it can hide people from anyone at any time, it is also a long-term artist. One of his images is in the prison behind, who described a voice. Gorge Barry is the first and only movie to exploit his victims in some real moments such as a wonderful situation. Yellow foam and liquid sea The atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of Gore, unfortunately the court is rather folly and acting amateur I still enjoy this low budget curiosity as a fan of the unusual movie. This is an opportunity 10 out of 10.
