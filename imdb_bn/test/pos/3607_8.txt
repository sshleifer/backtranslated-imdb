Captain Corelli is one of the best films of Mandolin Nicholas Cage. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against a retro island retreat. John gives Hart's character to his daughter, some good advice in love is beautifully played by Penelope Cruz. This movie is not fully expected to be expected. This film allows Cruise to start a performance as a strong woman who can recognize her own mind and heart. Once the movie has passed the opening sequence, this movie keeps an eye on you. Again, do not despair Nicholas Cage.
