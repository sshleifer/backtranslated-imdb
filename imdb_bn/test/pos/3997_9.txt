Not sure why the other comment on this movie was negative, but I like this movie. I am a student of Asian art in the special love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie was a very controversial and interesting character in life. Jang Singh-up is going to be honored as one of the most famous Korean artists and a master. Given the timing and tumult of nature in its conflict, it is amazing that it produced so much work, with so many styles and such skills. This film honors her talents with a direct focus on her talented and slightly self-destructive personality. In my opinion, the cinematography was beautiful, many panoramic shots outside looked like the Korean landscape painting (which I found "too much arty" instead of a beautiful pride) and I think that Choi Min-Sik is portrayed above the thighs with a necessary intensity and unpredictable. I would highly recommend this film to industry lovers and movie lovers alike.
