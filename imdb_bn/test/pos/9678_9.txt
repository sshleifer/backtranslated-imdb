I absolutely love this show !!!!!!!, this is basically a better version of Fox Simpsons. (Causes it shows that the Simpson is very dry, it's very dry when it's 9 years old, it's politically, irrational, and unreasonable to say that they do not like it. They're lying, there's a character for everyone, Peter, Steve and Kogomier are my favorites. Because Peter is not unreasonable, objectionable, and does not just give a frog, his amazing intelligence, and how he can help you with an adult. When you at least expect it, you'll be curious and happy because one of the perpetrators is a dirty joke, there's also an episode for everyone, Mr. Griffin goes to Washington (Viol Season 3). If you like sex and physical humor more then Emission is impossible (VOL.2 SEASON 3.). Or if you like any other kind of humor, then JAMAT (VOL.1 SEASON2). What I'm talking about physically is When you see on this show is for everyone separator humor. GIGGITY jigiji gudo!
