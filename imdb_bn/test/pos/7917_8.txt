"Alexander Nevsky" director Sergei Eijenstein returned to filmmaking after the exile, and what he produced was a fierce propaganda film by declaring Russian superiority over Germany. <br /> <br /> Very small plot: Russians combine the Germans war; Russia has won. This film is an extended Montage of most war scenes, mixed with moments of German cruelty (such as a shocking scene that German soldiers thrown in anger by Russian children). It was Eisenstein's first sound film, and it is clear that he does not know what to do with the medium. In fact, this movie shows more like a silent film by adding more words. There are some conversation scenes, but they sit quietly on the screen, and pensing off, as if the actors were not really set up, they were together at the same time. Eisenstein mostly uses words as a pretext for Golden Prokofiev's disorder, and virtually it is one of the biggest assets of the film. Say <br /> <br /> Tell you the actor (or lack thereof) of Einstein's power or his film more descriptive, how he must edit photos and music for the greatest impact, and "Alexander Nevsky" illuminates everyone through his deficit . <br /> <br /> Grade: A
