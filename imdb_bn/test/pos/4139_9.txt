What a great film! I never knew much about Body Holly, but was familiar with his animated and funny music. This is a wonderful biography that helped change the music in the 1950s. Although I did not care for Gary Busce, she was pretty like Body Holly! I do not know how accurate the movie is, but in most cases it is correct, which makes the film even more interesting. Music across the movie just adds pizazz to this biography. I do not think I'll make some changes in this movie, it was all good! What's the difference between 50's to today's music stars? How can you compare Justin Timberley like Buddy Holly? Or the other popular singer of this generation?
