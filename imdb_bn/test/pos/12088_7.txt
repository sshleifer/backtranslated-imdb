Above all, I enjoyed seeing this documentary that I should point out. It was not only great music, but the shot and editing was also wonderful. However, these positive issues about this film do not change this role in true bitterly oriental Eastern "East-West" cliche like the Turks. Well, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very stylish way, which is a good thing, to show that the unidentified European and American people are not just killing Armenians and Kurds. However, the problematic of the film is what it determines as "east" from the eyes of "west". I mean, a jazz singer in the film says that there is probably no East and West, perhaps it is a mythological event, which is false and hostile by the ruling leaders of the "Western" nations to maintain hostilities. Can the world continue to rule and "keep cash flow"? <br /> <br /> Why do not you think of it?
