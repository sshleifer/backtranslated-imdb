This movie is one of my favorite comedy all the time. The dialog is crisp, speed fast It's not just a trick comedy, but it's interesting to watch behind the scenes of the television news business. <br /> <br /> There are many fun lines ... Some of my favorites: <br /> <br /> Arnie Murman: (Satire) Always know you well, always be the best person to think it's the best intelligent Will be. Jane: (serious) No, it's not terrible !! <br /> <br /> <br /> Harun: She must love him. Jane: How do you know? The performances of Haroon Hani, Albert Brooks and William Hart were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I think this movie is good. Often forgotten amazing funny guy Cusack! Newsweek staffs beat the deadline to a deadline where I love the scene. There are so many fun scenes that it's hard to pick favorites. I highly recommend this film.
