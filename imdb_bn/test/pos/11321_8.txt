Daniel Percival's "Dirty War", a BBC production made for television, was recently shown on the cable. This movie is a documentary style after creating the nearby Holocaust among the largest metropolises in the world of London. Indeed, this film produced in 2004 was a warning message about the events of the following year, in which terrorists installed explosives devices in public transport, which in the wrong time killed the innocent people innocent. <Br> <br /> The movie director and production team influence the film to make this project dynamic. There is no relentless moment in the film when creating terrorists and creating people following their dirty work. Although an inevitable event happened, it is surprising to think of the consequences of planting 'dirty bombs' in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The last picture in the picture has a cool effect. Distortion of the crowd and the entire area, send a fearful fountain, thinking how it might be possible.
