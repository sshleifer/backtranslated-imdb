The film is a pleasure to watch, not just for the plot, it's great, but also for the great acting of the actor, DENUEW and Belmondo. Although it is considered 'flop' on the first release, it has become a critical success and why it is seen. Denov's acting style is brilliant in the film. He has continually impressed that he has kept or hid something, and his character in this picture I'm not saying what it will be looted, even though it is fairly released initially. Belmondo is fairly neutral but loving as a tobaconist. I would recommend this picture to all trophots or DENUEW fans. It's a brilliant HitachiCity style thriller that provides exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop like a development. The film is about 2 hours, so you feel that you were not sold small. Cinematic stole shows in this movie, and it is clear that the trophy was very much hurt when the film was produced. Must view the course for a specific no synthetic or moviefan. 10/10
