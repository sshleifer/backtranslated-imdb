Spike Feresten is a comic genius. The strange ball immunization that created showcase like 'Talkshow' Lettman and The Daily Show, has been revised. Her likability is obvious. He found the fun unique angle, not the path of expected sitcom ... thank God. His comedy award winning memorabilia ('Talkshops' have long finger fingers crossed). The things he highlighted are those things that are neglected by others, even when he creates a joke around them, then you wonder how it missed the first time. I especially enjoyed the sketch ... "Unfair Target" will not be a classical class. Set your tivo's people ... it will not miss a show.
