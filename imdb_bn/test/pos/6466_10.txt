This is one of Cassavetes's best performances. The whole cast is outstanding, as the exaggerated directions of Martin Ritt. The rage, distraction, and hatred of urban labor war are described wonderfully in a fashion that is not flexible and is sponsored. A way to date it with its era, but in many ways, it is timeless to magnify.
