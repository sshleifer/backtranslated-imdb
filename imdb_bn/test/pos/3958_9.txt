Films in the "silent film" genre generally include the same elements: a "deuce pre-machine" plot twist that dries the original character, it is a beautiful but psychological girl, a handsome but psychological thug, a lot of money, a lot of cruelty, and usually in the desert. A denouement Think of "Hi Sierra" or "White Heat" <br /> <br /> There are plenty of hard-hitting bad films silent. But when the movie is silent, you will not be able to stop the eyes from the debris of the train of human life. <br /> <br /> This next tradition is related to the "blind spot". This image follows Danny Allton, who plays with a frustrated teen (deeply, grace, passionate honesty and cruelty to James Franco, who has thrown himself completely in this role), who is in love with street street street Dariusz. /> <br /> From the beginning, you know that it's going to be bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invited Danny to his house. But the house is empty and for sale, and bloody check floor for thousands of dollars. Danny looted his clothes and accessories, but using checks to track suicidal April - Darcy's other boyfriend When they reached the real home of Dresian, they found Wayne - a cold hunting hunter for his theft. Together, three Darcy manage to locate Darcy in a dusty, run-down motel. But this is just the beginning of the story, such as plastic explosives, drugs, guns, a horrific funeral home, bisexual killer, and a lone semi-finished house in the desert, bringing events to an explosive head in a lane outside a tattoo parlor. Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> The best silent artist I've seen in this movie for several years. In one case, Danny runs through the desert to the last half of the desert in the desert, where he believes that Darcy can swim in the evening. Danny shows a long shot with sharp lighting effects - arms and legs flailing, palpable fears his face (even visible at this distance), behind his back, as dust sticks from his side of the dust cloud - racing across the desert flat towards home. Loneliness, frustration, disappointment Danny looks like a picture of depression. There are so many scenes in this movie, which were created wonderfully by the experienced Maximo Munji. This is the Oscar-winning element. <br /> <br /> The edit is also very surprising. The film is a short moment where the characters get insight on themselves or their condition. Time is bits, where memory comes back to the feeling and flood. At this time, the image quickly flash across the montage screen. It is superb edited by director-writer-editor-publisher Stefan Olomshujuk. In an early montage, Danny describes the wonders of his life which Darcy has entered in his life. Quick diaries of Danny diary across the scans: "4 lives," words "lucky" and "safe" closing in a moment, when pages on pages page, content of people's hearts, race across the screen are fast-moving out of focus. It seems like Danny feels like a flood. <br /> <br /> The photo flood reveals something else about this picture: just how Nutanel Waters' production design is so beautiful. Darcy's Context-Hot Home is Hi-Tech and Slab (respect for set decorator Kimberley Foster's attention). Stunning desert house view is just perfect. Darcy hiding can be found in any abandoned small town in America. Fantastic (and surprisingly enlightened) funeral home where the plot makes the horrific cyclone swiftly hanging over the whole movie with Paul's death. (Credit rating is too bad to credit.) This film has a great production design, which increases the performance of single frames and each actor. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth element of this movie that you create and hold it: Acting. James Franco is a fantastic actor. Even in "Spider-Man" - where he had nothing to do with virtually nothing - Franco showed that he understood the human emotions as any other actor of his generation He is not a nice boy in Brad Pitt's good looks. Franco portrays deep passion with full power. His performance includes the heart of pure people. Consider the scene of the phone booth outside the funeral home, where Danny collapsed after Danny April and Wayne died of Darcy. Less actors can not carry off a complete psychological breakdown of people. Franco <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Deeply concerned with Dressey, his unborn child ( After the embryo is spontaneously closed) After burying a fragrance in the forest, he feels very depressed, his luxury and perfection today is a jolt: April one of April is the seratum. I've never seen characters that draw in the film. Derry's relationship with Derry gradually spread throughout the film, but the neurological breakdown in April was revealed to the audience only. Danny and Wayne are not particularly interested in him as a man. The disappointment of April, when Danny realized that Dorsey was her lover, she could not feel any emotion for a long time because she is stupid and strong, or even completely disagree with the character. Montgomery is a heart in April that keeps your heart through wringer. <br /> <br /> Mark Patrick Gleason is given the most difficult work of the film: Wayne, to get out of some people and lips. Initially, Owen is only one of the most violent, foul-mouthed, panic-drug-pusher / gun runners that appears in a film ("Kindergarten Cop" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason works very well with what he has given, but Owen does not quite get where he feels so much for you. It's hard to tell whether it's Gleason's problem or element. There's a moment - where Wayne (Dary's brother, Danny or April does not know about it) reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional link between two men - where you only know that Danny's ass is going to go to Owen Homophobic. But the explosion does not come. (Thanks god! Silent death of the plot plot.) Once it comes to the end of the movie, the audience is deeply amazed by the depth of love and sympathy. Owen really felt for Dressey - so deep that Owen admitted that Danny is gay love for his brother-in-law brother. But all this happens in close screen. Gleason is never given the chance to work on the feelings of Wayne. It was very disappointing for the performer. <br /> <br /> The story is rather inventive, though the smuggling machine at the end of the film can remind the audience of "diamond forever" (yes, James Ties). A traditional descriptive voice-over (which proves Franko as a ghostly actor as voice talent proves to be great), although it flows to Schmaltz in the end of the film (giving some unreasonable laughter). The terrible locale plays the main visual role of the movie. Location scout Kudos to find such fantastic buildings! Hit me as the film rushed a bit in the end; Not Pat, but my film is very strong for the silent taste. <br /> <br /> Now, I saw the hatred or love of the audience "Blind Spot." Modern film viewers arising from the most extreme cruelty and violence often have little understanding for the little benefit of film silence. My suggestion is that some of the friends have to take small friends that do not feel depressed, depressed, depressed, depressed or depressed. Take them to the small theater, where they can be glorified in the philosophy of film, but they will not be destroyed by the crowd of people who can not recognize their good crowd silent. They get some popcorn (believe me, they will be so mad that they will not finish it), drink a soda of them, and let them down. After your soul cleans up the grime and horror, after some places go bright and cheery. Because this movie is so good to feel like you, you will need to recover it.
