Okay, first, for all the haters: Get a life! I can not see why you are annoyed to post these boards, when you certainly do not know anything about movies, robots or people. <br /> <br /> This gender is an important lesson for all of us to know about sex, stereotypes, relationships, and status. Really, we all have some robots, some incentive programs without worrying to respond. How long have we seen a sunset and even made some trite comments without thinking about it? I say, thanks to Aqua (brilliantly played by Barnett Peters) to stop me and think about the extraordinary ability of the mother's nature. It is only when Val and Aqua start rejecting their programming that they begin to understand their real desire - to find love and to escape from the factory in search of creative life. This movie should be shown in prison - only think about the dream and hope it can be inspired by the prison. Even they can even overcome their "bad" programming and can join us in the world of criminals online. <br /> <br /> We can learn a lot from this robot. I'm a good person for heartbeats
