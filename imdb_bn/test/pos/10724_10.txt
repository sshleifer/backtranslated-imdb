A good drama movie about a child custody case with great performance by all actors. A great example is a nice script that can promote a simple story of a superior quality standard. Although the script was simply average and it kept the movie from the list of the greatest plays of all time. Great acting shows this movie well so that you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of main actors. But that would be really nitpicking for more excellence ......
