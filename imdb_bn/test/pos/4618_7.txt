The film appears on the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and to achieve a number of fame, the film seems to be more modern and deeper school drama. <br /> <br /> This is a young man who often walks through open and frustrating days at school. Everything is moving around suicide - it has been shown in very short period - it happens at 2:37 pm. Characters are somehow connected to each other. What is explained by the summary interview sequence of their move, strictly B / W s. Characters are well-written, acting is stimulating (especially like Teresa Palma Melody and Franks invents Marcus as sweet). <br /> <br /> Let's come up with the strategy of the film. That really impressed me. Cameras like Gays Van Sant's elephants mostly follow the camera. Some scenes are presented more than once, but each time from different perspectives (here: character). This is definitely developing slowly, but the literally grabbing environment which literally drags you inside. Colors are inefficient in any way considering a vibrant, solid plot - but it is not less than a tricky conjecture, it's a boring 'everything good thing'. Use light to all the time, underline the actual mood of the characters. And finally, the music has beautiful places. <br /> <br /> 2:37 Anyway start from the beginning. It does not compromise or does not smile. It would rather define psychological as a terrorist moment, together string. This movie mostly focuses on emotional precipices. There is no person who can not manage any type of neurosis, even the small portions of the painting (eg, teachers) seem to be in some disorder. And that keeps this movie from being really good. In short, it is unrealistic in its bone of misery tragedy. No: friendship, love, smile, truth, passion There are: fixing, humiliation, frustration, sickness and beating. It's always like being hard hard hit on the face, but you are numb after the first hour. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 10 of the 10 makes it difficult.
