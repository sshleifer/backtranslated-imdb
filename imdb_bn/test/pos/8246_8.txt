The vote for this movie is an interesting split (at the moment). Those who go to expect a documentary are influenced, or at least not disappointed. I hope those who give 1 of 10 films are the war criminals or the Galipoli attack on the idea of ​​reconstruction. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see actors, gunfights and cows, this picture will not be suitable to you. If you want to see an independent documentary about the Gallupuli, without any aspect of any aspect (these events were the only enemy wars), then you will both influence and debut. I found it a very moving film, even though Captain Guy knightly liked the end.
