I think I was one of those other people who had this other pearl of chariot. As a reward, its performance was stunning. 25 years ago Francis Ford Coppola was so strongly spoken that the story was gradually released and the characters left the room for development. Roeg is proven again it does not have to be a battle setting to be interressting. Contrary to a most amazing position lies a story. In the hands of ruthlessnes and beauty, loneliness should be your best friend. It shows the more insatiable past of the reign of a small golden era which is located on the richest coast of the world's world, if you send the right men. A beautifully directed movie from Nicola's rog wing is a glorious throw of all.
