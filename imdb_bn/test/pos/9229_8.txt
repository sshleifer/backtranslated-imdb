I was not born after the series was released in the United States. It took another decade before retaining British television networks. <br /> <br /> I was really lucky that the first episode was enough to see, in which The Lone Ranger was like a beast, attack and kill. TLR was the only survivor. Although seriously injured, he rescued an Indian named Tanto. I believe he wore a mask to hide his true identity with fear of revenge. But instead he recognized himself more. If Dunne wore his sleep. <br /> <br /> This Saturday was titime staple. William Tale's impressive fanfire Bakels Tele, the food still presaged a dash in the hand. Although it became very quick repetitive, predictable. Nobody ever encountered him. Nobody ever landed a punch, someone shot him out. She was very good, and most of the kids had very little camp in her dress. On the other hand, Tommy became her aunt Sally. He was always slugged and tied up and kidnapped and getting stuff. <br /> <br /> And did he keep calling Lone Ranger? 'Raja Sawi' was a general realistic where I lived. Talking in Indian languages ​​'Know the Big' But Mr. Silverwell was sounded like something else, as there was a speech error. 'Kemosabe'; What is that hell? <br /> <br /> Later, and both low-selling, well known as "blanket radars" and "dick west" both won my vote. It was a nude face featuring Jock Mahoney who got nicely beat-up in each episode and was completely less shorter, less super, and more credible. <br /> <br /> is still; Even today, I can not hear the overtures of William Tale's Houston and Hero Hui-Oh Silver. <br /> <br /> Devin Duffens.
