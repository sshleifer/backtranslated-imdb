It was a great event ... I do not think much about it but remember to see it and loving it. I remember my mother and father. I really like the Grandmother. She was like a grandmother, you could not really grasp until you became an adult. She was very intelligent and no nonsense. The show was my favorite song in the morning in Sardinas. (Which may not be the title) I heard the show and went to Cleveland Ohio to see my companion, and my sister and I sang the song so much that when we gave up my little cousins, it was very singing. I would like to find this on DVD too.
