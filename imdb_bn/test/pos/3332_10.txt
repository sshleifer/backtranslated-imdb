These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and funny) puns. Here we see that the first shot is an island prison, written on its big door: "Alka-Fiz Jail - No Nose Good Noise." Inside the prison, we see the first sign "Welcome: There is a seat." Then they show an electric chair. <br /> <br /> The colonel gives way to trick, however, it is seen behind our favorite wolf bars. With the pen in his hand, he literally painted a door beside him and then ran through him! At some point, he cross-crossed the United States, jumped across Canada and in the northern part of the country. Here we see the Canadian Royal Mounded Police and of course, our heroes are known as "Segut McPauld". He gave the responsibility of catching big criminals from Alka-Fiz. So, with her faithful little blue horse, she wanted to get out of heavy snow so that wolf can look for wolf. <br /> <br /> From that point we get the usual story: Neppi always dropped out of the wolf, however, what next ... and both characters are involved in some wild and very interesting sight gags. Droopy even pops out from an eagle egg on a cow. Wolf can not go anywhere - or plastic surgery! None of anyone in the history of cartoon has seen this tremendous response, every time this wolf sees his kindness! Every time she screams, mouth and body stretches in horror, a big part of sight gags. <br /> <br /> You think this comedy cartoon will be boring but not so. This is one of only 24 cartoons in the "Full Theatrical Collection" DVD, with more wonderful things from Tex Avery and gang, with wonderful restored visual views.
