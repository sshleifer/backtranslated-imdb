Emilio is a successful business people, a perfect father and a good husband. Or everyone thinks that. The perfect tale will be starting off suddenly near all her he has been carefully built along this year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> While this plot is headed towards the tension increases, the film explores most of our fearsome fears ... do we really know the people we know? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> A good deal of Spanish films is interesting stories but far from technical expertise. The perfect rhythm and good shot scenes make actors so credible, we go inside Emilio, and hate him, and suffer for him, because his condition becomes even more frustrating. There is no need for Spanish folklore, and it's an effort to create a Hollywood style flick. This is the real Spain, 2002, and despite the obvious ambiguity of the life of Emilio, in reality, there is a possibility that the person who claims to be a person is not fairly good. Not just a great commercial product, it will be amazed at where you can get us. What can we hold? <br /> <br /> OK.
