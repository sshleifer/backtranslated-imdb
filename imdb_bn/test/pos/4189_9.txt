I can not believe it is a huge religious hit. Perhaps in 1968, McKay does not refuse to see the Beatles think of Beatles as a stupid factory built-in pop band Rip Off. That syncism probably never covered it from sight. Do not make this mistake. _Head_ is an amazing movie that most open minded people will realize. It's very fun and very cute (and very trippy).
