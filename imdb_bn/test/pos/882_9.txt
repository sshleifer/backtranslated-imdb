A rare reproduction of the genre chief - completely new but in his story, there is nothing silent about the presentation. At the age of 40, young young man Manohar, his police officer has been separated from his father and found a job in a jewelry store. Soon a random person came to him and called him immortal. The presence of a "doppelganger" is established using only a few pithy moments. Then a woman came forward and claimed to call Dopelganj. He is with his loving brother (Ashok Kumar), who is so sure that Mannai is really immortal. He took off his shoes and proved that he was not the recipient, 6 owes money. Zaheer's super cute girl Anjoo (Tanuja) is absolutely fascinated with the humble. All of this is a jewel thief in loose confusion and she is deliberately stolen. Slowly, we learn from a super-hit nightclub singer (Helen!) With a gentle interview that the thief Amar Dopplenzer There are many beautiful women (Anjumu Mahendru, Farial) after the hero The police force with a dumb father is completely helpless. Humility gradually falls for the shalini and the saloon and bless his brother's union. This action goes towards Sikkim, where Amar will be the next hijst. The rest of them watch for you - Duplicate, girls, who seem to have quarreled in every word of humility, they are their boss immortal, loving brother sister, both - nothing seems right, and it tells the story of theft (and direction) Concluding the story in a very entertaining manner. The film will be astonished at many moments until the film is filled up in a grand palace in a grand palace in a palace. <br /> <br /> I was not a big fan fan but he is quite skilled here. At his chubbiest. He is able to add confusion to the story in a fine way, but good when he is sad or dancing. Tanuja is as beautiful as a button and I like her in this picture. I wanted to get him very badly. Dev, good, will give If he is not walking like an infected infected shoulder (one shoulder is always less than the other) I would be surprised that he got to imitate him! Yet its style, elegance, and cremation were uninterrupted. I did not give it to Hata Bechar's song only God saw the cold stick carrying a fishing stick, for which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was just awesome - Dada Mani did not turn the whole movie into a single history history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mary, and my favorite favorite seductive number of night is Ellie High buzz gay die. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want a great story, with more twists than pretellels, keep guessing, still happy and entertaining - then buy or rent a necklace. Good to buy it, then you can go back and see it again with your friends. This one is the keeper.
