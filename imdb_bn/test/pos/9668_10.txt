This is a bright series along the same lines of Simpson. Following a family and family life, a little less realistic than a Simpson, talking about a child or a dog? Family Guy, where Sampson or Phuturam does not dare, reaches a sick joke and even more disgusting world. And believe me, it works! Almost all gags hit the mark and they keep you sewing (especially random, frequent flashbacks) when my brother first showed me, I was not in the order, but after some episodes I was hooked. You will be 10/10 for a really brilliant show. Sheth Macfarlane COngrats for bringing this show to life. :)
