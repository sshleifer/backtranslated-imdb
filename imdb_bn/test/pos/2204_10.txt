Even if you are not a "theater person" I suggest you see it. Christopher Bond (at the same time, the old London legend was closed) based on a game of the same name, it is an extraordinary work that brings it to the musical theater stage. The score is just amazing - one of the best scores written for Sandem's best, and perhaps a musical instrument. The show is thrown very well, my only complaint is being Betsy Joslin's screenplay of Josephine. It's good, remember, and she's a very versatile actress, but she does not sing "Greenfinch and Lint Bird" very well. But more than that, it made all the phenomenal - Anjela Lansbury * Mrs. Lovette introduction *, and she just so well. In the role of George Heinen, a good replacement for Len Karyur and Kenny Jennings Tobyas played a great role. The end will give you cold. Top mark for a wonderful show
