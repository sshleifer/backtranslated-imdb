Seeing this movie, I can not help in comparing it with Wild Reads, another thoughtful movie about age arrivals. <br /> <br /> Like wild reactions, this film is slow and the director will not rush fast. . So if you want some quick resolution then do not see it. This film is like a fruit of life, unkempt and incomplete. There is no resolution, no real life for somebody, happily for some, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director is tall, really long, excel at showing the shot and actress and actress subtlety and inner thoughts. 0 <br /> I love this movie. I do not see it around but now I'm so happy that I This is not a movie for everyone but if you are willing to let it grow on it you will be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
