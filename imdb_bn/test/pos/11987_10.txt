I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the scripts and plots can not be changed at all, but The story was better than Cadash 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not like CadSheck 2 ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Sunny Daferfield! <br /> <br /> I think the film will be better if Rodney is part of Dangerfield's Jackie Messon. Although I liked Jackie Messon in the film, it would have been better if Rodney Dangerfeld kept it. <br /> <br /> Another mistake that I did not hate was the Dan Acroids. The movie was the first one to eight years later. Bill Murray, "Carl", can leave the job as assistant grinskiper and join the army, you know? If Warner Bros. That thought, it could make movies even better, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Try it.
