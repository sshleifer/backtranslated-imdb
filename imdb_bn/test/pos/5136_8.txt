I highly recommend this movie for everyone. My son and I read the first book and then saw the movie. The book was good (in my opinion) the movie was still great. My son and I agree that when we like the book's version well, we love the end of the film better than the end of the movie. The scenery should be just stunning and soundtrack. Hostage Buffet has a small role and a plus that supplies music. Leik Wilson did a good job in the role of Officer Delinco, and I mentally imagined that Delinco was able to see the book as it was. I'm surprised that this theater is not good, and I'll wait for the DVD to come out.
