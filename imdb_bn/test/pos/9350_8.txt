Best of the film is its best. Instantly set forth in WWII (1946), "Crossfire" depicted the times of good, bad and ugly. Monty Montgomery killed Sam because a Sam is a Jew and therefore, Monty is automatically understood through narrow lenses, who have been slurred in the war, they themselves. Monty does not like that good man. The fact is that Sam was a soldier, but something that disappears is true when you feel right about hate ideology, you are submerged and the world is ruined and these badly need your brand "clean up" <br /> <br /> Winning a Monty soldier's clothing is a sad. WWII sufferers were more hateful than their shares, favoring leaders and soldiers as well. Some of them were angry for war crimes, such as the "war of aggression" started. <br /> <br /> This film is America's other evil temperaments when his creator suffered, Joe McCarthy was going to his earliest hearing in the 1950's <br /> <br /> <br /> I see, "crossfire" , Actor Robert Ryan saw how good it was. The real Robert Ryan was no Monty. He was great, underestimated under the great actors used. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" and after WWII America get a taste in the dark side. As well as see the late 40s America get better side flavor to see it. Robert Mitchem and Robert Young also play a leading role. Mrichim could play Rayan, he actually played psychopath in "Cape Fear".
