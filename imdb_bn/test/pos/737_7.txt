Widely known as "Do not Hide in the Basement" - It's a terrible 70's B-movie love that can actually pass as the version of "One Flu Over the Kaku's Nest". Although this movie seems to have nowhere to appear in the first hour of its runtime, however, I've enjoyed these enormous crazies and their various personalities and deficits - such as a former army sergeant, a lover of a plastic doll, a loving man obsessed with care, -child, and a Uninterrupted joke After a patient killed his head's doctor, a small sanatorium recruited new nurses to their under-staff facilities, who were immersed in residual "ticks" and explosions. Events gradually become newborn, but when patients start acting more unusual than usual ... you never know or you never know where the film is going, because it ultimately gives ultimate entertainment till the end! Several "twists" were felt forcibly and I could use more blood, but I really mixed this very low rated humor and awful mix. See it ...
