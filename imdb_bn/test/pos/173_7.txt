Fear of 80 is an absolute classic. It's not like any other, because it longs to kill pin shapes, wild eyes, psychological youths, against all big adults in the city. From the only pile of Gueus (80 gold) in a game of murderers and he tried to buy in the Blue Brothers, jointly with Jacques Blues among the younger girls. There is a third blonde boy, but whatever he keeps from the movie disappears. Violence from time to time is pleasurable and nicely scary. The giant gang of lively kids, though in some way, came in the way of additional planets, dumped dew-child children with little harmony, who did not think of using pistols, crosoms and swords to kill these small adults. Julie Brown (another city downlain not Julie Brown) shows her rack almost three times in her bedroom. This movie is a rare thing that I can not believe that I want to grow in the 80's. If I saw it as a child my absolute favorite movie has been there. Where does the end request? This movie is incredible. Find it at all costs.
