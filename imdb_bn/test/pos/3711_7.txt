Based on the short story by William Faulkner, the Oscar winner's short film (40 minutes), in December 1941, brought us to Tennessee in our small town. Looking for two brothers, 18 people and one egg of nearly 8 birds (probably one of the time, huge collector items for boys around south). Well, decided to enroll Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and big brother stomach. He gave his younger brother, Willie, his reward egg and wanted to show more passion and tenderness in his little alleyt. Well, if Willy does not do this, Pitt can be a soldier, so he can. He went on to Memphis, showed his determination and determination, as he would also make several adults well along the way. After finding the enrollment center in Memphis, he demanded to see his brother, drag a knife on Lieutenant and injure him in the process. We are shown a small brother (Jonathan Furr) devotion and love. He delivers a stupid performance of the yesteryear gentler times as a cruel strong-deliberate boy. The film tries and makes the success of most brother's fans and the importance of family bonding successful. Since the two brothers are soon resurrected, the film provides a sincere tone, because the brotherhood binds us all. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a cold bottle. Perhaps Dasani or Akafina, clean, clear water with a delicious mineral packet, but not pure natural spring water like Ivy. Yet, it tears you thirsty and you do not doubt the effect of its purity and kompan. It runs more than matches and is less expensive, but completes the task, after refreshing it and later disconnecting. 7/10
