Yes, Singaporeans do not see any big deal about this movie. Some references to this movie fly directly from the head of foreign viewers and most Singaporeans can actually 'get' it. But I request you a foreigner, check out another whip out of Singapore and compare it with this movie. It is compared to a date diamond in comparison to a diamond. This picture really shows some converts in Singapore - something to say, the plays do not exist. And there is a part in this movie where a gangster (our unique conversation 'Ingris' in Ah-band) in four languages ​​is Shariat English Male and Hokkian. Well the truth is that most of us can and do not have time all the time. Sadly, foreign viewers of the foreign contrived to get their oily fowl easily on this gem, in their original country, it was initially banned, only given and R-rated and it has more than 20 discounts. It is good to let you know that one of the best, creative, lively and original films produced will be easy for you to achieve incompatible, unrestrained receptions; Half of all around the world than your own.
