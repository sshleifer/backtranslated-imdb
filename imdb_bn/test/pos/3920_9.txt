Probably the horror film of 5 years .. Lum has been remixed, you are trying to get scared (when they do what you do when you move away from the theater) and movies that should not have been made. But this one is worth it. Paris Hilton is in it because only because I could not give it 10 (but his death scene is made for it, trust me). <br /> <br /> So they spoke here ... of all the movie's death scenes. <br /> <br /> 1. My favorite death scene - Paris Hilton! After sitting on the ground with her girl-sticks, her boyfriend, Black, began to run away. Well, walking more speed is more respectable. He finds it like a garage with all these cars. Then (one) the killer cut his ankle from below (this whole time shes holding a huge metal spike) so he drops it and runs behind this car and hiding it. The killer loves it and shows it through the window as he has thrown it through the window and it shoots through his forehead. I will never be so excited or so disappointed in my life. <br /> <br /> 2. Pag's boyfriend Blake gets a knife stolen in his neck and then the killer walks towards him (when he quarrels over the ground) and his steps push forward his neck. Then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3 Elisa Cuthbert (Curley) (PHEW one of the best girls of all time) does not die, but she encounters her lips together with a lot of glue, and gets the index finger of her index. ) 4. Carlin's twin brother Nick survives, but his ass gets hurt and hurt on foot. <br /> <br /> 5. Nicks are throwing down a flight to the best friend Downtown Stairs, and then are decapitated. He pulled his body and we saw his eyes blurred. Then he covered the wax. <br /> <br /> 6. Wade (curly boyfriend) snatches her Achilles curly with huge scissors, and then gets attacked by the same scissors. He did not die, but covered the wet makeup, and his skin was suddenly removed 2 times, his nasty bloody flesh was released. Yummy. <br /> <br /> so it's there. Definitely work your money.
