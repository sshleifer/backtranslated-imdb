This picture is one of the most tragic and painful horror films of my life. This movie is based on the real story and the cruel assassination of Jeffrey Dahmar (Karl Kru) is enough to bring a tear to my eyes. I acknowledge it was a low budget movie with the least dialogue, but it explains why Jeffrey Dahmar was a psychotic panic. He became a murderer so much that he went so far in his brain so selfish / internally mentally his passion and selfishness. The person who returned to his apartment, was attracted and had feelings for him, and why he killed them was not simply thrilling to kill them, because he could not deal with the truth of their leaving them. . When he killed the first victim in this scene, I noticed that I noticed that he wanted to kill him, because he wanted to kill him, but the man was devastated with the idea of ​​leaving him. Since then, he used suicide for his behavior and killed his hobbies for both evil and mental. <br /> <br /> When he was crying to his mother, he was watching the scene. He loved her and how she showed love to her grandmother and how she did not want to go out of her house shows that she loved her heart. A scene that I got quite wonderful and strange, when a priest invited Jeffrey to Pub to his apartment and invited a caller in PAB to Jeffrey, so that he lost patience and changed his mind. At home with Jeffrey. When the man left Pub, the priest began to pull the phone and started laughing at Jeffrey. I have seen that Karl crew played a remarkable acting performance as Jeffrey Dahmar's role. Before his death, his bad and cold facial expressions were so real that I was entering my seat. His facial expressions reminds me Vincent D'Ophriyo (Private Pile / Leonard) in the film 'Full Metal Jacket', just before shooting the General in the toilet barracks. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to recommend you to watch this movie, but if you do not, then go ahead and see it.
