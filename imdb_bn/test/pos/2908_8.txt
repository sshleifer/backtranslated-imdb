This was a big hit in Fox's view, released in 1954. Produced in harmony with great music and set, playful cast, it continues to slow, but interestingly. Edmund Paramedum is an Egyptian who is a famous doctor who woke up three wonderful women: Suddenly Jean Simmons, who persecuted her, seduced her to Bella Darvie, and the sister of the forum Jean Tienen who called her as his forefather. Repeating at AMC (especially widescreen), because the popularity of the movie has not been reduced. The voice is full of fullness, his character is apparently striking with women, and not married and ending a "thinker". The role of Darby in her femme fatale is amazing and tantalizing. Victor mature, starring Michael Wilding, including Peter Ustinov. See it
