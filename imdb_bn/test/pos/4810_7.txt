This film is a frustrating change of speed from Hong Kong triangle movies which I was so tired. There are no spectacular gun battles. No car And functioning briefly functioning briefly. The listener remains mostly in the mystery, although some aspects of Andy Lau's so-called "rice" are quite clear. <br /> <br /> The picture was congratulated for the departure of violent triangle. Film, and as a "cute" crime film. A level, it is. But, in some cases, it still fails to test "credibility". In one second Andy Lauer's women can not be fooled enough to see a trio member through disguise. It seems that "if someone gets seriously ill, some people will eat blood plenty of blood." Chinese movies are always going on. <br /> <br /> The delicate relationship is a refreshing change between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> All enjoyable movies, although the concept is not new and there are some surprises. >
