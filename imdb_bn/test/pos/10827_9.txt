Sponsored by it, it is one of the longest-time classical recreational action / comedy / romance movies, which reminds me of the unexpected old "Saturday-afternoon" movies, which was just the perfect balance of unexpected twists, time humor and integrated action Outside, we have knowledge about the context of this film. It has the same content of "Casablanca", but just how many characters will really understand what is happening in their country (and the world) and understand the consequences of some of their own behaviors. It adds a strong note of humorous humor (we think that one of the female characters changes their childhood in the future). This is a movie that you will not be sorry to see.
