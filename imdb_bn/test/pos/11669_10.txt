I am surprised to wonder how a filmmaker is infamous for his political leftist barbarism, such as creating a fine, non-sacred picture. If you are on the death penalty, you will use it for it after seeing it. If you're against the death penalty, you'll still be against it. But whatever your opinion, this movie, at least, reflects on why you think your opinion. There is no false note in the film.
