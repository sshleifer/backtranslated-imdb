Thought spirit, humility of the human disaster of war. A small, but elaborate view of the inter-relations of a family with the enemies during Kentucky's civil war. This film "glamor" reduces the war; It is affecting not just soldier but whole family unit. <br /> <br /> Most of today's films show war as an opportunity to highlight "heroes" and other interesting features of the war, but very few attempts to show actual influence in the fight actually take place in a community. This film tries to restore it through a person's memories of those days. Indeed, this film is probably hundreds of true facts, thousands of "real facts" during civil war, this film is said to be a short translation of real events. I highly recommend those who are interested in our civil war for watching this movie.
