I'd love to hear from director Barbet Schroeder, why did he create more of his first film, and especially about his interest in Hippie - or why he was interested in this form of euro-hippie paradise and his death? Film, at least, is quite true to be interested in one, but it is strange, biased in its own truth. This is a given heroin (ur, "horse") horror element, harmful, conclusions for most stupid drug users, which can be seen as all-end, because it is basically because everything remains after that, that life becomes, and This is the continuous run for the same death or death. There is more about romance between New York's girl and a German guy, but it becomes better or worse (sometimes in both cases). <br /> <br /> It is basically about two "young" people, Estelle and Stefan, who stepped into a city like Stefan hiding away from his home country. He can be very fragile, arranged, and very friendly with a big time crusher named Woolf. After they finish somewhere near a remote island and, after Estelle grabbed some bold for some "horses", they find a pad in the form of a seemingly remoter house along the beach. Schroeder's comments on young people and on sex and drugs are not easy, which many years later the film actually makes it cute and intelligent. It's more straightforward and subtle about the character, and then what he's seeing can only be a promotional suppression-free picture on the other hand. Probably most joyful, and it is a hypothetical, as used in the long sequence of Monica with Bergman's summer as a prelude to Scroodor's: In an unexpected connection to two kids, some good things are definitely not good, very well shot (too?) Old shots visible <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will mention that there is a problem, actually something big. Performance is not very believable throughout; In some scenes some power is reduced or the actors are in good relation with each other, but Claus Grabgard himself expresses himself even though he used a Germanic language of nature (in this case I liked Claus Kinsky to insinuate it, but deep for it) As the farmer has his own degree. And there is a casual gap in scrapple which can hold it deeper because it really seems. On the other hand, two big things are going for: Nestor Almonds, a great filmmaker (i.e. heaven's day) a big improvement as the first time director, such as DP and Scrooder. Almost every image is viewed with a great purpose or artistry, it is as simple as a shot of rock or a room's natural light by the sea or by the sun. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It's a very good music all the time, sometimes a mind-blowing diversity that gives them the respect they deserve. Some of it is a little tedious, even a movie that is free love and lots of medicines and at the same time both are concerned. I will not rank it anywhere in a magical place like Maddell or animal, of course it is not Dark Side, but it helps to make matters even better, especially when it is at least at least a tone or outside the building inside and outside the building. As Stefan or another walkway on the street. The film is a better atmosphere than itself, but it is also valuable, but effective, for less than aspirational but more significant as Zabriskie points, for more than a whole time.
