When I was making this movie, I got a statement about it on television. Like: "Is Killinggangate now shutting down Nazism?" <br /> <br /> So, my understanding of this movie, from the beginning, was the idea of ​​Nazim. Recently in the TV-version of this movie I had this filter before seeing it and it was not hard to see. <br /> <br /> When I was curious I could not explain this movie. First heard <br /> <br /> I found these things in "four shades of brown". The lack of sympathy between the four stories has happened: <br /> 1. Cremation workers do not show realistic sympathy to dead animals or those who say goodbye to the dead. It is almost like a colorful game in the toilet room associated with death. According to the seriousness of death and fire, not stressed by the father and his son, imposing a button in ignorance which pushed his father to a fatal disaster. Possible Lessons: The importance of showing young is enough emotion. When they grow up, they should know that any behavior creates disasters and that any emotion is good. <br /> <br /> 2. The magician uses his wife as an invisible doll. When he thinks he has started cutting the string in the hands of the master, he has reached for personality, honesty and happiness, he works hard and he comes back to solitude and despair. <br /> <br /> Their son has tried to rebel against his "bad" taste of his parents and to make his life a "good" taste. His father's behavior, far away from the actual problem he is carrying, passes his hatred towards his wife in his shameless environment. Possible Lessons: Torture Ties <br /> <br3 When the child was tortured, the child suffered from his child, when he betrayed them in their inheritance. He robs his childhood and his inheritance even to the end. Possible lessons: When giving a love you can not give <br /> 4. The misuse of his parents creates a cruel retaliation with his rogue aggression. Here ice cold Nazi-mood becomes very clear in physical violence. It is a possible background and some of the "skin-head" of young people, when they are oppressed, give some reasonable explanation of the behavior of the experts. <br /> <br /> possible read? : Can Nazmium be born in a distorted home? <br /> <br /> The horrific consequences of ignoring the sympathy of family life for a long time, is that room given to Atheist Nazism? <br /> <br /> There are a lot of movies to rarely have. I meditate on it as it expresses little by little. I consider it brilliantly "painted" and the actors are fantastic. Wolf Blurberg looks particularly the best visible block.
