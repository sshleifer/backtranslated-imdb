Compilation: Andrés (Trend Fausa Arpagh) is seen alone in the coach, lying on the desert soil, which seems to be the last stop for his journey. He did not know how he came here, but he was welcomed. After thinking about her position temporarily, she is greeted with a man who takes her away with her new life. Then he came from to enter into a different world. <br /> <br /> After underscoring quickly with his new job as an accountant, he realizes that his surroundings are very similar to his favorite. As he took his first lunch break, he immediately notices that everyone in the city turns around gray suit. On the same day, he saw a fellow businessman dead on some fence spikes, which seems to be an act of suicide. The strange thing is, the city does not pay attention to this terrible thing and continues as it does not happen. These are quickly found that these people are genetically sensitive, and they do not have the ability to differentiate between human or inhuman. <br /> <br /> To help Undersas, she is invited to go to the local nightclub with her colleagues. The club is one step away from being Bingo Night, and Andres drinks his tragic way, he understands how much alcohol he drinks, alcohol does not affect him. In a man's house, a stranger is in this comment because, in the toilet coil, a man starts talking about Andrew's mind. Realizing this person, he came to his house and noticed where he was for future reference. The plot evolves with predictably an escape from André To find the person he followed once ... He hoped that he could become human again ... but is it too late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This Norwegian film is something that everyone will see as the answer to big questions! What is the meaning of life? (Well, close enough). This picture portrays dark reality that has become the working man (or female) of today. This is the only purpose that people can understand that life is too short to be materialist. It tries to show little things, such as the kids' playing kids should not be allowed, because at that moment you can not hear the word, at that moment you will be a moment away from being robot. The end of the movie took place when Munde was too late to get rid of the routine, which you have now used. If you do not break 'do not fix it', start accepting it, and be very comfortable to take the risk of change. <br /> <br /> This picture will not be taken as part of the reality ... its message is real ones. The lack of sympathy has been revealed in this film, and what Andreas sees, is a bold statement of how to become a life. The director, Jens Lien, has made a film together, which may fail in another handy handwriting. It's a fine part of cinematic jeans, and I'm eagerly waiting to see his next work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Played Treva Fausa Oravg Representing the average Joe, Trond provides a good catalyst to this picture dark ridiculous. Supporting actors also work properly and for some reason I think Kenyue Reese was perfect in this film, because most supporters would be uncomfortable with their acting. <br /> <br /> Score This image was composed nicely. The repetitive theme was always happy to hear, and it was a very scary but welcomed the movie. <br/> <br/> To determine the date of release in the UK on 25th May, 2007, I must go back to life again on this big screen. This picture has come up in my top ten ... now it's fast becoming my top 20! It has some dazzling scenes, and humorous in the dark ... a must- !!
