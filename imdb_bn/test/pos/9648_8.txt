It's not like a historical movie, it's not a movie of unforgettable love stories, it's not a movie with a spectacular scene, but I'm sure it's a movie with a great atmosphere ... <br /> <br /> It was 60 types of Bohemian and rebellious souls: A group of friends living in a poor apartment in Paris, everyone is making art, world To ribartana dreaming, drugs, and loving his own way. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of patience to see and a special mood, if you are not in it you can get it very annoying and dull. I like the very realistic way of events that happened and their immediate effect on the lives of students: fear for their future, the difficulty of their livelihood, the obstacles to follow their dreams. <br /> <br /> Black and white pictures of what I like Still the camera angle was amazing, they were like cold moments. It gave me the impression of a long slideshow of old and very emotional and consultative photographs. I was watching the movie again, just taking that amazing screen-shot. <br /> <br /> Beautiful one word ...
