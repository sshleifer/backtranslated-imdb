Overall, the father's army film is very funny, although humorous like TV and radio series is not very interesting and fantastic. So this leaves us, visitors? If you have never seen the father's army, then the film is a great way to get into the crazy world of Walmart and S / P and join it. The negative side is that you can not "get it" because, I said, somewhat in the movie's ridiculous strong side <br /> <br /> <br /> A short series of TV series, But this is a unique opportunity to see your choices in "High Def" compared to the variety of BBC video recordings. <br /> <br /> This film will be the lowest hold-up sequence in the history of the universe. Although it is a positive or negative, I can not make my mind.
