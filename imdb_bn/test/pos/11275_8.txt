After all, it is an art film and it's a good one. I like the presentation and the way it has been shot. Very cold Some scenes I've ever seen were some of the more graphic horror sequences. This movie does not make me scared because it is not due to breathing or shock, because I died that I could see something soon. That happen in a few places, but mostly at the beginning. This picture is dragged and takes 74 minutes. However, if you are in film then you have to see it. To date, I saw nothing like it. 8/10
