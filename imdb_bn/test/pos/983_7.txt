All right, I will admit that if I do not have a baby, I would never see this movie and did not see it. However, I have seen that all rotten kids consider the movie (such as Speed ​​Kids 2 or Bab: PIG in the City), it is a significant improvement. And, it was enough that I was not completely disturbed by my freak or thinking of suicide (I have repeatedly done some other films). Of course, the performance is quite broad and the plot is stupid - but it's a kids movie And, compared to other series of the series, it is obviously more than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bain actually seem to have some talent and probably will continue their career after young people - at least doing an infirmary or voice-over. <br /> <br /> So, if you look for a movie with your kids, you can certainly make a lot worse!
