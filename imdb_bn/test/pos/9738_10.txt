I saw Flash Gordon Serial in PBS, and it was funny and horrible, I ignored the special effects of rocket ships and the Big Dragon giant of Lobster bird, who cared about it and it was serial in 1936. So each week they will show a new chapter, Flash Gordon played 3 Serials all the time at the Baster Crabb. Then in 1932, he played Boca Rogers, in 1933 he played a fearless act of Tarzan. He was very busy actor. Sexy Dale Ardenen. Frank Shannon as Professor Zarkov and Charles Midlton brutally played Bad Ming. He sees Darth Vader as a boy. The series was very close to the Alex Raymond comic strip. Space trips were only a pipe dream. Time to mention guns and television. Which ever stands as the best serial. Siegel Flash Gordon's Tuesday's journey was just two chapters, just 12 chapters winning the next flash Gordon universe. And then its native Mongo .., Hawa-men, lion-men, shark-m en.the feature version finds shark-men's view. For full effect you will see full serial. George Lucas was inspired by Flash Gordon when he fought the star. Flash Gordon was from the public studio. And soundtrack music from many universal films like Frankenstein's Bride, Werewolf London, Dracula's Girl, etc.; Even today, Gordon continues to delight young and old people. 10 out of 10
