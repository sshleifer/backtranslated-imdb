This is a fantastic movie and has been immediately put in my top ten (believe me that I know the movie!). This is a movie that really makes you think, not about the story itself! The film is about 15 years old (Leland Fitzgerald) who killed an autistic son. She has sent the girl where she called her teacher Pearl Madison. His relationship with Perl gradually increased and finally decided to write the story of Pearl Leland and his colleagues, but when Leanders came near to find out the purpose, he first came to know that his own problems must be addressed first. <br /> <br /> It will be a great film and watch with great music by a pixie and a fantastic score! Look at it!
