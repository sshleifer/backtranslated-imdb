I work in a movie theater and every Thursday night we were shown a movie which comes the next day ... today it was The Guardian. I saw the trailer and ad and did not expect much from it, and in any way I expected to see this movie. Out of the good acting this movie was more than I thought a lot. It was a great story first of all. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Coster did a great acting role in this movie. Being a big fan of the 70s, I always saw such a difficult kind of cures like Kirster, but despite the fact that he played Katroto's Butterfly Effect, but after this film, I think I can finally see him as a serious actor. <br /> <br /> It was also a great tribute to the US Coast Guard's incompetent heroes.
