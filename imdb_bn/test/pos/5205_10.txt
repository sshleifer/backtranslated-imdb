Along with less budget, more than 50 Germans never see in one scene, at the same time, two half tracks, this movie is a full top quality. Everything is right. What I think, from the uniform to horror and confusion. Everyone is gray like gray gray uniforms. Gray men with life are finding them out. Gong ho ho ho blabak down and private ryan have forgotten This is one of the best war films ever. Just pull it on iron cross and find it for the story. Could you have a correct non-dubbed German language with English subtitle versions in the UK? Harmful import from Europe without charge. Most of the other DVDs are multilingual. Why is this one?
