Are you crazy or what? Is there a genius in this movie who criticizes a film made by famous director and producer? I mean, you are definitely looking at some vague versions because if you had the correct version, you would not think of some low resolution game graphics. <br /> <br /> This movie is enjoying the Hong Kong film on the other hand, Asian people enjoy watching observers. If you are selling like this .. Hong Kong movies are completely different from Hollywood that is, HK cinema is in a class of its own ... <br /> <br /> If you are not Hong Kong Enjoy watching movies from the producer and do not argue about how it would be a waste of time .. just another man enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> And personally I saw this movie and I love his story and the way it has been made.
