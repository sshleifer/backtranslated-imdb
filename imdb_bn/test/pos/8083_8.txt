"The Viscus Circle" is a very unknown British mystery story. Like many hitkk movies, it is about a person who is not being accused of any crime and can do all he can to prove it. This time it is a Dr. Latima (John Mills), who found a murderer German actress from her floor. As an honest man, the doctor phoned Scotland Yard, which could be a big mistake ... <br /> <br /> This short film does not really have anything special. Still, the time to look at the film is an entertaining way to pass. I enjoyed following the development of the plot. Fine actor is a plus.
