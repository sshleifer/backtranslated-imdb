I watched this movie a second time with this 8-year-old girl and I remember why we liked it for the first time. All these people who think it's bad are very high and critical! It's not just an entertaining little movie, it is not supposed to change the world. I have done a great job with all of their characters in their actors. (Except Jeremy Jordan as Guy - he was a handy person who looked seriously at the need for soap and shampoo, if he could be a hot guy in his school but they have thin picons.) - Drew Barry was naturally happy and David Arquette was even enjoyable and I Usually its static it and the commercial can not only bite him! Molly Shannon is always entertaining, and Lely Sobieski has done a great job as a tortured brain. Some parts were really painful, remind me at high school. Although I have not been amused with gratitude, my heart hurts for those who do it. These movies are really good to see children - My daughter has observed a number of things about the cruelty of the students and how wrong it was. This movie is suitable for anyone and for a good way to stay 2 hours away. If you do not want to think too much then there is a time to see a lovely little movie, but it is definitely a consideration.
