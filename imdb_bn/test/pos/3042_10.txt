I watched this film on TV in 25 years ago and it has been revived with me since then. My interest recently visited Hilton Head - by reading "Yamakra" (from Dowfusky) to the next island and Pat Conroy's excellent "Water Wide Wide". With the benefit of knowledge I have recycled the Concrete and it is a wonderful composition. John Voight conveys the spirit of Cono, and the film's atmosphere makes the book live with some accuracy - Hollywood's rareness. <br /> <br /> Three things about this story have still diminished me: 1. The education of the poor and impoverished and educated is the same. 2. Education is more than reading and writing. 3 .. These kids were my colleagues, I spent the year at the age of 6 in the year 1969, in the year of Pat Quarre, Daufusi. <br /> <br /> Why is it not yet made in DVD?
