There are many mistakes with this photo. I will not lie I would say that most of the problems seem like they are standing in a budget that has been cut down from Flickr and editing some bad hack work. <br /> <br /> This is not the office space. Do not expect comedy's office space levels. It's so funny though. It's a mess, but at the same time very funny. A picture is a funny mess. How CadSack is Interesting A mess of incomplete fun scenes filled with some bizarre strange scenes. <br /> <br /> This works perfectly, and it definitely has a wide release. This is your best comment about Wall Mart / Starbucks / MTV race which you can expect. The image is exploring the idea that intelligent people are breeding at a hazardous rate when conscious people are not born, it's great in my book. Not very politically correct, but at least the price of some debate.
