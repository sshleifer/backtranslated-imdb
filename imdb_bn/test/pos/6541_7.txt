I assume that if we're a car fan, a racing challenger's word is growing along the road but the word is heard, the word 57 is shouting when it tears around the angle, and, most, it sounds as a classic vehicle explosion Burst as bursts bursts I'm the biggest car enthusiast by no stretch of imagination, but any of the above is really my engine rev! The importance of transportation in the movie can not be denied. Even it has been said that the invention of the train was one of the greatest effects of the first movie (the concept of passing a window like a moving image and sending it from another time / space). But the car is the most popular and most ruthless, it has even got its own style: Carpalotation genre. A beauty that focuses entirely on the beauty of the car. Actually, it's just obscene! Car porn! And I'm not talking about the broken documentary than the Channel 4 where men were actually involved in sex with the car. Whatever your floats ... car, I guess. Moving ... When MMP is run, it's not as vulgar as Vanishing Point (Richard C. Surfian, 1971), as the shutdown of the car is in motion, all its hurdles and curves (!), This does not mean that the film's main Not focus. In fact, cars make themselves characters. They are objectified and fetishized as much as women, in fact, even more. And holy is holy, some of these cars! Every car in this film (except in the background) is simply beautiful ?? Due to artwork, there is no question about it. <br /> <br /> I was saying, these incredible cars, in the same way, have been given letters. You actually start sympathy with the car! Speaker Especially during the scene that the car was destroyed and burned the spinner. It has often become a convention of the Carpalotation genre; Nifty Little Mini Cooper Friendly Foxewagen Beat LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) from Primauth Furi Cristin (John Carpenter, 1983), Cheon's custom Lincoln Mark III (Eliot Silverstein, 1977), Italian JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) and Of course, each car had its own character from Death Race 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even Wakie Reses (1968-1970). Wickedly, this emphasis on the car often takes the character (!) Of man! And this must certainly be in conformity with the MPTI, in which only one person's character (the blind character who drives his vehicle without listening to him) has a level of magnitude, the rest are very much stock characters. All of this is your stereotypical Australian 1980s teens; Big hair, annoyance, and someone look out of Nimbours, especially Kylie Minogue look-like. But who gives a blame? It's all about racing and crashing cars! That's it! If you do not like that you are actually watching the wrong style. <br /> <br /> Car Scene is certainly the selling point of this movie and the best thing to do for it. They are fast; Very fast! And we're not talking about the annoying tactics, but it seems to be using some movies where they record the speed at about 40 meters and then it increases speed. Oh no! You do not have to do with this film. Are these cars zooming along the real-time top speed ?? Here is no fancy editing strategy. So, we have speed. Check out. What about the crash? Check, check, check! Although the car is unlikely to break the car, it is impossible to blues brothers Brothers (John Landes, 1980), where these cars crash! It seemed as if they were using a lot of powder or as a small blow and the carbohydrates burned in the fire. This reminds me of the thriller: the meaning of an angry image (Bo Arn Vobbanias, 1974). <br /> <br /> This simple awesome scenery (especially the very beginning and the very end) is a few scenes that are all slow and, in my opinion, are unable to add too much to the film. Note: Need more explosion cars! But here are some wonderful scenes that are great scenes here? SPOILER Especially try the rape scene. <br /> <br /> So all, this is a human film! A boy's film! Foam to fill the foam behind and throw a few of the tits for very good measurements. I'm the bike driver (!) Even if anyone would recommend this small film ?? This is a great movie that you can simply switch your brain, sit on your leather chair and keep the full volume! I would give it 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs ?? Bruuuuum! Ps ?? Does Amazon just sell this for Â£ 2 ?? This is a real deal though the DVD lacks any special features.
