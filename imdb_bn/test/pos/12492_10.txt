The film, "Queen Des Arfres", directed by the bright Henry-George Clujot, is a famous film, because it is the best annotation of French filmmaking in poster years. Stamen's novel "Longtime Defense" adapted M. Cloot, he showed his novel that he set the story and how he interconnected all the letters of this deeply satisfied film, such as DB Dumont, mentioned in this forum, how powerful it is in Klujote and how borrowers in the next generation of French generation filmmakers, especially Claude Chibrol , It shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We saw recently. Working with Clauset, Thirteen maximizes dark tones and shadows in most of the original view. Francis Lopez's music, which created light music and oprah in France, works well in the context of the film, because the music hall and knight clubs are taken around the world. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, which is seen as a police detective, is perfect in part. This was an epic of French actors, an actor is one of the best screen appearances. Jovet had clearly understood for the creator of his police inspector who could see the soul of the wise and his suspects deeply and ultimately steal the show from others. In an inappropriate comment by someone on this page, the visitor of the jubilee is compared to Peter Falk's Colombo, TV detective. Frank, and Mr. Folk have no disrespect, this is a good champagne compared to the good cell wine. <br /> <br /> Bernard Blayer is perfect as jealous husband. Blier was the kind face that could be assembled with people to feed with passion in her face Jenny Lamour awake. Martineau does not work weakly and reasonably; He is a simple suspect because he has done some crime that he has not committed any crime, but all the evidence points out the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> Another great character in the film, the striker, photographer. How does it interact with Jenny? Simone Renant is sadly attractive as this sad woman and makes remarkable contribution to the film. Jenny playing Suzie Delayer, who suddenly ran from obscurity to celebrity and Brinton attracted people like old lecture, applied as a singer. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best chloroids of its time, it is the way to bring together all the elements, because everlasting life and one will live forever.
