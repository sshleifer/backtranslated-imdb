AH is my favorite movie ... I have seen this many times (do not remember counting now) and every time I like it .... This is the best movie of Raj Kumar Santoshi. This comedy, dialogue, and performance are extraordinary .. All actors and actresses did a fantastic job ... You can not stop smiling while watching this movie ... it's just ridiculous ... Aamir Khan and Salman Khan did a great job. And Paresh Rawal's performance was always excellent ... the music inspired from the old Hindi film (60 songs) and the good ... The whole cast of the movie has done a great job ... <br /> Overall it is a great Indian comedy movie ...
