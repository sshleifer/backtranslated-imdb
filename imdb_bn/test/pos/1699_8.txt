Some people say that this film is not bad, it's actually more enjoyable than the original. Maybe that's why it hates some people that they do not want to accept it as a "good (not good)" movie. <br /> <br /> If there are not all FX in Singapore, in most cases I do not think it was an enjoyable movie at all. Phil Bacamman - (Chris) My opinion was that Julie Daly's best man was rather attractive than filming in the movie. <br /> <br /> There were many advertisements in this movie that I think is good. This movie is in my collection but is not real because I do not like it. When I watched this movie, I was not bothered, it showed me something horrific film, which I can say, like Oh = driller killer and sauseria (The movie of Dario Argonto) but two numbers. <br /> <br /> It's a good way to be in the collection of people if they like the Wearoff movie, but maybe I can get the original sometime. I have only one complaint and Phil Bacamman - (Chris) was more than that but the film should have been next to him. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " <br /> <br />
