I do not usually like to watch movies while at the price of tickets, but I saw a poster poster for some things, and I thought, "The young actress who feels intelligent and mysterious, does not like normal blonde BS". So I agreed to take a crown and see this movie on its opening night. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you, I'm really surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I did not really know what it would be like, but the bourgeois' negative emotions and honest teenage experience made me satisfied instead of my decision. Alberta Watson has done outstanding work as a copper ill ill mother and I want to add that I was very impressed with the comedic styling of Megan Park as a friend of Tamara Brenda. <br /> <br /> This picture was marvelously directed by Gail Harvey and was drawn together as Casci 50 which makes you feel warm and happy, although the story is not so uptick. I thought that this movie was shot well, I remember many beautiful pictures of the country's 1950s for a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The whole picture was diverse and awesome. I thought it was unpredictable and even though the story ended in some open-ended way, I was still satisfied. Whether you're looking for a funny, yet powerful old story, or just want to remember life in the 1950's, I'm sure this movie is for you. Even if you do not have any expectations, it will still be very impressive. Give this a shot!
