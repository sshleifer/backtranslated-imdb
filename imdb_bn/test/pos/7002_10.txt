It's the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen in the year without doubt! Asampurna a ship with more than three plots shown in print in the desert sun causes degradation of the planet, living landscape, and to adjust to each other, and then the dark and monsters are present. Pilot Fry, after the unbearable moment of being descended from the atmosphere, when he won almost the passengers, the team was in charge, and the culprit helped Ridic to escape through the dark for help - he could see the darkness with the surgery that the improved eyes But it is not really easy - Each character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting features, so you never know who's good and who's bad. /> <br /> superb acting together <br - Radha Mitchell looks to for leadership Stealing fries, depending on one's fear and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Hausa Cole, who has returned to the custody of ridikake its own agenda and its Has its own illogical value. But the film ridikera Win related to diesel - the most magnetic screen presence, I have seen over the years. Overshadow his face for most of the film, and the fact that he is not a big thing, but also to attract your attention. Sometimes he draws your attention by not talking - or moving. And diesel does not despise her character, as it can be done easily, giving her "heart of gold" - Reedic is still a middle and wicked man while reaching the ship. He lets us see that first instant step only to take care of yourself to care for others. <br /> <br /> Technically, film is very good. The light effect spectrum is excellent on both sides - overbright triple sunlight and pitch darkness. The special effects shown by both the ridics and monsters add to the mystery, such as using the flying sound of monsters and using "ultrasound" (monsters spontaneously efficient and dangerous). Edit so strong that it is often shocking - this film does not have any padding, there is no fading, do not have time to restart itself. <br /> <br /> From the first shot keep your wits about you until the end of your achievement. Each scene, each line of dialogue, is important in every single camera shot. See it all three times to understand. <br /> <br /> My only warning about science - the solar system shown as a model is impossible (the planets revolve around the sun, not the opposite). However, that does not affect the stories of people, so I was not taking points for it.
