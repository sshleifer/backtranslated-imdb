Kinks are warned about media heroes. Outside the movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people" The Society claims to play some role, but what happens when it comes to parental-child relationship? Will some parents try to improve their children instead of the opposite? How do you make a role model but not the role? Those who hate hate in a bright swimming; A brilliant musician who will not play. Offbeat, funny (despite the "serious" problem drawing), played by everyone very well played multidimensionally. Plot twists plenty of stress supplements. Celluloid heroes do not feel any pain. I'm never frustrated by the Sigourney Beaver film (I like "The Village"!).
