Tonight full moon? Oh! No matter that they can change that drug when they are! If I used to think the full moon tonight! Geez <br /> <br /> I really like this movie, romance, mystery, awesome, and hot stuff;) I love the first half of the movie when the man kills the girl with the bungee jumping and protects her from being captured. . That was really cool. Setting up this movie is a love city in Paris, France. The cemetery scene is wonderful, it does not let you know what will happen to the cold behind the wall. The scene that gives you jump from your seat is really cool. They even got me to that scene. The friend who died and she killed the girl in the graveyard but still shows herself the character of leadership (sorry I forgot her name), was really fun. The actor has done a good job plus make-up crews. When they are all partners in abandoned churches, I can not believe that it is a abandoned church but it is still God's house. I bought this movie a long time ago, and I'm sorry for buying it. I'm a scary-movie lover. I give this movie 5 stars out of 6. For those who open and love these movies, try it, you can like it.
