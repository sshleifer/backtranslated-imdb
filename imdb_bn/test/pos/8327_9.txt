If you have not seen it yet, you must do this in DVD. I can not believe how much I enjoy it! It's amazing, realistic and trustworthy. In fact, most of it is thought to be and I want to know more about the 70's and what was proven, but it is very well managed with a "cruel mother nature" theme. . This will remind you about the nature programs shown on animal planets and discovery channels, only animals are dinosaurs. They do natural work; They eat, kill, partner, play, and fight for survival. You actually get rooting against some of them and others. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the effect is excellent. Occasionally they will look a bit like CGI, but then you will see them in a different corner which makes them feel more realistic. In some cases, you'll be really sure that you've seen a dinosaur. There were my favorite colophies, rapper, diplodocus, iguanadons, allosaurus and arctic bipeds. I was quite disappointed with T-Rex, but sometimes the computer looked a little less. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is educational, well-made, and very entertaining. What's this, one of it!
