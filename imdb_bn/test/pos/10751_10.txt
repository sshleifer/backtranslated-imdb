I really enjoyed this old black and white baggy. At first I did not recognize Harold Lloyd, who was a missionary to come to China to find a wife. Mr. Hall is clean. There was a lot of turn and turn in Kobe's efforts. His method of criminal punishment is likely to be illegal, but it is not a movie based on reality. It will be suitable film for nudity other than women (only Pastegi in Grace Bradley)! The old telephone is funny. The only fault day is usually a problem - the Caucasians are used to represent Chinese men. This Chinese depiction is offset by positive ways. They are wise, good and friendly guys. Trivia - A Beacon truck is displayed in the movie when the police goes out of Black Maria.
