Do not expect a classic military comedy, which only demands military fun by increasing the views of the military. Instead it deconstructs the military elements to make such a killer machine. "Buffalo soldiers" like the Eastern German version <br /> <br /> "NVA" works on a meta level that it is sympathetic to its efforts to escape from its heroes' military drills in any way. It's not about laughs loud but about long lasting smiles. Ostrich, of course (you will be shown a harsh reality in one scene), but very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> To fill only the required 10 lines: If you are an army officer then do not go to that movie. And like your work.
