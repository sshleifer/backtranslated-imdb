This movie will be seen for the song, which is actually a wonderful canton composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Clearly, the original soundtrack is not whi-fi, but there are many great versions available in classical music selections. Cantata can be praised for its own sake, but it helps to show the film. <br /> <br /> The story is the ultimate ideal of the anti-Soviet anti-German anti-propaganda campaign. One interesting fact is that Stalin was interested in buying time by welcoming Hitler at the beginning of World War II that Eijenstein was sent for the second time in a German film for a second time. <br /> <br /> Prince Alexander Nevski (honored as a saint by the Russian Orthodox), defeated the Swedish attackers on the Neva River, earned his nickname, emphasized Russian resistance against attacks on the Titunik Knights, and to other winners, Ended the victory. An interesting scene: Alexander sees Russian czars as a slave of Mongolian soldiers, and Tietonic knights do nothing to stop them as their priority. Historian Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to the people of Mars while working for consolidating the future independence of his prince.
