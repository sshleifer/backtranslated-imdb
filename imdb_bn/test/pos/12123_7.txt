I do not know whether this review is fair for me. I'm not a fan of neutral violence. I do not understand the art industry making heroes out of film industry and cold bloody killers. After the godfather was out, I thought they broke the mold, but for several decades they have performed well with big stars and directors. This one is probably less budget, but it is certainly well done. All this time I think I would like to take a shower. If the character actually exists, it is difficult for the soul. I have always been intellectual that this kind of thing will rise above mankind. This kind of crusade has to be stopped. I hope people going to such movies are more scared and less hateful. I think the sort of slashher movie in the same way. Why do we have an affinity with death and separation? Absolutely, I'm judging it with acting and direction, and it seems like a good job for it.
