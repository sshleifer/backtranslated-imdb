I have seen a very long time one of the best movies. Burchard is a way to find things that are completely unique and this movie is not frustrating. <br /> <br /> This film is estimated to be lifelong on screen by addressing the banned topics and you have estimated it all the time. There are no bad guys or good guys, Bechard makes sure that. Characters are very complex, you feel for everyone, you care about what they are doing. <br /> <br /> There is no attention to the details of the trial in the world of "Fast Food Movies" and some things may be uncomfortable - you love the feeling you give it to you. <br /> <br /> I heard that it often says that there is no new story to tell. Thank you Germaine Bechard for proving false. Do not play <br /> <br />, can not see this movie.
