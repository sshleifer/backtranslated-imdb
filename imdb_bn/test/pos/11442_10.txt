This picture probably gave the most amazing surprise that I've ever seen. It was not the product of a big budget and its main foundation, medieval amateur jazz musicians got unexpected professional partnerships with Catskills, it seems less decent. The success of the film is not decent. It's a little slice-of-life movie that can be entertained throughout life. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script and it is packed with interesting subpotts and unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> Actors who work harder do the hard work. The greatest revelation to me was that of Clavan Little. A professional musician drama which he is hired to fill for a sick band member. His attitude immediately clashed with others. When they see it as a great opportunity to have fun and one-time lifespan, then they think of their work and are not particularly interesting. This leads to conflict but when the group gets hardship, he steers through them. Little, who died at a very young age, has really shown me that he is a fine actor with this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is really like a sleep, the movie fan always hopes to discover. I sincerely recommend it
