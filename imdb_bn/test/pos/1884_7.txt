It was a fun movie. Just a week ago I did not see Evil Dead Trilogy (and asking for more), I got a lot of Bruce Campbell films as I can really, which was really bad. This is one interesting fact, without exception, but as the origin of the hell is sure. <br /> <br /> I mean you're crazy scientist, superhuman cyborg, half brain fire, GPS, former kb cab driver, jealousy, murder passion, love, romance, sex, action and more, all with the same 6 actors <br /> <br /> <br /> If you really want to see it and enjoy it, I can not explain it in a text box. I think this is not a movie of many cultures like Evil Dead, but it certainly has Bruce Campbell's touch. Ted Riemy hands out, you are both beautiful and attractive (he has gone far away from Hooker on 13th Friday) and Vladimir Kolev has shown many commitments as an actor, although perhaps he will be acting as a secondary character. Her full career in the Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Funny movie. If you like Evil Dead, you'll also like it.
