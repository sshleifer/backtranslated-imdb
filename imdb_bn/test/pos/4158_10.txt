I had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (known now as "The Golden Door" in the United States) and it was fascinated by both the dreamy and occasionally supernatural stories of immigrant migration from the US to the US. 20th century It works as a (stimulant) medium finger in the fingers of Homeland Security (especially by the maximum number of fake), it depicts the ill-treatment of foreigners who want a better life than their motherland. (Mostly) Italian cast, works well with some exceptions. This is a cool, different picture which is beautiful to watch (occasionally, but the delicious use of the occult elements is always pleasant), when the script is well written. This is a film for Hollywood's sick and stupid hunger who gives more than selling popcorn (I do not have any flaws with popcorn, remember! --- I really like stuff!). You will be wise to find Nuovomondo / Golden Door (or whatever in your area heading whatever).
