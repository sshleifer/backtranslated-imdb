*** SPEAKER *** *** SPOKILLER *** I liked the set up and consistently smiled throughout the whole movie. Acting was great, being my favorite part (Kevin Kline) attempts to be a "human being". Fiance and parents did a great job as a support cast. Spoiler Alert: The attempts and acceptance of its conservative family are heartwarming and credible. Finally, my only problem was that Howard was gay. Setting up the movie as "who you want to be" set up, but the movie is actually opposite. Howard's argument behind his "discovery" is that he liked the movies of Barbara Streissand and enjoyed dance in music. His behavior and taste seem to be gay, and it can not be understood until it is directed to him. Instead of setting Howard Free, it paws him. Oh, he likes to be gay, to dance music. His confession in marriage turned to the will of the society. In the end, the film has become a gay rights film, which was not the main course. It becomes bland with the rest around. I believe, Howarda will make the film straight way better. It's truer message.
