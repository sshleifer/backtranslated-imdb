After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. I can say that it was good to wait! "Rio in Rao" could be the best Rock DVD that could be very good. I'm not kidding It's incredible! The word is false, but it does not make the concert obsolete. I think you actually see the concert from the audience in RIO. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. You actually feel like you are there. Also, JD, Alex and Blue were never the best form! Geddy's voice is flawless, Alex's guitar playing is still incredible, and Neil - absolutely no sound to say. I had to say that this concert camera work was very good. They were happy to see everything they were going on to the stage and to the audience. Camaraman kuds! However, my raving is enough! See "Rush in Rio" for yourself. You will be surprised. I guarantee it <br /> <br /> 10/10
