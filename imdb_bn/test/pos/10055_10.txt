I have to rate this movie at 10. I'm sorry but it seems to be the classic comedy. So, if you rated it in another Madonna movies ... well, what? Did you mean it was not his best movie? Mira Sourvino has not won an Oscar for the same performance after almost ten years? Please, this film is worth getting more than this credit. Plus, I like to think of it as a ++ social science research in the lifestyle of 80+. Remember, you can shop from Sam Goody and Cartier on the same day? Remember when women used to wear the proud eyebrows? So it was no "last emperor", it was still good. There are some movies I wish to see every day. Three, in fact, that peppe up my day and smile to me. If you want "Who is that girl?" Then I would recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle High School Reconciliation".
