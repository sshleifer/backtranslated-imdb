I do not have to go to this hospital for anything other than an order to leave the city [or hospice, if I want to be politically correct] [Which assault is the original phrase, anyway?]]. George C. Did an efficient job to burn an old job, who did a very cruel thing, who came to the conclusion that his life was wasted, but despite having a golden opportunity, he was helpless to change his environment or condition [which was probably not so golden]. I received several smiles from this brutally black comedy, but at the same time became rich and often cooled down because I think this atmosphere is written in most of the healing houses and I am writing.
