Dinosaur This documentary was undoubtedly fascinating and very good. However, I found myself a lot of observers with disruptions. The film has taken a firm determination rather than what it said and showed, but inevitably behaved animals, their interaction with each other, what they saw, how they walked, what they played etc. Guess - sometimes assume with reasonable confidence, sometimes just wild guesses. But the observer is never aware of it, the film actually looks like performing real dinosaurs and their practical behavior, which is probably better than seeing the audience with the waiver of the waiver, but it is just a little popular in my assumption.
