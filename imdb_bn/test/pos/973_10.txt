This is one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. A 14-year-old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper named "Big Fat Lear". When her skateboard was taken, her sister had to use the bike to go to college and hit Limo. When he went to Limo, he met Hollywood famous producer Marty Wolf. When he left Limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he had left his paper in Limo and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher did not believe him! So Jason and his friend Kyle went to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood, Marty admitted that he stole his story to Jason's parents. When Jason called Marty to his father, Marty stole that paper, Marty cheated him and burned his paper! Jason was so angry that Marty burned that paper, so it is called security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kylie realized that Marty was not going to accept the truth. To take Marty down in the second phase: Takedown, Jason and Kleley keep the permanent blue-colored pool in the pool and when Marty leaves her body becomes all blue and it does not stop! Then they keep permanent orange color in Marti's shampoo and when it is used, its hair becomes orange and it does not stop! Finally, they keep lots of glue on Martin's earpieces to call Jason's father and when Martin uses it, he takes it in his ears! It was fun when Martin's hair and body became blue and orange and his headset covered his ears! Afterward, by telling Marty to Martin, they cheat Marty, Marty's assistant, Dancan, in a house where a party is running. When Martin went to see Duncan, he was in a wrong house and all the children of the group beat him! When Marty was at home, Jason and Kaylee switched control of his car. When Marty was driving, he knew that all the control switches were made and he did not know what to put in a button. He's stony enough for enough. When Martin hit the back of the mosquito, the mosquito's vandalized his car! It was very fun. So Mercy calls Jason's father and cheat him again! He called, but his father was not, he said security! After getting Jason and Kleley Marti's safety outside the site, they asked to go to their home. Monty was next to Jason and Kylie because he knew that Marty was a liar and a blur, so he told Rocco that he was one of the security guards who would care for the kids. Jason told his father what he had said for the last two days, told him the truth and his parents came to El El. When Monty came to the children, she would help the children to go to stage 4: Pavia. Jason breaks the cricketer into 3 groups for Phase 4. Until Jason's parents are set up, one team will get confused and stop Marty. Marty first flew with Frank Jackson, but his car broke down so he went on the road with the jail, but he took him to the desert and released him there. Marty Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. Then, one of the blades is Marty and so the pilot closes the helicopter. After that, he was going on the set and when Jason saw him, Marcy stopped and saw Jason what he saw: his monkey! So Marty Jason and Kylie later went away and when they saw Lester, he gave up the water and when the water came, he removed MARTI. Marty was still after the kids and when Kylie walked the other way, Jason led Marty was taken to the top of the apartment building. At the top, Jason challenged Martin Martin by acknowledging the truth and Marty would never tell the truth. When the crew suddenly caught Marty, all the people, including Jason's parents, knew what Marty did. Marty was going to kill Jason, but Jason was the only way to escape from the jump! Then, his parents believed that Marty accepted his story. When the set was left of those sets, this Marty ended. In the end, Jason's story, Big Fat Leah was a movie. I can get enough of it.
