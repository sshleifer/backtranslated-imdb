I watched this series as Velvet Tip, for which I gave 10/10 grade. I read users comments about this and I have an equal good series, or if possible, even better hope. At this point I must emphasize this series well, and it definitely caught me across it and thus worth watching. However, I did not enjoy it like Velvet Tipping in the following ways: <br /> <br /> 1. Less emotions, love, and related sexual content. There was amazing little emphasis in this material, in which I was integral to a love story. Fingerprints felt like a downfall of mith Velvet Tipping. <br /> <br /> 2. Likewise, like Velvet Tippin, the story had three parts: at the beginning, a stubborn second part and the end. The second part should have been the last episode of the story (such as in Velvet Tipping), but instead it was almost completely excluded, possibly due to the disappointing but inability to build trustworthy shelters. This series can have three parts, which have two parts, which focus much more on the second part. <br /> <br /> 3 Often no weight has been given which affects fingerprints and how their personality is affected. I did not address the central issues properly such as the series that it was found rather annoying. <br /> <br /> 4. Finishing Velvet was much more hasty than tipping. Fingersmith has left some interesting plot lines open. <br /> <br /> Despite these errors, Fingersmith is a good series, and well worth 7/10. However, it is not a classic like Velvet Tipping.
