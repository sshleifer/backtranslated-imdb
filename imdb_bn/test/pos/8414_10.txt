James Hacker MP did not expect he would be the next prime minister. Except America, the party was elected in Britain, when we, the US, voted for candidates irrespective of their party. Despite the difference, CBE's performance as the Minister of Paul Eddington became almost the Prime Minister overnight, his senior advisor Sir Humphrey, Sir Nigel Hathorn, and veteran actor Derek Fowards, also directed by another night, also returned to the scene. Now instead of pleasing some people, he will make the country happy instead of his constituency. Now, it is harder to work even harder than before. Now, he has to approve the honorary list and work on his regular basis as well as his fun. Hacker hacking type is not. He does not like and dislikes rather than everyone who likes us and does not travel as a persecuted or naughty dictator. Now, we want to see the Prime Minister's attitude and all the happiness as well as handle strikes.
