James Cagney is harder about everything, ad postings, jokes, nails and nonsense charisma. <br /> <br /> This plot seems to be serious, but the film is something else. It is completed in the 30's Scrubby comedy style and works well with Phoenix Mae Clark, with his reactions to 'Becoming' and his co-worker James Burke. <br /> <br /> throwing that it delivers what is better than usual and delivers it. The dialog is good but it is nothing to bounce until it is distributed and bounce for the characters involved. All of this is well made by the whole. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable.
