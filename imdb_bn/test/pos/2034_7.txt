I was looking forward to publishing this movie, because I heard the first idea two years ago, and I was not frustrated. I will not be annoyed briefly to everybody else's story, but I would say that it was just a little entertaining. The performance was good, the music was there, and the original character was liking. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is: (1) The story was clearly lacking; The film was covered very casually - actually the writing was reduced to the second half, although the writer was not sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot was not nearly as important as music and action, it did not really affect the entertainment value of the film, so it does not seem to be a big accusation. <br /> <br /> (2) It is really unclear, but the song that was set in 1985 after listening to the song of the film was in the music. InxS's Devil Inside since 1987 and AC / DC's Array You Ready was among the other mistakes since 1990. It bothered me a bit, because perhaps they went to length for a good piece of time, they could check the copyright date in these songs to make sure before 1985 or earlier. Again, not a big deal <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought of something else that was weird. Steel dragon band members were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dochen's bassist Jeff Pileson and OG guitarist Zacch Wedd played the band members, and each of them had few lines of American accents. It was also lazy, but the real musician was very quiet to watch the musicians, so I would also ask for that forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I could probably do all day in a notipic, but I did not want to give that impression that this was not a super entertaining movie. I would probably buy DVDs when I came out and I would definitely buy a soundtrack CD for six stainless steel dragon songs (if you think it's been singed by the singer from the Stylhart band!). The highlight of this film was probably a great outcake, where Mark Wahlberg is mocking with a rock song on stage, and suddenly someone plays "good compression" by Marcie Mark and the Funkie bunch. Wonderful look in the face of Mark is invaluable. Classic rock and roll flick! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
