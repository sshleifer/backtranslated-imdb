One of the best French successes of the year, "L'Iberge Espagonola" is very well congratulated abroad which is fantastic for French cinema. Determining the reasons for this success is not difficult. This film was created by this year's most interesting French filmmakers, Cedric Clapish, presenting students from all over Europe and bringing them together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are like you imagine or like you see in everyday life: either untidy, serious or a sense of humor. I guess the movie worked so well, because many students certainly got the recognition of their original character, and especially Xavier. <br /> <br /> We follow the film and so her experience abroad through her eyes are Erasmus students. Javier really is a general student with his qualities, his faults. With intelligent ideas, the intelligent creator fully expresses his lost mind and world concerns and Erasmus students. In that case, the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first is a woman from Javier University, her DAA. The preparation papers are asked for preparation. When the same woman informs them about the different methods, all papers appear on the screen when they are named! In the next sequence, Javier's voice-over viewer believes in his vision of the modern world. Now, where to find the second example? Well, Xavier has a full medical examination where clapées movies are enough enough to speak their views in their own language. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the director was not really interested in the research of his main character. He left this point low-key. He did a lot of effort in Javier's personal life, of course, in the case of his love relationship with Sophie, and especially in connection with his colleagues' tenants. This is a story of a real friendship, which is a glamourous display of our happiness moments, but its arguments and its tensions. By the courage of Xavier and at the end of his stay, he will be started in life, which will make him more mature. It is not difficult to guess the message the writer wanted to send. You naively believe that you live in an untidy and complex world. You do not have to give up, but find it hard to find what you want. Even <br /> <br />, we may be scared of the fact that Cedric Clash can not avoid any trap: Clichés Let's be honest about it: They are included in the platyple, but the director may not be too much of his film to give his best film to his film. Then, the screenplay has convenient and predictable moments: Before we board the airport and before boarding we see Javier hanging a tear after leaving his family. But thankfully the script errors are closed here. Many fun dialogues and cool young actors fully enjoy their roles. <br /> <br /> Despite its weaknesses, people will be taken to the success of the young film "Aiagerg Espagnol". Besides, its entire environment lets us think that this film is mainly directed to young viewers. Finally, the end of the film and its huge success tells us that Clapby American fashion has fallen into the right fashion: the expansion of signals. And indeed, filmmakers currently work in a sequel entitled "Les Poppy Russe". Let's hope that it will be as good as "l'auberge espagnole".
