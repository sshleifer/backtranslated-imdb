I saw this movie on Phila last night. Movie exhibition. It was an interesting and fun movie which was some favorite and moving scene. Peter Foke was excellent as the rest were excellent. They played credible and well-played role. The movie has gone a bit longer and the conclusion is fine. The audience laughs in the right place. Family mobility was terrifying and although it was a Jewish family, they could be Italian, Irish or any other Greek. If you are interested in laughing about something that is not handled in this way, then I recommend this movie. IOTs affect you on the consequences of your actions and others in your life, and what you think about those who are not clear in your life.
