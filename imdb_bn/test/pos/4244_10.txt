"Chakki Wife" is one of the best horror films in the last ten years and it can be one of the biggest horror movies of the 90's. <br /> <br /> ** ** Spoklar ** <br /> <br /> At the end of Part 3, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) is chatty in the fan after finding her escapeable escape and finding her The trailer brings to the park. His neighbor, Jesse (Nick Stabil), and his girlfriend Z. (Katherine Higel) suffer from his uncle. (John Ritter) married Tifani Chaky when she refused to marry him, so she bought a doll to play with her. Chakhi kills Tifani, then transmits his soul to the doll. To bring them back to their human body, they need to find a tranquility to travel to New Jersey. Jessie thinks it's a chance to flee from the ritter, and they start the journey, but before the Ricki, Chuckie and Tiffany are not killed. Alongside the road, various intriguing events forced them to stop in bed and morning meals. When many more people were killed, they asked their best friend (Gordon Ultet) to make the situation straight. They do not satisfy him, one of them is not like murderers, because police has started solving this crime. He found the body of a rector in the trunk behind the van. Think he was set up, he confronts about them. Chuckie and Tiffany then prove the fact that they did it, which killed the vault. The group stole a motor home and comes at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade turned each other, enough to turn out to get Chucky and Tiffany. Chakki took Z. back and forced her to get her supper. Chucky and Tiffani resumed their militia, which gives Jesse and ZK enough time to kill them both, the police arrive and clear their crimes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Good News: The scenes together with them are the main highlights, which contains a ridiculous conversation, where the serial killer advises Chuckie in the work of Tifani 90. That being said, the amount of liners in fact this funny is incredible. Chalky gets the most of them, but some gems cracks alongside Tiffany What Hollywood calls these days comedies is actually it's funnier. Gore is abundant and shockingly realistic. Most of the deaths of this movie are really original and creative. Fully brilliant viewing of a new form of pinhade Returns. The honeymooning couple was a beautiful death scene as well. For the love of teenager, Stabile and Higheel pair do great work. They have a great chemistry together and actually act like a normal couple. I must admit that for the first time I saw this movie, I jumped into some scenes, and it shows what any incredible work director Yu did. He learned, apparently, enough to do the same thing with "Freddy vs. Jason". He knows how to set-up and pay-offs, and here he shows some great skills that contain Hong Kong-based looks and styles. If he is fulfilling his resume with those two films, he may be the next great dire director. Very good soundtrack, "Freddy v Jason." <br /> <br /> Bad news: For fans of Chess movies, it will be a great looking. However, this movie has a high cheese content that can prevent serious horror film fans from a good time enjoying this movie. The film knows it is a Chess movie and revels on it, things like one liners turn off due to a serious fan. It's not bad for a movie, but it should take a look at the frame of the mind of a Chess film and add some glasses to the movie, not to take it. Remove yourself from the state of your mind and you can enjoy this movie yourself. The final verdict: fans of sugar film and other "child play" movies will find many things to like on this film. Keep an eye on this for serious horror fans, but remember that this is not a serious film and the glasses should be there and you may like it yourself. <br /> <br /> Rated R: graphic violence, graphic language, short nudity of dolls, a galaxy doll scene, some drug use, and countless drug references.
