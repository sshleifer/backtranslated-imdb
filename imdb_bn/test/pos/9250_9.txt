I've always been a fan of the show so I will admit that I favor. When the show's run ended, I felt like many questions felt like. I felt like close to this movie. In the past few years, I saw everyone together was finally rewarding. I have heard that this is probably the only homicide film that we can expect. If so, this is the best way to go out. This movie is sometimes mad, sometimes upset, but always satisfied. If you are the fan of the show sometimes, check out this movie.
