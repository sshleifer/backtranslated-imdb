'A Tale of Two Bones', or 'Jhangawa, Honggreen', the real best composition Bright psychological thriller, heart-twisting drama, and a gorgeous horror all wrapped up in a fantastic orchestrated package. From the complex paintings, to perfect cinematography, absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> To be afraid of excessive release of plots, I would simply say this is satisfactory. Although it seems difficult to understand first, it is a good idea to explain things in the end. And if you like psychological thriller, drama, or horrible choice, I'm committed to not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> From a technical perspective, it is almost flawless. Set, cinematography, lighting, and especially soundtrack, are all impressive. Waltz seemed like a strange choice for the first time, but it could be an impressive choice. <br /> <br /> For casting, we're talking about complete perfection. I'm still completely convinced as Su-jeong defiant, yet troubled Su-mi. Moon Qiun-Yeng is equally confident as his mentally depressed sister Su-Yen. These two girls were screen magicians. I must see them in another movie. Yeom Jeong-Ah gradually slips slowly and slowly Finally, Cup-Su Kim tired of acting as a broken, broken father. <br /> <br /> I really love this picture. If you still see 'a story of two sisters', I strongly recommend to recognize a copy. This is a real gem, anyone who is worthy of collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
