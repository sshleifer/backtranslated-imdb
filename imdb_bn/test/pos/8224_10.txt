Written and written by Bill Irwin, The Razard of Flight is a truly classic theater piece, which translates well on the small screen. Quick and surprising dialogue and some of the decade's best physical comedy, "Comedy" head and shoulders above 99% as it exists today. I'm sure this one day will take its place with great groups like "Fantastiks" and "Gotot for Waiting". Why it is not available in DVDs is still a mystery and a tragedy.
