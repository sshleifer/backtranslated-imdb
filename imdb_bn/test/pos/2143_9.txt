I was first released in 1980, saw this movie. From other sources, I learned that the 219-minute cut was the only release in New York City, after which it was strictly cut in 149 minutes. So, I think I saw the small version, at the time, I thought, it was a very rare anti-western, if a confusing confusing ... <br /> <br /> So, with more interest I was finally able to complete the length Version received a DVD I'm happy because this second scene has confirmed to me that the film was a genuine classic, and critically critical Vitriol was uninteresting in Michael Simino. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a long movie, but so many others have been. For example: once America (1984) at one time at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) in 320 minutes; Ten Commandments (1956) in 220 minutes; Spartacus {Recovery Edition} (1960) 198 minutes; 22 minutes and other times, with Gone with Win (1939). Therefore, there may not be a time to travel around during the time when the gate of heaven came upon the scene. <br /> <br /> Remember that: In all the above movies, everything is there to emphasize the history and the heroes with a thorough emphasis <br /> <br /> Thus, the Gate of Heaven: In this story, the American West will defeat her. And showed irrational hardness, injustice and poverty. And probably because of this, many have disrespected the picture: During the 1823 Johnson County war it showed Wiming that 50 murderers were appointed to kill and kill a large group of European immigrants accused of the Woming Stock Growers Association. With the support of beef and the cooperation of all and the authorities, with the President of the United States For an article in that war, the background and what has happened, there is a link to Wikipedia under the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Very rarely want to remind the dirty times in their country's history, and face the country that seems to be like it. If it was a documentary, it was barely palatable for most; Like entertaining, it was often bound to commercially failures and was scattered by streams and infamous. <br /> <br /> Move to the social-political diatribe for a moment, that's what Siminio introduced here, describing what ?? Three main character stories? Well, the people of that time were probably not unusual for the fall in local prostitution, as is probably not unusual now. This is a fairly standard love triangle by which Ella will have to choose between two people and ultimately the younger Nathan will decide, even if it is not appropriate to take shelter of cold blood, when it is appropriate, but older James shows more soul and commitment than that. (Or Jim, as most people say in the film). Some, that part of the story is very slowly; Regarding the widespread description of the war, however, I think, it is completely appropriate. <br /> <br /> And the war is graphically, fiercely and brutally depicted with the murder scenes that are highly stabilized and edited smoothly ?? Although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I am sure that some carrier wagons are repetitive. A small point and probably when 219 minutes was cut in the rest? However, even if you look at it, it confrontes you with confusion of noise, dust, chaos and war ... <br /> <br /> Which brings me to other criticism by others: The sound and dust dialog is difficult to hear and even what It is often difficult to see what is happening. I will admit that I am very annoying for the first time, even trying to capture images or words backtracking to run parts again? As long as I do not understand that if you accept the director's intentions it is not really necessary: ​​life is not unwanted, it is difficult to listen and see in the crowded situation, and in war, this is not the scene of this small-scene. In short, you are truly and in the scene ... <br /> <br /> And what is the title? From Shakespeare, it is a metaphorical closure to God and so, if you make the natural world equal to God, then this great scene influences the movie ?? And is it stunning, fiercely the same as David Lin's doctor jhvgara? (1965) ?? A useful metaphor I think, however, that Simino wanted to say something, like the idea of ​​brave immigrants ?? Earth's terrible salt ?? To become the champion of independence and independence in the world, the freedom to build a living for the country was denied. <br /> <br /> was she the motto of Simino ?? American western story barrier? How, in America, when rich people will become rich when rich, genocide, history, while becoming rich on the other hand? What's new? Not really, we all know. Although it really hurt, by not showing America how it was and by release, not the country of brave and brave people. Instead, after absorbing this narrative, we have printed that the underpins of the United States have to do more with a home for the occupied slaves' land and knees ...
