I really like this movie, it reminds me of my high school days completely. Soundtrack is awesome. I have a huge nic cage fan and it's my favorite movie that she's in. I love the story, it's about the love story of total love, the kind of odd things I think anyone who graduated in eightyi (1980-1984) can see the movie. It's completely bringing back high school memories for me.
