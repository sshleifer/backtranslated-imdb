Thanks for making such a wonderful turn. I love movies I was so impressed with Ariel that they shot and the time was dynamically perfect with the song. To be a dancer, and to be a part of many dance films, the choreography is usually cut, dies and sometimes beat ... "Shoogiuli" Movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I saw the movie before, a different version. And I finally disliked the husband. I felt a bit too much for her this time. It is about how I feel about the female love birds change. Its all so magic.
