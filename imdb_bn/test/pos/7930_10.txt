Eisenstein was the greatest Soviet, Russian, film director-director, but was not one of the best masters of the film among Griffith, Murray, Ford, Hitchcock, Wales and others. One of the greatest things in all of his movies was a very special, very personal, and exceptional in this film. This was his first sound film and a perfect contrast between music and images used by the great Russian musician Serge Prokofiev's musical music, in order of war. This film is something like a class or a lesson in the movie, which can not afford a movie director. I do not get tired of clocking the real class like this film. I hope that more people in the near future can recognize a great job of art.
