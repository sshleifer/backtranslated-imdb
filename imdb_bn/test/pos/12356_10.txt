Yes, I think this movie is comparatively less than other pamphlets. The plot is very familiar, the dialog has been fixed, and the acting is not something very good. But it is valuable to see the longer stretch of the film at the end, where we can see Miss Gray in a sexy blue wetts, half of the jeep is unzipped. Yes, it seems like an enormous point of time when Pam Greyer's talent is discussed in an actress, but she will be a highly versatile woman, and back in the day, she will not quit who had a body. It's nice to see being displayed in a tight wetsuit. Rent the DVD, and then tell me I'm wrong. Can not you, can you? Because you know I'm fine! :-) And yes, I really give a 10 for the Wetsuit scene! ;-)
