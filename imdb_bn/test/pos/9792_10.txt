Sometimes I had a kid I liked this movie. I have always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. Both of these movies and Jurassic Park were pure talent to the child. I'm looking for DVDs or VHSs to buy a store near me, which I can not find, I hope it's going to DVD! Well anyway great movies If someone knows where I'm finding it, please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Also someone can really explain what happened with Bobby. Was it real or was he fake and he had fantastic friends and his turn mikes? I'm not stupid. My favorite part was clearly where they made giant juice and made fun of it throughout the kitchen, but it was also a sad part, because of what happened to the door because of the torch. I liked to see boyfriend, because he played a good part of his face. I think mother was a great actress, I think her name is Lorraine Brac√≥ or some such names .. All right, please contact me <br /> <br /> <br />
