I'm not sure if these other people see the movie - some apparently can not follow "critical plots". He is a millionaire who owns the oil company, who also happens to be in the big game - Wah - it's really far away. By any means - its new "drilling machine" can break through the glacier and on the other hand, dinosaurs and caves are almost a different world from our own time. Nothing is breaking the soil about this but it's certainly not ridiculous. However, the rest of the film is finding out about this T-Rex (which the millionaire, Buen, claimed there) hunted them and they hunt it. See - it was made for an old TV movie - obviously the special effects showed Chess - they did not have CGI - they did what they could and they did a job for MFTVM for that time. This movie should be rebuilt for a big screen - I like it and I want to be the first in the line. Dancing with the special effects of modern day will be great for stalking the boys!
