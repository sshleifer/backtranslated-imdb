I just saw "back to the solo hose" and it was very good! I've seen so many negative comments about it and I do not think the audience is real about it! All actors in the television / movie business are difficult to get back to a second Situational or third part. We have other minerals that have ties in Lone D is strongly credible !! This music was the top notch in the original music score, and the actors put it in their hearts (you can say). If you want to see lonely Robert Duval and Tommy L. J. Then see the original. L.D. No more intelligence and more serious sound but not very drunk. Villains from the touch moment, this one winner! "Awesome !!!"
