Disney's Buena Vista picture presented an amazingly well-known play drama directed by actor Bill Paxton. Photography is fantastic, but stories sometimes lumbers along. This photo is about 20 year old amateur golfer Francis Wyatt (Shia la Bouvet) and in the 1913 U.S. Open competition. What a wonderful story; One-time lifetime opportunity for young players to play alongside British champions Harry Warden (Stephen Dillan) and Ted Ree (Stephen Marcus), along with some of the best golfers of the time. Finished a tangle leaf in the neck of a story book. Cast includes: Peter Firth, Elias Coats, Marney Macfill, Robin Wilcox, and probably the act of stealing is Josh Fleetter, who plays Eddie Lowie, Cameti and best friend.
