Once I knew that Donald Sotherland, (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) appeared in this film instantly told me it would be a good picture to see. Most of the Sunderland films are full of action and suspense and they can play a cruel character, and it can be quite charming and kind. In this film, Jack Shaw was a good man and a bad guy when he trained to train the navy, who changed his identity and had different personalities during the night. There are plenty of car charging scenes and lots of stunt male situations which I do not want to perform. This Navy used to live in a number of communities with his wife and he was a father, but you will never realize that the film will reveal its horrible background secret information which he had to protect from his family and friends. Good spy film and all actors have great acting.
