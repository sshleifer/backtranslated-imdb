Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. The film has grown from crime drama to romantic Goffball comedy, and has come back again soon, which looks like two different movies that are played with each other and eventually join again. But they did it easily, and some bloody parts (such as scalping scenes) are found in the theater as fun. I just spit, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. Has the ability to perform over-dramatic soap scenes with the sound of its right overage expression and voice. His scenes with Beti seems like something like "Seattle's laziness" or some romantic comedy. You almost forgot that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock Betty are looking for. The charm of Morgan Freeman with Bethey was rather unclear, he thought that he could actually be his grandfather, but the scenes where he is talking to his photography, must be some laugh! Chris Rock's performance seems to be rather wooden, but he has his moments. Ronnie Jelgiger Betty is a romantic waitress with many sweet, strange husbands who treat her muck. It is unlikely that without any real certification, he got a job in the hospital, but hey, this is a movie, just go with it! Her roommate, Rosa, as she worries about Batei, also does astronomy as a woman, but she does not know how to deal with Beti's illness. And, in the end, there's Crispin Glover. As a fan of her, I naturally thought that the movie might have been more fun. There is no one to play ChrisPin, and the reasoning between Chris Rock, Crispin, and Soap opera is ridiculous. I guess I liked this movie a bit! If you can stomach blood, violence and many dirty language, it will be worth the watch and you will laugh a lot!
