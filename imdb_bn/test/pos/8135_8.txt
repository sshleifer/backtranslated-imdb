When a concept was successful during Silent Movies's "Golden Day", you can bet your bottom dollar that it will repeat; Although the word "reworking" is used. Finally, someone can argue that this recycling business has never left us, always creating a trend for success in movies or TV; All rival teams want to bring their own hit movie or TV version of the program. <br /> <br /> We strongly disagree with this endpoint; It's easy, easy and easy to copy or steal for. <br /> <br /> This last silently and hardy short indeed has got quite good; For Anggaar (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) Roch Lot is not reconsidered once, but twice in the next three years. We were treated with the proud Gary (Roach / MGM, 1931), where the goat was replaced by a cute, small puppy dog. Also, the weather is transformed into winter death, during a snowstorm. As well as replacing Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall, they changed the line-up further. <br /> <br /> The second reconstruction of the hidden animal was 3 relayer, Chimpe (Rome / MGM, 1932), former employee of Stan and Bebe, who replaced a female ep from a dissolved and inactive circus. Circus paid its employees with their staff and the boys received chimpanzees as their final salary. <br /> <br /> Our real 'hunting', today's topic, go back to Angola love. Recomember? Short start simple enough to start off. The guys are facing the goats and the Nanny on the road to follow them back home in their living room; Stan after his donut feed. Followed comic moments are made by L & H and their landlord Edgar Kennedy, an interplay between slow-burning expo. The effects of the event are extended by the night interplay occur. And luck will be it; Their rooms are directly located on the landlord's terrace. <br /> <br /> Apart from the noise, there is a doubt that the goose, smell of goat and the landlord Edgar illegally have another person in Laurel and Hardyar's rooms; We've torn a bit, which has been missed by censors. The boys were advising them about the word they made, and many of them overnight reminded the rules of their custom regarding being an unauthorized person. <br /> <br /> His camera shot was made from inside. Room, over their shoulders. With Edgar and facing them, he warns; "Remember, this is a reputable organization!" As she said, a lady dressed in the evening walks across and goes straight to the Lealmard; Follow a uniform sailor, who cocks her hat as well! Pedal graduation !!
