Hey ... Thing. <br /> <br /> Seeing a horror movie which is not only for every character of the age of thirty years, but also spontaneously illogical, a refreshing change, and reminds me of that distant time because of their tin appeal on a mood cover rather than their talents and Their ability to play realistic characters is due to the actors selected. And the carpenter likes a production designer and a painter who can create a realistic environment than actually paramedic styled. And there's no other 'twist' incognito, nor the camo celebrity look, or lam pseudo-romantic mistress. <br /> <br /> and I actually miss physical effects; 20-year-old kids try crazy new ideas with blood and latex and primary animatrix vats. Between 1979 and 1984, for five years we have been in Alien, the Elephant Man, Poltartist, The Haoling, an American Waywolf in London, The Thing, The Company of the Walls, Elm Street, a Nightmare ... What an Awesome Eclipse! And I did not start at the death of matte painting. Matt's work in this movie is beautiful and uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? Third rate CGI, ex-music video directors and professional stylists, even 'reti' horror films are also shining like MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to Netflix 'The Howling'.
