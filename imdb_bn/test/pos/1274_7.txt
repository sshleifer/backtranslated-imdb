Considering its production situation is a pretty good film. The top talent rival of the planet features any actor acting from the name (sadly someone persisted in a career). <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan has the ability to write the perfect dialogue as well as the gods and goddesses. The dialogue that carries this story, is a person who likes to follow people for his book. Good shots, edited very well, even well written, and performed well unusually well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
