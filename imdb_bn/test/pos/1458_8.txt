In the 1950s, we have moved away from this temporary effort in the banned area-drug addiction. For example, the film may seem to date. Man performed his work with the Golden Arms, coming back to the bottom of the society, in 1955 I saw this film in the first theater while showing a child in the south. After some serious consideration of being very young, I was allowed to go. It was strong and then influenced and still retains some sharp, painful moments of naked stripped soul. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She conveys her helplessness and void in a beautiful restrained performance. As a voice of common sense in dead-end urban forests, Kim Novak as Molly is quite good. He is sympathetic and still stands solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a slim character and it's not very good. Greatly annoying and painful insecure in the role of Eliar Parker Sinara's grotesque wife Dayalu Josh Arnold Stand Road Another impossible to survive. Deemed cruel and despicable, its character Sparrow Tart provides comedic moments. <br /> <br /> The music is almost in this star-star, crazy, temperamental, mad. Elmer Bernstein's score is fully strengthened by the Frankie Machine's spiritual weakness and the tension of heroine's physical needs. Molly's theme is bitstweet and illustrates the image visually. I effectively know another soundtrack which effectively works as a supplement to the tension and defeat among the people.
