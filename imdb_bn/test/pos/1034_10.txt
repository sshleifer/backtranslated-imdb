I can not remember this series, I think it could be "American Masters," but it was circulated around PBS. In the 1980's, most people have some knowledge of bomb development, and those who have little or no one, it seems to be a pretty dry matter. Anyone who views this 7 part series does not think that way. You can find out the unpleasantness of Oppenheimer's mind and how his development has changed forever. You understand the tragic personality you have and why. With 7 episodes you can learn about major players, and conspiracy and backstabing. I contacted PBS about the opportunity to get a video, or a DVD, but did not get any feedback. Too bad, I want to see it again.
