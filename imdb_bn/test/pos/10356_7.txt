The American final final entry in the "Blood Island" series of Filipino horror films has expressed concern about the desire of Alexander Abdul Aamer (Reid Haddley) of the country. He died because of cancer, but it still means how to get him back: Keep his brain in the donor body. Crazy Doctor In-charge (Kent Taylor) puts it in a highly unlikely body: the scarred monster mananservant inside the mouth called the womb (John Bloom). A doctor friend of the ruler tried to remedy the matter and ended the plans of mad doctors. <br /> <br /> Movie Maker Partner Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) Coral have several actors. Taylor, Adams' sexy wife, Regina Carroll, Angelo Rossito, Jandora Vorkov, and worked with Vicky Vaultant before. They tried to get the feeling of the previous "Blood Island" entries but someone could say it was made stateally. Although a "good" movie is not essential, it has found a bunch of interesting elements to add to a fun trash. A brutal dwarf (Rossitto), poor operation, a rather uncertain makeup work on the bloom, the use of political conspiracies, caves full of cobwebs, etc. The description here is quite beautiful, consistent with the fact that there are plots and plot twists there. I think it may be a bit pruning; Drag some scenes. But it's got its fun moments and one last man can not expect. <br /> <br /> Such things, acting is not very bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; His role of modern seems to be quite a good time. Volante is applying enough, and Williams O.K. Heroic Role At any event, these films look beautiful to see these familiar faces. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not something special, but as a trash B "horror" (I rarely use the term, none of it is just terrible), it certainly amuses <br /> <br /> 7/10
