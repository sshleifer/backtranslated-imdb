"Shivering Shakespeare" can be considered as the first classic of the "Our Gang" Tacky era. Until now, Hall Roach studios have started to hit them severely, and "Shakespeare" is a happy result. <br /> <br /> The gang is produced by Koe Wadish's version produced by Kodi Cop's wife. The children's play is not very fun and the theater people are confused and can not remember their lines. Copies as the most fun bite in the Kenyne Giant, who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man on a bull costume; And the terrible dance girl (played by the wife of director Bob McGowan.) <br /> <br /> Several pictographs mention that "Shakespeare" has won the first fight in a box. This can be true because they tried different speed with the film during the war. At the end of receiving one of Harry Peis, brother of Buster Keaton. Very funny and a first gang talk classic. 10 out of 9
