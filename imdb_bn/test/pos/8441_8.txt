Big corporation v. Patients are not good-ers. We always think of such incidents (real life and relay life) as a witness and most of the time, greed wins all the necessary (dirty) and suppresses the truth. At least this movie Jack GÃ¶del (Jack Lemon) got his point and paid a lot for it. In recent years, we have seen more such movies, the most memorable being "The Insider", where Russell Crowe played a tobacco industry scientist, congratulating City Industry scientist on the need to add more nicotine to Sylhet. Addicted to smokers. This was the reporter-dramatic corner where the reporter was looking for his dream and faced the moral conflict of drama where he had to choose between fairness and his livelihood and sometimes his life. <br /> <br /> Zen Trend Reporter Kimberly Wells played Perfection. He plays a reporter who is interested in serious news, though his master is more valuable as 'I-Candy'. He and his crew (film producer, who was a postmodern cameraman directed by post-coma Michael Douglas) was a witness to the accident of a nuclear power plant. Cameraman Michael Douglas obtained a footage of the incident on the tapes and steals it from the station, despite having a photography zodiac / illegally photographic zone. The station notifies the corporation that it denies the wind and owns the nuclear station. <br /> <br /> Chief engineer Jack Godel began his investigation and discovered a lot of irregularities in equipment used for the reactor. It marks the beginning of all the dirty politics of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> It was a good thriller and finally made quite a lot of pressure in the audience and the interesting thing was that there was no background score, not all scary moments suggested. Now that movie is great and unusual. The performance was all good and I loved Jack Lemon. We primarily know him about his comedic role but he plays equally well in the dramatic role. I give this movie an 8/10.
