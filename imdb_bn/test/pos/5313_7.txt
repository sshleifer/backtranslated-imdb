After hijacking a disabled boy, fifteen years of ill and neutral Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is a teenager detained. Her teacher and intention writer Pearl Madison (Don Chadell) became intimate, with the intention of writing books first and later becoming her friend. Leland gradually expressed her sad eyes, she showed that she is the socialist. <br /> <br /> "Leland United States" is a character of depressing and interesting research. Low graduation riveting plaque reveals stories like a puzzle; There are excellent lines and dialogs; Performance is fantastic, even though thirty-year-old Ryan Gosling is not satisfied as a fifteen-year-old teenager; But it seems like to complete a puzzle and "Land of the United States" is not about to make an unforgettable movie. The "why" frustrating explanation of Leyland's violent activity against Ryan Pollard is not believable or sensitive, in fact, it shows that this character is completely disconnected with the strange and ill-natured views of the world. In addition, Ellen Harry gets rid of a foot knife ridiculous. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "And Mundo de Leland" ("Leland World")
