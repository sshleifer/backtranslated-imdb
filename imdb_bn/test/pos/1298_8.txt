I really liked this movie. One thing I noticed is that the Korean TV drama is good, so far as you are giving the whole story. When I feel like going through time or not in the 16-30 episode when I watch the movie. Movies seem like running and you do not watch carefully but you can miss something. <br /> <br /> I think it ran out and especially to find out what I had opened in the end and to find out I had to review some parts. If you like the story of good love, yet I still think it's nice, and if you have extra time, I still think it's valuable. <br /> <br /> It is good to go back to the movies after the actors, when we start playing them, as we act as producers and directors of actors in our own country.
