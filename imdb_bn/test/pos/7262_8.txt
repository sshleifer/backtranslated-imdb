Well, I'm not going to add 'diary' to this image about 'Promoted'. <br /> <br /> I can add that it does not claim to be a 'historic' photo at any time. Contrary to 'Braveheart', 'Titanic' or 'Patriot', all of which are very credible and serious historical revisions, entirely for the effect of the theater (possible worst pretext). <br /> <br /> Has everyone understood the humor? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said to him, what would I say? - One last point. I am surprised that there are comments about 'modern music' in historical settings. I wonder if Mullin made the same verdict about Ruiz. I do not recommend.
