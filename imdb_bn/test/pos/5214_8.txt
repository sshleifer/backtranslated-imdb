This is one of the best tv movies I've ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable, but let's say, all TV movies are like this! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic It may seem ridiculous, but it's based on an incredible real story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Davy who is trapped in his marriage. He abandons his wife and children and then hangs his death! All so that he could be Alan (Karen Sillas). How far will Dave keep his secret? <br /> <br /> Top notch for acting TV movie. Gary Cole, especially the movie, puts an impressive, smooth conversation as the sophisticated, which his wife answers in suspicious circumstances. Karen Silas can do the best work as a wife who discovers her husband as a leer and does not know what to do. True wife Gerry Cole's wife, trustee Tedi Siddal, especially when she cried about her husband's "death", she did well to keep her part well. Wendy Mecca adds a nice touch to Alison's sister. Linda Gourson is the best of Dave's mother as her younger role. <br /> <br /> Predictive but the acting and the story take this picture to a certain number of intoxication.
