This is definitely unlike what a good movie is saying to other folks. The pyline and I both saw the movie 3x and the last one, but it is part of the package ... it's the same thing to protest against death, so the movie is a great one. For those who want to see a classic Kevin Bacon movie, please see it. Take care salute from Istanbul. If you really want our 2 then we'll write 10 lines but we think it's time to waste a waste. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we wrote it only to meet the requirements of the 10-line (crazy), but we will adapt to the kind of people and therefore the rules for us. So people do not see this movie because we wrote 10 lines, but it's good. And by the way we wrote 12 lines !!
