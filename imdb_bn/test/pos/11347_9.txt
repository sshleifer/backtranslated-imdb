Warning: Speaker, Speaker, Speaker !!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Other comments And reading reviews seems like many visitors and critics missed some important information that prevented them from enjoying this lovely teasing of a movie. <br /> <br /> We are using so much to see the alphabet in the description, we have forgotten that there was a time when filmmakers only saw slog-hooded couples slip in to listen to the word "dirty mood" that they were returning to the next scene. At the same time, the kidneys lock the gut or the fat. Hip ... "Meet Your Child". <br /> <br /> Mr. Chau and Mrs. Chan chose the same nostalgic method to tell stories. The last warning ... Speaker speaker speaker <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Next scene: Mrs. Chan put her head on Mr Chau in the taxi and said, "I do not want to go home tonight". Translation: "Let's do it" <br /> <br /> Why did not this couple duplicate their cheating husbands, get divorced, raise their child's love and did not have the modern thing to live happily? The answer is that all these stories take place in Hong Kong during Sixties. An adulterer if a child of an adulteress lives in shame, but a "legitimate" child is nominated to pick up her cheating "father" from him, then a sad but good / honest life can survive - Invisible Mr Chan. In short, Mr. Chau and Mrs. Chan dedicate their relationship to their child's future. <br /> <br /> Because of this Mr Chu, who lives together with Mr. Chan, with the little boy, smiles. Mrs Chan's dream to make her a mother. Then he realized why Mrs. Chan was going all the way to stay with him in Singapore, at the last moment, only to reconsider and leave, do not want to see him again. (But not before taking some unnamed shepherds) Mr. Chao lived with this wonderful secret with no one. No one, without a crumbling temple wall and of course we visitors, ... but only if we care about listening.
