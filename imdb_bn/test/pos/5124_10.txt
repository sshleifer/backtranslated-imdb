When I read the book, I read the book before I knew that the movie is going to be good because the book was great, I seriously recommend you to see this fantastic movie. I know you will like it when I went to see it when I was there with my sister and there was no one with us, I was a little disappointed but whoever did not recognize me, she went to the movie saying that it was a horror film. No one likes to see that anyone would like it (no one wants to see it bad) Anyway, I hope that from what you hear about this movie, I hope you want to watch this movie. I'm sure you will like it as much as I (I'm neglected) I'm literlly
