Luciano Flori is not one of the most important names in Sphletter's history. Perhaps the Italian director is a legend among the hardcore horror fans and his work has overcome the barricades (who can forget him? Western, crime or fantasy flicks). Perhaps it lies on its most important movie, and unfortunately it ends. A horror director (Fulci himself) started hallucinating about the terrible murder. He goes to a psychiatrist who believes in him as a criminal. During this time, the doctor started a long discipline of serial crime. Such a plot, something in the movie should have been filled. And rolling bodies, crashes or molten heads, stabbings, decapitations, chainsaw dismemberment and much more. Kind is sometimes boring, please definitely gore addicts which are stored by the film too much violence.
