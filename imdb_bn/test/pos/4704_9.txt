The room connects 21 people with almost every story for the recovery of drugs, such as Briste Helen. The last scenes are particularly involved and emotional. <br /> <br /> The story of Helen's wedding, addiction and losses reveals a very complex character, who is fun, sensitive and respectful. /> The film is a wonderful story about a series of surprising surprises, surprisingly, it is a story that has been scripped almost every scene and performed best.
