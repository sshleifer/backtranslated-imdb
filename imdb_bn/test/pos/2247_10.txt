When I first saw this movie, I thought it was going to be a terrible catastrophe, it was headed for the first time director Liep Scrubber. In the next 130 minutes, I completely changed my mind completely and completely. Based on the novel of Jonathan Safran Phoah, everything is lighted up by a young American collector (especially played by Elias Wood) who is trying to rescue his grandfather from Nazis in WWII. He traveled to Germany and beaten 20-something, translator and his grandfather. It turns out to be strict search in the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for. A few shots in the most beautiful countryside of the world, everything is illuminated by translators and excitement between his grandfather and Jonathan who needs help to find his authenticity. There is also a lot of religious matters, such as the grandfather named Jonathan "Jewish". After all, it is a movie that relates to finding yourself and loving family. I wonder if this is a wonderful movie, 10 out of 10- Arjun
