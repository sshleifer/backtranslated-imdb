My girlfriend and I originally released this movie when I released it. Controversy surrounding real release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwanted pregnancy) was something that did not touch our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and felt a lot of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were very young to get caught up in simple (occasionally) acting and corny (occasionally) emotional twists. This movie talked to us that the story of adult love can never be. I think, I have kept her hand while shouting during the final scene of sitting in the movie theater with my boyfriend and sad (album Siripi).
