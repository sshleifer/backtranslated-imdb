Although I agree that it was the 1950s sitikam, I do not think it is "ideal". First, Donna Reid was a Strong woman in front of 50 second sitcom Mom. She made a stand for women's values ​​and equality (an episode where the TV broadcaster feels "just a housewife") and stands for all women standing and representing women, especially those who do not work outside the home? And when the women rebelled against some of the series, it was not a little trivial ... always the right to treat women with the same respect for men. Remember, Donna Reed was married to the show's producer, so she had much more input to create her more powerful character. <br /> <br /> Children were intelligent, but were not unstable. They were normal kids. And they could act. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else seen in Donah Reid who just did not look like their parents, but you can feel chemistry among real actors, which then came out of the letter. Shelley Fabers and Paul Peterson often wrote and commented that they were treated like children of Donna Reid and Carl Beatz and they give great protection and treat them with adult children actors. Donna and Alex were some sex chemistry that was not seen in other family groups. And the letters may be faulty, and in the main way, and yet, accept for errors and mistakes. This super parents did not have any mistakes and there was no mental high and low. They are normal people who work as ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Women's rights, drug abuse, child abuse, single parents, poverty, children who need good health care but it is not able to ... This show was shown on this show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The occasion of Donah Reid did not last for eight years. This was probably not for Tony Owen and Donna Reid's divorce, perhaps it can be tolerated. <br /> <br /> This show is highly underrated and should be appreciated so that other generations appreciate the quality. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with the original poster, who is definitely worried about the show, but I think the Donna Reid shows offered much more than casual entertainment.
