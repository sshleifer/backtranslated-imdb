Walter Matthaw "helpless" dentist Dr. Julian Winston, who has proven to be a risky textbook for burial of Girlfriends Goldie, is incredible. Golden Hawon's sensitive coke Tony Simmons certainly won his Oscar. The action of Ingrid Bergman, like Steveni Steff-Star Nurse, comes out of his shell suddenly and nervously. A great movie to watch this spring or anytime for any time. It is very intrinsically; Until I found it in the video store, I never heard of it, and what I found!
