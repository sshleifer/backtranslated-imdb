I saw this movie almost every night which was in Habee. It is my opinion that it has succeeded in the theater, until it was topped to deliver top advertising. I played with actors, who played a grandmother. She is an outstanding actress. Of course, my favorite actor Terrence Howard. He deserves a much understated actor and credits much more than he has got. Ebony Magazine does not have an excellent article for him, something of him is a good propers to him. Likawana Blue, I have understood the stories that my parents used to tell us. They came from "Philadelphia, PA" in the same city, their joints and their fun in them. I want to say that Moses Defe is an incredible actor. She found her calling. I saw several movies in which he played different roles, from thug to doctor and he had stuff! Overall, Put Lakawanna Blues on Video for Rent.
