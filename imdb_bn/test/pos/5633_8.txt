I enjoyed this one because I can relate it. <br /> <br /> I was trying to make a film in my life, and in the same way, Mark Bockardt tried to make his film. And I went through a long period of short-lived arrest, where I refused to grow. But then, miraculously, I've got married, and the kids were there. I realized that there was a struggling filmmaker, probably not going to feed my family. So I got a decent job and what I thought was what I had to do. That's what a mature, responsible adult is <br /> <br /> Mark still does not face that reality, and so, in this sense, he is a talented teenager. For this reason, there is a disappointment about her. Like Don Quixote, he feels so illusive and self-conscious that he does not understand how bad he really is. Visitors experience a sense of superiority and grace for him and his circle. Mark's children and ex-wives and bills have been provided, but the film has made it only primarily to follow his "artistic outlook". Despite this, Mark comes across a fascinating personality, surrounded by a very interesting family and friends group. Unfortunately, in the case of both Mark's life and career, there are a lot of things needed for success: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, priority, financial scandal, etc. Yet he like Ed Wood, without much of a twist of a twist. <br /> <br /> I think we feel encouraged by the philosophy of "never die" of this great personality. And people, what's odd! Kaifaar Sotheraland, Colin Hendes, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie, a descendant of big-film or TV people. No doubt, if they are not already, they want to point out some days. How many rooms are there for an independent like Mark? It looks like a person hit the head on the board and hit again over and over again. Let's think, in a fun scene that can be seen in any movie, the kitchen cabinet is very close to the door with one of Marc's actors. <br /> <br /> Despite these mistakes and criticism, I really enjoyed this movie, and sincerely would recommend it to anyone. Aunt Bill is amazing. A friend of mine who watched both Mike and Mark and told me that in real life, these guys appeared in the same film.
