I love this picture, it's nice and funny, Ben Fit and I do not want to show him on holiday day !! I rate this image 10 because its gr8 and I hope they will not rebuild it because it will not be the same. The funny bit is that Andrew is looking at the moon, and shouting Nicole, look out and look at the moon, which always smiles me and is not old. Another thing Nicole looks much more at the age of 14 ... but shes a gr8 actress. But I do not need any help, nor do I end up with Win Nichol and Andre Nach's song? It's a nice song because it's really bugging me 2 it's no excellent because !!
