This movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of Alan Ladd. This is a good reason in a way because the movie has some interesting things, but bad because it looks like every hard guy Ladd hopes his natural position will be reduced, he is frustrated. Without fanfare or roles, Ladd suddenly launched the third relay. Indeed, his role is a key issue but it can be small and lost in Shafiul. Former NewPadMan Martin Munir has a number of political roles in the skeptical screenplay that hits all the political alliances and totally ruthlessly denies reform candidates. It is a beautiful and very talented Joan Woodby who is related to a wide variety of stories. Contrary to the production of ordinary Hollywood, this plot has actually reached the continuation of the zoom, in most cases the French will return with the "New Wave", although it is easy to follow, but especially if you are aware that the original title of the film was Paper Bullet. However, some descriptions of the film and the character switches are somewhat annoying, especially in the role of Jack Lauro who was surprisingly picked to participate oddly. One of Jack's best performing works, but no one can notice, oh!
