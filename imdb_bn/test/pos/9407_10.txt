I was nice in this movie. John Foster was my top favorite actor, he was perfect as Michael Scalque. I find great about it, acting, dress, production, instruction, photography, script and music, etc. Everything is available <br /> <br /> Spoilers are coming up! You have been warned! <br /> <br /> Martin Moxley, who used to tell the story in this story, was killed in the death of his neighbor Neighbor neighbor Michael Scakel. Martha did this because of her brother Tommy's jealousy when Martha rejected him and instead accepted Tommy. Fortunately, they were caught a few years later and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. However, I think he should be sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of parole. <br /> <br /> Congrats to cast, crew, and filmmakers. Two thumbs way up
