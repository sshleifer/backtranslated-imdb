German-born Turkish director Fit Akon, in his film, presented a variety of styles and styles of music in Istanbul, a city that is a bridge between East and West, which is a city located exclusively on either side of Bosporas. Europe and Asia Kurdish dirges represented by Aynur, who performs his own brand of Kurdish Gospel music, passionate and harmonious. We are familiar with the Roman instrument, oran geschecke, which is called Arab music of Arab music - music is heard everywhere in the city, because faith Akin sends to our underground clubs, street actors and recording sessions. German bastist Alexander Hackney comes to learn in Istanbul and learn about Turkish music quotes Confusius, "To understand the place, you will hear the music that you play". Akin's fine documentary is fine - giving us 90 minutes of music that helps bridge bridges. For me, the movie was especially interesting to see because I recently visited Istanbul as part of my holiday and spent four days there. The city is fascinated by its image, color, crowd, vibration and visual beauty. Now, I can add lyrics to Istanbul's changing portrait.
