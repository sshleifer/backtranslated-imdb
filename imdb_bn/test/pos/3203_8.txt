Killing Yard is a great movie, though sometimes disrespectful. Maurice Chestnut faces an extraordinary effort as a mentally wounded and jailed prisoner prisoner, and none other than the presence talent of Allan Elde as defense attorney. The emotions and raw facts pictured in this movie's "Flashback" scene have the ability to directly set up directly into the events represented by the audience. I was not born even during the Atika riots, but in the extensive study I found that all the fair trial stories of "The Killing Yard" I would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educator or staff group as a necessary educational tool.
