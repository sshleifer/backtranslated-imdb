This is a very good black comedy, there are different views on different different concepts of the same type. Three main characters are met each girl called Jail, who has played Leiv Tyler, who has a different male imagination for each of the three. Each of three men goes through the same situation, but when they tell them to other people, their understanding of the situation is different from the other two. This is a very good idea, probably not entirely original, but it works very well in movies. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. Acting is equally good, some of the actors take place outside of their league or out. The comedy is very black, black pitch in some scenes, and many people will certainly be offended by it, but the black comedy fans will probably enjoy it. Overall, this movie is not for everyone's taste, but most people who prefer black comedy will probably like it, because it must be one of the best black comedy. 7/10
