I read the comment in Las Vegas and agree with some of them, it is not a brain surgery TV, but again I was under the impression that TVs are mainly for running, especially in what is happening in today's world. Let's face it, a show in Vegas (this is not a reality-based program) is not based on the reality, because Vegas is the perfect imagination for me! We can go wherever we go and most of all want to do what we want (fund obviously!) <br /> <br /> Las Vegas is beautiful, sexy and characterized by all these money reflected in my eyes. If you do not like it, do not see that we have millions of channels! <br /> <br /> We are coming to the third phase in the UK and I know that I'll be a beeline to see it again. I hope it will not be canceled, a program that seems to be happening, which is half decent in the UK! (Firefox and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!) <br /> <br /> This is vain, great fun and every time I see it, I want to go back to the original thing :)
