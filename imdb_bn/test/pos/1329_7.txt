12 of the ocean <br /> <br /> <br /> If you steal fifty million dollars they will find you. (Alan Rickman, Die Hard, like Hans Gruber) <br /> <br /> This expression is certainly true in this sign. Terry Benedict has been told that the Danny Ocean and his companions have exposed him and now he wants all of them. The ocean gang requires a lot of money and fast, but can not work in the state because Benedict XVI is impossible for them. So, to accomplish the execution of death penalty in Europe, when Catherine Zeta Superintendent of Joe Jones, Rusty (Pitt) is trying to avoid the old flame from the past. <br /> <br /> In their first hijst in Amsterdam, they learned who was rained on them 'Night Fox', a super thief thief in a legendary complexion. He faced them with a challenge that could fully write their loan or Uma Tharmman-Kil Bill II-buried them according to the grave-living-type-order. Funny? Yes right Slow? Type, type Entertaining? In most cases Character development unnecessary scenes? Lots of <br /> <br /> The ocean and happy men's band is charismatic, and if nothing else is a signal and we are all old friends, we can see more 'palli' situations and conversations. too much. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; The cats were laughing, we knew what they would do; Barney Mac talked too much and Don Chaddell's cock-a-nay accent was as bad as before (I really liked Chadle, but I could not follow it). Pete and Clooney talk like old friends, fill each other's glasses and read each other's minds. However, what was the good work in the last movie, the lack of character development, which is how much the whole enemies were chatter. And as well as these actors work well, JETO JONES fits like a big square pig in this picture continuously in 11 sided holes. He does not fit easily and his chemistry with Pitt does not exist. <br /> <br /> The big star of this movie for me was the likes of Vincent Castle, Night Fox and Soderberg. Cassel plays pomp and wealth if he is born between both. His knight fox boasted, 'The horrific curiosity of the lives of other people' (Danny Ocean) and the ocean gang's total contrast. This is where I think the film loses its way. Castle and European positions provide a very realistic contrast with the American actor and the first film genre. We want to slick, brush and witted quickly; Broken, considered and not intellectual. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />.
