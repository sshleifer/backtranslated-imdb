The Golden Arm The Man was one of the main topics (and, in some cases, the message) as the tragedy of heroin addiction in the first films. It is nowhere near a great movie, but it has its importance in dedicating it to the importance of auto-pramming to make it more important and melodrama and natural end. What I like is that it is not too much for the publication of junkies (if you want it to be the best publication of naked lunch, but if you can get it through the point of view), then the nature of the city environment Frankie machine lives. She goes straight and narrow to become a drummer of a band and make it as legitimately as a musician, she hopes to be out straight after delivery from the fisherman. But his "uncomfortable" wife, Josh, who needs to work and needs money and often complains, and then there are old people nearby - he is Lau (Darren McGavin), who is still playing back-room card and, yes, shrugs. Like a minaret road, you have difficulty escaping from miniaturgy as long as you leave. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult for the Frankie machine that it is difficult to try and manage naturally at this urban end. It just can not save Junk's temptation (when he is booked for stealing his friend with sticky theft, he finds out the junk and returns the fear of returning to his clean voice). And Frankie's personality Sinatra, and I could not see anyone else acting, even the original choice Brando. He feels like the people who fit in the neighborhood, and the kind of game should be one step. But Sinatr has a weakness that he surprises in detail, and as long as we see him 'Cold Turkey' in Molly's apartment, it is also believable that even 'my' generation people will not think about heroin. That is, Trainings and Requiem Requiem for a Dream). If there is nothing else then you want to watch the movie to see what will happen to this character of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has become truly ill when he can actually walk and made him fool for one reason or another. But with her it becomes clear - she is supposed to be nuts with nuts, and jealousy, and that level starts to get it well. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, though not on the side of the surrounding qualifications, as well as the potential girl as the reason for the story. Then there is a Detective Bandar, which can sometimes be one-note character / performance. And Sparrow, Frankie's ambassious friend and Louie and Schiff's characters, and they all can play as they can expect (actually, McGuin is better than that). As far as other talents are being thrown around in the synagogue, Premminger does not do such things. And, frankly, some scenes fall flat. <br /> <br /> But there are many attractions among the people of the golden arm, and not like some dates of society's interest. It acts as compulsory drama, and messenger pieces as convealed without preacher or camp. This is a real article, not just exceptional.
