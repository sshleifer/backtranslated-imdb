This movie captures the atmosphere of a D & D group brightly. While watching, I could not help but noticed how the characters clearly reminded me and my gaming friends at the point where they literally acted like us. Revolt, war, with internal jokes, DM driving driving. All things <br /> <br /> it has all. The joke that made me cry, the action scenes that are even pictured in a low budget, I'm weirdly fantastic. The story is straightforward and unclear, but it is not really a matter of fact, because the best parts of the movie respond to letters and communicate with NPCs with each other. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you play DD and D or similar RPG, I can not put enough pressure, check out this movie, it has nicely acquired the spirit of D & D.
