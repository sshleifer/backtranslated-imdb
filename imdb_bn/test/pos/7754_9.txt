Haruj Sujumiya's revolution is an Enam that impressed me. Partially for characters, many of whom fall in anime fantasy / science-fi stereotype, but instead of high school, I have a twist to establish these stereotypes instead. Then there is a somewhat insane title character which is something else: a heady, almost casual, ridiculous amount of meritorious girl and she is secret that she is not aware of it. <br /> <br /> Set-up a mind-treat bite for this series. Originally excited, Sujumiya is a kind of supernatural, creator like creation and destruction, like the Creator, as he can destroy and rebuild the reality. Our story and initial character Keune, who sympathizes with Hihir, starts his life spice, against his wishes, because he is bored with normal life. To find adventure, he claimed three unusual members, with every secret mystery and they all dragged into his crazy schemes. <br /> <br /> Before some crazy, but enjoyable, philosophical considerations, we are disputed that the world is only the creation of Huyhu, because he gets bored from the old one and whether our characters exist or are there to serve him or can he exist Controversy about whether there might exist. It's a bit of a conundrum, but an enjoyable one is the same. Although the Saifei-fan / fantasy scenes are happening continuously over a period of time, I think that the series is among the usual things, even if these things are very annoying, this tension remains, however Huhoo hopes the world can be destroyed. It makes it more interesting. <br /> <br /> The industry is clean and consistent with what I expected, which is usually imported into the US; I like the character design and the series does not have complete activity, but I think it enjoys it better. This series has been described from the heart and he does not play omniscient, but comment on what he knows and what he thinks. There is a lot going on in his head, but he can not really speak the whole thing so that we can hear it. <br /> <br /> The voice played in the English Deb is acceptable enough, but I prefer acting over the Japanese. There are some unfamiliar aspects of the series, some of which are parody and traffic in Fanby-SEM, which I found interesting. For the first season, I must admit that there is a lack of closing, because the series is not really big story pressure, but once things seem to be taken at one go, so it's a simple series to pick and hold down though I think that instead of Recreational qualities, it's still hard to keep It was based on a series of light novels and the writer was directly involved in the series of writing. <br /> <br /> Although it is based on novels, I still want to have more powerful stories arc in the over series, but I naturally love these characters and we love how well the series can play crazy as well as quiet moments. Haruhi saw himself growing up and it was seen immediately after establishing a relationship between the SOS Brigade (Haruhi Club). <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, because of his mind-tendency and "the extra ordinary people in a world world" setting. This is likely to be a fun-off for fans who are in the action / science-fever / fantasy, and related play lovers, but those who might try to do something different or weird quirky series like this, I think Harhuhi Suzumya's melancholy is rather a refreshingly unique and enjoyable series. Do more. 9/10
