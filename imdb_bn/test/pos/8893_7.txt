Billy Crystal Larry, a writer who did not write and is suspected to kill "Train from Tho Moma", Danny Davito and Anna Ramas are valuable. The word "black comedy" was invented for this frenzy, which was "strangers of the train" of Hitkoc. In fact, after seeing Owen (Davito) Lane's famous film, Larry got the idea of ​​killing his mother in exchange for Oven for the former assassination of Larry. "I have seen movies. Chris Cross," said Wayne Larry. Larry does not know what he's saying until he's late - just as "strangers". The author, Larry, claimed that his former wife, played by Kate Magrify, stole his book and named him. She has become a great celebrity, appearing in "Oprah", where she mentions Larry as "a beast". Owen is in Larry's class. She lives with an insulting mute mother (Ramsey) and has poisoning to poison her poison, tearing a scissor in her head - you name it. There is nothing after seeing Larry's wife in the back of the "train of unknown train" in Hollulu. When he is trying to catch a earrings, the oven is standing behind him and weeping ... Soon the police is looking for Larry to question him, but he is encouraged to live up to the Oven at the end. The agreement was that he had no idea he made. You know, "Chris Cross." There are several scenes copied from "strangers" which are ridiculous. I especially pay tribute to sleeping sleepy Mrs. Laurie, when Guy thinks she is talking to Bruno's parents. <br /> <br /> Crystal and Davito comics are the complete master of the conversation and timelines and will laugh at you, often loud out. Ramsey is repulsively funny - a complete "out there" performance. Kim Greist and Rob Reiner also have the role - the girlfriend of the Crystal Griever, and the Rainier's Quayo Amount. <br /> <br /> The end is very clever, and the whole movie will let you laugh.
