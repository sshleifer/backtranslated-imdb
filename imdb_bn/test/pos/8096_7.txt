Not a good but great movie, "The Great Dictator" Chaplin's first talkie. This is a good endeavor, and sometimes an extraordinary satire on Hitler, but unfortunately, at the moment of Chaplin's brightness, the suggestions here have been reduced by the tendency to use excessive unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, silent screen master, uses a lot of words in this movie, and his tendency towards long lectures and writing external paragraphs of dialogue will be borne by his more talkative films (better) as "limlight". Yet Chaplin was very brave to create this image, and his performance in dual roles must be memorable. The "Modern Times" (his off-screen issue with his Chaplin was cool then), the Powlet Guards have no light, but he is always considered valuable, and Jack Oki steals the contestant as a rival dictator, Henlekel's famous creation of Chaplin.
