This moody, scary horror membrane starts on a fort on a hill on a hill above sea, it is a great setting, as a vampire bat flies and moves towards the sleeping doctor (Onoslav Steven). The bat changes in bat known as bat latos, actually counting Dracula (John Carradine). Dr. He wanted to heal his vampirism with help from Adelman. Finally the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse-assistant (Zen Adams), Wolf Man (Lawn Chaney), and Frankenstein's giant (Glen Strange). But Dracula's junk contaminated the blood of the doctor, and he became himself a Jacque / Hyde vampire. It's a little better than the previous year's "Frankenstein's House", it's less playful and more exciting. There is a scary scene where Dracula tried to attract the second nurse (Martha Odyskol) into her world, where she initially started playing "Munnite Sonata" in the piano, which soon became afraid of music. Directors Eire Kenton mostly uses expressive shadows and eerie music for sequence frames, with studio often having an awesome montage sequence to use their awful characteristics. Two actors note: Stevens, with his wonderful voice, first sympathetic, then firmly menacing. Adams shows her beautiful face, great way and sympathy against the dangerous side of her stomach body. It ended in a slam-bang climax, with the footage of 1940's public awakening, usually somewhat suddenly, "The West of Frankenstein" (1942). I hope Universal will soon release it in DVD (it was omitted from their Double-Feature releases).
