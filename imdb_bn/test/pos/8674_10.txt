I think it's the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. It is about 40 years old Andresas who was hurt by a subway train, and suddenly found himself in a strange town, but everything here has been prepared for him. She has a job, a house and clothes. At first, this city seems to be perfect, no death, no pain and no problem. Everywhere men of gray yarn clean and do not fit everything to fit their definitions. But Andr√©s can not really be fit and can not start long in his old world, and tries to go all the way back. <br /> <br /> The thing that impacts me most in this movie, thinks that the city is so spiritual, although I have seen so many places in these places that they seem so distant. Another thing that contributed extensively to performance from the actors is that. Trend Fausa Oroog is the perfect guy to play just confused and annoying Andrade. And all other characters playing overwhelming is a great job (sounds like hard work, so do not?). Between strong differences between Andreas and others leads to a very funny situation as well. <br /> <br /> To everyone, it's a fabulous movie. The plot may be a little confusing, but the film has such a great environment that I would like to see everyone. <br /> <br /> And I will not recommend listening to "CSCD212", it seems that she has seen many commercial American films and it seems like too much has been used to get moral service on silver plates. The way I see it, there is not much in this movie that tries to tell us about right or wrong about suicide. I think it is a warning of the aspect of our society that seems to be happening. But sure, everyone can see a movie by themselves.
