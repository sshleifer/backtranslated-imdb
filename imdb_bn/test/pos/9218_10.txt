This is the first movie I've ever seen myself in the theater. I was 7 years old, and so far it is one of my favorite films. It's pure smarmy cheese. Cartoons are sold to younger girls, dolls are sold with soft bodies and large plastic heads, for every color of sunshine, their own special animals, 'Sprites' and even the furious horse. It was about the general of the period, how every event, hope, unity and magic can 'make everything better'. <br /> <br /> The film expresses concern about the arrival of spring, when all the light and color comes back to earth, but this time it is not happening for our lovely hero. The magnificent princess plots have to pass the light of the universe (and given life-giving), which, for its own terrible purposes, without any reality, and now must save the Orin, Anx, and Chris universe, known to Rainbow and its new friends. As I said before, it's Chesie, but it's nice, and it's just like other cartoons of that time, such as Careb Ear Films, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petell, and Smarf. All cinema kids make dolls sold. And it works. :)
