If you see this series you will find a slipper cell story and an interesting 10 sections about each letter. And more intense with an FBI's penetration penetration. <br /> <br /> Excellent story, excellent characters and performances, but some mistakes (of course, for me). Final mistake You wait ten chapters with a great ultimate hope (if they do not meet its objectives but it is not important) .. Well .. I think not enough. This is a small final for a big series. Also I hope more definition about the story of the characters. But, I repeat, it's interesting and miniseries. If you do not want to wait for the big series (22-24 section) then see it. I give 10 of 7.
