I had the opportunity to see Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it. I thought it would be one of the most captivating movies that I have seen for a long time. Unexpectedly and brilliantly the best locations of the film were a fresh face and a great actor behind them. Three heroes share a chemistry on the screen, which is so exciting in the film. They are set in outstanding landscapes shown by such a real eye (Dope's work is just great) that you feel like inventing for the first time. Scenes of desert flooding are everywhere and even the scenes portrayed in Los Angeles or San Francisco street are considered to be natural expansions. As the perfect climax for this perfect journey to the story, you rides smoothly through all these beautiful settings for managing a bitter sweet finish. Making a film is a master craft of itself. Efficient use of innovative companies (such as Stitching the memory of Danny's film), it is very rare and enjoyable to compare with the pieces of work done by that hand. Blind Spot is able to take you to the top of the desert to take you to a universal common ground, where one of us can be both detector and native.
