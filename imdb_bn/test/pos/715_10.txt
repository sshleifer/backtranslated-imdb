I saw it at a local station on the other night because I did not like to see the trip like 'American Idol'. Peter Straus 'Rain' congratulates himself as a criminal in the name of Murphy. He confesses his crime and does not create any bones that he does not feel shy for. His room lives with any comfort that likes other prisoners' books and images. He is running the only time to feel in other regions. He often does this and can run a mile within four minutes. When the college coach listens to this, he wants to make him head for the Olympic shots. First, does not want any part of 'rain', but when his best friend dies, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, duration. Strauss is very good (what do you expect, some less?) And Michael Man shows the indication of glory which will be fulfilled year after year. This movie was a bit of a reality (perhaps it was portrayed among the culprits). It almost feels like a true story. Extra welding is good. Brian Denhe, Roger E. There are many notable names like Mossley and Richard Mull. <br /> <br /> <br /> My heart sank when some director's director did not let him run because he felt bad for his crime. Her final act made me stand up and delighted. When they took their dreams away, he took them tight. This was when the TV movie was actually good.
