Michael Henk is known for his funny movies as "Funny Games". At this time, he accepted Elfred Zelox "Die Clairpsiillerine", which is probably his best work. Jellinck always writes about insulting behavior in the family, and in particular the repression of women in the fathers society. <br /> <br /> Erika Coohut (Isabella Huppert) worked as a piano teacher in the Venetian Conservatory. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), they sleep on the same bed (already an indication of something strange). Irika has similarly raped her student by her mother and secretly shows pornography and herself playing Sodomosochistan games with herself. A student, Walter (Benoit Magilele) falls in love with her, but she simply refuses to sleep with him. He wants to play his game with him, but he is despicable. He unwittingly follows his rules, which means disaster for both. <br /> <br /> Hanake has a very clear picture language, everything is almost spartan, so complex characters and stories are enhanced. <Br> <br /> Those who do not know Austria very well can not realize how essential the setting for the story is. Jellin (as well as other great Austrian writers Thomas Bernard) suffers from the chill and proximity of Austrian family and society. In Austria (at least the Vianis people) are often unable to suppress their emotions, wishes, their emotions, so often their families do not have true love, affection and nearness. In a society where it is more serious to show a better view of society rather than dealing with your mental problems (Erica and her mother, Erica and her mother as protecting Walter's brutality for barbarity against Erica and Walter as her mother) Surprisingly, Sigmund Freud is in Vienna Established psychoanalysis. Irike has a cold and remote relationship with her mother, they are not very emotional and tender while only sharing a bit of time. Iraq replaces its secret passion with the will of violence, so that finally she can express some feelings. But there is no one who really wants to talk about his emotions, so ultimately he has to impose himself in order to ease his internal pain. <br /> <br /> Hecht has shown his career best performance (along with other actresses). With a helpless face you often see an indication of the emotions in her face, a quick smile, an eye with her eyes. And at the end her pain is displayed efficiently without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Gerdot also introduced strong performance, but the movie belongs to the Hupperts.
