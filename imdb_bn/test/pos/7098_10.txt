According to the comparisons of House of Frankenstein, the film expelled its predecessor and is one of the most fun movies of the Universal Monsters series and sadly ending. OK. So it is not something like Frankenstein's Bride which is considered a classic to be honored by fans of all the movies, but with Dracula Cast, the Wolf Man and the monster of Frankenstein (what? No mummy?) You help but enjoy this schlock festival! And unlike Frankenstein's house, the monsters of this movie talk about a lot more. But this film is both Dracula and Wolf Man, for their remorse. Provides some unique story lines to Adlman. Although Wolf Man has really found healing, Dracula puts his blood in the doctor and the real fun begins right away! I highly recommend this movie to the classic horror movie fans. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun
