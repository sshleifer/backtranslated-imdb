This final installment of the trilogy of Irene Jacobe Krzyztof Kis≈Çowowski is becoming interesting and the story is infinitely satisfied, because it has succeeded in converting three films together. I'm just scared of one of the talents in this story, together with three. Everything seems to fit well together, all elements of filmmaking are executed so strongly, and the end result is much more than the sum of the separate parts. Trois Couleurs belongs to the epic of nature and no list of great cinematic success. Just brilliant!
