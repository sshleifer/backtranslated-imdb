In the DVD era, you think you can find most of the pieces committed for celluloid, and in most cases it is true. So why is it so difficult to find this great little junk, why are those who love Naruto as loving respect (who do not fall into stupid land). Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are such a hot and superstar-in-the-curling gigino (Karen Sisco, CNH City) now their trademark red hot babe / superb acting routine. <br /> <br /> This film is really about the film's fans. A bouncing silly, clever and steamy Judas Kiss in Stereides makes every counting successful. <br /> <br /> Please, please let the Columbia Trister release it soon in the DVD !!!!!!
