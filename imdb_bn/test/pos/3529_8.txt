Many backwoods that came out of the first eighteen were horrible one and fortunately one of these good ones. Yes, this is a chessy plot, but I am amazed at this picture, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, even though the killer might have made a little more skoy, but he looked just like a fat slab. <br /> <br> Above all, our local sheriff or whatever he is, he warns that those dangerous people do not go to their mountain. But when teens arrive, they do not seem very dangerous like me. It's embarrassing that we do not get such movies, and if we do that, then it's usually a boring horror movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is more scary than reliability and reliability. Because this film is actually a factor, which I was not satisfied, but it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Not so.
