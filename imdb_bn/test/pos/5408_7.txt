When viewing "Fantastic heroes" it happened to me that a photographer should try to create drama about family relationships, opening his carrier and expressing himself as a way to open one or two children in the open farm. There should be something in this story, because it seems that every family drama descending down the pike will use this form in a form or in some other way ("Jannat" and "Moon Path Mile" are just two more recent examples which are sitting in the spring) Golden old man can come back as "Who is Virginia Wolf? It's a baby to explore for serious movies Poorness is not an illegal thing, it's far away. As it is, it can be so much unused that it only becomes a movie cliché, the ball provides a convenient shortend for rolling and a bit of time for the characters that we get <br/> <br /> <br /> This new work is "Fantasy Heroes", a movie that is the oldest and most likely, For example, "a child" genre, Academy Award-winning "Ordinary People. "Like the characters of that previous movie, the tragedies on the surface, up to the standard suburban family, up to a lucky day, their eldest son Matt, who is a" golden boy "athlete and thus Apple killed his father's eyes, without explanation (a small difference The "normal boy" dies due to "accident, not suicide)." It is Matt's younger brother, Tim, who smells of body Neigh the wind, and who plays the role of hero in the film, each of the rest of the family copes with tragedy on his own path. Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his elder brother, is more isolated from his father, who ignored his life and surcease He started to become a drug for that. Ben, father, regrets and became engrossed in feelings of guilt and his job Both sides move away from the family. His wife, Sandy, the most complex character in the film, the mother of 60 children and the wife, the introduction of a free spirit oddly feels unloved because he is married to tolerate stupid suburb. <br/> <br/> As written and directed by Dan Harris, "Fantastic Heroes" appears as a very fuzzy film. For every scene of the real and authentic mind, it comes as arbitrary and inhuman. Sometimes the idea has been lost that Harris wants to break the potential possible way to live in his popple, perhaps a commendable goal, but one that makes this process unnecessary melodramatic. Rather than identify the characters and instead of being caught in their plight, we often think of ourselves, "Oh, come now, what next?" The hot-button issues covered in this film are only ice tips for teenagers' suicide; The screenplay also includes drug abuse and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflicts, life-threatening illness, and even indecent gay cruelty. It's the mentality of the "nothing more than the kitchen sync" that really wants to hide the real movie, and it really wants to take care of us. <br /> <br /> It is not to say "fantastic heroes" is a bad or unrewarding film. What it says about family relations and values ​​in the 21st Century is quite insightful, original, guided and deep. For success, Prime Credit Actor goes to Emil Hirsch, Cigarie Weaver, and Jeff Daniels, who provide stimulus, sensitive performance in their respective roles. It stimulates our brain and wins over narrative supplements to touch our hearts. Then, Harris, in his direction, effectively achieves an effective melangolic tone, but one of the bold dark comedy that is incremented by some badly needed flashes. <br /> <br /> The bar can be focused on "fantastic heroes" and may appear derivative, but its fine performance and fine mood counter make it a film worth watching.
