Like most sports movies, it is not surprising that those who know about sports can find fault. As a football referee, I still have to see right when it shows a match in a movie or TV show. "Forever" has good actor, but I found Shane Astin to be a little young to be a young fisherman administrator. I was extremely grateful that this plot did not include the main character in rugby players to bend his fellow prisoners and take them along with Flagstaff as well as to Hailand. Which is credible: A police squad car can fit right at the time when flashstuff badges are digested by Rick Penning. Although rugby is not a nationally accredited school school, the team is like school-based club SportsRaido. That said, it is hard to believe that high school officials will allow them to play with open wounds: AIDS and hepatitis are not done this day. I do not care what the heritage and macho images are. Despite that, it was a great movie that was expected to work as thirteen adults (and sometimes it really did). Sadly, many coaches are like Flagstaff - or worse.
