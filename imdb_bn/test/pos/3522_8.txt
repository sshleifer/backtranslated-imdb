(Warning: Speakers!) <br /> <br /> The five young wildlife observers ignored George Kennedy's warning and rise to the infamous Oregon Mountains, where they are huge, perverted, hillbilly twins. When Warren and his daughter leave the two only, they return to their animal nature to stay alive. The movie has ended, Connie killed half of her hands with the throats of the killers, killing her. A very powerful, slightly overrated, backwoods slasher flick that utilizes the power of sound, sound and photography makes it a cut above the normal Friday in the 13th cash. Do not miss an interesting, favorite cast, especially Deborah Benson (now where?) And Greg Henry, who will not miss this part of Nifty music by director Jeff Lieberman's Skyrim (1976) and Blue Sansine (1977).
