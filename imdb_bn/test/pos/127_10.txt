Previous critic Claudio Carvalho gave me a better repetition of the plot details of the film than I could. I mostly remember that it was so beautiful in every sense - emotional, apparently, editorial - just fantastic. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have mental content that is relevant to the beauty, I think you'll be happy to see this amazing and unusual work-out industry. <br /> <br /> On the scale of 1 to 10, I'll give it about 8.75. I'm shy away from 9 because it's a mood piece. If you really are in the mood of an artistic, very romantic movie, then it is 10. I definitely want to see it, but none of us can have this mood all the time, so above all, 8.75.
