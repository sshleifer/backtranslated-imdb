I tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years. Lastly, 03/09/2005, which mentioned the name of Stasi Kich, and it reminds me that I saw a movie in the Atlanta Film Festival in 1974, so I searched Google for the movies of Kitch. And gravy trains are available. We were supposed to see Duddy Kravitz at the Film Festival, but for some reason they were unable to show it, and instead replaced the Gravy Train. We were very frustrated that we would not be able to see the most excited Duddy Kravitz, and I could not hear anything from the Graveyee train, and did not hear anything from it. However, I think we were amazed at how good the movie was, and I remembered it was ridiculous. Would like to find it on tape.
