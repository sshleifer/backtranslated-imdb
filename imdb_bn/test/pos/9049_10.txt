It's not funny if a joke does not blame anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So rap is music. Drink it I suspect that any San Black person would think it's ridiculous to cartoons, and white people like those who are offended by them, who still think that Black is the need to protect their patronage against racist humor. <br /> <br /> Sincerely cartoon funny. It makes me sad that anyone is not really bothered because someone might be unhappy, I can not buy Ink Cartoon or The African Quinn or South of South Dvd.
