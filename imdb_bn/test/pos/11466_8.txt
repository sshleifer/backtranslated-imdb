It was overcome by all the horror movies of Halloween / Friday 13th slash-style horror movies, so this is a relief. <br /> <br /> Ten unbelievably annoying teenagers (You want to quarrel with these quarrels?!) Decide to throw a Halloween party at a local ex-funeral parlor called "Hul House". During a "past life sensor" a giant was eventually released and every person appeared and killed another. <br /> <br /> All these happenings have happened to Evil Dead / Daemons-ish, but Tenny lays out some of the directory's style, there are some good one-fishing boats, music is excellent, Steve Johnson artificial make-up FX scary and Linna Quigley As a boy-crazy bembo, who throws the ribs with his fingers and things with a great new lipstick tube! <br /> <br /> Great fun at the silence level! After examining the voting breakdown and other post reviews, I do not understand how I got 4 out of 10? <br /> <br /> I can give 8 out of 10
