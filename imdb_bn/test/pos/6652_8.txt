I saw the Cold Mountain shortly afterwards, some I knew I enjoyed it. Although it happens in the last days of the American Civil War, it is not a war film. This is a romance / drama much more. And it works. Actually due to performance. Actually I do not like Nicole Kidman, but I like it here. I thought he was very convincing in his role. I love Renn Gelweger, as well as I usually do not fan. Jude Law is as good as usual. He has some great support in supporting cast. There are very specific performances. Also some breathtaking scenery in the film. And there are also many beautiful musical pieces also. The story is tragic and involves tragedy but it is a beautiful story. For me, Cold Mountain is an 8/10
