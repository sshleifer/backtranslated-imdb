When John Lawrence directed himself Michael Jackson's thriller as a small film, he was disturbed himself. Of course, it's frustrating, the conversation is terrible and it all seems very cheesy, but it's not perfect. <br /> <br /> The last horror in Michael and his date is to see the movie. When it gets too much graphics for a date, let it go. Michael follows. On the way home, they decided to take a shortcut through local cemeteries. There, it starts. <br /> <br /> Actual thriller dance is amazing. It is full of those trademark jacobs moves, as well as some memorable zombie moves, complete. It does not appear at all, not very long, at all. The whole thing seems like movies and it is really rather scary. Of course, this is one of the most famous music videos of all time, and most probably it's the greatest music video of all time. <br /> <br /> Overall: See it, seriously. That 13 minutes long to star on a screen will be something best ever. (5/5)
