Thank God that there are out-of-films that do not follow the same old Hollywood shit formula. I think the digital revolution and DVD revolution can actually be made to work more interesting to find it, but if you find it difficult to dig it out. I love it when I take a time to draw it deep and deep into your inner emotional reach in a film. It was really like taking a trip through the soul of America and that the spirit is disturbed and confused. The words of my mind really used Martin Luther King's speech about Vietnam and the way he killed me as reference. Every time I hear her voice herself poked up. I must have heard him speak before, but the lectures they used here remind me that I understood his message in such a way that I never imagined. <br /> <br /> What can you say is a movie where there is deep statistics about war, oppression and compassion where credit crawl will usually end? Actually, there is no credit in the film. You need to access them by selecting them from the features. Because that made me think a lot. All I can say is enough about this DVD Bright
