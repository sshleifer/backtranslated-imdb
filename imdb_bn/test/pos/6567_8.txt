I read all the manga of militant Ito English. I saw Tommy film and it was a big vapor cast. Thanks, Ujumaki actually makes justice to Mong. I think those who read Manga really would appreciate this movie, many screenshots and camera corners are exactly the same and how interesting it is to find the book's character in the film. This picture reminds me of eerie Indiana. The end is different from the manga, which I was hoping for. Kiri looks like her manga opponent, and her male friend suits very well Very scary I must admit, this image seems like a sad nightmare, when you had a child type. Not really terrible at all, but weird, when you get my drift? Another great awful from Japan, get yourself a copy.
