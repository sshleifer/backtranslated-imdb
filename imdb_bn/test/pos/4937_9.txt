For years, most of the most enjoyable films have been for helpless families. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> May We all know or want to know people like this comic wax. <br /> <br /> This 2003 edition was written and directed by Sheme Jorkin. I hope he hopes for a long career. <br /> <br /> This picture is seen in the eyes of a 16-year-old boy, who is concerned with everyone in the family. Oshri Cohen's great acting (she made the film at the age of 18) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole custom is fantastic, I hope I will see them again. <br /> <br /> I like every degree of dignity for everyone. I think everyone who sees it will agree. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun It has been nominated for the National Award and won 8, it deserves everyone. <br /> <br /> Now it was a very limited run in one language besides English. The United States, which I feel is sad. <br /> <br /> You will be happy to rent this image. <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (between 4) 95 points (among 100) IMDB 9 (out of 10) <br /> < Note: Since the story is not new, the number of ratings it can get is because of it More.
