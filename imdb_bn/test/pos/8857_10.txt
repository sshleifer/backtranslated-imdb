The fool is saying, "you can not touch it" definitely applies here. With all the worst remixes, including clone horror and sci-fi movies, it is difficult to find 2 hours worth of your time. So I always rely on the classic, when I was scared of my age at the age of pre-adolescence. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that I have no doubt, the gorist, ickiest, screechiest scientist-the fiercest classic classic John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you, Mr. Spillberg) ever made. Although it really gives power, it is not like cow (it's flour and blood oozage and God knows other fluids), but it is a sense of fear, isolation and distrust between the characters and the audience. <Br /> <br /> You can not be further distant from Antarctica, and in this sunny position, the frozen white setting, where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men were employed there. One day, they ran a Siberian hosk dog from Norwegian gunmen for a life of love. Before they know it, the American premises is fighting a mysterious creature that it can emulate any animal. It can be transformed into a haunted bloody form before it is over, but once it is over, if you do not see it progress, you can not say it in human or other ordinary Earth animals. <br /> <br /> Russell, Keith David, Wilfried Breamley, Richard Masrouter, Donald Munfft, T.K. Carter, Thomas Whites and Charles Hallah have been fined. Why this movie may be a terrific form of horror. It actually scares me still Alien blood "jumping" outside the pettery dish, I still jumped when the hot wire touched it !!! <br /> <br /> Still the most awesome among them.
