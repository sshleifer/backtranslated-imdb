Anyway, the movie is near comics, it does not matter. This film was originally moved away from the annoyance of "interview with the vampire" (though the performance was good) and slides into amazing action scenes. Extremely believable stories and interesting with all the amazingly good acting performances Difficulty - poor graphics. Does it matter? No
