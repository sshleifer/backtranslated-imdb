I saw the Gate of Heaven in its first week almost 20 years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the long-awaited long wait of Simino after the surveillance of the 1912 Best Works "The Derhurter". The reviews came in and trashed the film with critics' vehemence. An influential New York film led the way of critics and followed most critics suits, and 3hr. 40 minutes The film was drawn from the delivery. United Artists reduced the film for almost an hour to Simino, and after several months it was rediscovered for the same criticized reviews and uncomfortable business. The film cost almost $ 40 million (now considered low budget), making it one of the most expensive in history, and Simino released the project in an endless competition despite its third film. "Dirhantar" received negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. I mentioned all this for presenting a possible winding building against the Siminos. At that time, I think the film was very good and when I saw the small version it was a little better. In the early 1990's, the film was again shown in a museum. They were supposed to display long versions but they found an existing print. However, after the film years later I now think the Gate of Heaven was a Best Composition. Finally, a long version began to appear in some selected cities, I recently saw it and it was worth the wait. The Gate of Heaven begins with a graduation program at Harvard University. Two graduate Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we have some of the initial errors in their characters. Mr. Joseph Couton delivered his lectures in the graduate class and gave them their speech to enlighten and improve their country for education, many graduates as they behave as part of an elite country club. The film goes ahead to Johnson County in Wyoming 20 years. A cattle organization called "Stockholder Association" shot 125 poor immigrants to poor people, claiming they were cattle thieves. Christopher Thompson is part of the John Heart Association as well as Migrants. Although the hart is a totally ineffective act against this deadly action, to do something about it. A genocide takes place, but immigrants do their best to protect themselves. After the arrest of the United States Calorie Association for their rescue, most of the damage was done when they approved the massacre. Kristofferson also suffered a great personal loss and married after years of her Harvard Elite class, married, a yacht, bored but dead on the inside. <br /> <br /> A very complex film, bright in every section as each theme, form, direction, film, writing, music, editing, set design and acting. Cristoferson, Walken, Heart, Hoopert, Darf, Bridges, Waterstones, and Cotton illustrate very complex characters. Most inconsistent, inconsistent, very long, letters do not give any sense to me about the major allegations I read about this film, and the term is often unknown. In his defense, the same time as the "McCabe and Mrs. Miller", the gate of Heaven saw the look of photographs of those times. Some scenes of the scene seem like comets, industrial revolution or sometimes horses, wagons, people are creating realistic ideas from all sides. (Critics who consider it to be the most rude film, have loved to use their thumbs.) But despite all, the composition of each frame and painting is defective. The film makes a great deal when you pay attention to it. Everything is not spelled for viewers and should be closely monitored for understanding the motifs of characters or their themes. As a length, it is a beautifully structured piece, sometimes running, poetic, delightful, or imitating others with a great scene devastating. Sometimes the sound is unintelligible, some of the bustling scenes with some activity. However, through the use of the film, the character or their actions, they can understand movies such as movies. One day soon, the film should be republished in full length so that people and critics can give it a second chance. Do not let Michael Simino be the other Osborne Welles - praises his lifetime, and he is not able to create a great movie.
