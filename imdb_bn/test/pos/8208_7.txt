After a friend's suggestion, I got this movie myself. I usually love computers very much - so why can not a 1995 film about identity theft disappear on the Internet. There was some bad echo about me, but in the end, I was not so frustrated: the story was classical as it was, and it was really new when it was released on the theater. When I was happy, I was surprised to wonder that in contrast to what we usually see, computer-edited actions are just as realistic as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. Storytelling does not disturb mediate and viewers. The end is generally American. Actor's performance is good all over the world, Sandra Bullock usually bothers me to behave "Oh my God why me", but this time she seems to control herself. I'd recommend that movie.
