Not all, but most of the story is Buster being "Dead shot Dan", being mistaken as a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There really is no story, just a continuation of Buster's physical talent, which is amazing and its ridiculous time. The 27-minute movie is basically an adventure, on the other hand, after most of our heroes are involved with the follower. Before this, it pushed some police into the street after Katkan and later it was "Big Joe" Roberts, a cyclone police - and Dad is interested in a girl Buster - who is behind him. I was the best of the following scenes, where there are many cute magnetes involved in the hotel lift where Big Joe and his daughter live. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, it is the best or near of its slapstick, and it is so purpose: it is our entertaining buster. Just imagine: Even after 85 years of making this film, people (like me) are still enjoying this invention and this silent comedy classic! Cool!
