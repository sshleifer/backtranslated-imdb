An astronaut is lost in a deep place and himself travels through unknown areas on a living spaceship board living with a group of non-resident forces. This incredibly designed and enjoyable TV-installment comes along as a positive birth-visualization. In the beginning of the series, the distinctive characters of the conflict must be combined with each other and ultimately to improve in the strong team. Most of the work is in the womb of the myriad, living space ships (those who are pregnant and born in another ship!). Although science-fiction-stories are generally interested in negative birth-ideas (for example 'movies,' for example, see the fourth part 'revival') it comes suddenly. The absence of military order on the board of ships and the positive outlook towards sex and human (and alien) body is also enjoyable. One of the female characters, while facing the sunlight, actually enjoys a photo of 'Photoshoot'. The crew had to go to the toilet even. 'Star Trek' will not be impossible?
