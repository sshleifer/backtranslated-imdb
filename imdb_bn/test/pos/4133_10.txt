Gary Busse did a fantastic job playing Rock-n-Roll Legendary Body Holly (1936-59). He has a spitting picture of people. A garage band of 50 is different from today. Having a group of three is usually easy to return to that day. I bet Holly (Busey) I've heard mostly betting that much better than the musician. As he lived in Lubbock town of Texas, it was the only quiet city. His parents were Christian, although his mother was a strong supporter of his son's work. That's why he did not act like Elvis. He stuck in his kinder way. That really makes him well! When he went to Tennessee, he found out how bad the producers were. They hated rock-n-roll, which made Holly a big time. Holly and her friends used in different environments were a challenge. She travels to Apollo, traveling with Sam Cooke, who quickly accepts American-American audiences in Africa, I like it! And Sam Kooka confirmed that Holly and her band got some services. That's what I call tolerance. It is unfortunate that he is Richie Vallis and J. P. "The Big Boomer" Richardson made his music career smaller by 1955 in the crash of the plane, at least their memories would live in our hearts. There was no flaw in the movie, I think Body Holly has overcome the barriers of music and politics at that time, and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey, she was perfect in the role, and music as well. Allah blesses you! 5 stars!
