I saw it in an advance screening, I did not read the book, but heard a lot about it. <br /> <br /> The movie was absolutely fantastic, very moving. With a roller coaster of emotions you fully connect with the characters. Shaun Tauve was great, it was a complete departure from his usual role and the Persians / Dari realized that his performance was incredible. <br /> <br /> Remember that Khaled Hossaini actually liked this picture as unusual for a book adaptation movie. Although the film was seen several times, he was "Sabbing". <br /> <br /> The animation was fine even from the essay, as the names were shown as Persian Kilograms, very unique! At times the translation did not clearly express the message, but it was all a great movie.
