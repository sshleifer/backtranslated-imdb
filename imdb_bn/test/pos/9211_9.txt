I recently saw the show for the first time - 2 hours "kidnapping" program. I do not know why I do not hurry ?? James Kane is remarkably credible as the role of the main honcho in the fantastic 5 * Vegas Complex. So often, those who have one or more such events together are very annoying, or they seem to have been picked because they will be related to producers or directors. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the case. Along with Caan, the primary and supporting cast is all attractive, and credible, engaging. Guest actors are well-chosen. <br /> <br /> The stories I have seen are interesting, and the show presents a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> This is a recreational program and I hope that it will be there. I do not know how I missed it for so long, but from now on it is planning to do TIVO.
