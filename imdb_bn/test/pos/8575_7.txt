I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed to be the place for an enjoyable, if not groundbreaking, film. It was set in southern France, led to the handsome and acclaimed actor cast and I really preferred African costumes, proverbs and music. Despite all this, I do not love it. Movies are supposed to express their meaning when watching first, but "secret smile" that does not work. Nimi and Matthew, played Long and Firth (both of whom have played romantic lead before and should be well known), develop warmth and emotions like dried fish. I used to deliberately 'dry fish', because it was a few - very few lines and scattered throughout the film. Another winner when Nomi catches snooping Matthew around his apartment. She found a book with her first name and said: "Your name is Nomi, I never knew." Then he insisted that he call him by his Christian name. I have seen this scene intensely, Matthew Neimee over said, "Say my name", until the moment he realizes that they always call each other with their last name. I had a turning point for this film, and it expected to get better. It's not Why does Nimi and Matthew always seem to stand in ten steps, even in the "Say my name" scene? Does Matthew love me with its perfect beauty? And why does an intelligent woman like Nimi cause a comic book writer to fall, who, along with a foreigner 'adventure' of a wedding, when her marriage seems to be something which she could catch? And I want to add that the romance made for fornication was a bit hard for me. Yes, Jenny is a naughty hilarious, but if I'm on her shoes, I probably would like to prevent her husband getting separated from her troupe. Believe it This story indicates Nomi's painful past, but it does not fully search. Some critics say, Firth looked a bit weird here, and I agree. For generosity, the actor called for more explicit desire and passion as the 19th century autumn Mr. Darcy (and during those terrible brits wearing)! For a long time, shining 'love jones', he started paying more attention to his pronunciation rather than acting in his role. Even so, there were many moments ?? The 'tell my name' scene among them? When he was in total control and came across really well. Yet, 'secret smile' is not without his release, and I have seen that it has increased with more philosophies. Nine did not fully understand Nemi's attraction of Mamiya, even if he was portrayed as a supporter and well-established. I love it when Neene encounters the muffin swelling in the contradictory proverbial scenes. My husband likes it, and generally he is shed what he does and does not want to be insulted on the screen first. When Sammy asked Methi about a frank question about sex, he looked at the scene. So there you have it. 'Secret Smile' was an entertaining entertainer like my husband, but enough to see a brilliant filmmaker like myself, for the director and writer who is trying to publish.
