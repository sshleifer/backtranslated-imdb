The story is about a working girl (Anne Sorn), who is a pretty thoughtless boyfriend (Paul Kelly). This boyfriend is so busy to start his own business that he forgets repeatedly or shows up late. The final straw and Kelly say she is very busy to take her out of celebration when Sothn has a birthday. So, just do not want to stay at home, he goes on a dark day which becomes a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly, but after breaking his relationship with Sotheby's Kelli, it has become clear that Hamilton, a new lover, has "loved" and left him. It is not difficult to predict how all of this is resolved ultimately - just enough to say that everything works perfectly well. <br /> <br /> This is a very modest small film in Colombia pictures. The relatively small budget as well as the second level level. Despite being a minor role of Mikey Rooney and Jane Darewell, it is obviously a "B-movie" - both have become famous yet. Now these bad actors do not say or produce no good. Indeed, given the production prices, it is a fantastic amazing film that seems to work well with all the beautiful and somewhat expected plots outlined. That's why the story of the actor and director Sarabijan did a good job. Plus authorizing authors is a good job and you have to take care of them. The end, in particular, was really sweet and virtually flowing my tear ducts! Due to these reasons, the film earns 7 out of 10.
