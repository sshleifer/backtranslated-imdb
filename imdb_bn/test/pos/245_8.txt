In the 1944 Technicola film, she is featured as a "cover girl" wherever she is in Rita Hairstyle by starring Jean Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eve Ardenen, Lee Bomman and Auto Kruger. Rita plays a pretty scarf, Rusty works in a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go out for Joystown (Silver), Austster with club comedians. They all hate Austen, but they are looking for a pearl. When they find one, three of them will be lucky, they will believe. <br /> <br /> Wrestler auditions and cover girl roller role for the magazine has won - he is moving forward to other competitors because the magician's owner (Kruger) sees a similarity between the rusty and the girl she once liked, who played the role of Rusty's grandmother See to be Once she becomes a cover girl, the world is open to her and her dream of being present at Broadway is true. Danny wants to achieve her success, but at the same time she realizes that she lost her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Rita is both her best and both of her grandmother Rusty in the past. For such a sexy, favorite, gorgeous woman, she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men. None of these has been shown on screen, or does not want to be a movie star. He is one of the true Goddess and the life he has brought all that he has done. Gene Kelly plays a serious role here, but gets lots of chances to dance and sing songs. Phil Silvars is very simple and fun as a sunny and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie, no tube spots. My only problem was that Rusty would have to choose a successful career and the person she loves. When Supermodel Jeans Falconberg, who plays herself in a movie, says about marrying, he does not warn his master that he is very much needed for the modeling business. We are not told to continue working with our career or to work in Danny - but all the signs point to the Brooklyn club. Why can not he have both? Still, you can not beat "cover girl" for top entertainment, beautiful colors, beautiful music, great power, fine performance and its most fabulous assets, the magnificent Rita Haven.
