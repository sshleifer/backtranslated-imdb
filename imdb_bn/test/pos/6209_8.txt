Preston Sturgis's Power and Pride By the end of the 1990's, it was revived and disappeared by the public for almost 24 years of television shows. Already it was notorious because Palin Cole's Citizen Ear Book was suggested that Harman Manquique - Anson Welles Kani's screenplay was based on the painting of Sturgis. At the beginning of this thread for the image on the IMDB web site, Kell has increased her case. Charles Foster talks about four lives of Charles Foster: Newsreel (Rolston - Henry Lus Clone), Thecher's Memoir, Bernstein, Zed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Batler Raymond. Everyone has separated his ears, reflected his beliefs or disappointments or human hatred. And of course each one expresses his own failure when they say the version of Kane story. This method causes repeated occurrences of the same event. <br /> <br /> It is not the power and glory situation. Yes, it's a legendary businessman like Cane - here Tom Garner (Spencer Tressy), who is a man who became the head of the country's most successful railway system. But there are only two narratives - they are the right hand of Garner Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). At the time of the purchase of Garner, we have restricted nearly three dimensional views. Henry, when he describes, he is talking about his master and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife, like the voice of a suspect crowd - he only sees errors in Henry. <br /> <br /> Example: Although he worked on his way, he became more labor force in his subsequent years. Union causes problems, and he does not care to be slow by their shenanigans. Henry describes the clash between Union Tom regarding a major walkout of Tom and how he focuses on the loss of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him that Tom uses the strike and violence to stop the strike (apparently blows the union headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of man, but one pure white and one pure black. <br /> <br /> I'm not really getting the strength and not to replicate the success of the ear, in Galarie (some movies - including all of the other films of Osson Welles), but I know that the story will eventually be presented with enough to hold your interest. Is. And due to the performance of Tracy and Colin Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the couple's global success has brought home completely. <br /> <br /> When they got married, Tom did not want to work well (in part) to the benefit of his wife and their families. But the price of great business success in America comes. Tom Railroad gets deeply involved in running the empire (he expanded it and continually developed it). But he took him away from the house, and he lost contact with Selby. And she's eve (Helen Winson), a little girl who turned her ownership into it. When Sally could learn about her unfriended behavior, she destroyed her. <br /> <br /> Tom also has a complete shock (which makes him die in Henry's eyes). Eve married Tom and gave him a boy - but Tom's son, Tom Jr. (Philip Trent), became the son of Eve. Tom shot himself as a result of the discovery of this indecent cicameral. <br /> <br /> This film is not a total success - sometimes the action jumped in the unlikely way. Yet it seems the business is real (when Tom considers the scene of the board of directors planning to buy his small rival train line and discusses the use of debentures to finance those plans). Sturgis came from a rich background, so he could bring such detail. So it's a first rate film. Which citizen might have heard, but as a business-realization attempt by social commentary in America for lovers of movie lovers
