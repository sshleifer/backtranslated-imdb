LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good movie, though it is already a bit of a problem even after similar movies. In many ways, the movie is reminiscent and remembered by previous cast such as Grand Slam and others. So, when director Melville and the actor did great work, it seems like all the designs are fake. For this reason, I got a hard time giving this excellent movie a higher score. <br /> <br /> An unusual aspect of the movie is how the kakaras meet together. Instead of the usual way, Vogel escapes from prison and comes only to meet Kori, which is only released from prison! Both were a good match but their both films were a clever touch until they worked parallel to meet. Besides, most of the film's anticipated crimes have expressed concern about planning and ruthless execution. I appreciate how the film shows the crew in such a cool and isolated way - in recent years it is relatively less than French movies, but rare in American movies in recent years. <br /> <br /> Overall, looking very well made and valuable ... If it does not seem that it looks like a tad repetitive, you'll see some fine acting, aspects and many great tensions.
