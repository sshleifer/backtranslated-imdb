Bonnie Hunt scored a coup with his director debut. Small drivers and David Duchovny have some indecision that called chemistry. Make sure the plot is unlikely, but that does not stop one from enjoying this film. Carroll O'Nauna does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great character actors play his card friends. Jim Balushi Magan's head's head, sunny as part of the extended family <br /> <br /> Honor, family, and marriage are honorable. Some sexual references and non alty words are used but in context and with gentle humor. <br /> <br /> and the wonderful Dean Martin tune - "Go back to me." <br /> <br /> <br /> Recommended.
