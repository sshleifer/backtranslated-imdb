Barbero Bablova In this story, the screenplay of Valeria was completely pleasant and heart-felt at the same time. It has been a long time since I've seen so many hidden emotions and mystery by any actor using his face features and using his eyes and face repeatedly through this character. As Valeria she was completely credible and I had to move away with her characterization of this role. Once the film was a real life and imagination, the shiny use of limited dialogue made me spell. I was compelled to read in the line and every major player used the body language and emotional motive to express strong story lines. Especially barbora was apparently an almost dishonest way and at the same time stimulated a sexy way. This comment can relate to each of the many emotions brought forward by its performance. In terms of dialogue but the presence conditions are strong. I have been detained by this actress distribution and will have to find out a lot more of her work.
