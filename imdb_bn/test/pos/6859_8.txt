I'm going to use 'German Scrum' as a summary but it has already been lol. It sums up nicely anatomy. If you are not a subtitle reader, it fits sticky with the Anatomy Scrum / Urban Legend Pack. This is a tin-awful set at a medical school where students are absent and then separation becomes an experimental subject of the lab. <br /> <br /> If you see the original German language film then I can not see the English version, I have not seen the English version, the anotomy is intense, written and cleverly designed so that the tension really does not give up. Compared with American counterparts, the mystery has been discovered more quickly, that is, until the end of the slash of rights, Anatomy grows during its running time from the movie Hollar's running time of a smart and thrilling thriller. It's a secret journey starting from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Hats off with actors. Franka Pantent once again proved that she is an intelligent, smart actress who can take a role in life. Piula is a great foundation for the movie created from its central performance. Wicked speech and their teacher's pet are equally good, at all times the true predictions of the present. <br /> <br /> It is very surprising that the film can not stretch too much. Speed ​​fast and punchy, similar to the previous urban legends, too, means that there is always something to keep your attention high. If there are any negative points, then they will feel very alarming for them, but if you are convinced of the first half-detection graphic separation sequence, the next half will reward you with its exciting thrill vaults. I recommend to Anatomy who enjoys a good adventure but a little mock with America.
