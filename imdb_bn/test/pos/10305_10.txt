A very moving and thought-provoking film that raises issues about mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia. A heavy word? It's a little, but in fact it's actually coming straight into a story of family changes that have to deal with all these issues. The confrontation of life and responsibility is a positive story that is not bothered by the content. <br /> <br /> In modern times, the image of the afterlife is beautifully shot and made and modern contemporary topics are discussed. It's a character driven, inspired movie inspired by a strong cast and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is not a movie that always performs well at the box office, so you can catch it if you can.
