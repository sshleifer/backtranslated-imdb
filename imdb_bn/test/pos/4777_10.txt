This 8-minute jackpot is not only timeless, but it's a cartoon milestone. This is Mickey's third cartoon, and its best one. It was the first word because it was a cartoon milestone. And my goodness, even 70+ years later it is so good, and gives the actual extra weight to the story. Black and white animations are excellent, and the character properties are quite convincing. The music is awesome, I love the soundtrack, adding fun to the cartoon, sometimes the story is thin. And cartoon funny! Such memorable moments, such as the cow's tooth, are used as a xylophone and its bugpiece. The characters are also compelling, Mickey and Minni two landmark Disney characters are well-spoken by Walt Disney and PT works well as a "piece arch". After all, "Steamboat Willie" is just a timeless jewel that everyone will see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
