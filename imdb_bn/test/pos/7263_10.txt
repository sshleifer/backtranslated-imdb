Usually I hate films over time. If the moment of living in England is the drama allergy - what I do. But this one is the best. It does not take itself seriously, and Johnny Miller and Robert Carlele together are great, lev taylor is good but its English pronunciation is well! <br /> <br /> There is something in this picture that just wants to enjoy the movies themselves. It has actions, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how much Jokes will translate across the ocean but I hope they do it. American viewers will be embarrassed to miss this film. It shows that English filmmakers can create something that does not include constant oaths and sexuality. Both are not these features but in a balanced format. Ian Robertson's camp is good for the gentleman, the picture is brilliant, and the two brothers who are the partners of the high class are ridiculous! <br /> <br /> Tell them to be supported as a trailer for 'Spy K Shaggade Me' .... "If You See Another Film" .... This spring creates Plunket and MacLean. It's fun, action louvro and of course, Johnny Lee Miller, with an English accent to change!
