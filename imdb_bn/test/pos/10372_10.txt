After the funeral was absolutely fantastic, and till the best episode of the season. I was frustrated with the card on the table, which started very well but left it up enough for the last half an hour, and I do not know what to think after the flood, though I finally feel confused. I said at the end of the funeral, one of my favorite Pierot Episodes, five Little Pigs, Saad Cyprus and ABC Murders. I was afraid that they would destroy the story, but instead it is very faithful for the book. Now I will say that I do not think the changes in books and books do not try to compare movies and TV adaptations to their sources, without a wonderful composition of the book, and adaptation it does not judge. For this reason, I dislike some desert areas like Nimesses and Sleeping Maraudes, and outside the ray of the Accurate Raiyar, taking the flood and cards on the table is really the only disappointment. Everything else is better than the best, even recent appointments with death, despite many deviations from the book, which I admit is not a favorite, was wonderful, amazing production value, thanks to the performance of the stellar pair and extraordinary music score. After returning to the funeral, production quality is pretty good. It really has a contemporary feel, and stunning photography and fantastic scenery and costume make it a visual banquet for the eyes. The music was very stirring and even hunting, and the whole cast to give wonderful surprises. David Sauceet is always ineligible as Pierre, and Geraldine James and Anna Canada Marshal are just as horrible. But for me, Monica Dolan was Mrs Gilchrist, she is the best supporting actress of the Pirot episode with Doubled Samtor and Polly Walker, how good it was in her performance. Above all, one must certainly be one of the best Pyroot episodes and certainly one of the more faithful people. 10/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
