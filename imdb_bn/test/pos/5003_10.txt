This is a great show with total trivia and innovation. That's the normal chair (sofa for a woman), that compulsory band has a pair of tunes, the same old joke, copy from the same sample Nebuchadnezzer days .... Perhaps Johnny Carson's Pattern, copy by one and all, Latterman, Leno, Kan .. Dal, this show does not seem like any. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show in the first 10 minutes and I'll be in it. Although it can be said very quickly that most of the talk shows seem to be so different from the others, and I hope this show will refrain from any intellectual tendency. I hope this program will last for a long time! <br /> <br /> I love this event even after a few months back, and I love her self-harming humor (for example, her determination is that only the people of the pot will live, see her show on midnight on Saturday, and in this way, the joke is funny only to the idiots ), However, does not include the usual monkeys of Canaan O'Brien, for example (I know it is a fundamental sin which is exposed by O May be disorganized) Brian's antics, but I really dislike his style and iteration). <br /> <br /> I saw it again with Tom Arnold on the other night. FairSane trading spawns (and 911 in the previous episode 9) Sunny Idiot Paparazzi makes fun, especially when a security guard warns them to take pictures of people, and (if I'm not mistaken) they start shouting the word "Gary Coleman" and taking pictures of her. <br /> <br /> has been added on April 16, 2007: coming back again, I'm left confused by the neighbor and his dog.

He is crazy than a bunch of monkeys and so I will write his suggestion here better: I want him to show a 30-minute show with the commercial crazy Crazy Gideon on the last 30 minute TV. I want an interview on Crazy Gideon Spice's talk show, sing a song (play guitar), do a sketch on the SNL line, and answer the questions of the audience of Los Angeles's possible mayoral (I know that Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this However, it has been explained in detail why he may be the perfect candidate for Mayor of LA. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> on July 14, 2007 Come back Someone wrote here that Spike's comments are praised by people who are acclaimed by Spike, and I acknowledge that Spike has really bribed me, but I must admit that Rockefeller gave me the name of his wish and last night I had sex with Syndy Crowford. .
