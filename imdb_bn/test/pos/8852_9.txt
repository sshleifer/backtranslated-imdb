Brightly a sensational flick of John Carpenter is a great combination of sai-fi and horror, which takes the classic body-swap theme and accepts it extremely quickly. The original essay of 1951 holds a revival of the Hawk Haq, theme-themed themes of the Cold War War of the Carpenter, and believes in the retreat of foreign takeover and impending condemnation of the separation of Antarctic setting. The direction of the cartridge is always excellent, because its camera glides through the only earth of such characters, whose living environment is going to be polluted by the initial fear of the body's takeover. But just like David Krenberg's work here, the presenter does not hold the event, with some superb special effects, we are witness to some insane moments of the supernatural Gore. However, he will not touch the human body of the story, as we face all of the sudden happenings in front of us, we have gone through the views of belief and doubt. <br /> <br /> 9/10
