Well, what's wrong with the headline titled "Different Lies" (elsewhere is "not sensational"). It's cute, fine and somewhat poetic (Of course there is a Phil Collins Song and James Belushi film "Separate Life" which is mentioned here.) <br /> <br /> But the moral conflict of lying on various stages of the film is probes. All right, this is not an "in-your-face" ridiculous title, but it's not a light-hearted movie about you. Please give British movie like this opportunity. They try to think of people about important things, such as: How far do you go to protect your life against unexpected disasters (even slightly weak). Maybe you lie Maybe you ignore your loved ones's lies That many people can wear. <br /> <br /> American films of this theme are widely available, but they do more by using firearms which are not part of everyday life in Europe. <br /> <br /> Maybe we are not so much "exciting" here, but we do not expect slogan-like film titles for movies that are not intended for large masses.
