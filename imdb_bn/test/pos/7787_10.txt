Andy, you always have my favorite comedy film. Two Amir and Salman Khan have performed wildly, Amir's performance is much better than Salman. Amir Khan 'Mr. Bollywood's perfectionist 'and he proved it in every film. <br /> <br /> The story is about two young people Amir (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) both from poor families and big dreamers, they want to become rich without enduring any pain. So when they came to India to find her wife, when they heard about Raveena Bajaj (Rabina Tendon), daughter of Bajaj (Paramesh Rawal), they both fooled their father to marry Rabina Bajaj and the journey started. There is also a twist in the movie that makes the movie more fun. Paresh Rawal dual role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and always acted as he did. Shakti Kapoor (Criminal Master Gogo) added a great comedy <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is from the first minute to the end of a Ribi Tikling comedy and it is one of Bollywood's classic comedy films.
