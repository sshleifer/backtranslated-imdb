Well melodrama, which tells the story of Sally's Tomboy dancer, is a circus dancer in circus, as well as Performance McGarley (played by WC Fields), she's top hat, a little trumpet, checker pants and skills awake, pickpocket, and runner-like three card monts and old shell games. Carnival Con Games. McGarley has raised Sally, who was married to Sally's mother ("Circus Man") after her death, calling her "the real father" and leaving Seli orphan. Sally McGarle is her mentor and loyalist, and she does not care about what she does - but McGarley is guilty of keeping her own family in the circus instead of these years. When he finished his carnival in the city of his wealthy grandfather, McGarley used the opportunity to "investigate" Sally's real family, with the idea that he could bring them back. But grandfather disagrees with the judge immediately for Sally because she does not like "show girl" - is she a harsh, narrow man? Meanwhile, Sally is busy following a handsome and rich young man, who helped Grandpa get his wealth. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie with some smiles here and there. Curious editing style (I do not know how to describe it with a long shot, then a few seconds back or suddenly the angle of change changes). Carroll Dempster, who is playing Sally, is delighted here - his performance is quite tricky and ridiculous. W.C. In addition to the fields, even his famous voice, is very funny - just as he left and his funny, humorous reactions (like a small dog seen in a fun scene), we even saw him awake in a short time. I love the old fashion circus and a few peeks of carnival shown here. Its print in DVD looks very nice, colors a light sepia tone and the piano score is really nice for it, based on Philip Kelly's original coup sheet.
