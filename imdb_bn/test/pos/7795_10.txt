Rajkumar Santoshi succeeded in trying his hand at the comedy. Salman Khan is one of the few good films involved. The end of a very funny movie from the beginning. All characters contribute to the movie and believe me, there are a lot of them. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Ravina Tendon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Biju Khot, Jagdeep, Dave Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Tulsaniya and more. The direction, the editing, the sound is not the same, but it still does not matter, because the actors are more than ready for that part.
