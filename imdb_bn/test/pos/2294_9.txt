I agree with BigAlSy - Before living in Japan for a year in 1993, this film actually prepared me to have many cultural differences and practice. Tom Selek always does a fantastic job here, and the film is quite funny and educational. I am a big fan of Tom Seleck, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma, I'm not able to drag any other actor by bringing this film to life. This was the Japanese actor for the first time in this movie, and it was very entertaining to watch while talking with Selkekak - I can imagine the fun that I had seen during the filming of the film - to be a great Japanese, you have to make a party Do not want to see the sight, or just accept everything.
