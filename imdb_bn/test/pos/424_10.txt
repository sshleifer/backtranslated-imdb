I love this show. It's tricky and very well played. David Morshey and Andre Bruehrer have excellent chemistry. The text is tricky and concubine usually gives great humor. After every new episode, I am always wondering and at the same time entertain this event. My only complaint is that in the absence of Dona Morphy, in the second phase, at this time. David Morris, as a former wife, Heather, added that character to Shoke. <br /> <br /> I think this show is a achievement of crime / drama series. That said - I can not understand why this life is so low rating for my life. Does anyone please show this show in 1 criticism with this review?
