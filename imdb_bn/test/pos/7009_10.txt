I'm 15 years old, usually my age kids usually do not see this old classic movie. But this is my favorite one. I was completely addicted after seeing it first. It's really good that if you think about technology and movies at that time, the music is great, the story is fine, the corridor is superb, it must be seen. I do not know why there is a prick for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but I love classic love movies, they are better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and dance. The music is absolutely interesting and beautiful. I did not see the Winnerty Dance 2 Harvana Night (Prix), the prickle's real actor should be star, which I hate about the premise, they destroy the root. If someone wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many agree that for a movie - the original, the seagull and the third are enough. Outside, people will not be bothered to see it. Who thinks about the movie about St. Benard Beethoven? I think there are 5 movies completely.
