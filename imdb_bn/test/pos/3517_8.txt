Don really really surprised me when I saw an awesome horror adventure being much less than I expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman maintains a surprisingly anxious and chaotic environment for the vast portions of the film, until I was not sure that until I was about to go, I apparently developed suspense, but I was waiting for the spring to wait. Due to lack of action in many areas, it is very disgusting with the Chansso massacre of Texas, and when it really works, it is really frustrating and dramatic, sometimes it does not need to be poor. The characters for this type of film are almost equal, though some are more sympathetic than the ones, and the bad guy memorably weird. Photography and mystery are the real winners in this film and they continue to be totally dull (as suggested). I strongly recommend this one to a terrible fan. Do not expect gore, hope to have a wonderful backwoods story with several wonderful moments and a great dreamlike ambiance.
