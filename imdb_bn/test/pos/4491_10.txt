When I saw this for the first time this program has completely absorbing effect on me I do not forget. From the moment that has become amazing, by the great Clonner, for the extreme effort of his extreme situation ("We are alive, we humans, we have to remember!" Unreasonable quote will stop but) from its painful efforts, to revive the way to escape, it is a frustrating drama. <br /> <br /> After watching this, there is little touch with viewers for a long time. At the moment when the lovely ballet dances for everyone, Scottish musicians scare the bagpipes; The impressive comments of the tram, "A Miss is just as good as a mile", Major's disappointing decision is that they will stay in hell. <br /> <br /> This is a bright episode, nicely written and played. Susan Harrison's exciting beauty has added to the story of strange, sensitive stories.
