It can be said that it is a very shiny movie about the time-out. Film authors French, it is very interesting to think that Vibi can "explain outside the ideals", because it is not generally known as "Hong Kong Cinema" <br /> <br /> The film expresses concern over a thief who equally tries to take some criminal vengeance with the help of a clever driver. But first he will have to satisfy the police to join him on his personal crusade, and so started a series where thieves manage the police in his plan. <br /> <br /> Pretty shiny movie. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (For more detailed reviews of this film or full-length reviews of foreign films visit www.nixflix.com)
