I'm not going out of my way to see romantic comedy, and maybe I'll be in the future after coming back to me. The plot was easy after the promotion and there was no secret. You do not have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. Let you relax and let Caste take you to a world where "chemistry" is abundant and good people win and you can just laugh and get a good time. I love this movie .... and have the DVD sequence!
