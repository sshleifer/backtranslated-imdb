De Suneer is inspired to make a two-part song by a horror movie. The topic of the song he wrote / directed / produced and starred in the film (from Horror-Territory, Twiststister / St Hanguri). People have said that he should have a sick mind to do something like this. No one is listening to Steffen King, Wes Craven, Dean Quantz or his own time to comment about Alfred Hittak. A modern psychology profile created by current trends in film society. Personally I thought it was done very well with imagination and inspiration, in addition to the big budget and besides interviewing real victims / criminals. If you want to give nightmare and you want to cringe about potential and potential this movie is perfect. It can be !!
