I really like this movie due to all the stars and dance and stories that go along. Rita Hareth was the fatest of her musical instruments and dresses were quite beautiful. Although a musical, I thought Rita Hayworth plays a dramatic performance in this film, well thought out a fine performance. Until his dance, I think he was nice. Even Bati Grable was praised by Rita's dance on this film as much as she danced the ring around her own dancing and commented, Bati Grable was an excellent dancer. Cinematography and vivid colors are also mentioned. Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she is in love with her mentor played by Jean Kelly. Has he fulfilled his dream and bypassing love and Broadway stardom, or is he looking for a unique pearl that will change his life forever? Find out the film!
