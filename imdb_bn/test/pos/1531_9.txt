This movie took me to surprise. I saw it 10 years ago, and it still remains with me. It just got a bit of annoying points, and I, personally, would have ended it differently - at least it does not discourage me to see it and recommend it to others. Acting is _fantastic_. Cast and the director did a great job with the script and whoever liked the film 'Separate', who has been sitting and patiently saying, "What is this?", And allowed to drag themselves, this film is a chance to give. If you want to fool Allan Ricman or see things bursting, it's not a movie for you.
