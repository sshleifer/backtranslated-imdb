This is one of my favorite films, dating back to my childhood. In the beginning of the century, it was established in the remote desert of Siberia, when a cool winter winter brings two tigers to two tigers from the mountains in search of winter crops, then excite a small community. In this atmosphere we got acquainted with Avakum, which is a wild trap trap, who lives in the wild, comes to the village when he visits Boris his annual, close, and only friend, who is in the village store. At the request of Boris, Avakum took her friend, a proud barbarian, Evan to a tragic tiger. Personality crashes and tempers flare as older, criticized more experienced Avakum Ivan's amateur method, to face one of the targets by other members of the victim. On the second day, the hunters see their victims and pay the chase. In a thick wood, Ivan Tiger attacked one of the wounds, which then fell fierce. Evakum, fighting Ivan with an angry animal, but accidentally hit Ivan. He killed the tiger as he killed the tiger. Other predatory scenes, to reach the suspicious. <br /> <br /> Back to the village, doctors worked to save Ivan injured. Avakum tried to leave the village, but Ian's friends were confronted. The trailer closes them, and increases the speed with its dog-drawn slide. The young villagers then swear that after Ivan died, they would come for him, which he did later, but before his death, he explained to his father that it was an accident. After learning about his close friend from village to village, Old Boris, collects "lion's crowd" and goes straight out of Ovakam, to find him and set things right. And so the original story begins. <br /> <br /> A common film, it creates the struggle of man versus man's conflict and civilization, nature of nature, mainly the struggle of Awakum to live alone in the desert. Landscape in the winter is very well-pictured. Perhaps the most powerful element in the hostel's soundtrack film. Very sensitive and enthusiastic, Algino's adagio is a memorable issue. Other movements reflect the Russian style, as well as the tune of a few pairs of musical sounds of folk music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this image, my knowledge, which is rather not available to buy a shame. About 20 years ago my own copy has been reduced gradually by recording off the TV. This movie must be seen for those who appreciate it, if they find it. 8/10
