As they came to the first external banks and heard the movie (I lived my life here), I waited for the film to come out. And I waited and waited and waited for more than a year and a half for this movie, it was valuable to me. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit different from the book but in my eyes, it still works piece as beautiful book piece. I both cried, at the time that pulled me. I smiled and I just smiled much. This is a great movie with a great story line. <br /> <br /> This is never found, which will change you forever. That will shape your soul and awaken you in a completely new perspective of life. <br /> <br /> I would say that it is possible to meet anyone and it can be possible to change your life forever, which is the character of Lane which is the character of Lane. I met the love of my life and was completely impressed once I never forgot or stayed with him, until I met him again after a year. My whole heart could be related to this movie with me. I think if you listen to the movie with your heart and see what you are saying about your expectations. Finding your true love is not too late, great work Mrs. Lane and Mr. Cure!
