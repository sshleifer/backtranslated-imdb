I like this movie! So long running time value. I finally needed help .... <br /> <br /> * Finally the final shot of Mary - is it still recommending that she is still searching for Rend? Or perhaps he wanted to revive 13 people? (He seems to have given Colin first letter initially) I did not fully understand, but I know I really like it. So if someone has seen it and thinks it or saw it, please please detail it at the end. <br /> <br /> Thank you
