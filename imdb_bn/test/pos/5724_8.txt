Tempo de Ukidre (Time to Kill) is a bit of a diverse film by Giuliano Montealdo, but it is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I will not be disturbed by the essence of this plot. I have misunderstood what I read and believe me most of the people who did not really understand this movie. And even if you understand it at some level, you can not even describe what it is actually about. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is known that many actors who This is the main or gradually growing work. The cage was not yet a real star when this was created. I'm not his fan. He played some role very well (raises the Arizona, brought out dead) and he weakens playing the hero. I really can not think of him in this, but he certainly does not portray the hero's main character. He could have done this picture besides, but the act that he played is only able to make it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Helpful Cast is good. None of them show fake and they actually work there. Solid Support. <br /> <br /> I've seen 3 films from Montaldo (Marco Polo, Sacro and Vanzati and this one) and I think he is one of the directors of this period. Unfortunately, no one knows him. This movie was ending in its long period (19 year break). I think this movie may fail in the office, but from the way it is done, I think it was a private project for Montaldo that he really liked. <br /> <br /> The production is great. It's always enough. Dusty army camps, clustofobic towns and fantastic landscapes are all a great part. It seems all too real. In some scenes you can feel almost heat. The sound itself is not something special, but music by Enio Merrokro is very good. It's not a piece that whistle when it's showering, but it sure works great. <br /> <br /> So this movie shows, feel and just right. It does not serve lessons found on a golden plate, but it can be the biggest difference between Hollywood and euro-cinema. It might be a strange word to give an 8 and it does not recommend to humans, but that's what I do You are looking for actions; To avoid this one! If you are looking for a well-made apocalypse now with a different time and setting, but with the same 'mind status' same journey (sorry this sound is corny but I do not know what to call it) can enjoy just one of these one
