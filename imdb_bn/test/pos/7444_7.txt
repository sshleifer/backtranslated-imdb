Some big speakers, you have been warned <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at the Venice Film Festival yesterday, and I must admit that being a fan, it was really reactionary. Excellent graphic, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent verb sequence and much more ... but there is a but. It was exclusively thought of for all the gamer who liked the movie, and for this reason, it is in every single reference, character, comedy (see the music you want to win especially the humorous music). A poor man is not in the world, but the FF can clearly see the glory of the technical part, but can not understand the inner satisfaction of seeing, for example, Barrett is fully out of Bah√°tut and is shooting. He will ask himself, "Who is this song?", And I can not blame him. When a gamer thinks of a gamer in the first open song, he still can not understand that Nakaki was driving the canyon with his two children, trembling at the ruins of the monastery and then "498 years ago ..." Almost all the characters have made an appearance or quote (including Rev, Teng and Allen), and Reno and Rud was really crazy and ridiculous to watch, but the final impression of the movie going to me was "the ultimate dream of hardcore gamer, but it's a little less Movie fan ... ".
