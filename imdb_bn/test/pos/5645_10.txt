This is probably one of the greatest war movies and certainly one of the greatest films. There is no thought, there is no patriotic agenda, even in this silent manifestation, hopeful of universal brotherhood which we can call only in hell. This is the lack of silent hardness and manipulation which gives the film its amazing power. There is no attempt to defeat the leader of Inchikoya Tamur's hero. He hopes that trying to survive in a terrible world is a poorly destroyed snake, but because he is not sure he can hang in his way to humanity in this process. The intense lack of inkwaywala fork and delusional fire only put plain stands. Ichikawa died in February 2008.
