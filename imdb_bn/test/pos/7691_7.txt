I first saw Auto Preminger's "Purgie and Base" opening on TV, probably sometime in the mid-80's, and despite my little short music, my little temperament is found to be a bit slower. I turned it off <br /> <br /> Last night, very rare, printed printed together in LA Cinemethak and it was a bit of a direct audience. Performance is powerful and memorable. Dorothy Dondridge refers to sex in her part of her weakness, strength and fine (at least today's standard). Sidney Poitier is called uncomfortable with the movie, but its performance is awesome, as well as Perl Bailey. Even better, like Sammy Davis, immortal, sport life like Cats, and Brock Peter, as a tremendously sharp crown. <br /> <br /> I still see the premiere's ex-lead - and much easier - "Carmen Jones. " Porgy and Bess "is much more common than the less controversial film - although the element of the source that is to be associated with it is even better. <br /> <br /> Last night, it is far from a sturdy but perfect work. There is some pain that is mixed with the actual style of the film, with the usual style, the Catfish Ro Set (nicely done by Oliver Smith). Instead of vulnerable ears, some small parts of scores seem to be unnecessarily popular. <br /> <br /> It also does not diminish from the creditors of the filmmakers - although the decision of the premimation is almost entirely shot in the film, with no close-ups And medium mid-shot, there is no doubt that it has been rendered unreasonably on "pand and scan" TV And even if it qualifies for recovery, it can even destroy it on the widescreen DVDs. On the small screen we will not be able to create many details, it is important to manage the filming of Priming. <br /> <br /> Also, it was weird to hear the last night. The voices were embarrassed by many, especially in the opening "summer" with a soft feel and mechanical music. Perhaps it can be fixed in recovery. <br /> <br /> There are problems with ethnic politics in the film. Personally, at least in a contemporary context, I can not see anything wrong with it. When the strong images of African-American characters are seen in such a short time, it may seem unfortunate for a big budget Hollywood movie. And, although there may not be many "empowerment" here, these are not recognized mankind, which are not ethnic customs. It's the operators who make poor choices because it does not make sad letters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> compared to humans. They may actually be poor and illiterate people of any ethnic background. <br /> <br /> On one side of the thorny politics, the original work is undoubtedly American music and (secondly) one of the truly great achievements of the theater. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and, yes Pearl Bailey, is not all the amazing actors who we would like to see again. Better but still less than this strong film, these are clearly visible and can be treasured.
