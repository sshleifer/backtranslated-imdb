Stambett Willie is an important movie in our movie history. This is the second appearance of Mickey Mouse (which followed the Crusade on Silent Plan before that year), probably its most famous film - because in most cases it was land-breaking. Because it was the first sound cartoon. You still can not listen to Mikey, but there are plenty of sound effects and music throughout the film - but for the sake of what we've taken now, but in 1928 there was a huge crowd applicant. <br /> <br /> Now, if there was only one important historical movie, it is valuable to watch - especially to lovers of animation. However, after meeting again after 25 years, I was amazed at how cruel the film really is. When we treat Mickey and Minis slightly different than the character of love (most often thanks to the talent of Kaki Man and Animator Ub Weaver's), the film has infectious attraction. Very tragic (sometimes ruthlessly) Mikey is very sad to see him playing "Turkey in the Straw". Glittery and a real crowd - This picture is still among Mickey's best films after 80 wonderful years.
