This movie shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was incredible touch. They speak German and Russian, which makes it more credible and practical. This is a must see movie. Actors are very great. A really good piece of work This WWII WWII takes place in a German soldier. To fight against the Soviet soldiers, they have to go to Stolengrad, Soviet. You connect more with each soldier in this group and follow them through all the dangers stuck in Stalingrad. They meet face to face with death, blood, sorrow and Russia's coolness. This is definitely a movie movie and you can not see it.
