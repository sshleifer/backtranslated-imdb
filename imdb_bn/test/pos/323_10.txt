It pays to see the reader's digest. Or Time, if it was the original source of the article, but it was presented as Mani Ratnam's supposed inspiration to create this masterpiece. Based on a real story taken in search of adopted parents, Mr. Ratnam draws a classic figure that mocks as soon as possible, as soon as it is disciplined and publicized as soon as practiced. <br /> Where will it start? What is the forecast of the new conflict in Sri Lanka? A family chaotic family led by a fireman engineer-writer and 3 superb naughty kids? Or is there a dirty area where the reality crosses the point of providing comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredible and horrible events and ideology? It shows you anyway, this image is valuable for your collection, if you like the great plays of Gem Ratnam. <br /> <br /> One of the fantasy imagines among real life events is a past master and in this movie, he is unknown to class to transform two real life stories into one. It will look better than reading it better as I will go into the story. But, what I do affects me and why it can not destroy the simple but incredible power that can be expected for the war-clashes that took place during this World War. <br /> <br /> Innocence, in its purity, can not fathom the complex desires of adult disappointments and temptations. It does not recognize the danger when it is endangered, with a strong determination to find what it wants. This is the nature of innocence that invents Amudha for its biological parents, despite the warnings that they may be lost in the story of civil war. Only after experiencing a terrorist experience with a physically challenged person, he can only realize that he is in a disguise with a more deadly entity, unmoving his will in such a way that he tears the resistance of his well-wishers. And finally, when the two meet, the mother and the daughter, reunion is so intense with emotions that even naturally acceptable parents also decrease in tears. A And supported by Rahman's dangerous background score, this scene is shocked to dissolve the heartwarming hearts: it is a list of questions to ask Regina to ask her biological mother. In the sequence of events, in a final stage as dramatic, a child lives in the body, discovering his mother, but losing the soul. The kisser realizes that he is not expecting anybody with the survivor who lives with him, Amrita is with his adoptive mother, what does the title of this film mean: a peal on the cheek. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratanam has a gift to gift a gift to the lesser known artist in a spectacular way, but it will take nothing away from the Kehrthana for a reward-winning performance. He embraced the scene in almost every frame with cast supporter in support of Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and extraordinary Nandita Das (Shyama). Music can not be remembered as the proposition of other Rahman, but has not prevented him from providing other national awards for the direction of the best music. "Velay Peimala" is much more than the need to foster human life for nature. Dialogue is top-class (sample sensitive exchanges, Amuuda and Indira are swimming, after Indira's biological daughters, and cinematography, superb.) <br /> <br /> This picture as soon as a weapon drops to honor human life and expression. . Do not judge it as a lesson in film making; Moni Ratnam-A R. Rahman's stability, you will face a very good one.
