After seven years of showing the first game, it was my second experience in the monkey island series. What was my reaction? "Oh, great, we're playing a cartoon." I'm glad my brother stopped me, because Jocus again drew my attention, as well as the excellent voice-activation of Armstrong Gaibash - not everyone correctly (I still feel better than CMI's Alin) External machines) . Cutscenes are good at portraying something happening, and both the game and cutscenes are excellent in the industry. When we got the CD with the revenge of the Secret and Levite, we both were delighted and spent time working with revenge - it was a moment where we were just sitting and blowing up for half a day. However, CMI will be playing the monkey island, especially for the battle of the sword and for the high sea war I have played the most. At that moment when you face Keni and she told you she went straight, "I'm driving a gun!" My brother and I were tears from both smiles. And not until that, the best part of the game is not.
