Two soldiers are a fine example of making a fine film. The director and producer took a heartwarming story and made it alive with a highly skilled and dedicated cast, extraordinary cinematography, and very creative art. <br /> <br /> The brothers' taste was illustrated with the lifestyle of the woods. With great details, and with the militaristic lifestyle they were intensely reversed that they had shields. The interaction between the virus brought smiles and tears because they fought hard and peaceful lives in the retreat of North Carolina and even struggled with the difficult life of war. The actress was very good, especially the elder brother (played by Jonathan Furry) Big Brother (played by Ben Alison) and Colonel's strong performance (played by Ron Perlman). Performance was very good throwing. <br /> <br /> Two soldiers were delighted to enjoy the magic, and I sincerely recommend it to the listener of all ages.
