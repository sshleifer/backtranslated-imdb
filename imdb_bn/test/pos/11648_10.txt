After reading most of my opinion, I think I have something to say. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem is that most people here think that this film supports the issue of death. Punishment and whether it works with them. I think I read an article when it was published in 1995 (yes, it has made me so interested in it since I heard that it will come out that I am not forgetting about the articles I read) Tim Robins says <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I admit that I believe that on the way to making this movie he did a little for the death penalty Nevertheless, people still allow their own choices. And this is a very rare thing among American movies. <br /> <br /> I have shown this movie to many people because it has come and I have seen all kinds of feedback. Supporters of the deaths became opponents and became stronger in their faith. And many executed opponents (including me) have become strong in their belief that the death penalty should be canceled throughout the world. But I have even seen the opponents turned into supporters. This and the people here that fight about me show me that there are many ways to see it. So what impacts this is on you, the important thing that makes you think. <br /> <br /> This is a few movies that you really like, which is not ashamed by a simple path. The guilty is either bad or innocent. This can be a difficult thing for those who like to choose entertainment or to love text. There is no text where you have to find yourself. <br /> <br /> Everybody appreciates acting, instruction and music, but since it has been told so many times I will not repeat it again. <Br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do so - if you dare to challenge!
