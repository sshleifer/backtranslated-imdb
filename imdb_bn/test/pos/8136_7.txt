This is not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is the last silent movie of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The end of an era! Laurel and Hardy's' 20's mobile phone has left a real sign of movie style, which is still popular and seen and is being regularly broadcasted, in this present day. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that this movie is a great way of doing this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The boys were grouped together with a goat at this time, which certainly leads them to hardships and watches for us some sunny situations. But at the same time very stupid and watch the comedy staff boys with a goat is completely incredible. Most of the movies still work well, but the film is not really fun or memorable. Comedy and stories really feel occasionally and mostly very easy and predictable. <br /> <br /> Certainly still good and fun to watch for fans but still a little frustrating quietly silently and hard-hearted entry. <br /> <br /> 7/10
