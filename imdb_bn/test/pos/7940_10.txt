A stunning piece of art. You can see each image of the film and see the beauty. First of all I want to say that I saw the helmet of the Germans, I realized that it came from "war" Hadi was inspired. This scene was very scared when they beat the baby and I did not like it when I saw it. But when the movie ended, I thought about the scene and changed my mind and thought that in World War II, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the visual image is really nice. Then Prokofiev scored one of history's most famous sound tracks and I think it was the best thing to do. <br /> <br /> What else can you say then a job? Art. Einstein is a stunning masterpiece, a campaign film and a beautiful work done in the industry. I'm very happy because I just got the message collection Eisenstein set.
