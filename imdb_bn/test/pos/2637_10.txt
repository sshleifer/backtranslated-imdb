This movie was really fun. Expected people can see themselves in a comedy comedy. It was a fun movie to watch funny and funny characters, plot lines, dialogue quotes and catch phrases. I rated a movie 10 if I bought a DVD, or in this case, the videotaped, and seen it many times, and in this case, still laughing loudly About 10 ratings, I have 12 movies in my collection and almost half of them do not have anything to do with the Oscars. Again, it was a fun, light-hearted movie. I hope this DVD comes out. I highly recommend checking out this movie, you are in the mood for a messy comedy.
