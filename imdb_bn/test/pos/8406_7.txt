After growing up with GWW, I've surpassed both the "Scarlet" Siegel books and the Mini series so far. When I recently watched the video for the first time, how much did I enjoy seeing it being pictured as Roth Bottler and Juan Wallie-Killer scarlet from Titlene Dalton. I think "scarlet" should be judged on his own competence rather than trying to compare with respected Celestial Masterpiece GWTW. Although the lines of the story "Scarlett" and some conversations were caused by the lack of inspired writing, overall I thought that what could be between Scarlett and Rite is an appropriate dramatization.
