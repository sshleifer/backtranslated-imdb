I do not know why critics say it's a bad movie, it's one of my favorite movies. Tommy (Chris Furley) and Richard (David Spad) are a great match. Tommy, who has spent seven years in college, eventually passed by D +. Richard Smart Child who hated everyone at school. How do you laugh when you sincerely start singing "Superstar" to the two people and suddenly pops the hood? All this is a great movie, I recommend it.
