I'm not talking about what I'm saying behind the camera, I'm referring to the taste of the audience. The idea of ​​a "chick flick" is alive and well today, though still lots of action and horror films which primarily apply for men. Of course, there are men and women who enjoy movies outside of their general population, but there are not many movies that appeal across the board. Hit, the last will Smith Smith tries to change the trend by flashing a chick that throws the male's outlook. <br /> <br /> Smith's hit title character, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, "Dated Doctor" tells how to contact a man and train men for a successful date. Hit enjoys her job and men love to successfully complete their dream of going out with their dream woman, but due to the bad experience of college, Hit prevents herself from the idea of ​​love.

There is doubt about the possibility of Hit Albert, but if his clients feel genuine, the hits support them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the dated doctor can not follow his advice to become a follower of Sarah. Sara's work has become more complicated by the things that led him to investigate the relationship between the accountant and heir. Will Hit Be able to balance his personal life and his work? And more importantly, can you believe love again? If you are a true movie fan, you have complained about the lack of Hollywood movie factories in your life and have cried for something new and original. Well, that movie is not a hit. However, most movie fans will also acknowledge that sometimes a formulaic film can work at an entertainment level. Hit that qualifies as a film.
