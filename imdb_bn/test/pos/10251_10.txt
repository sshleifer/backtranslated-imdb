The movie was very good, when I went out, I joined Kuolie High and the Kuolie High Grade Center, in 1968, I was the queen of the house and grew up and lived in the Cebernina Greenens area, I knew many people in the movie that friends in the movies living in the region It was great to see, and they could be a star that can be a living experience for them, the north side I grew up in my good times and hard times I could relate to the movie Cooley High is not permanent but a person like me is still and we still remember the fun of becoming big in the presence of Cooley, there are many history around this north side area.
