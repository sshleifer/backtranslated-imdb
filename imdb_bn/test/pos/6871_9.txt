On Monday night at Tom Snyder's "Kal" show, I asked Tom, his guest, Henry Morgan, that he was "perfect". Morgan responded, "something with Glenda Jackson." And even though I do not think this movie is perfect, it is a very good idea. I'm not going to take such a picture about Hollywood, I'm going to use the clich√©, but then I saw, "Up in the Air," another intelligent film more than 35 years old, who is in love. Match that even though there are similarities. "House Colossus" is just two professional professionals like Matthoos and Jackson just stops it and it just shows perfect fun considering it's completely natural. I saw this movie in the theater in 1978 (at the age of 18) and it took me more than twenty years to get all jokes. The 1920's tennis great Bill Tiilden and the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's fifty lines could not play any film well in the magazine. One other thought: The Montage Beatles / George Harrison tune, "Some", set in 'Beatles / In Love' in the main theatrical release. It seemed to be somewhat compulsive at the time, but the song was subsequently made to the home video and genre Henry Manasini music queue for the release of the movie. Very bad, because that scene is there now, there is another victim of music license.
