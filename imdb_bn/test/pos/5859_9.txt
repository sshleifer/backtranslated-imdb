Apart from a few extraordinary TV series, I could be very tired of the mystery of the murder. Otherwise, there are a lot of themes in this murder plot. I do not like the theme of two glossy, selfish youth as an intellectual exercise, I do not see any interest in Hitcoos that seem to have been related to it in any way. . But do not misunderstand me, the theme itself is excellent, the whole movie is done very well, and of course Sandra Bulac is always the highest. <br /> <br /> The character of Sandra (as Mrs. Consolation) is not rated by a male team working with her skilled skills, and the bot mostly ignores her ideas, and finally she gets annoyed and gives the case His male partner Of course, Sandra works and gets killed in almost a very dramatic denouement. His colleague did not let the killer kill him - it's a curious subject that he has no confidence and probably "can be saved, the other is a true psychopath. <br /> <Sandra's hard shell has happened because of his past sufferings that killed He was abducted with his colleagues, who realized that Sandra's horse was heavier than the curved, despite this case Solving it, finally discovering what happened to Sandra in it. Thirteen, which he now faces and exorcise and shows his start of the last scene - we hope to do whatever - just do that. <br /> <br / > I can see the time from other reviews I was in time this movie will attract a broad group - those who are both police in the rebel boys, with their cruel philosophical determination Interested in cutting and perfect away from murder, such relationships that are so well-crafted, horror links heroine past, a police theme, and some smokes and mirrors - as well as for Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> Those who The question is why does Bullock's character have a problematic past, really I think it would be a little less funny movie if he was just a detective, which Taze was trying to understand, a willing psychic helped and a male-champion helped the boss. It is not necessary for the connection between intelligence and intelligence to engage too much or to show intelligence how he lost the confidence of his arrogant boss and then lost his life? This is not a main theme, it is actually a very annoying theme, as the male magnetic boss brusciously expresses his frustration, but clearly shows the motivated operator to get out of the case and leave it to someone who does not have the skill to solve it clearly, though it is a sidekick. I was very worried at the end, what could happen to Sandra's character in terms of his emotional involvement and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of crime, dangerously taking himself with the case. <br /> <br /> I was not frustrated again with the character of Bullock and his sidekick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because we did not think their emotional emotions could rule their relationship. This movie is cleverly thinking to you that any boy is being charged and there are some twists and turns, and boys show their underlying self-contradiction at different levels. <br /> <br /> One thing I have clarified and this is what came to the court of Sindh when "after the movie is over" .... You need to watch the movie to know why you are there. <br /> <br /> played very well. I certainly can not agree with the complainants against Bullock's acting - he was fantastic. The part is really its very well suited. The story is gripping even if the mystery of murder is not your thing and they are often not mine mine.
