Like many great evening zones, one of my favorite parts was simple social commentary that created the story of the Sarlung. My longstanding suspicion about the incident related to "The Hailing Man" of the recent episode was considered, for example, if Jesus came to earth to bring his followers to heaven, then immediately insane and perhaps will be cast into a shelter. Our main character of this episode meets the same problem when he is trying to convince Americans of the 1860s in the future and President Lincoln is killed. The episode incorrectly insists that it means that some parts of the past can be changed but others can not change it, but it is a fun time to travel to the rope. Guessed, we do not really know history can be changed by time travel because the time travel has not been completed and, sadly, never will be. But I think it is embarrassing that if you can set yourself physically in the past, then nothing can happen physically unless you shout like a killer like a killer. <br /> <br> My opinion among the consistently interesting things about time travel movies and TV shows is the time of travel time. There is, of course, no way, our main character talks about the time travels of a palanquin club and then goes out and dissolved from the early 1960s to 1860, but there is no problem. In the evening the zone did not hit me for my complex sets or high production costs so far. <br /> <br /> Russell Johnson played the part of Peter Cargin's traveler and discovered that he has come back in some way, the only day he killed Lincoln, he led himself to jail, but fortunately for him, John Wilkes Booth was leaked to the police station for some reason. Going and trying to describe the catastrophic killing. That booth was planned for that night. <br /> <br /> The booths requested Corrigan's custody for some psychological exams, and the police officer saw nothing wrong with leaving this man in custody. He had a business card, after all, how bad could he be? <br /> <br /> The show shows that you can change the life of people by changing some of the past through time travel, and I will not include restrictions that are not willing to take that time when it is still a fun episode which I think, which is one of my favorite attributes on the Good Evening Zone ...
