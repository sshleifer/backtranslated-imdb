I'm not sure what I can expect from this film, it was a good cast, a catchy story line and a whole bunch of things for it, but I still could not reduce my horror feeling. It would be like what my stomach was about. I was very glad that I was very happy with the result and expressed concern with everyone. The film opening scenes were extremely impressive and were enough to maintain the initial interest of the film. As well as the film progress, along with the character of the film as well as what happened in the prison riot was presented to us. Most reviews for this movie seem like, I must admit that there are some unnecessary clich√©s but it can not be removed as a good novel, the overall power of this film can not be removed. Casts are all great, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and one of the best movies of this year is the film. Of course valuable value is if you are looking for a good courtroom drama.
