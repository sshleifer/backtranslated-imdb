In contrast to bonds and other detective films, Alfred Hittkok's hero was a common man who was in trouble and used to go through his skills and courage (and luck). Jhel chief is based on the same principle and in this way it is a tribute to the mystery of victory happiness. It may be as respected but it stands on its own basis and establishes victory pleasure as the great director yourself. <br /> <br /> It's a common man's story, who one day understands that its a double is actually a jewel thief. Suddenly, modestly finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and protects himself by staying behind a wild sage, which keeps this immortal one step ahead of him. This movie is almost always a victim of murder and you are hurt by the brightness of this project because the plot is unfolding. Like Hitkoc's movies, prison chief can boast of a huge climax shot inside the Grand Palace of Sikkim. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I all understand; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Bhajanti Mala, Tanuja, S. D. Varman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. This is one of India's greatest thrillers.
