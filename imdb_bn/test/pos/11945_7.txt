This movie is sort of like "Better of Dead", which is similar to its stars. This one is not quite good though. It's rather funny and enjoyable, "Well ... there's something I like about." These people are going to Nantucket to spend this summer vacation. There they see this girl who is trying to save the house here, this man wants to make him a lobster restaurant. This guy does not look like a lobster, because in one scene he gives a stick in boiling water and puts it in the stethoscope so that he can hear screams. To throw this girl and the girl's daughter on the bed, which wants to make a restaurant. This may be a big boat race showdown, for some reason or another, it's kind of "Summer Renting", although it works a bit better here and fits in it, the plot is a little better. What is the contract of boat at this time? Was some strange attraction with them? In most cases this movie laughs at a good clip, but "Better of Dead" was even better. The first and joke did well.
