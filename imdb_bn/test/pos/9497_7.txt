I found this movie filled with taunts. But to see the movie you can see what almost you can see. Leila is a confused, boring house wife, who is constantly looking for happiness. When he thinks he finds true happiness, then he leaned over him, knowing what he knew behind him. But he himself finds himself in comparison to the notes between his former husband and her husband. She learned that if she knew more about the annoyance she had had on her previous marriage, then that was even easier. He understands that the words are nothing but verb, but he can learn more in his second marriage and look back on himself and hope for change. The main conflict in this movie, Lilla v. Herself. With real happiness, you can not get true happiness. I liked this movie, but I would recommend only this movie to women, I can not really enjoy a man in this movie.
