Snoquin is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: Lumann's Romeo and Juliet or Spielberg's titanic is much better and deeper. Gerda's love affects me everytime, her inquiry, her battle is exceptional. Gerda became a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kaya is poisoned by dark forces: temptation. This story encourages me to fight like a guerda, for the love of my life, for Mr. Wright. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I groan every time I grasp Gerda and care all the trouble And I hope it will end soon ... Snoocaine said though in my life, I was deeply familiar with stories and characters. Thanks for at least Hans Christian Anderson and director.
