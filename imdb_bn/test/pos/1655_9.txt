Rififi is a great film that is ignored. This is a criminal drama where a man comes out of prison and plans for another job. It's an over-used story but this one is different from others. They are normal suspects round up for the job. This movie focuses on how the family is separated when time goes out. The real one is the best one I've ever seen. Instead of an honorable soundtrack manager decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. This fits perfectly mood and is often copied this day. Of course, things go out of hand and people die and it ends at a great end, which develops suspense. <br /> <br /> So if you look for a great movie, which does not talk about a lot of people, it's a great pick-up.
