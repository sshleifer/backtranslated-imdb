The warm-hearted Flick portrays a rebellious, overweight, cigarette smoking slab-like arch-angel Michael, who loves to dance and cover opposite sex. He has a good side, but he tried to fix things in a couple life damaged by burning before he remembered in heaven. Interesting, acting acting film; Very usable though a bit irreverent.
