I went out of the curiosity of this movie, and went on to set an argument. This film is now well-known to Sergey Prokofiev's musical suite, collected from his instrumental music in films, trickle movements and pop systems. The general outline of the plot is well known from the slip notes of various recordings. A clerk is present at a list of risks, creating an existential Lieutenant Tigress. Interested in the basket among these individuals, and telling him that he does not exist, courtiers and officials maintain that pretense he is real. Saijia is exiled, remembered, promoted, married, preached, resurrected, died, given the state funeral, has been expressed as an embarrassment and posthumously granted posthumous status. <br /> <br /> Clark invented Kiz, in which the ink bottle and holes were involved, but I heard that the movie was lost, so there is no way to find out what happens. Then the film became part of their prokofiev festival in Berlin as the part of the festival. For the record, it happened that what happened is that Clerk confuses two words while writing a command and turns Kuji into words. For example, there is no time to correct the mistake as there is negligence in the storm. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to be surprised by the historical curiosity. The film is very funny, and the audience, myself included, constantly smiles. Although most of it is directly pictured, most of the palaces are set, but there are some "strategies" shots where multiple images are displayed on the screen. For example, the Summer Army represents a small group, repeats across the screen. Four identical guards execute perfect drill perfect integration. Two identical servants dig the floor <br /> <br /> There was a slight flaw that everyone was very hard to work on. There were two women, who were the daughters of Scar, or daughters, servants or anything else. And very few people are named after them. But above all, an enjoyable movie and I'm surprised it is not often seen.
