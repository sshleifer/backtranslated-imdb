Hitcoak will be proud of this movie. Even when nothing happens, it is suspicious. Director David Lin Ch has highlighted some of the most exciting adventure strategies here and there, but because of their involvement with other cinematographic techniques, it deprives it from disappearance. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie is awakening and it is mostly a dream to remember but it is not enough to make sense. I'm still trying to find out all of it and I'll probably have to see it again to catch something I miss and it will help me understand it better. This is a very detailed plot that comes very slowly, so you must be patient and pay attention. Get your bathroom trip before it starts. And yet, this plot is overtaken by themes, moods, character development, and filming techniques. <br /> <br /> The main role of Naomi Watts, Naomi Watts, shows her tremendous talent. That is, I could get close to her eyes with her co-star. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Collected on the smart use of music and words, it helps our mind to doubtfully build, a main purpose of a suspect director. Well, he kept me at the edge of my seat, even I used to sit here to talk to the actors, there was not so much na√Øve in there. You know, what kind of stuff do you want your kids to work in movies.
