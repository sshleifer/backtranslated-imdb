If you repeat a lie repeatedly, will it be true? 15 Park Avenue is a substitute reality of schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is a fabulous address for her house where her dream husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen has still delivered another masterpiece. Every actor in the film was better than the other. Kankana Sen looks incredibly believable as a schizophrenic. He pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond his age. Shabana Ajmi is incredible as usual. She plays Mithi's supremely independent and independent independent sister, who is taking care of her sick sister and her elderly mother. Despite all his strength and courage, he admitted that he still feels lonely at times. It was a very simple movie for Rahul Bose. The role was at least bit wanted and anyone could play a role. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> It took me a while to finish the film. It leaves me confused and even bored even a bit. But later, it started to drown. My eyes are black But everyone said they are blue, I still believe in his black ??
