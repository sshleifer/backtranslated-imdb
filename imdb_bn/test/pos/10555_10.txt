I think a great and a very funny movie. The story is so funny. The girl Nicole brings her father Andrey into some tragic situation, in the attempt to influence her dream boy, the girl considers her father to be her boyfriend. You just have to see !! Higel is beautiful like Nicol, probably very nice; I'm not sure why he will lie to hook anyone? Gerard Depardieu works very great in this comedy film, he's so fun to see. If you like comedy and romantic movies you will see it !!! I think you can see this picture many times, and you still get a good smile. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
