I have not posted anything here before, but after seeing the name of Noura I thought it was about writing my thoughts about me. <br /> <br /> First, do not compare Blair Witch, this film is much better than that! Simply tell, one of the greatest horror movies I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot!) <br /> <br /> I really love how this film does not present itself as a horrible Horn Flickr. , But as a documentary depicted by a journalist named Kobayashi and his cameraman (I think?) Without spoiling a lot about the plot, I can say that it is researching a series of apparently unrelated incidents with Kobayashi, which could be related to something more dark and dirty. <br /> <br /> The story may not have been real in itself, was it really an incredibly shameless environment that was associated with Nero? You might not be in this movie looking for cheap scares and seat-jumping scenes. This film is about the mood of depressing images and the general sense of predictive mystery. Filming of documentary style just makes it more credible for the farm. <br /> <br /> It has been a lot of help by acting which is fantastic, although the general part of the movie is not perfect! This series is much better than other movies. <br /> <br /> I am quite boring from me, I highly recommend Nero to everyone, it is unclear, unclear, good acting and my first horror movie that scared me. In the ages.
