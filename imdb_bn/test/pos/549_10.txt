I was able to see "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free sneak preview. I absolutely love the film! Due to the realistic storyline of the mother / daughter, I grabbed it ... there was a connection between Edel and Anne. I think Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman both have outstanding performance. Srilan was the right actress to portray Adele and after leaving the theater, I could not think of another actress in the role. Portman was as nice as Ann. She did not think of any other teenage actress that the role of maturity and intelligence brought a sense. I think it will be credited to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and for both the "Actresses" and "Supporting Actresses" sections, both the sardon and the portman have to be nominated for the prize. It will be ashamed if they are ignored.
