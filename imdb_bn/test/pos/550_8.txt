My one-line summary indicates that this is not a good movie, but it is not true. I enjoyed the movie, but it was probably too much hope. <br /> <br /> Adele, who strongly portrayed Susan Sarandan, did not come as a favorite character. He was incredible and unlucky for what was an unqualified degree for his extraordinary love for his daughter. One thing that he knows to do without fail. Adele's daughter, Anna, a sad girl who is so busy for her mother's loss that she does not seem to be 14-17 years old. This, of course, Natalie Portman likes to play Anna because she does not seem to be 14-17 years old. Portman pulled this role so easily that you almost forgot that he was not making a movie for 20 years. Yet, with two strong points, Owen Wang never grabbed even with the Joe Lucky and even with the audience. Although I did not read the book, the film thinks that the story has changed, bringing it to the big screen, a change that can eliminate the emotional intensity of the story. I enjoyed the movie for two wonderful actresses to do fun of their work, but I have never lost experience and I am never related to their affliction.
