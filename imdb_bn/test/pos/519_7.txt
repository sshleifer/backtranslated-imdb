"Witchery" is a modest little Euro-trash horror twist! David Hesselhoff is very funny and sadly, he is a good actor. Linda Blair is suddenly terrible and a woman who plays Huff's wife ... she laughs bad! The plot of this photo is very ridiculous. It has some holes, which you can not help but can notify, but it is an entertaining lifestyle throughout life. <br /> <br /> "Witchery" has a great extraordinary experience. I like the part where the old bag taps the "tire" trash and ends in the chimney roast! And the part where the woman "benefited from the devil" was quite annoying. I would say this is definitely a Gaurhound. <br /> <br /> If you produced an extra, looking for a good acting flick, see elsewhere. But if you want the old-school style on the Italian sledge and the upper Gore, "Wichchurch" is on your shelf. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see the low rating here! What do you expect, "Excellent?" 10 out of 7, kids
