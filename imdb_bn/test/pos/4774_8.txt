There is no doubt about it. It's an animated short, which puts Uncle Walt on the success map. When Walt's elder brother Ray proposed that the next Mickey Mouse short should include the word, Walt jumped with the scope. As a result: Steamboat Willie was a runway hit for 1928. After this, the first animated short subject (mostly music and sound effects, the dialog was short) with the synchronized soundtrack. Do not sound like a wet blanket, but a little too far from perfect. Before 1935, Animation was a crockery and rather was a hobby junkie (but once the tools improved and more artistic techniques came, the rest were smooth sailing), and the sound was primitive (Disney then wanted to use the well-known RCA sound system, or Western Electric Nosed Sound System , But was rejected by both organizations, making Disney a photogaphon system Yabahara was proposed, which is used in the PA capabilities). Plot (here's a real plot line?) Mike (as mentioned earlier as Wiley) is a steamboat pilot, that is afraid by the black peat (you Captain Peat), and decided to use a jam session on the ship, worries as musical instruments on the board (ASPCA, taking notice). If you do not think too much about technical flaws, Steamboat Willie can have fun (and a part of history).
