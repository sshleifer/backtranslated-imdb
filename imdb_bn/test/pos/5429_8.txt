If you are going to watch this movie then do not expect this film at all, the expectation of this movie will be absolutely cheerful because you will be disappointed. Yes sure it is fun from time to time but I would consider a political thriller masqueraded as a trick. Performance is particularly good as Jeff Sonar Bloom is the head of the selection company. He makes a lasting impression even though he is limited screen. Of course Robin Williams is a wonderful one. Laura Linne is a very wonderful one. She is one of Hollywood's best actress and looks at this special one scene. This film makes you think. What if a comedian ran for the president? Will the country be better or the country will be broken into one million pieces?
