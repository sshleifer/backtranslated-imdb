I'm not able to block this image completely from memory, although I've seen it for two years. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong - I have forgotten the long story - the relationship between Kidman and Law, which did not affect me, but it actually hit me that the torture scene of this movie. I cried for about two hours straight after the ward. <br /> <br /> It has never happened to me before that during the war, people can benefit purely like mother's love. We can see here a few examples of this - both in the name of Natalie Portman and mother hid her son with the soil with her finger. I am amazed at this scene and probably will never see the film again because the scenes are now completely clear in my mind. However, I am glad that I only saw this movie because it made me more aware of the horrors of war and the terrible cruelty that mankind could suppress itself. <br /> <br /> Since I've seen this movie, the character of Blonde Albin is at the top of my worst bad list. He has suffered a nervous injury with the horrific heroism and the lack of human sentiment for the victims of that torture. At one moment I wanted to go to the movie and kill myself (see that the film pushed me on the edge of the edge, it only happened that I was only hit on a big screen - which showed the power of film and at least intensity). <br /> <br /> I do not recommend the film for the uninterrupted love story, but for the war image without the need for a battlefield.
