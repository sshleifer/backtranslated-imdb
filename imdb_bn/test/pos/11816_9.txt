Although this film is 11 years old, I hired it yesterday and I found it as a really sensitive movie. The story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite a touch. <br /> <br /> Although I do not care much for the language used by some young actors - especially from Reno - I realize that the industry is imitating life. Renfro has worked very hard and hard (and I'm very meaningful) blaming VanNa (the client's role comes to mind), and Majelo is a wonderful, somewhat playful, Dexter's excellent job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the abandoned church, and cut himself Dexter (Mazzello), his blood was poisoned. Although very enthusiastic, and a little ridiculous to see an old man fleeing from a few small children, it is one of the most difficult scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Check this out for sure, but ready with your cleannex - you will need it!
