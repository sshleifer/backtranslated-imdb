Believe me when I say this program is simply normal. The main story is about Kintro Wai, who travels from town to town to learning, getting a job, and learning about life. Kintaro will never be the easiest one related to the characters ever made. She takes extreme things, and it's just a loud fun laughter during high time. From the search for his constant end to study life, he leaned toward matters of life or death, along with small things. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting of this show is the top expression and feedback of the cable only. He spends a great amount of different super-distorted modes like Dragon Half or Trigger. His face will not be severe at other times in less than 0.1 seconds, but the mara-militant-style life or death expression is trying to bench a new record such as a weight lifter. It's ridiculous <br /> <br /> <br /> If it's not enough, the fantastic writing and English voice acting may not be as good. But English VAT is perfect and when you are not really saying you will be walking around. It is mentioned without any doubt in the Ichchi series. It virtually defines the word. If you're an adult anime fan who can laugh at movies like American Pie, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> - Rireath_com
