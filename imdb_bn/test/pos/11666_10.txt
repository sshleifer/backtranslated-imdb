In a world, controversial and erroneous issues can be listed continuously, this strong 1995 movie is on top of the list; Moreover, with material and reality and with sensitivity and sensitivity, it creates a really great film by any measuring stick. And to add some satire to it, even the subject of this movie is also widely misunderstood, because it is mistakenly understood that it is a movie about the death penalty's professionalism and danger; This is not The heart of 'Dead Man Walking' directed by Tim Robbins is something that is actually the most misunderstood and good reason, because it can be really difficult for a person - and really - to understand. And what it actually does about this image: Forgiveness. Genuine forgiveness; Do not neglect a serious offense or criminal - not to say exactly what happened - but to do so, to find out the power to do it, and to do it by choosing life. <br /> <br /> Director / Screenwriter Tim Robbins has a fame and distributes the faithful adaptation of the novel by Helen Prison, in which he discusses his involvement with the prisoners of death, in which he has served his faith for many years . As a chronologically filmed, it was not just justice for her, but to achieve human dignity, it started with a simple letter from the prison sentence in the Louisiana State Prison in Angola. After executing the death sentence for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Shan Pen) was reaching out to one who heard his letter to Prince (Susan Sarandon), who soon saw himself entering a region where he had no knowledge or experience. And Robins has successfully convinced and unmistakable journey, when it guides it out of a tragic thought, which is not only real, credible and trustworthy, but it gives a clever and perfectly emotionally engaging experience for the audience. In the middle of the movie, once there was a personal, significant psychological experience for a priyajan, he became one for everyone to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Prison for her soul-stirring, sister-in-cheating photo, Susan Sarandan won an Oscar for Best Actress. With its sensitive and deeply emotional depth, its performance is incredibly touching and practical, especially in those ways, she has expressed the underlying natural flexibility and weakness of Priyan, which she strongly hates with the power required to continue her efforts to pencil (and, in fact, she Total). Regardless of your outlook on subjects examined in this film, Priyanjan is questioned without questioning the heroic proportion of a person, which Surdan has very beautiful personality here; And it does this without using any lazy melliadrietics, but rather the person's humanity in the very credible expression of fascination, and it is undoubtedly the reality. This is a great performance, arguably the best of the Sarandan's wonderful career. In addition to the best performance of the career, San Pen, who is nominated for Best Screenplay for Ponzlet Screenplay (he lost to Nicholas Cage, who won 'for his performance on vacation, Las Vegas). Perfect for each part of the way, the pen, before or after the pony has been better ever. She presented the Poncelet as a real person rather as an overblown caricature of a demon capable of effectively suppressing the crimes described here. It does not make it even less hateful; Just the opposite, actually. It can be a real problem with real face-to-face, anyone who looks like a person who can be with you may be able to do things. And that's the power of Penn's performance - it is so difficult to present with real, profound and inferior; You have to see his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul but to do. A horrific performance, and - as well as the 'Vegas' was - Oscar for Penn should've got. <br /> <br /> Another stand-out performance, Raymond J. Barry Memorable. Supporting the role of Earl Delacricks, one of the victims of ponotalate. At the time of the limited screen, his character develops in such a way that you enable him and his sister Prison to express sympathy with him, because through him we are given some insight into his complexity and apparently neutral position. , At least on the surface. Barry Delacrox is presented in a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective of the story, which is ultimately effective and underscores the film's message. <br /> <br /> Supporting Cast and Le Emari (Clyde Percy), Selia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Furni), Roberto Maxwell (Lucile Poncelet), Margo Martindale ( Daughter Colin) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will alter the minds of others on the death penalty, but it was never intended; What was the purpose, to create a thoughtful, emotional, emotional film that Robinson did with 'Dead Man Walking'. Regardless of your personal point of view, this picture will have an impact, and hopefully open some minds in the real nature of forgiveness. As we look through the character of Earl Delacrox, true forgiveness does not decide on anything, but a work that can be a life-time work. And perhaps one of the most difficult things in life to do it effectively. And you have given this film to sister Priyajan for her life, helping her uninterruptedly, and the filmmakers, like Robinson and Sarandan, gratefully come out of this film for the sake of living for millions, who otherwise did not know about her. I rate this 10/10 10/10 <br /> <br />
