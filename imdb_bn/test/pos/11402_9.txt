Boogie Night is probably the seratom example, which is the film maker has to take a long hard look. Of course, you could have spent quality time reviewing classics from Hitcoo to Skarsi; But they follow suit for modern generations and study half-heartedly. <br /> <br /> Where it starts, I think that anyone can probably see this movie as a story, perhaps even the documentary which focuses on pornography in the late 1970's. And it had no art! Using another half-polyester and * ahem * rubber can simply focus on the incredible details that a brillant filmmaker can acquire. But the truth is, boogie knights futures, no-bal! Shi has brought $ back, since I've never encountered the experience since the movie of the 1970s in front of you ... satire ... or jeans stroke The story is full of detailed letters, which you both can relate, love, or hate; But the impact is clear - you feel something for them. Among the characters, there are two performances: Mark Wahlberg as Bart Hornell's as Jack Horner and Eddie Adams / Dirk Degaller. Julian Moore is excited like Hiller Graham, but if I pay attention to an actor, then she is John C. Rally to be. John's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotions ... I see a sucker for the line "Sometimes watch the movie Star Wars? ... people say I look like Han Solo." However, the film's appearance is incredible, the director of photography and director / writer / producer brings a vibrant color and sticky style that compares to Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (according to his authentic perfection); But by creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the most long single shot I've ever seen ... that being the new year's party sequence. <br /> <br /> Music, like any great movie, is a character of its own. Occasionally, it devours itself with sadness or sadness ... but basically it is all fun, dancing and a good time; The spirit of the 1970s All right, go back to performances. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The terrible transformation from shooting on magnetic tape recording film. His industry rate, as it was ... and he has worked with people to change the mindset. Walhberg adds the essential blend of innocence and sexual brutality for the character's needs. For those who have viewed the Burton Planet of Apps, do not pay attention to Wahlberg's performance in that movie ... Let's hire the old woman and see what a good script can make the difference! <br /> <br /> Julian Moore's mother will have to be a mother, and she experiences pain and pain like that, imitating life art. And she's all who lose her off. Heather Graham is eye-candy, but later holds her own and even great Mr. Reynolds also steals his own scenes. Each character is multi-dimensional, rich with life and is presented by actors, which seems to be perfect for the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> It makes no excuse, and does not lie anymore; And offers viewers a trip around. But more importantly, the film gives a wonderful example of how the film should be made; And a new director whose bold aspect brought the film back to the industry.
