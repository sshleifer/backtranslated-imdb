By nominating Ali Jike as the Prime Minister for the entirely inappropriate seat of the local elections, Bhadra Chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dons) hoped to disgrace the current leader of his party, so he was able to grab power. For his surprise, the plan brought him back, embraced Ali, and Carlton was forced to find another way to try and guarantee his political future. <br /> <br /> Pure power, frankly, rogue and always insulting: What is more about these events in the big screen for Birgeshaw Gargasta, middle class class of Ali G Innhaus, Sascha Baron Cohen? This means that this is my kind of movie !! <br /> <br /> Clearly, there are people who are not just going to get jokes, and of course there will be people who will find extremist aggressive jokes in oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography, and the lower part of the Queen (they will not say They should be good!), But if you think such a bit of comedy is a bit of a side-splitity, but generally become a fan of Baron Cohen, Or just want to see Roba Mitra in hottie under her underwear (and you shud, she fits well!), Then I recommend spending half an hour between Ali G and West S. Company <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
