The 1978 adaptation had all the elements of a potentially wonderful film. It is based on absolutely charming books by Charles Kingsley. It's really a gifted cast from the likes of James Mason, Bernard Crisons and David Tumblinson, not to mention the voice genius of David Jason and John Parthway. Railway Childrens and The Amazing Mr. Lonel Jefferies is also a wonderful classical director like Blunden and the film is mostly frustrating, but it is frustrating. I did not have any problems like Mason and Tumblinson's Grimes and Sir John Harriet, and Tommy Penn and Samtha Gates are trusted like Tom and Eli. Voice Cast is also commendable, especially John Pertwee, voicing charming characters in their own right. I like the formal music, it is very hunting and beautiful, and the script was fairly faithful and was specially written in the beginning. Characters, especially the water kids are very impressive, and at the same time villains are terrible and funny, when I helped Tom and his friends escape to the water in the water, I saw that the shark behind the electric eel with an ax was very ridiculous. However, I would say that the film saw, especially the animation sequence, the live action parts were not so bad, if you rather do the dark camera - sorry for the work. The animation of the character was rather flat and sometimes the backgrounds were a little bit, though there were some nice moments, such as the first meeting with the baby Cracken and apparently water. I was also a mixed feeling about the song, Waterbaby's song was beautiful, but I forgot the first song, when Tom was finished. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song, it's like marmite, you love it or hate it. I personally do not know how to make this song, it was fun to listen first, but it was once in your head, perhaps annoying. As much as I like Lionel Jeffrey and his movies, it is usually strange strange miracles and magical magic Above all, certainly not a terrible movie, but artists can be good. 7/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar.
