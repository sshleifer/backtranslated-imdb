John Houston finished his extraordinary career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies I've ever seen. In order to know goodbye, he decided to convert James Joyce's beautiful little story "The Dead" and has not yet become one of the most trusted literary-to-film adaptations, he has also created a film that is still much more than 20 years later <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie a few years ago, as a student at the university, I was afraid of the screen First, I was surprised to see the film in each direction: acting, screen writing, direction, clothing, Settings, Music, Cinematography. Now thinking about it, I still can not do anything that I do not want to criticize. Houston knew only to tell good stories. <br /> <br /> Tony Haston will have a very good credit. He is better not only in perfection but also better than the intermediary of a text that is visible enough for the film. Dad and son breathe the story and gives pleasure in the long, engaging dialogue and meaningful silence in the character. <br /> <br /> Donald McConnell is eligible for credit for his performance like Gabriel Conroe. I have never seen him before in movies, nor did I see him later, but he has ever seen that one of the most running performances is given. <br /> <br /> From everyone, The Dead stopped being a good cinematographic experience, a legendary director who is excellent.
