The latest movie about Chansook Park, the great thing about thirsty, is a bit confusing. You could accept something as a minuscule, but in reality it is a big plus. Park takes pride in the importance of vampirezism and takes the story of Sung-Hyeon and Tai-Zu's intense love. We see the contradictions in both the characters- Sung-Haiyan is a priest who is a doctor who is unknown to him, makes him a sick but true-blue vampire and meets his mother and grandfather with his mother and "stupid" brother. Later, Sang- was killed as a very strong melodrama. There is no cry or inspiration in any place with stories and letters, and the effects that start with religion (gentleman, for example, that he sees as enthusiastic due to his blood clots from the rise of death) can not be just that and he does not know it) Cinematically move to any other flat level. <br /> <br /> I have a Cyborg but it should be taken as a given, okay, that thirsty has come up with the wonderful paradigm of the article which is in the park, with the support of the Old World, Lady Vengeance and Intrinsic. Thirst is a film about a juvenile descriptive and bizarre subterranean character, and it is composed and edited by an eye for a fission, part of which is romantic / erotic, part dramatic and the latest fantasy. And it does not always treat Vampires as something of a horror movie set-up (though she had more share in the horror scene of the horror film park). It is far more than the Dark Dark Movie, which never mentioned the word Vampire, but it lets you know and treat it with sincerity and a kind of carefully guarded track, and it is likely that the effect of the disease itself and its person's existence is probably the murder of the squar or blood. Once you see that a vampire has really raised or heals his wound, you saw M. <br /> <br /> Thirsty humor has a malicious feeling, just like the Old World, for the sake of a bite here) meant to emphasize the malicious physical condition. An example of this is the prediction of blood absorption by taking blood tubes and destroying the blood of the people of the waist. Or keeping his mother alive, T-Zu is going to a scrap of humanity, its method, even some like stroke and can embrace its eyes, and Black-suckers can tap a finger as a reaction to the pain and horror in his home. But these moments are frozen as a whole experience on cake. How the thirsty mind ceases is how the elements, the drama and the problems of existence together combine in the romantic-spiritual sense of Catholicism (I especially make her arm move to make Sinh-Hyeon and other priests bloody, but really wants to be a vampire). , And boyfriend: Their speed and length shots on the screen where they are finally sold Bong It's incredible how real it is. Not in a pornographic way, but the release and escape of these characters which are not prolonged on the scope of the story. <br /> <br /> If it's not like the old age, then it carp about nothing. Director of all the Chanwick Park films will not reach his superiority (and at least, he will always be known as the filmmaker). But Thist is an excellent addition to his wow and generally a serious series of Vampire films. The filmmaking process is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and 'the day of' a white room that lives in characters!), Humorous dark and humorous, intensely intense and moody - especially from the fine stroke of song Kang. Wonderful bad and wonderful weaknesses from Ham and Kim Ok-Vin, and when it finally ends, they are really the end of the fantastic vampire-movie that you will speak for several years. In the fight between Thrust and Twillight, thirsty takes the knock out of the first round. Dark right or near right, it's hard to call 9.5 / 10
