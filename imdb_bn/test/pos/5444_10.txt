When fully accepted for the current 2-party system and the conception and separation of political process, I think it is a great movie. I was not a supposed comedy in the supposed movie, but once I was able to think of this film really. Whatever we can see and hear in any election, it is so jocular. Especially in this film's debate, which I think is a great criticism of our political debate and how the policies are "discussed" in them. I encourage anyone that thinks our process is fine to go see this picture. However, if you want to laugh, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their normal soul. In this movie they show us that the truth is frustrating, the truth is not funny.
