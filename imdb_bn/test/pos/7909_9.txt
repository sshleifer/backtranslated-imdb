The 1955 producer Showcase version of musician Peter Pan with Mary Martin received most of the original Broadway cast, including Kathleen Nolan Wondi, who was a more natural actress than the hired girl for the 1960s televised play. It is shameful that most people will not be sitting in black or white because this previous product is in many cases - when you put "Peter Pan" in the search engine, IMDB does not even appear in the list! - Most people saw cutesier color version to higher. I found the origin of the disc and then it worked digitally to make it more beautiful. Now when I keep the 1960 version of the color, it looks garish compared to that. I think Mary Martin herself liked this original 1955 version of the Producer Showcase Television. <br /> <br /> The disk as an extra plus looks like opening ads and promotions to me. How far into the 1950's it seems - this kind of innocent time than today. I miss it
