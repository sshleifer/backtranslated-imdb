Some people were born with the soul of grief, they tortured another soul until they were singing singly singly and / or as beautiful as their own sweetly beautiful and caused an unusual magic. You are the only two of the cruel, honest views in the painful soul that are separated by the differences of unity in pain, by gathering for a moment of understanding and unity. Death is figuratively and literally explored. It happens when the soul dies or is living in the same way, very awake from reality. It is a life that you do not imagine behind the eyes of Pasar-Bai. This film explores pain pain among all of us, under the lower pains of the lower pains. The ugly instinctive fleshly thoughts and actions become honest and become a real matter, and then Bechard blends unexpected innocence and fungus of beauty and tells both of them the lasting of us. We often protect our eyes by watching bikard, authors, an expert in human condition, and illuminating life in light of their illogical attitudes but seeing and understanding. As a director he focuses on the souls of actors who play with their personal identity with emotional character in each of the actors. It is illustrated with a properly written and illustrated character and man's experience together, although I have still encountered this, although face-to-face characters may not be "normal" face-to-face. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack encapsulated characters are capable and strong enough in each song if they have to spread their hearts. It is the original voice of singing through the beauty, pain, talent and mental intelligence of budding Indi artists to burst each character into the real music market. Our soundtrack is perfect for our problems - those of us who acknowledge that we have problems and who are hidden among us. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy the pleasure of exploring the dark aspects of life both of Mr Bechard's fascinating life, the creative and realistic view of life, and the characters in which he is roaming.
