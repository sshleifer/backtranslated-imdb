Queen of the Damned In, Akash (Aleya) was more sexy and had a bigger presence, she just grabbed your eyes and attention. The movie was now faulty as the lack of explanation of the sky. I did not like what I liked, this film does not really explain or did not show anything like Least or Aksha or did not show much. The role of Akshah (Aliya) was not limited to the film, and she was shown to the second half of the film and then she was on top of it, her (Aksha) death quickly came 2. But when I tried the elders when they tried to kill him, how did Aksa fight, because in the book Aksha and the elders were rather annoying (they killed the sky for 2 seconds). The head of Akka was closed in 1 second and the lass was the world's largest Turned into a punk. <br /> <br /> Alesha did very well and Stewart was perfect, like Lestat, they could not choose the best sky or the lestat.
