An armored car company gets the new guy talking in to becoming involved in a armored car heist for some quick cash scores by his fellow driver. The problem is that they do not really have a lot of plans and when things arise in complexity turn fierce. <br /> <br /> There is a big deal with the fast moving Popcorn Action Film. The film is under the first 90 minutes, so the film does not really have time to throw in the plot. It cranks up everything and just goes. Later, the film has some great action sequences that move forward towards one seat. Finally, there is a stellar cast in this movie, which includes Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishbarn. <br /> <br /> This is not a brain surgery, it's a popcorn film and it scores too high at that level. Price of a look
