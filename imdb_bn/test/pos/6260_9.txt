'Shadow Magic' restores the joy and wonder of the first movie audience. It shows the film's ability to bring the world forward, overcome cultural barriers and protect itself for the next generation. Of course, anyone who really loves motion picture industry will enjoy this movie. It's a great first attempt by writer / director Anne Hoo, hoping to follow many movies.
