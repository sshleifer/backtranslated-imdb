A wonderful horror movie before dawn. It is filled with atmospheric, wild scenes of amazing shots, some of which young people meet with their misery, two eccentric, lean beef, who kill them. Jeff Lieberman is unfortunately undrated, which is very talented and intelligent director. He made the tension, not with the Gore, but the psychological nature achieved with showing the environment. Laberman has succeeded in creating an excitement in a very linear, straight path, which is the best way to show to the audience, but imagine the bad thing happening with the characters. <br /> <br /> Don has always had the eyes of the delivery and the mountains before compared to the Texas Chess genocide. Better than the hills, it looks as good as the delivery, I think it's awesome and well-made, and it's unclear like the Texas Censo massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD has been one of the best fears over the last few decades. Finally live on DVD!
