Better than the second episode of World War II, between K-Do-E, a former gangster from the Warner Bacteria who suffered from hunger and was reborn as a psychiatrist known as Robert Ordwell, who wants to go straight to the police and criminals. The crime doctor's courage is the fourth in a series of ten and it involves a person who may have some mental problems. The link to "Courage" is not particularly clear. <br /> <br /> This entry was headed towards fate hunter Gordon Karson's death, whose two previous wives were in a mysterious situation and those who died under the condition of the locked room later, but as suicide. Ordve label killing. Hilary Brook acted in the part of the widow Kathleen Carson, a mysterious Spanish dancer associated with Anthony Carso, whose acting disappeared on the stage. As a writer of mystery novels, Jerome Kowan is a well-known actor, such as Lloyd Krrigan fans. <br /> <br /> Shivering doors, house cassettes and suspects who are never seen in the light of day. Mystery to the wind. Set for dance sequences is quite a lot and ballet music is very good. Directions, production design, and photography stand out. External shots and dresses usually offer more prosperity than the "B" detective thriller. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended.
