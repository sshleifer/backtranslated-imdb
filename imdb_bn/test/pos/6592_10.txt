It's an outstanding criminal thriller, and a great cast too. For the past decade, the best and most popular actor of Spanish language film, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, came in one of the Spanish-language crime thrillers of 2004-5. Starting with the attention of the film, some thirty-five Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and sticky thief who learned from childhood friend Gitano, and recently learned from an old drunk named Manco. The Manco Ernesto Federico (Federico Luppi), an elegant, but more intense and experienced systematic thief - the best of his class. <br /> <br /> <br /> The only weakness of Federico is Pillar (Victoria Abril), his former mistress and partner. He suddenly appeared and proposed his former boyfriend a fabulous rip off offer for a crime on the Grand Scale, which eventually needed the help of Ernesto, Manco and Gitano. <br /> <br /> The script is full twists and wonderful reversals, especially at the end of the film. I have heard a criticism about the film that ultimately there are many plots twists, but I disagree. This film attracts the audience so much that the unexpected events are not too much to follow. Actually, these are what makes the outstanding movie. I highly recommend it.
