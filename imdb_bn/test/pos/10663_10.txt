Originally portrayed as a part of a huge epic, the revolution of the 1905 Revolution, the story of the revolution of the Pentecaine in the Pompekin Odesa Port. The film ordered Maggati meat and the commanders to execute the execution with the crog. A rebellion took place where the revolutionary leader was killed. This Krumen was taken to the branch in the state. When the villagers gather in a huge flight of shelter scene, extortion soldiers arrive and take down the storm-breaking steps. A Navy Squadron is sent to bring Pottin back, but at the moment when the ships arrive, their workers allow the rebels to enter. The non-historically accurate finishing of Eisenstein is open-ended, which indicates that this is the next Bolshevik revolution that will return to Russia. The film is divided into five parts: men and magazines, quarter dramatists, appeals from the dead, the Odessa steps and the squadron. <br /> <br /> Einstein was a revolutionary artist, but the talent level Do not want to create a historical drama, Eisenstein used visual textures to give the film a newsy-look so that the audience seems to be watching an exciting and political revolutionary story. This technique is used by the Battle of Algiers in Puntakovar. <br /> <br /> Like Pontecovare, Eisenstein relied on the type, or non-professional casting exercises relied on physical attendance. The remarkable face of Caste is that of Ptetkin. This technique was later used by Frank Capra in the Dead Gods to Town and John Doe. But in Ptatkinine, a person is cast as a hero or heroine. The scene is called through a series of scenes that meet a special effect known as Montage - the editing and selection of minimal segments to create a desired effect on the audience. D.W. Griffith also used the Montage, but someone like Aniststein did not do it well enough. <br /> <br /> The artistic art of sleeping in their hamks is supplemented by arranging arranged adjustments of suspended tables from the galleys. On the contrary, clashes between the crew and their officials caused pressure on electricity and the people's hateful fights show their anger with injustice. <br /> <br /> Eisenheston repeats the technique of showing an action again and again shows a slightly different angle of intensity. The term "the day for our daily bread" breaks down the plate carrying the plate. This technique was used last year at Marienbad. Also, when the ship's surgeon leaned towards the side, then his pins-nose leaned from the shockingness. These glasses used to inspect and inform passive meat to the officer that was there. This series relates to the punishment of the wretched corruption of the era. <br /> <br /> The most notable sequence of movies and probably in the history of film, the Odessa steps are. A wide range of steps are filling the excess hundreds. Fast and dramatic violence is always recommended and not clear, but the visual images of some of the deaths will be permanent in the mind of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The angular shots of step-by-step boots and legs are gradually accentuated with long menacing shades from the sun upwards. There is a deliberate difference between marketing soldiers and a few civilians at a steady pace, who dare to urge them to stop. After being beaten by a soldier's sword, the woman's face was closed due to fearful fears, the direct ancestor of Bank Taylor and the charger governor gave a permanent idea of ​​the horrors of Clyde's bonfire. <br /> <br /> <br /> Because of the death of a young mother, overseas journalist Hitchcock by Brazilian Terry Gillium, and copied by Brian Depalma of Unchoebible, is focused on a child's step in action. This sequence is shown repeatedly from different angles, which probably draws five other events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . Unchanged. It roams with intelligent injustice of seethes of fire and decadent czarist rule. Its greatest impact has been on borrowers' filmmakers and a few generations ago, the techniques developed in Russia were slightly improved.
