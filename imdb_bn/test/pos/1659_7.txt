This intense film of 1955 followed Tony Le Stefanoise, who was recently released from prison for theft, because he operated robbery of his life. He teamed up with his oldest hijst friends and they brought Caesar from the expert safer-cracker Milan (who played Jeuss Dashin, who is directed, he only gave instructions that he was blacklisted as a communist in the United States and could not work in Hollywood.) Genius 1 hour of light 1/2 hours. During this time, there is no dialogue and there is no music, only the sound of digging or safe drilling with the floor. It increases mystery and attracts you. They go with hundreds of millions of precious jewels, but a jeweler from a Caesars dancer looks at the attention of three brutal brothers. They set out to get the stash for themselves and bring them bad luck. Greatest hist / gangster movie, but I like J.P. Melville films in this style <br /> <br /> This movie was like some lemonade last night. I went to a Caribbean restaurant and instead of sugar, lemon was made with sugar beet juice. There was a lot of snow and heavy on the lemons, which kept it rough (which I liked). Sugar cane juice provides fine, slightly more flavored taste than the actual sugar, and the snow ensures that it is cold, and I have destroyed it like a torrent. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
