Lon Ronger and Tonto were raised in front of any cause for the assassination of three Indians to face trial of a band of victims of the attack. The man possessed a medallion until Lone Ranger discovered from the conversation with the Indian chief Tomme. Tommy will give Mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map of gold in a legendary lost city that will be combined when we learn after five medals given as gifts to his friends. If the London Raiders do not hand over the hooded attack, will the other two be dismissed? Actually there is no lost gold in the ground? <br /> <br /> Seeing this, I knew what was going to happen before and everything was astonished until I realized that I was a little little baby. And in my mind it seems that I enjoy having fun with this baby with a bunch of kids. Although, as an adult, this plot is somewhat predictable, but you know it, though it is very fun to watch even though not in the same league as the 1956 movie. Clonton Moore is perfect as Lone Ranger and J Silvervilles. Tonto has stole many of these movies because he is probably more in action than Lone Ranger. Here Douglas Kennedy, head of the Hudud Riders gang, Charles Watson, is a great sailor with a great Sheriff and a Douglas Kennedy as Ralph Moody.
