* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I made the movie fun. It was weird and I enjoyed it, I laughed a lot, so the bottom line is that I recommend the movie. However, I have a problem with what the lab wanted to say. The plot is very simple. Betty (Rene Zeljager), a tough lifestyle wife killed her husband and if she forgot what she saw, she followed her "real love" for the character of a soap series. David Revelle (Greg Kinnner) Easy enough but 95 minutes is not enough to hold film. And here comes the big question. What is this picture? The references to "Oz Wizard of Oz" are clear. Both Bitti and Dorothy came from Kansas, but Dorothy came to the end of this film that the decision "There is no place like home", Betty did not come to any conclusion, and at the end of the film, we were surprised that what she learned from her experience and the answer is nothing. It does not seem to affect everyone. <br /> <br /> different reality and imagination? Maybe, but dealing with this topic is not short and does not serve much more than a joke, it's a serious plot line that can take the movie in another place. (And it has been treated fairly well by "truman show"). <br /> <br /> The picture could be an emotional issue. The bett covered with a soap series and covered with Charlie (Morgan Freeman) Betty. The labot shows two points on the chest and it seems that forgiveness is forgotten, dangerous in any form, and should be condemned. He feels sympathy for radio emotion because he saw it as a neutral. <br /> <br /> <br /> They could have been a subject for the whole picture, but without them we have left to think that they will affect the characters. <br /> <br /> The last one is a makeup that has nothing to do with it. This is shameful because if he hears one or two points, then the film could have been intense. Many things but not really say anything. <br /> <br /> What we kept is that we saw a little movie, funny and weird that can be a lot more.
