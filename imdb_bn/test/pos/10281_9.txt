Great, original, beautiful movie Acting great, the settings de decors are fantastic (Paris is its best- but then the real Paris, not famous settings) and the music will also make. A brilliant story, very detailed, which I love so much. <br /> <br /> The best French movie I've seen (and French movies are very good)!
