Most of the views seem to be considered as a baseball movie, but I think it is only secondary. It really lives in Japan, and it is really successful. <br /> <br /> I've lived in Japan for a few years, and I think that this movie did not do very well, so you have Japan experience that you want to do. I see a friend of good traveler who was never in Japan, and he noticed that many of the events in this movie are so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension suspicion. My answer was that these incidents of life throughout Japan were completely false! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is valuable, especially if you live in or are interested in Japan.
