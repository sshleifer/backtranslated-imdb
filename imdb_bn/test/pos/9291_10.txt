When you think of the fantastic Australian comedy you do not see skit shows (though I partially partially with the full frontal of the 80s and 90s) or even Sitcoms - you're thinking about SATIRE! We know how well the Australians really know something. (For example: Front Line, The Michellef Program) We get $$, and how to take Chargers War on Evening, for example how it can be done and how to do it well. <br /> <br /> I've been a huge fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Rocchelle for a long time. I remember listening to them at the show in the afternoon of Triple J. They were, and around, two of the most fun comedians. <br /> <br /> Although they were sad to leave Triple Jay, I was excited to find out the amount they invested that they left them. (They are doing CNNN and Triple Jay at the same time, so I think it was something big) and Chaser's wonderful showy show <br /> <br /> I said, recently it got a much better time slot than Friday night and went on Wednesday night after Speaks and Spaces. Thank you ABC !! Finally I do not have to tap it! :)
