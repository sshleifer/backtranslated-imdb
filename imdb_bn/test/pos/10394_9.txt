I'm not really sure what to do in this movie, especially after seeing a great movie like La Note. Unfortunately I have seen this in Germany during the Antonio film festival in the Frankfurt Film Museum, so I did not hear the sound of Malkovich's wonderful voice. She is supposed to combine four stories about Italy couple. However, as an actor, Malkovic can not find the most ridiculous way in the four stories described here: A woman who comes to her in a pirate cafe near a shop and blows about how she kills her father. Then both of them go home, have sex, and they leave. It seems that Antonnyi was replaced with sexually explicit sex with her malicious nudity (like a passenger) in previous films. But <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is about two things that make it. Observable: Eye and ear candy. Actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and cinematography is remarkable - the views of old Italian cities compare a city with a tall apartment building (memorabilia of the law). <br /> <br /> Ear candy however, makes really what the observer film makes. U2 and Brian Nou collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Secrets", which both set the mood to the movies. The songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1"
