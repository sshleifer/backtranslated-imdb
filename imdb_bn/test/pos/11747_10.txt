I consider this loving, and sensitively written story, to be one of the screen's true masterpieces. When it first arrived in Los Angeles, California, after watching this film on my silver screen with my mother, I can get back to it many years back. Beauty, cool simple elegance and peace of the film to me, has kept it aside from many, many of it Yes, when I see it, my eyes get tears, and hear the annoyance once in my life. Probably still, today my number one is the most favorite picture of all time. I hope, this classic love story will be enjoyed, and will be appreciated by our future generations.
