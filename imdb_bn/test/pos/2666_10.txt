Instead of writing the paragraph, I will give four good reasons why, why the best film experience of all time: 1) It is a visual ODS that can only be called on the Big Screen. Kubrick won his only Oscars Special effects Jurassic Park and the most stunning effect before the age of T2 They allow Kubrick to give accurate (or at most most accurate) illustrations to travel the place from date to date. By filling space scenes, silence joins the mood of the film rather than just the right science (to discuss with HL next). Before the landing of Apollo, the Kubrick moon shot the scene, it is a great but complete step. Many have said that it was a favorite "trip" movie after its original release. I can think of any movie which is its time and even all the time (such as Phantom Menus fans!) 2) Such amazing visuals are there. 2) Kubrick's guidance is great. Like all his movies, Kobrich loves to use his camera as a way to enjoy his character and plots psychology. His camera is not as mobile as Scory's as the other desperate, rather instead of sitting and clock disappearing in the details. The main element of a Kubrick film face-to-face. Like classic movies like M and Touch of Evil, the audience concentrates on the face of the audience to pay attention to the audience. Even to show the cold and firmness of the computerized villain, he used HL's burning red "eye" extreme mortgages. I could go, but briefly Kubrick is hieght her style. 3) HL 9000 is one of the most harmful characters in the history of film. I sincerely agree with Gill Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000. This movie takes place in most places. Using silence and dark in space itself, is a mood of isolation. Dave and his crewmen are isolated between Earth and Jupiter, with escape somewhere. Combine this mood with cold, HL 9000's math functions and your most awesome villain is imaginable. Although I still see this picture several times, a special scene in my chest feels strong. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always keeps people away from this movie. What does this mean and what does it mean to try to give me my opinion about the meaning of 2001, I want to discuss the matter that eventually the film can go to the open open. Kubrick said that he intented to open up to 2001 discussions. He left his meaning in viewers. In respect to viewers' intelligence, Kubrick allows his film not to end at the beginning of a meaningful discussion of the past, present and future of the people. The beauty of 2001 does not necessarily mean the ending need, it can only be a fully plotted explanation and the whole film can be seen as a recreational journey through space. There is no movie, save for a great citizen, open for discussion such as 2001. It can really be a spiritual journey that involves the mind, not just the eyes. Instead of waiting for a long line of Phantom Menace, hire a widescreen version of 2001 and enjoy the greatest movie experience.
