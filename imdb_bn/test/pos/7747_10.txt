I had fun in this movie. I have never seen the old movie before and it was really a great first date movie. It was warmth and heart and soul. Chess was in the film industry today, Chesie is beautiful. I gave it a ten and I can buy or buy movies you can rent however, recommend. Gene Kelly was very visionary and a bit ridiculous and you thought the character had got it all. Woman leadership was perfect thrown because they had two personality sparks and wanted to hold what you want to happen and see. The grandmother in the film was infinitely. The perfect addition to a great old movie. I love the fact that I was black and white and gin kelly with all the kids in the movie is so sweet that you can not like her. See it.
