I have not actually found Favela Rising through the IMDB website. I have special interest in Afro-Brazilian culture and movies. Fivela Rising is one of the gems that give new converts to people. Jeff Jimblist and Matt Morchery are well-documented and portrayed, describing Roger de Janeiro drug trafficking former Anderson Psi, who became one after the death of family members and friends, Malcolm X and Ghani became one after another. Sao Afro-Begaye, Afro-Brazilian Hippop, Copoera (Afro-Brazilian Martial Arts) has formed a grassroots cultural movement with the help of dropping, and other artworks are frustrating and transforming most angry young people into a loving person of a vibrant, effective, caring community. <Br /> <br /> A few years ago, I thought I was going to the screening of the City of God (Sied De Deuce) and went out of the theater. The images were still awesome and you could not take your eyes off the screen. I think how frustrating the government was and how neglected government was due to the neglect of society. How drug trafficking was a way of living, how deserted the desert people were, because death took place every day. Like the City of Gods Anderson C discusses about how favelas people were also desensitized. He talked about corruption and how communities were so destabilized by drugs and gangs that you could not visit family members in any other area, you had to meet in neutral position. In contrast to God's city, Anderson's ethnic group aggravated anger and anger, giving frustration a solution. <br /> <br /> There was a part of the documentary where Anderson was asked to join some young people, in the voice of a preacher. AfroReggae These painful young people were so desperate to live and violence every day. Their role model was a drug dealer and they were willing to be. Anderson then said that drug dealers did not live long. Of course, he was reluctant but after five months he was able to join a young man in Afro rage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is clear to me that Jeff Zimistist and Matt Moucheri are not only stories of big stories but also visual artists . This is a must see documentary! This documentary has some really magic and transformation moments. I do not want to hide them for you. I want you to see it for yourself. Tell your friends, academics, youth councilors and family members about this wonderful movie. This will take care of you and our children around the world. <br /> <br /> I will give eleven stars!
