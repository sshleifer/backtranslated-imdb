Miyazaki's studio animates his wonderful touch in every little action of Ghoobni Panoo characters, inspires life. When you put your small boat down carefully to reach for Sosuke's red fish you will find that you get very good time to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Characters are interesting and you really care for them. They apparently think of another story, Raisa was growing up with a son, Naosika, moving in the Moving Castle of Wills seems like a witch. <br /> <br /> The element, air, rain, and ocean presence with its great, powerful waves, so powerful that I believe it was not published in any other way in this way. This is a simple story, very rarely inspired by "little mermaid" and has reached the heart of the audience, just like Teeto, another Miazaki's real best-written. <br /> <br /> An instant classic with a great soundtrack and an interesting song during the last minute. Do not miss it.
