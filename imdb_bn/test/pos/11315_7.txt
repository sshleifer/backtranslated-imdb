Seeing this picture brought back the memories of 9/11. That morning I think the first thing was watching an airplane TV movie flying in a big building and my immediate thoughts "must be a preview of a new Tom Clancy film". <br /> <br /> It was not a Tom Clancy film. This was certainly not a British version of "all the horror stories". Typically, Tom Clancy is a relatively small cast of film or novel, a linear plot and usually some sort of solution. This image was not there. Of course, what I saw directly on the screen was a little cast, a plot and a vague solution, but, like 9/11, that was the reality that was so big and complex <br /> <br /> System planning planning, and disaster preparation exercise reality, and disaster itself, painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for a disaster like this, and when it happens, it will not be possible to deal with it. <br /> <br /> The arguments between the police (not enough to be prepared) and the politicians (the tube will create a gas mask panic on top), constant loudspeaker announcements (there is no danger to your health, but we will go home before you are corrected No), and (do not eat, drink, or smoke before we smoke), I was at the end of the whole film season. This is not the least requested for a channel surf. <br /> <br /> This image was 90 minutes long. It could be twice, and still not show all possible details. Instead, it did not allow us to imagine the details in each of our own ways. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, and many times I grabbed the train from Waterloo station. I saw great battles, I'm telling myself that it's just imagination. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image will be imagined, and sometime in 20 or 30 years, my nephews watch this film and the first of the 21st century May keep in mind, and we are very scared. I hope that in the same degree, in the middle of the 20th century, in the middle of the 20th century, remembering the retention of Shawl War with insurgent imperialist rule and remembering the "drop and cover" practice in school.
