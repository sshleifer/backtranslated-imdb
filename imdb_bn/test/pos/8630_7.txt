I wanted to see this movie because I was a very big Abbott and Costello fan, and when I saw it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, not funny, funny. I mean I'm laughing a lot of fun and I just enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Although it's not the best of Perfect Stretch Man and Perfect Baboon but you'll love it, you'll love Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> I can not tell from Abbott and Costello's movie that I saw someone who hated me. This is decent, fun, and entertaining. Abbott and Costello have at least made pictures of some beautiful movies in their next few years. <br /> <br /> Everyone, I like this movie, it's not their best, but I like it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
