The most notable feature of this movie is the chemistry between actors, camaraderie in their dialogue and dance choreography. This usually has an overworked plot of increasingly rising star musical instruments, even for 1944, but due to the actors it is still fun to see. Hverth is not even a dancer, but there are many 'inexperienced' charm that fits his character. Silver supplies plenty of self-extinguishing and smile when Kelly plays her usual caring authoritarian role. The movie can be very serious at the time. Of course not to see, but if you like the actor, it will be recommended.
