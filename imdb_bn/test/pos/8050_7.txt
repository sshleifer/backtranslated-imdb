Although I score the 7th film, I can mention that it is historically interesting both (when it was Maar Marsh, Lilian Gish and Leynal Barrimo, when they were younger and less well-known) and presented a lot of exciting steps for her day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Indians decide to eat a giant dog dinner (No, they Ukura feeds, but the dogs are being fed) and two Indians arrived late, there is no fool to the left! So, they steal two dogs of two orphaned two white settlements nearby, and in fact it closes a complete fight !!!! Just do not fool this, but the audience seems to play in the prejudices. I do not know if American Indians actually have eaten dogs, but it sounds like a stereo that is applied in another type of ethnic group. All these dogs are over! The film has some wonderful battle scenes and exciting moments - such as Mrs. Marsh who crawls across the battlefield to save a child! Exciting stuff! But, Strange, too!
