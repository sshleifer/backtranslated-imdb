I can never be illustrated if it is made of the greatest soya opera, or the snake art figure. However, cinematography of John Seale is completely ravishing. The novel can not be reduced to Ondatej, but it has grown into films for once. If there is a guilt, it is not in the original novel, Anthony Minghailara's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with its length does not read books almost certainly, and probably can not read. I do not like to repeat adjectives, but works for ravishing purposes. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story, players excel. But it is the light and shadow Australian sensation that finally win. Like some antipodian Dutch masters, Seal uses an explosion in the light, where Van Rijn used the shadow. One can cry for this great cinematography.
