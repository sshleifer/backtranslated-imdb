Fem was released in the US a year before my birth; I was too young to remember the original version of Fame - and I still heard and read many things about it. As it was made a TV series and its soundtrack was headed by Irene Cara, Geojo Morodara hit, 'Fame'. <br /> <br /> The FAME was reasonably able to showcase her first image and the exhibition was a feature-length film played in the form of film industry in the world. Life, struggle, students and some teachers are seen in the eyes of the audience. <br /> <br /> The performance was fantastic, but in particular I was caught by Jean Anthony Ray who is still annoying yet committed Leroy. Angry, frustrated and first rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed in his studies - not only with practical but practical in theoretical. Irene who was visible in Coco, when she stopped her blouse, some decent director wanted to film her, but Paul McCracken surprised her for trying to cope with life with a helpless but intimate gay. After writing a name in a Performing Arts school in New York, he kicked off the military and declared him gay. Ralph was operated by Barry Miller, but occasionally, his character spread to my nerves. <br /> <br /> The dance-drama was excellent, some good dance numbers were involved, and the 'hot lunch' scene in cafeteria was worth seeing. The song 'Fame' was played, and all the other kids started taking to the streets in New York and started dancing without taking care of the world. It was like a street jam on the other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Behind the scenes of series like Avby Hats Chris and Bale Air's Fresh Prince. Later, in the role of Peter McLaren in front of Peter Weller, 'Robcop', where he acted like a villain and ER ray, humiliating doctor Romana. <br /> <br /> British director Alan Parker is really good at this - he allows actors to dance, act, intervene, and do not influence their style to sing their heart content. <br /> <br /> Through the duration of the film, we have students from different levels of their 4 years - from their audition to the new year, until graduation in High School for the Arts in New York. <br /> <br /> Fame is a movie that targets a particular audience <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, one but that creates creativity and artistic expression as someone who could be f as annelled through every hard work, commitment and emotions with their talents. Therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor or creative person then you may be interested in such a movie - although the facts of the fame are in real life like a college / college, then that is completely a completely different thing. <br /> <br /> The 2009 remake of this movie was recently released and, apparently, got it relatively. <br /> <br /> For the original Fame, almost 30 years though yes it is a diverse date, but it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic, but in the 80s dance films of the 80s culture, classic, football and flash'dans, the fame hits the spot. Is it no coincidence that all these dance films begin with 'F'? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
