At any time, I'm not paying 150% for my dream or my goal, I think about Mark Berchard, the real life of "American Movie". During his first feature film making and shot, Mark's impressive conviction is so economical that it will make you laugh, push his head with depression and rooting for it. <br /> <br /> I saw this honest documentary RU. Movie on the alphabet Supporting "Cast" (Mark's real-life family and friends) are all great. Give this movie an opportunity and you will see a great movie and you will see an excellent portrait of the American dream company.
