I absolutely love this movie! It's my number one favorite. Although there were some flaws (there was no flaw in the movie?), This film was written, guided and produced very well. The characters of this movie are very real and trustworthy. They fit a specific role in the character. I think that the most obvious triangle about "Earth on Earth" and other emotional situations in the movie were also there. This is not one of the movies where you can not think of anything just because it is a situation that everyone has or has been. There are so many different things that are not related to this movie. I was only 18 years old and I could even relate it to it. It was warming the heart and wrenching at the same time. "The world here" will smile to you, to cry and sometimes angry. I suggest it to give a great review of this movie and anyone who loves romance and passion!
