I'm a huge fan of $ 5.50 DVD Bin in my local Walmart. I hope you have one in your local branch. You can find a bunch of campy flicks, a bunch of trash, and sometimes surprises. This movie is one of the wonders. My friend recently bought this one, and thought it would be another Chasei Kung-Fu riot, I was amazed at how good I really was. I watch many movies, and as a result, often I can tell how a movie will be launched; And if there is a plot twist, what will happen. This is not the movie! The order is bright, the plot is awesome, and the fight is incredibly innovative. If you're sitting somewhere at this dirt-cheap price, get it! If you see it at full price, I will still recommend it.
