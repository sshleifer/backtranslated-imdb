I remember a time when clubs, drugs pubs and parties are the only things that exist. It came a few years later, I started to start clubbing. If I had never invented the horror of this movie, then this film was not sensible to me. That night, when I saw it for the first time, with some partners, I was completely blown away. I saw a movie that was not so close in my life. Almost everything I can relate to in some ways. I was never fully related to 1 character, but I could have adjusted one after the other. Where my partner is different and I remember all of us where they are or where we are We all have decided on how to do the trick in HT on weekends. When we saw we were coming down and when the movie "came down" seems to be actually coming down a bit. It was actually quite depressing in our room during "low point". So good about Human Traffic It really damages the whole situation. <br /> <br /> This is a unique movie where it is not run plot, but its letters are not operated, although the letters are important. It always began to be based on the situation. The situation as a group and as a person Each character has lost life, because of their own self. Yet each one of them has similarly lost feedback. Work on any work to pay weekends and earn money to run it all. Their holidays for them. But the reality is you can not really escape. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Was there. The human traffic that we did not understand about our traffic explained us. It does this in a way that does not talk to you. It thinks like us that we were not the only ones like us and that we have learned lessons from others around the world that lessons have been learned. Until I changed my life style from the party's popper to the career, I did not fully understand this movie. These days I remember the HT, each and then (as I have), and the old days. Any other movie can do this. I was Peter Popper, I was Zip Trouvalta, I never got land with my favorite family. I want $ 200 in my back burner and I'm so much wax! Do not worry
