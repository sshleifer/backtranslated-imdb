True love, I really enjoyed and loved this movie. It was fun, funny and inspirational. I just saw the DVD. I did not miss how it was a winner! I was Flex "that Guy". I wanted to marry her. It was my first time to see him straight as a straightforward person and close it. I thought Tangi Millar was the best of all time and I was also a felicity head. An innocent woman, who feeds only her nun. Thank you for the women in the color range of your work and she looks great! Tasha Smith bomb attack! Alma Wright was so priceless as Dana. This cute romantic comedy is "a must see". Oh and new comer Marcus Patrick wonders the wonderful women ... true love. Karen
