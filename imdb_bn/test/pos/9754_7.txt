Han Canadian TV drama for justice, which it has created in DVDs, and is hungry for educators, who give information about our current history information that can be buried in media anyhow. This movie is not Hollywood production, it relies heavily on footage from court files, but it has presented to us the heroic act of Lewis Arber, who has been facing the trial of Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosewich. <br /> <br /> A Canadian judge of NATO as the Chief War Crime Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal of The Hague, Lewis Arbor (veteran Canadian actor, Ondie Crusan). This film began in 1996 when Hague traveled to meet political obstacles that prevent the trial of the war criminals from fighting the Arbah war in 1996. Yugoslavia was fighting in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, which has a complete proof The crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, elimination camp, and other serious misuse. Progress in bringing criminals to justice is influenced by the generals (including one by William Hart), who are afraid of World War I, warnings against them are violated. With the unexpected support of his translator, Psko Odsk (Stipe Erceg), his staff Keller (Hino Farch) and British Captain John Tanner (John Corbett), Arba focuses on the impossible task of strengthening all of the parties, on the three specific cases of justice. Three top suspects are detained by two but their trial meets each of their ends. It only leaves Slobodan Milosevic, and Arab and his colleagues have been successful in trial for war criminals in 1999. <br /> <br /> There are many well-documented stories in this well-documented storytelling plot. That's more points in the history of private points. Some may be too strong to see the footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps, but they need to increase the film's motive. Wendy Crusan carries the power to run the message - the message that the war criminals should not be punished. There are many current history to learn from this film: Writer Ian Adams, Relay Adams and MA Lovera have narrated the information and made it dramatically. Director Charles Dunkeman gave the balance to Dokumrama with progress, never forgot that he also had the plot story. Harmful to the trial! Grady Harp
