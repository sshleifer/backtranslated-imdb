This short movie is a perfect joy from the beginning to the beginning of watching. The story is always entertaining, the tension is never losing up. The whole throw is amazing. Walken and Bracko teamwork works in perfection, it's almost like a reflection of a classic sculpture romance BRACO is very free and really funny as a hate artist who struggles for its independence. For some reason, they make Wakens very weird and I can imagine that weird hairstyle ?? It was a parody of Bert Lancaster's Elmer Gantry. For me it's added pleasure. This is the first film I've seen Miguel Ferrer, probably the least appreciated film actor of his generation. He played a small role as BRACO's Pump very well. Even a sight to see Jamaican thugs. I can highly recommend this movie.
