This brings back many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) Brill it The train, the old house, the fallen runner, the really horrific landslide (when you are 6 years old), the dramas can stop the train, or will it crash? It is a child film without any doubt, but it does not offer any harmful blood / nuts / guns etc. for children. And it's got Bernard Cribbins, who are cool. 8/10
