This picture is great! Being a fan of "The Comic Strip Presentation ..." I knew I would love this movie. And I love it. I finally got round this year to buy a copy this year. However, I was annoyed that it was cutting! So I'll look at the car boot sales for the original version. However, this film is trying to influence Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson) who claims to be his girlfriend (Don French), a drug dealer. Anyway, Dennis one day and the night poke and crazy! So Dennis roams in a lot, but trouble does not know anything and he becomes a liar and even excavates himself in a deep pit! All these satirical events are drug smuggling in Devon. <br /> <br /> This picture is not funny like me but it's still a good movie with some good smiles and a great soundtrack. . This is also the greatest movie of all time in the British movie ("two tribes" of Frankie's Gosses to Hollywood walking in the crowd of Robi Coltrens. <br /> <br /> So if you are "The Comic Strip Presentation" ... ", a cast member, or British Comedy A fan see it ASAP !!!
