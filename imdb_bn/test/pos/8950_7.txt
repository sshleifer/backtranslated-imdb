Again, seeing this kind of movie, I can see more in English humor, not often seen on screen from Monty Python and Man of the House. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The rest of the cast, when almost unknown to me, enabled very good performance. The film gradually slowly and gradually enjoys slowly and gradually slowly and slowly. In the middle, I laugh laughing and tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Finally, a funny English movie, Thousands better than supposedly 'funny' garbage. That comes from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
