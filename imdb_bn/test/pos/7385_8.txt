Rickman is very sexy and good, but less "believable" - Rudas is kind of sexy, but he is not a serial actor - in this case there can be guessing fault - we are just excited because he is "beautiful" - but that's not enough. Almost believing fallen wife - 7 years of marriage and he and Rickman's character must be more permanent with each other, whether their roles are incompatible or not - they should have a sign. I think, even though I think that the wife is a bit stiff in her role - and does not strongly attract "strangers" - so it fails - the unclear character between Rickman's character and "stranger" is even better, even if we Is not it sure I missed Rickman's sexy English accent (fortunately he went out and out in American pattern). Frustrated but with some great acting.
