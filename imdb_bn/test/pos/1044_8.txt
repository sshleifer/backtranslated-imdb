I absolutely write a welcome article every month which includes details about her extraordinary home life as a wife and mother at a beautiful Connecticut house, worshiping this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwick) for a major homemaking magazine. The problem is when the owner of his monthly publication claims to have him and a WW2 hero as a guest during his Christmas holidays. Why is he sad? Because he lives in a small apartment in New York, does not marry, and has no children - and can not cook it all! When Hillary (and romance) tries to save the face and refrains from being expelled from the owner of the magazine (played by Sidney Greenstreet), she tries to apply a trustworthy law. This is a fun comedy; One that I recommend classic movie lovers !!!!
