Susan Sarandan. She made this movie for me. The more I played in this movie, the more I did not appreciate his performance. He actually played Adele although he played. I appreciate actors and actors who leave their personal personality and make a real credible character. <br /> <br /> As Antoine August, Natalie Portman helped develop their ideal character through cinema. Other characters were peripherals so the movie was about them. <br /> <br /> I gave this rating eight, but Susan got ten out of me because of her performance. As far as relationship is concerned, the beach and fulfilling conditions will have more impact on me than this film, but I highly recommend it.
