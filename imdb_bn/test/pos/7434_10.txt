I still can not believe that computer graphics are capable of creating 3D images. At the moment I heard a forum from my friends, I swear to myself that I am going to see it myself. <br /> <br /> I found its part in its fellow shopping center, where they had many infant DVDs and showed it on a few laptops for sale. I was obviously glad but it was not enough yet. Then I went to YouTube.com to watch the movie. I came up with music video dedications. That's the lucky day ... I found it. I have seen this despite all the misconceptions because I knew that I should see or else I would say a harm. <br /> <br /> enough about me about the movie. If Final Fantasy VII was not enough, they made a movie about it! My favorite part was the end of the life of Serifoth. The cloud's OmniSlash could not be good. But I do not completely hide the show for you. You will see it for yourself !!! Get DVD Now!
