Sometime a film captures such intense drama and emotions. This film makes it so uncertain that the drama is so real, it's hard to remember that it's just a movie. So far Madeline Stowe and Allan Rickman's performance in their career This movie is often felt like the theater and it is introduced. The only bad thing in this movie is it is very difficult to get a copy. I still have to see it other than Laserdisk. These really powerful film DVDs deserve a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment. It's really that good.
