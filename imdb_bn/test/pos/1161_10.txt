I like winds and lions too. It was a good movie. I thought that I was a young man and it was created long ago, I do not want to feel good at all, but after seeing it I was amazed at how good I was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, I liked it, all of them. I liked it because it showed how German, French and even Americans were treated in Morocco in the early 1900s and how the Arabs and the people were treated. If I was a high school history teacher, I would definitely show it to my student, from high school student's perspective. I did 10 wells out of 10 of this movie. My grandfather loved it very much, they bought it for themselves. My little 3 year old cousins ​​also saw sitting there. <br /> <br /> System system
