This is a movie that I'm returning for a variety of reasons. It is a strong force as evidence of the general military sufferings in the Eastern Front in World War II. There are a number of powerful scenes in the film which are considered to be the battle of warfare to be considered to be the horrors of warfare. In addition, the experience recorded in film from what I can see is big and 'true' - if you read this book titled 'Stalingrad' then I will know what you mean. The film has succeeded in such a way that it does not allow the character or plot to dominate - it is simply the story of survival, which generally tries to portray the war from the point of view of the (soldier) soldier. I read somewhere else that the original screenplant had to pull down, which does not surprise me - if they really try to look like a war, it would be almost impossible to make sure. Even, there is still some difficulty in seeing moments - it was made before the personal Ryan, but perhaps it was hard to hit the places. The only sound of caution - do not buy the dubbed 'English' version, it's awful and spoil the movie - try to get a copy of the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's even more powerful. You will buy a region 1 DVD of the film in this case, just like I did.
