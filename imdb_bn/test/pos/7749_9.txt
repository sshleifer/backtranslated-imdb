This show is great. "Haruhae Sujumiya" is not only a very good article, but also reflects issues like philosophy, science fiction and little religion. It's some points and "cute" (for a good sound lack) to delight others. Actually it can be effective for the lack of experience of Japanese anime, but it has been seen that its greatest section. <br /> <br /> I basically give credit to writers. From the original Star Trek, I did not see such fantastic scopes in the television show. I hope the authors continue to add strange new characters and give more insight to the great characters that have already been added. I hope.
