This movie has recently not shown subtitles for Australia's special broadcasting service. I thought I could read here that * sometimes a guess is that * Reits of the Rits * is a sigl. Actually, rats are revenge for something done in this movie or in human history. As far as I know there is no preview. <br /> <br /> Now, let's get Hamelin's pie pipe out of the way. When I was watching this film, I probably thought of this story, but that's all. At the end of the movie the word "authentic" was used. A renowned mayor tried to justify his actions by saying "pure empty". "Cafers" is not a word that you have heard today, unless you read local stories to my kids. Looks like * Revenge of the mouse *, I've read two versions of Hamelin's Pied Piper. Now I see to compare. To get rid of a metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor rats, more commitment than city capability. As far as I can follow the analogy about this. The children are not led by a door to a mountain, one lame boy is left behind behind a chaotic horse and a land in the shower, where it is always in the spring and behind always saying. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of that quite a lot about this movie about. Especially romance and resolution. Female characters are a potentially strong role in society but are really quite impotent. Where this film is quite rebellious (compared to American movies) it is anti-superstitionist. Helicopter pilot is dismissed for mayor "good work". The mayor and the local government are angry for the corrupt and big money. Finally, it went to a doctor in Frankfurt to resolve the epidemic of a fatal and infectious disease. Obviously no official infectious disease authorities can coordinate or send back a topic. <br /> <br /> I'm not a terrific fan, so the horror that I see usually matches humor. From the right side of the rat in the blood bank, you will see horror and proper balance of the comedy; The huge number of rats seems to be very impressive and awful fans.
