Returned from the European premiere of The Gammers: Darkness Rising <br /> <br /> I can say that if you are a gamer (CRPG, RPG or LARP) then this movie is for you. And if you're not a gamer? Well, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Actually, Oscar is not worthy of acting, but it adds charm to the whole element of the film. Humor is everywhere, with some very nice touch (especially good for Gary Gygax tribute, you can spot it). Cast their eyes down on the earth too much, they are enjoying a common hobby of ordinary people, that is true. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> One system is not afraid to use a specific vocabulary, they still allow a place to be a part of the movie, but in a very understandable and completely fair manner. It also touches some felt prejudice that some gamers can talk very well about it with other gamers and <br /> <br /> All the movies are all about a good idea balanced character, plot and Entertainment (Bird extraordinarily means good value). Finally it makes the film a lot difficult, so I gave it 2 score. <br /> Score (for non-RP): 7/10 (A few moments can be on top of your head, but the main parts of the movie work so hard and much more.) <br/> < br /> Score (for RP'ers): 10/10 (Everything fits together, with perfect quantity and perfect charm and feeling)
