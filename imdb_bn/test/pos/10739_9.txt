Do not forget to put a picture of Krummer vs Krummer and do not forget This is not one of the most popular movies ever made and it is certainly one of the weakest best film movies, but it is still not important. I thought the movie was well done and you just wanted to see it more. Performance was the best positive for the film, and Dustin Hoffman played his best role, which he did as a solo performer, to take care of his son, as his wife separated from him. Huffman's son Billy, who played another superb performance with Morill Streep, was Billy's depressed mother. Crumar vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest movies and it's not perfect 10, but it's worth the movie and has been able to take care of it. Of course, he has ever worked in Hoffman's best film. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> The hadith of Outlook: 9/10 *** + A-
