I was amazed to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention joyously throughout my life. I'm a horror fan and I see everything around that genre, but the dead line managed to upset me. The speed is set very cleverly and Andrey Bagg is not a good performance as a great man. What is the main plot below? A trip to crazy. How can you end up like that? Martin Sanders asked him, while talking alone in the street, he saw himself. At the end of the film, Haroon Mandel's character asks the same question when he sees the same thing as the other homeless; Not smart, yet, this homeless Martin Sanders, answering the question at the beginning of the movie. Two broken glasses are personality breaks and a clear symbol of the division. The finishing jaw is dropping and you know that you will just be making a sequel.
