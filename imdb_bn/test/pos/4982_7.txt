Violent men are good Westerners that certainly benefit from their excellent cast. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson's big ranchers are trying to find a small fishing boat, among which Glen Ford. Until Robinson's aspiring brother (Brian Keith) was killed by Ford, Ford is ready to sell his fiance (May Win) to make him happy. Then you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick plays her special role as wife of Robinson's plan. Dian Foster comes to praise his daughter for praising Ford. <br /> <br /> Violent men are nothing more than a "B" plot in the film "B", but it is very good.
