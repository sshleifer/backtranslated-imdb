"Snow Quinn", of course, collected (at least) Anderson fairy tales based on fairy tales of the same name - and, it maintains the spirit of ferries compared to other recent productions based on other fairy tales, an easy-to-understand and very good American, Not to be understood by many. Speaking of animals, deliberate sanctions, presence of galen, dragon and monsters, is not questioned in fairy tales; They say an element of ferries as normal, in the scientific world of the universe, and the reason or explanation for them is entirely beside the story point. Modern Hollywood compositions are not tied to rules that are controlled: Directly, often in less work, at wildly linear points, and obvious (at least at least). <br /> <br /> The criticism of this defense against people who can not understand the fairy tales, "Snow Queen" is a delightful movie with extraordinary visual effects, skillful acting and a great feeling. The only flaw in the movie, I do not think it was fantastic, but some parts of the dialogue were very appealing and unexpectedly modern, otherwise a hit on the ruthless nature.
