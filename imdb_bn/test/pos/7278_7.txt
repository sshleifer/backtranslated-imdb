After reading the film's horrendous review, along with quoting comments from Colin, I was not bothered to add this film to my Firth Film Collection, but the Firth fan I'm going to get is that the conspiracy has made me even better! <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie completely to surprise me. It was the mystery, drama and conspiracy and Vesaux Collins scene. The plot kept me guessing till the last credit, and I felt that actress had acted firmly by showing Jennifer RÃºbia's opening scene. Colin was sometimes brilliant and saw his character playing a character from 'The Dark Side', a 'coolness went to my spine' and after watching it I could not wait to see Collins 'recent movie' Trauma'sun. DVD out Well, it was probably not a film that was 'talking' to your face and nobody could 'sleep in the plot', especially as much as much is going on till the end, but I like about it Well, the acting was fine, with overdone gratitude (like many mystery thrillers), it makes this movie even more cooler to see. The only Collins character (Ross Talbert) can not guess, or Jennifer Rubase's character (Jamie Harris) was going later, and the store had a few surprises, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, all the time, a cushion is easy !! <br /> <br /> I'm very happy that I've seen 'Playmaker' and of course I'll review and see again. I think a fan fan will benefit from watching this movie, if they do not like the plot, then see the colin ;-))
