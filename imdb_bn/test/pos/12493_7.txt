Quai des Orfevres takes very long, Clouzot is so enamored at the stage milieu behind her that she is in danger of forgetting the story. However, once it does, it's Clouzot its best. Bertrand Blair (co-star of Bitterrad Blair and co-star of his buffet feud) is planning a worldwide pianist who has married himself below and who is planning to kill Cedi studio mogul with his wife design, only to see that anyone beat him. Not only that, but his carefully planned but tightly executed aliabes are broken into pieces, at least when a thief drives a car in a murder case? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A wonderful creation with half an algorithm simulation. Clearly running the push, his investigation is always at the top of his voice against chaos and noise, whether the glossary of the police station or the rehearsal of the higher rehearsal. The police station itself is a wonderful, realistic creator, telling a story of chaos and a short story that, once Steve Bockchor's American police copies of Revolutionary 80 looks like pieces of ancient museum. <br /> <br /> If Suzie Delare is a helpless girl's fatal, then Support Simone Renault has nicely mistakenly loved her as a lover and made mistakes for Blair's lover. And other interested parties (Just like Juve, Unfortunate with women, understand and really sympathetic). With Armand Theride's huge black and white photography, it's a nice finish finish and a beautiful view with a cab driver, a pretty small thriller that reluctantly stays at a police station, (Trivia Note: Playing philosopher Dr Bhojat in Le Corbou, who played a small role as a cab driver in Pierre Larky, Kui and Les Espion, both of them.) <br /> <br /> standards DVD is pretty cool - a French with great photo quality A stimulant essay featuring the interviews of Culujat, Blair and Rinat from TV shows.
