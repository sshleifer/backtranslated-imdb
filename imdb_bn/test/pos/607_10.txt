This photo was posted in Tokyo on the rise of Gaisha. Ockin, played by the incredible Haruki Suegimara, pays Gisha, Tama (Chikako Hoskova) and Otomi (Yuko Mokijuki) and they bother about something a little cheerful about him. A son of Tammy, Otomi is a daughter who announced the film that they are leaving them, Okin is never a mother, she receives visits from two of her past, from someone else, just want money from her. A compulsory story of what you like, what you achieve through life and who you are responsible for and see. Haruk Sugimara was always one of the country's greatest character actresses in my eyes, and he has played with the superhero fighter than the mostly helpless, younger Fox, which you do not like him, but at the same time almost envy him. On the other hand, while making extraordinary films in Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kino≈°ita and Kursova, Mr. Nourouis is there with him. If you have a free DVD player in a region, you should try to find two Naruse box sets in England. I think this movie was an amazing characteristic of women, who are dangerous to be irrelevant. That does not really make this film a worthy creator of this film.
