Brigant Fonda has frustrated me for many years, but I had a focus on UP. It is true that the story does not have critical details in different places, but I clearly check out the fundamental topic of the story and she did not release me. Having seen his eyes in the last scene, because he has stirred up his courage, in the literal sense, has made a foot in front of his uncertain future, he is one of the most dramatic and notable examples in the face of acting. I believed him completely because I was probably known and admired by many "difficult" people, who lived in similar abusive situations. And they did it without hating people, but this is the hopeful projection of Fund's character in my UP.
