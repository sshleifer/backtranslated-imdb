Rowan Atkinson provided his amazing performance undoubtedly Mr. Bin. Mr Ben's appeal was largely his childhood behavior and innocence. We do not know whether we came from the sky or the other planet. He's a weird character that you can not easily create. She is often alone and used to it. That's why he could only hear from his gruntts from time to time, which may be why he is communicating through a difficult time speech. There are other characters to talk to her and she responds. Mr Bean is a mystery of the character and is still. He lives alone and feels strangely when he can do an intelligent thing. Mr Bien is rather a weird man who does not think much of it. He rather lives with his yellow car and teddy bear, and hopes to work with time.
