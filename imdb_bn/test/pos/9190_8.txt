Faday is the almost sad sadness of the Portuguese Gypsy song that is heard repeatedly on mobile phones. As is explained by major characters (Igor), so is the meaning of fate. <br /> <br /> It is actually a fate that brings together two main characters, Paco and Alex, and triggers what has happened. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it quite a bit. It starts with a suspenseful thriller / road film like a Downs and Outs' plays / road movies. <br /> <br /> Two things that I think are unreal, it gives me higher rating (I'm an 8). Why Alex has left things is the first major issue. He was so frustrated for cash money that he sold his passport in a perfect quantity and sold it, and then he gave thousands of unknown things to the people? His explanation was incredible. How did they enter through the gate, where was the police?
