I think, in 1987 we came back to our examinations and my friends and I saw papers that played 'Teen Debian' in a theater. We decided to go for it just hack without hope of something great. But we were for a wonderful surprise. The film was made in 1965, but by today's standards, this plot was completely modern and ahead of it. The music was wonderful, and seeing the joy of the city, Dev enjoyed watching and played his best. After the film ends we still feel the excitement that came out of the theater. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this story together for three different girls at the same time? No he is not three times or fooling them but he actually likes three of them for different reasons. A housewife, one actress and the third is 'High society' girl, who can help God in her career as a poet. The question is 'one' for him. What makes the case worse is that three of them also like him. When things come to conflict, a hypnotist takes him and his hypnotic state and he dreams of every future and reaches the right conclusions. <br /> <br /> The only color of his dream, otherwise the part of the Black-N-White film is the film's crooks, but surprisingly today's editions are edited from most editions. If you want to watch this movie, make sure that this section is intact. If you watch this movie without this part and get confused, do not worry because you watched an incomplete movie.
