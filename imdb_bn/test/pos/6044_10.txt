I went through the boot camp of the MCRD Paris Island in 1953, and this film has crossed the boot in that era, it has been properly depicted, even to kill that wild sandy. Marin was a very active actor in the film's "actors". This movie may be more entertaining for the morons than others, but I think the film is done very well and the Jack Web has created a "good DI". Semi Fi!
