No, there is nothing to do with this sitfail "sinfald" or his bright and ridiculous character Kosom Crummer. In reality, "Crumar v. Krummer" is a subtle drama film, one of the best and best movies of all time without any doubt. I am glad that it has received more than "Apocalypto Now" because it really deserves this type of glory. <br /> <br /> "Crum vs. crumar" is a nice movie, so well made and so perfectly balanced that I do not want to change anything about it anyway. There is nothing wrong with the film. It made the highest quality film. And it's been very time tested. It does not just show any date, but its cultural influence is long lasting and its realistic story was very important as it was published in 1979. A timeless classic. They do not make movies like this today. <br /> <br /> This movie is dramatic, realistic, simple but bright, intense, strong, sweet and even tragic and sometimes depressed. Yet, it has good humor. It has no special effect, but who care? This is not a movie or place to discuss things. For such a movie, this thing is in vain and absolutely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. Actor chemistry is just perfect. Actors are all great, but 3 main ones are very good. Davein Hoffman, a brilliant actor, as loving as the greatest performance of all time, but also as a remote workhellic Ted Crummer. Mary Streep Ted's wife is as great as Joanna. And cute little Justin Henry is loving but sometimes animated as awesome as Billy, Ted and Joanna's son. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is all helpful and wonderful. The opening song (by guitarist Frederick Hands) is bright. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly classical music of Antonio Vivaldi and it's just wonderful <br /> <br /> This motion image has incredible development of characters. Check out the character of Chad Crumar: A workhorse who becomes amazing father without any other way to care for his child, his wife, Joanna left, tries to adjust these new responsibilities with her job. With this, Tedges learn about the most beautiful things in life, but the problems of his work and the return to the young man, he understands how life is in his son's custody. But the zones also change very well and it is unexpected to be surprised when it looks for the first time in the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture also contains some, such as court scenes, where Ted and Jonah face both brutal characters. Murder kill by lawyers. Another thing can be seen though, when the poor delivery stopped a jungle gym with his toy (a plane) and was seriously injured in his face. But again, the scene is very well made and the next is very intense: his father runs quickly and he crosses many blocks, ignoring his son's traffic to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Overall, a movie is a good lesson in life. <br /> <br /> This must be at the top 250.
