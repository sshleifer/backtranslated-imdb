After the release of The Lost Child several times after being released in 1995 and after reading the reader's comments (mostly for Zen Generation's background and Helen Mirin's wonderful role), it hit me more than ever before, making a great role like Chris Hughes Robert Glenster! Even after 10 years, it is still the most credible way to portray the complex personality of a child abuse, which increases the weight of its past. While watching this episode for a whole one and a half hours you always switch between love feelings and hate for this man, in which hatred is due to the gravity of his actions. I saw a more brilliant role of my favorite actor, but it failed to make the biggest impression for me. Helen Miron will not shine without her next wonderful actress. Robert Glenster praised!
