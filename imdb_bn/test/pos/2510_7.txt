Although it certainly spends a few hours in an enjoyable way and it is always a clock value, this movie never meets the goals for two goals. First, after twenty-five minutes in the first or second, it gives serious attention to Helen and Johnny, who are far less attractive than others - Genet, Jennifer, George and Miss ScatterGoods are much more compelling. Although it works first, we do not always know everything about others in life, and because the matter is being created that Helen is a little self-involved, she wear thin thin and we want to see more of the other letters <br /> <br Second, the picture seems to lose its way in terms of the plot in the second half. The letter contains much less significance than the first half, and again, though it works well in some ways, but it seems impossible to go beyond the possible probability of the first half. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The lazy but silly atmosphere, like Helen, has a sense of resilience in the atmosphere of heavy and small seafront, but the film is not as intelligent as it is, and it is not intelligent. It's just a light romantic comedy and miss both being a cute picture of life. However, it's still good and if you get the chance, it's definitely worth seeing.
