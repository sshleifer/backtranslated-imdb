I just saw a very original movie that I would recommend to everyone including 'young and unstable'. However, I think the film's immorality, violence, and sex is not something 'suitable for all your children.' Before the hour before the hour filling the sand, let me tell you the name of the film: 'nurse betty.' Ronnie stars as Zelliger Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trans, and thinks she is a real life character in her favorite soap opera. Because of this, he traveled to Los Angeles with his supposed soap opera character lover Dr. Ruble To add fuel to the fire, he hunts down some brutal 'living life', who thinks he stole medicines. You could tell how the nurse Betty spent 'her life day' throughout the movie. This extraordinary 'situation' eventually led him to the 'hospital' set of his favorite soap opera. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks it's all realistic. Like other people in his mind. OK! Enough! I will wipe my face with soap and do not mention any soap name. I have already registered my vote as my best actress Oscar nominated candidate. Also, the performance of Greg Kinna as Dr. Rubel was as good as his acting biography. To add this, I have a final determination that everyone should call for 'nurse betty'. ***** Excellent
