I was frightened by the fear of the sea and spent a few years in the navy, so I have some favor on this. I missed this documentary for the first time, but this Christmas (2002) pushed me to the DVD to buy it and I found it! The film is a bit amazing and I have great respect for creating such documentaries, the 200-odd Blue Wheels are amazing scenes of 'cruising' through the sea, they looked like submarines. I like informed information and information through description, that's right, I do not really want to know some basic substances, it is enough for most people. The BBC has given a threat to putting things at the right level for a target audience. <br /> <br /> 'The World at War for For' is a great documentary with me, DVD is a great quality. If there are minor criticisms, there will definitely be some specific words here and there, I think they are disappointed with some scenes. But well done in the BBC and discoveries.
