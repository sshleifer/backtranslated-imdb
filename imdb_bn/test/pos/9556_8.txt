"Best In Show" is a often ridiculous mockumentary which takes place in our dog show world and dog owners who prepare for some event. The only thing that separates the dog from the actual dog show is that the "best show" dogs behave more brutally than their owners! Eugene Levi (who co-authored the film), Parker Pozzy, Michael McCain, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynn and Christopher Guest (who is directed and directed along with Levi). They are all funny, but Fred Wild says the most deadly thing as the announcement of the movie theft dogs show with its explosive fun performance. Plus dogs are very cute. "The best in show" is not really a sunny look, but I have a smile and it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> *** (in fours)
