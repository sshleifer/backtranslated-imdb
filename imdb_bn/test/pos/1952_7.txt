Former young man Josuya Miller (as team) threw his sister's doll into the river and after smoking Daniel smoking (as Samson) Danny Dates (as Jamie), how to smoke and smoke cigarettes. The dolls have been washed away, but the naked girl is seen on the "bank of the river" to see a pedestrian. The bodies of 25 teenagers, mostly nude bodies, classmates. Stoner Kine Reeves (as Matt) and Crespin Glover (as Lane) are the most camera worthy. To find out what friends are thinking about their guilty, beer-gosselling killer friend <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mr. Hooper once killed a woman. She lives with one of the life-size sex dolls, with a face apparently ready for action. I'm a living doll in sky leach (as Clarissa), and she is waiting for her kiss to Reeves. Their crane is particularly cross-cutting with a flashback of the growing enemy. A real teenage, the role of her first feature, Mrs. Leitch 60-daughter of singer Donovan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> some backgrounds of the characters are somewhat subtle May Most likely, the killer was teased; Note his weight, attitude, and "toilet" - connected nickname. Some of the character's relationships and motivations are very unusual, but the cast certainly makes the material interesting; And director Tim Hunter, photographer Fredrick Elms and author Neil Jimmyne are obviously skilled. <br /> <br /> ******* River Edge (8/27/86) Team Hunter ~ Kenyu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Dennis Hooper, Joshua Miller
