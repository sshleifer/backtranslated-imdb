I could not stop showing this movie, though it was too far in my bed. <br /> <br /> Compared to Hitcoak - this thing is really playing with you. It's a real, instant mystery and walking a wonderful line in a dark, restless humor. Like many heroes of the hit, the silent witness in the eyes of our eyes is frightfully frustrating somewhat frustrated - and we take most of the ride with him, when he is fully able to identify with him and feel his fear, it suddenly shows the thrilling secret. Risky more placed. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers take many modest care to do this. Starting from the right shots, they challenge and challenge what they are involved and what determines the fabrication. Who is believed and who is a demon? The plot twists and turns unpredictably. Suspense is carefully created with the combination of camerawork, imagery, music - but most simply letter the letters, which send the raw fear among you. <br /> <br /> A warning: There are some nudity along with some terrific real cow. Scary scenes are done in an emotional way that makes them more scary and annoying than a teenager's slash. <br /> <br /> And this is not a tin-slash picture. Characters seem like quirky and real people, for one thing - a couple (including heroine) you can even find me as respectable. You will see no mistake in watching a movie made up for the big up. I mean, Alake Guinness has been in a little while, and you know that he does not need work! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . And do not want to do this yet.
