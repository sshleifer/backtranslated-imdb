We went to see my husband, two friends from heaven, and I and we all enjoyed this movie. Characters are fun, many like reality in the story and real life. I think that I like the most, just looking at something trustworthy, there is no murder, no science, just good, clean fun This is something you can not think about your kids or old parents. There are so many of them !!
