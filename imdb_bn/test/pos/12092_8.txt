This is a great documentary and a commentary on how wonderful it was, so I will not repeat the same compliments. But, believe, a Turkish-based person, who probably knows more about that country than the ordinary Europeans, falls in the trap of orientalism, which is usually lost to other western artists. But you can describe the terrorist who came to human beings and your movie could be deep and describe what is beyond the "Bayoglu-old town". Mujuyen Senna and Oran Ganschev's performance movie wheel and Sija (very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) talked about some trash about the American gangster rappers, which I totally agree with. I would recommend this movie to my American friends.
