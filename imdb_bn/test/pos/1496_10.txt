Mr. Bean was very fun, I liked it, every episode was really interesting, Rooney etkinson was good for this role, he was a funny face and expression of his face was lovely !!! <br /> <br /> This series was so successful that they created the movie of Mr. Bienan in 1997, which was very interesting with the way !! <br /> <br /> All of these series and situations seem to be funny, this series was definitely sure, and I still see an episode in time. <br /> <br /> One of my books in Mr Bin 10 valuable, fans of the off-line comedy will have to check this out.
