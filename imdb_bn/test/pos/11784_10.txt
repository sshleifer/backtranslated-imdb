Nothing is sacred. Just ask Arnie Fossilus. In these days, everyone has a video camera and the spoofs start flying, quickly written and shot, and rarely comes out before filming directly on the internet. Spoofs are hot these days, and we are sure that our filmmakers will not stop taking their own interests out of our way. It was a different world 25 years ago when the first Star Wars was created. A selection of filmmaking was a playground of few and the spoofs were very rare. Then God gave us the hardware war. It was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) And the audio was actually recorded after the truth. Take away from that experience? Nah! What makes it so great! It was raw and unpublished, and steadily hit some seductive moments of the original film. Instead of a flashlight, instead of a flashlight, a flashing light instead of a flashing lamp (when I was abusive!), It was a part of Uchi Ben Dogi's "no, just a little headache", as a brief part of the film. The facts about the actual Star War film no. Rent it Buy it Lend it from a friend. And Farce could be with you. Always
