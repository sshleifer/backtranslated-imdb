It is widely agreed that Hyo Miyazaki is a master of his imagination, when mixed animations with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters are mixed. His movies are not only very much appreciated by the recent Haoul Moving Castle from NazikA, Totoro, Kiki, Laputa, and Monoch, but also for filmmaking. Can these people make any mistake? Not really, but it is impossible to expect everyone in his movies to always have five star wonders. An unforgettable family-friendly story of "Sonfish Outside Water", Ponio, his newest movie, Ponio, is as animated and alive as you look forward to ... with interesting characters and yet it's its first film, "Less" region. Do not make me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie in any way. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and it is charming and adorable as Tororo and Qiki. The problem is that the story can not be satisfied to encourage another stubborn and deeply intriguing plot. <br /> <br /> For the first hour, PONYO Miyazaki is the story of his best story, in which a horrible and strange young Sonarfish (who later became known as Panoo) created a banned trip to the human world, where he later called his own age Inspired by the boy (the director, after his own mind, interestingly, the model). It does not please Piano's father, Fujimoto, a mysterious wizard, who is very angry for the destruction of the sea (this environmental theme is not different from Miazaki's other movies) ... a problem that he wants to correct, creates jellyfish from the submarine end . He separated the pair and tried to talk to Panoe with the water he had with him. Sonfish, already in the blood of Sosuke (healing on his finger) and some people's food (ham, which he is unnecessarily addicted), and of course stole his father's forbidden pots, it has turned into a hyperparty. A young girl (Who is the girl's spit picture from my closest companion?) It awakens a dangerous tsunami that burns the whole world with water. Fujimoto decides to love the love of two young people for each other, conspiring with his wife, Gran Maam, a confused sea goddess, who alternately transitioned from high-sized titan to human shape. They raise the ocean by plugging the sea into the ocean floor and encouraging young people to set up an extra-sized toy-boats (made by own wines) from the narrow world of their sea. <br /> <br> At this point where the ponois begin to flee from steam. Although Pinoo and Sasuke are attractive and their scenes are fun and intelligent, they reduce the film. Unfortunately, where the movie comes with water, unfortunately, Sasu must prove his love to Poyoia, which is strangely anticlimatic and is presented rush, which unexpectedly stops. It is probably waiting for visitors to another instant industrial path, which is a much more interesting final distribution for its other films. Remember to destroy Laputara? Looking for a little girl looking for sashuki? Kiki's Tomboy recovered? Porco Rosso's war with Curtis? Forrest Spirit's head recovered? Or is the test of Chabiro and Yuba? These resolutions were much more satisfying and felt more complete than this. <br /> <br /> At a technical level, PONYO can not be blamed. Animation is absolutely fantastic, it is fully produced without a single shot of computer-generated images, and naturally Joe Haseyhi gives us another exciting musical score; The best moments are in the order of cyclone below the water and by a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly portrayed as any other Goby movie and details. <br /> <br /> The previous films of Givalley prove themselves eligible for translations in English with the top quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar again provide English. The actors dub a whole lot with a capable cast. Frankie Jonas seems to be very normal and believable throughout life, as well as lentils are surprisingly good. On the other hand, as Noah Cyrus Panoo, sometimes his line shouted before the end. On the other hand, Fujimoto (who runs himself vaguely in character), providing additional protection to Liam Nisson, is included in Cate Blanset Gron Maemer (a universal voice that is not different from Lord Rand's Lord Galadrol). , Sosuk's continual sea father Koichi (who is good but can not write anything), as Matt Damon and Tina Fai as Lina. Among them, Fai combines the best voice in the whole cast with only the right soul and personality. His scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, the spectacular Claris lecheman, as the Castle Dola in the Square, was frustrated by three wildly wild women (he's just a line!), Who are the voice of Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Among them, only Tommyine's character, a dangerous woman named Toki, shows a real person, but if I throw the movie, then I would switch to Tommlin with Leichmann. Perhaps Dab's only real annoying error is a sleek techno-remix of the hottie (but laughingly repetitive) title of the film, which does not express gratitude to the midway through closing credits. <br /> <br /> Full, PONYO is a good film; A delicate piece of animated work which is perfect for young people and family audiences. Due to the decreasing speed of the end, although it is much less than the classic condition. Since Miazaki is still better than her at least one of the animated movies, I would be generous and recommend PONYO a complete star, because her features are still very much worth watching, especially on the big screen. (Do not forget to catch it in the theater when you can.)
