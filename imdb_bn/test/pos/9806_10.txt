I believe, it's a heart-tugging film. Richard Donner (directed by the leading occupation "Superman"), did a great job to manage this film. Some Segemats were good, and some were terrible because Bobby (Majello) The King (Badwin, and especially his dog, attacked Shane King) meant that he paid for what Bobby did. <Br /> <br /> Elise Wood played a good role in this film. In this memorable scene, he dreamed that he had consulted with Bobby about rebellion. Lorraine Brac√≥ (pre-evangelical) played an influential role. <<br /> <br /> I have four with this picture *** !!!
