The way I spent my vacation, from 1990 to 1992, the television series continued to be disseminated. I've always enjoyed the series. I did not compare Syria to Loni Tune in the old days. The television was divided into four or five episodes of video publication (I think I am not writing this) and it is included in the series list of the series. What is good about this series is that the main characters of the show play a big role in the story. What we all see in different parts of the world during their summer holidays. Elimira is leaving the Safari, Plaki, and Hampton with Hampton's parents, Fife's some beach, and so on. The mountains are very good and at the end all small toe characters are reconnected at the beginning of a new year. "Looniversity", this is actually the end of the good run of this TV show.
