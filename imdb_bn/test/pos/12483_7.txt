This photo is so lovingly you want to be part of it forever. Flicks are straight but not without dirty, the products are transparent and the evils are rarely there. Even "cabaret" even very naive they will be made to daydream with nostalgia than anything they provide on TV. Blier fine, if a bit is one sided. Louis Juvett is perfect, you just can not have a good copper. She has the best lines: "My dad cleanses other people's dirt, and I do the same". Susy Delair is intolerable, but I guess part of the part, dress and hairdo. Simone Renant, on the contrary, makes a great femme fatale, if a chic. The IMDB user's dubidentil and others may suggest that they are gay.
