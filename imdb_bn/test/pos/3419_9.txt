These movies are different from traditional Hollywood movies where it shows a true depth of feeling. For example, in Europe we have fought for many years and even though one nation can not eradicate others, old warriors end up living together with each other or at the end of the conflict. In the United States, immigrants are victims of the extinction of the white population of indigenous population. American citizen never had to live with his enemies. It gives me a clear explanation of the holistic nature of Hollywood movies when they try and explain the foreign country's conflict. But this movie, director and screenplay does not fall into this clich√©. It turns out something right and something wrong with everyone in the story. It's a great story of morality, hidden truths and compromises.
