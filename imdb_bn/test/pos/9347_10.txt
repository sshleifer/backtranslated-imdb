I saw the thriller's first music video that my mother brought me home from the hospital and when we came, my sister was on MTV TV and playing the thriller, my mother said, I laugh. I'm stupid, I know, but since that day I loved Michael Jackson, the music video thriller inspired me to dance, but I have reminded this dance today. I even performed it 3 times for an audience! Words can not describe the power of the song that can sing and dance to you, but of course, Michael must sign the American Wayforfe of London's director John Landes and only, the thriller had to raise the MTV bar. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date, Ola Ray, are driving gas in dark, wooded areas. They walk into the forest, and Michael asks him if he wants to go steady. He took it and he gave him a ring. He warned him that he is not like other sons, or other people do not really like it. Will a full moon appear, and Michael begins convulsing in pain ?? Transformed into a scary verb! Her date shrieks and runs away, but the warewolf catches up, knocking him down and starts lunging on her with her nails. The scene goes to the movie theater, where Michael and his date actually reveal this scene in the thriller. Michael Hussey was afraid of his date, and asked him to leave. Michael cares for him, and says that this is just a movie, but he does not like his joke on him and he starts to walk. Michael and his date then walk on a foggy street, and he teases her with the opening verse of the thriller. They pass a cemetery, where Vincent Price performs his rap and the bodies start to rise from their graves suddenly. Michael and his date then find himself surrounded by Junky, and suddenly, Michael himself became a zombie. Michael and Andrade simultaneously perform an extensive song and dance number, followed by thriller chorus. <br /> <br /> The thriller is the best music video of all time, the interesting thing is that Michael Jackson wants to debate with others, but the thriller is particularly danced, stories, influences, at which time it is the most expensive music video. Michael definitely screwed his famous music videos and then again with Ghost again. But what you say, Michael was a 1980s star, no celebrity like him, he loved life, lived, breathed, and accepted him. Thriller has proved that he was willing to work for the best and we got it with thriller legends. <br /> <br /> 10/10
