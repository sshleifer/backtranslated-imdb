Of course, most people will nominate the "Island of Fisherman" as innocent and trashy, but can you really naming these multiple movies that bring these colorful themes forward? This Italian jewelery has features like pure entertainment, and Voodoo, volcanic eruption, mutant fishes, a mysterious continent of Atlantis, riches, a remote island full of death and full-fledged scientist! All this and a simple movie more? Yes! Opponents of Italian horror film mortgages can easily tag this movie as the cheapest exploitation version of "Dr. Moreau Island", but the fact is that much more! The "Fishmen Island" surprisingly starts from the beginning of the thrills and adventure to end with fantastic special effects and surprisingly stylish camera-work. The story is open with a small group of captives, the survival of the ship, and a tropical island. They face rogue Edmond Rackham who governs a native tribe? And part of the genetically built Ambrian monsters living in the island's stems. There are many twists and extra sub-plots in the story which are almost impossible to write summaries but trust me, this jewel is worth checking. Sergio Martino has again proved that he is an impressive filmmaker who is capable of being competitive and creative at the same time. She makes great use of beautiful island location and look very impressive in the interior. Wonderful watery footage and fantasy scenes really highlight this picture on the normal values ​​of 70 hectic exploitation. I do not understand why Roger has reproduced the original order and left it in the American market under a different title ("SkyMars"), because very few components are open for improvement. Cast members are all regular in Sergio Martino (a good supporting rule without exception of Great Joseph Cotton) and give great performance away. If you can get your hand in the recently retrieved German version, your extra action will take more than 15 minutes. See it!
