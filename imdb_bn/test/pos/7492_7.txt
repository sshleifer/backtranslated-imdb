When I saw this movie I had no idea, and I have never heard of it before. But I was definitely surprised by the fact. The first few minutes almost the whole movie is the most fun. Shop from India is very interesting! However, talking about the story is not really much, but I think it's okay. Acting on the other hand is quite good, and I'm still a recognized actor Mickey Roar who was not really really in the movie. And when I think that's off, it's not bad but I do not think it's really like the end. I seem to have some more. Some way is a final war. I do not know. After all, it was a good film and I recommend it to anyone in Tarantino-type films, including violence and dark, decent humor! I rate it 7/10.
