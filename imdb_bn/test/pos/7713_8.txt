The eighth of the animatrix, and thus the second to the least short, it is the only one such. It takes inspiration from two of the Matrix's most prominent entertainments and is incredibly well-connected to them. This aspect, the triangle in the voice is extremely incredible. Animation is a fantastic, exciting animation. This style, which is universal, light. The plot is appropriate, and story-story, as well as music, spot-on. The general term is superb, and helps draw moods and the atmosphere as well as drawings and designs. Voice acting indirect In these two films, the people reestablish their role, and both of them appear in Enn Mosque, who was present among them. This is nine best, and one of my personal favorites. It is about ten minutes long. Panning is perfect. It's not terribly very slowly, but it is not too much, either. The last may not be more suitable for this. It creates nine minutes long with Kid's story and it is well-completed and informative. I recommend any fan of the universe and this chain of heat made in two chains. 8/10
