As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that did not say "very deep in this movie." Have to disagree with me? It will be one of the deepest and most worrisome movies I have ever seen. Yes, acting and music were nice; They were appreciated over the review. However, I appreciate the heart of the movie. It resonates with deeper meaning and feelings ?? It's a story of release It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten by life but killed and died very powerful. A girl is seen by a man more valuable than her. This reminds me strongly of the redemming love book by the River Francis, which contains stories similar to release. Yes, the images and themes are messy and sometimes frustrating, but if you are close enough, you can see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the perfect thing in life is not beautiful, but they are real.
