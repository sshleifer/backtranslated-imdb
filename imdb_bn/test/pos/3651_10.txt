Come back and lead the director Inderbal to the visually and passionate journey of India's mind and spirit. The last time you can say you've really enjoyed a movie? This movie has a speed and we are in a direction which can only exist in India. You do not want to visit India before making this movie for you to see it now. This movie involves dancing girls, a Chase scene, and mafioso. But it's a lot more. Thank you, India, for bringing such an exciting and wonderful story to us. I loved the end We do not want illusions in women's lives, we want reality. Again, I was a friend of Caroline at the Sona Film Festival and I saw you briefly. Good luck with your distribution efforts and I'm talking about a storm in the movie.
