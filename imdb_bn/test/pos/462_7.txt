Good show, really good acting, and the director is swimming in an interesting, unpredictable way, especially because it's two people in the room. It's not like many modern movies, but it can not even pull. Bohl shines enough to believe in his character "now", which is still involved and is not going back to his 'career' choices - so it is trustworthy without the need to show us deep, self-test. His spirit ... maintains the weight of the brand's weight, innocence, humility, and the class very well to draw 'Buddy'. The film is a little stained on the quality, but fits the tone of the story. Hair and some makeup may use a little polishing at the end, but certainly worth looking for.
