When I saw this on TV I was nervous ... if they make it shocking? Like millions of families living with the brain affected people, my father will be released to me in my case. I saw it with my mam and we both ended up weeping, it was so perfect and how the family felt the person suffering from brain injuries. The actors were all wonderful and I had no complaints, my mom told me that she could not stop thinking about it. I hope this program makes many people aware about what it is like with living in the brain and living like it for the family. More such programs should be created, I was amazed at how good it was and it really pushed me into emotion.
