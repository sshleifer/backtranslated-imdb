When I was watching this movie in 1981, at the age of 7, it seemed to me that it was absolutely brilliant! I just found the DVD a few months ago. I was jumping around and down! I bought it and showed it to my kids. They liked it very much. They ask that Sears sing a song (I did not tell them, because I do not think the word 'gay' and 'exstacy' for 6-year-old children is very good parenting). The song is bright I still think of them all. I will remember them at the age of 60! There, or near abouts. Tommy Pender (was) such a brilliant actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
