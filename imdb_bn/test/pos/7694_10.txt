I was always fond of filming this vastly invisible film of Gershwin Opera, since I saw it in 1959. Many of you know that it was unavailable in the video or DVD; In fact, the Gershwin family tried to destroy all existing prints. However, for some reason - hoping to end its conflict, the Gershwin family recently approved the display of a collector's print in the museum. Moving images in Astoria, Queens. <br /> <br /> Wide-screen, technicola print was nice! (Not perfect, but nice.) The word was awesome, street stereo show quality. Those who saw this in their original release did not see much good copy. (The program notes include the original diversity review, which warns that people can bind to a limited limited-free ticket price of $ 3.50!) <br /> <br /> And, as much as I really like it, Pogi and BSS I Feel better than It's just wonderful. As Parry was in Sydney Poitier where her career started to catch just the fire, and her shines through charisma. Dorothy Dandridge as the base is spectacular beautiful. Brown Peters Crown as Aggressive Monthly Pearl Bailey as Maria gives some comic moments, though her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Junior, as Sporting Life, he stole all the scenes; She is particularly riveting in her two big numbers: "So it does not need" and "New York has a boat that's Leavin soon." (I have won the last win after watching the last screening.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The clothes are also outstanding. <br /> <br /> Songs of Sydney and Dorothy have been dubbed, but they are very well dubbed. The fine "fertility" is played by Clara, a young Diahann Carroll is played by; His songs are sung. (Actually, only Pearl and Sammy use their own voice.) <br /> <br /> The music is great, of course, but this time it really hurt me how emotional emotions emerged from the story of Premingma. People were really relaxed in the audience several times - once the base sang the beautiful song "I love you." And I came out from the audience, "It does not need to be so" laughing loudly on the line. Did they ever hear this song before - or did they really hear it? I believe that most of the emotic effects of this film are influenced by Poetor and Dandridge performance - you encourage them to win their love. <br /> <br /> With a short time of 136 minutes, a little soft - one or two slower places, and a stereooptical, Amos-n-Andy-type scene that saw a Shafter lawyer seeking divorce from Crown, even though he did not marry her. . (I cut it off.) And the beginning is a little confusing - both title characters are weird - they understand who they are before they understand the part of the movie <br /> <br /> And I do not think a close-up has been used in full-movie premimation. It seems to be shot at all 3/4, which I guess is that it was the way to work with a wide screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> For those who like our soundtrack, and some of us who have just heard about it. I hope they will find ways to reproduce it and find out on DVD. It deserves a potentially broad audience.
