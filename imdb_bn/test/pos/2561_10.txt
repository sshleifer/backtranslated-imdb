I liked seeing this reason for one reason and one reason ... Samuel L. Jackson. I like him, a lot. I did not see any preview or trailer for this nefarious movie, so it went on without real expectation. <br /> <br /> South was not as disappointed as Jackson Laser, and perhaps distributing his most powerful performance, playing a number of excellent blues tunes and singing. But the real surprise here was that of Christina Ricchi, the real-life best air adventure airplane, who had played the role of tram roy in the city of sexual harassment and made her believable, almost even the desired character. Undoubtedly non-sexual relations has emerged in Lazarus and Rai, only extraordinary. <br /> <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake, pop star became the actor, should be promoted around "dress confectionery" and Pop Stage. Most of his compulsory performance was confusing to the real story here. <br /> <br /> This movie is raw, great, and most of the time "your face" Not everyone likes it. However, those who will quickly move it to the top of their favorite list.
