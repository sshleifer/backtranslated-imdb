Yet in the late 70s and early in the '80s, the long lines of "no" films were still much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low-budget schlocker with a twist. It is grain and odd soundtrack which features horror movies of the period, but it is a wonderful performance of the wonderful talented actors / actors who make this film well. Dr. A young nurse in Stephen's Progressive Psychiatric Hospital arrives only after being killed by a patient and does not seem to be what she thinks. It seems that an aspiring female doctor Dr. Masters has done his duties and started implementing his own ideas. Each patient adopts their own unique personality and features and flaws of their own personality, which creates highly entertaining interactions. Nymphomaniac, crazy old chron, a woman with unhealthy emotions and returned to her childhood in another. In this bizarre story, there is a strange small curve which can then find young nurses trapped inside the shelter with patients moving around the body. If you are a fan of Sludge 70, it's a movie for you!
