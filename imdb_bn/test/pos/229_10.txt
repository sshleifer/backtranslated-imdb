One night I heard talking on the radio and Leslie Nielsen was in their program. He went to explain why there were only six shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> TV shows are like mosquitoes, you can go to the fridge to get the beer and you do not remember anything until you hear it. But with the police squad, you wanted to see the show, if you do not see them, the eyesight completely miss you. Who can forget "... ... the part of the city" Little Italy "..." With Coliseum in the background <br /> <br /> Even the movies were also dependent on the scene, but again in the theater you were a captive audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was for the audience to get jokes. <br /> <br /> Well it's about 2 cents.
