It was certainly valuable for a TV movie. All the performances were very well done and the story itself was a touching universal theme. I have not read / saw the original word, and as a rule I can not stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie (civil war setting is also done well). Do not expect to see an epic, but you will find it moving enough to enjoy it. However, do not compare this (or any movie) to the original work (in a side note). Movies are not supposed to transfer a book to the screen, rather take the general idea of ​​it and then follow its story. When people say "the book was so good" (they are usually wrong in any way) they actually wanted to say that the book was so different.
