Mikio Naruise's test of living of three laziness, continuous accusation, single ex-gaias in post-war Japan is part of an excellent character. They started to be friends of old but now their relationship has been torn apart because a woman has successfully succeeded and the other two owed her. Although the only money donor who has succeeded in rebuilding this money, he is the only child of three children who have no children. The other two each have a child whom they rely on for income, because none of them work. Complications arise when the children decide to get married (though not one another) and leave home. It becomes bitter, annoying, even more bitter and annoying to the elderly woman, becomes drunk and disturbs their degenerate children and is a beneficiary to a friend.

The problem, I think, does not seem to amount to all the amount. But the picture is full of good points. Although it is illogical, it is not too much. Naruse seems sympathetic with his great character, and he painted the animated portrait that makes spontaneous misery squalor even think of some of the characters.
