If you are looking for a movie that is awakening and does not disturb you, then that is the place. It's fast paced and fun with some decent acting from characters. It is always difficult for me to see Mark Walhurg as something else other than Marky Mark. The picture that my mind is burned forever. As an actor he is quite good as well. Action fans who want to watch this movie must watch some short twists and turns. I will choose this movie for a day and buy it.
