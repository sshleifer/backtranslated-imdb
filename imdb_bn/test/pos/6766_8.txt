This movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a play, almost two people who worked in a Butcher Shop and wanted to make themselves. When they finally met those dreams, they faced a new problem: there were no clients! One day, accidentally, a man dies in the refrigerator, and starts a new type of Butcher's business ?? They started selling human flesh, saying it's just chicken to clients ?? And their business begins to improve: Human bodies sell well! Oh! I forgot to say anything ?? These boys are not normal! There really is something missing in their brains! <br /> <br /> There are some nice dark humorous scenes in the movie, but in my opinion most plays are. One that shows the inside of the head of the psychotherapee, shows what his motivation for what he does. I must admit that I was amazed at the end of the movie, because they hoped that they would not be able to discover it, but perhaps it was because I could see many Hollywood movies? Does that mean I always hope to punish the "bad things" in the Hollywood movie. Always there is always the morality of "good values", we all know that in "real life" it does not happen so often ?? And I like this movie in most cases because it is a kind of movie that fits right, front, without any fake morals and what "to see" on the other side of "traditional morality"? It just happens in independent movies (especially European)! <br /> <br /> as well as Nicolas Li Cass and Mads Mickelsen (especially the first one) have excellent performance in the role of "helpless boys"? <br /> <br /> Very nice Danish film!
