I did not understand what the line meant ... I do now. I do not really want to see Dirty Dancing I rent it but did not see it - and today I did. And I thought it was a really fun, fantastic movie that you want to get up and dance. All right, it was a lot of times Chess ... but it's still a great movie. I can not believe Jennifer Gray was 27 years old in this film - my friend and I thought she saw about 18 or 19-20. I suppose this is the acting talent admirers. And she really looks weird at times. Patrick Swayze is very good, but you can say he thinks in his thirty years and a bit old. Still, still very good. I liked the song of 80 so it really hit a mess with me, and love story (yes, I am a romantic) so wonderfully done. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Beyond my expectations!
