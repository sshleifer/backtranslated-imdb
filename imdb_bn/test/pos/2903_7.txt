I give this movie high marks for movie-photography and performance. I read a user's comment about actress acting, who congratulated the congratulations, who left Sinhu, the main character. At the last moment I saw this when I think this actor is a mini biography. Obviously, she was Holocaust Refugee, she was discovered in the film industry with the wife of the French husband and with her extraordinary beauty discovered. He died in very young and tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is outstanding in this film. Like other neo-biblical films of the 1940s and the 50's, "Egyptian" reflects the ethics and values ​​of that time, but there is still great entertainment because performance is horrible and the story is so good.
