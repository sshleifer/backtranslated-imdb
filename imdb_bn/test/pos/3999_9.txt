What a movie! I've always liked the Asian style of shooting, and this movie is not all disappointing! Photography is breathing, ranging from rolling colors to amazing landscapes. The main actor painter represents really realistic (whose picture is surprising). The last very very well selected, very poetic The only comment that they might have shown to be more deeply concerned with his inspiration and the abuse of alcohol and women. But it's an excellent movie!
