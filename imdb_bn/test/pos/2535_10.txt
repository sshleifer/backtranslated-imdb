The filmmaker speaks to the camera and says he is showing a story about children in Brazil's street whose family maintains poverty and stole it to live. In fact, the main character (Pixot) is played by only 11 year old street kids. Following was one of the most cruel, depressing and scary movies I've ever seen. I saw it almost 17 years ago (a double bill with "Black Arpius") and I have not forgotten it. I do not want to see it again - it was too much. <br /> <br /> Spider Ahmed !!!! The scene will not leave me, when Pixot fills a prostitute, which can stop her own fetus. You do not see him ... but you will get a quick look at what you got. This is about 20 years later and the scene reminds me. SPILILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The movie gets more cruel in the only way it can run. The more frustrating thing is that these stories happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and it is still happening today. <br /> <br /> A violent brutal film ... but if you can manage it, then it should be seen. I was surprised to get this rating - I saw a low-graphic x-rated movie. A 10
