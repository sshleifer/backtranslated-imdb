I saw the first picture in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and remember it from it, even though I have never seen it for the first time. <br /> <br /> How easily human life can be destroyed by pure evil? Only then existed and still a memorial that would scoff me forever. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny and very sad, at the same time Anthony Quinn's role is excellent. <br /> <br /> This film should be in the study of all colleges about the human's inhumanity.
