This picture is not really a remake of 1949 and 'Bryan' film (which is awesome). It lends itself to the main premises - a man becomes poisonous and spends the rest of his quest to find the killer. But I like the writers to choose an English professor instead of a personal teacher. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves fast enough to stay awake. But this movie is a strange date about which a strange date (because it is probably the original music score of 80) is combined with a weird "silent" feeling. Dennis Quaid grins inexperienced throughout the whole movie at a weird moment, but he is still mandatory in a general way. Meg Ryan is a fine for student helper / love interest. When the movie goes bad, Dix (Professor) meets British Bodyguard / Chaufur and both of them are pretty funny The bodyguard works for rich widows (played by beautiful Charlotte Rampling), but the scene is very spontaneous "silent" to help the film, though the family "plot line" is rather attractive. Dex looks at the same place and finds out this bodyguard, which is rather traditional, rather than traditional. In the last part of the film, a man fires by a window, and you see him jumping from outside - this is a very bad side. But from this obvious error, I think it's still okay. I did not predict the end, so it was good - there was a wrapper, and although some posters here think that they were confused, I thought it was a fine and credible end. Danis Quaid, with his weird hilarious and black eyes, Diet Wright, Great Ball of Fire, the heart's space, and Cold Crick Manor are more likable. But here as Dex, he is supposed to be a bit blurred, so he's fine. Fairly decent movie
