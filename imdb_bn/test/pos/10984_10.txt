I did not know much about this movie - my roommate kind of dragged me into it. I was so surprised! The plot really grabbed my attention and held it, and the characters well drawn and realistic. The script is very tricky and fun, and cast is great thing with it. And the best part is that it managed to entertain without any explicit sex or violence! This movie comes anywhere in your area but you must see it - stand up for this little film, it's valuable!
