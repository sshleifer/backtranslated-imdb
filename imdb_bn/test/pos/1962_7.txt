Zero less than 80 seconds of the movie, which expresses teeny apathy in its most extreme form, was really stuck in the book. However, where they did not, the film presented the work and released Larry Clark's films with 'Kids' and 'Bulli' with the greatest feeling until the end of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Social outcast teenagers face a rather strange conflict (they do not behave like that at all) when their enraged friend (Daniel Rokku) is proud of them that he killed a teenager near the river bank, the city of the suburbs. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character among the group, willing to show any kind of conscience, on the other hand, helping others to hide the body without doing anything about the death or their friend. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is more ill in this movie - Crispin Glover - who tried to protect a friend and smuggled him out of the state and became a parent to hide crime. . Dennis Hooper (who is involved with a female bloopup doll), who makes friends with adolescents (of course, a dealer) and suddenly involved in the events. Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's younger brother Tim. At least that at least until his emotional breakdown, all of them seem overwhelming. It definitely does not hire the peppy 80s teenager, of course. And of course, it makes clear the issue of serious isolation with these kids (though despite the continuation of the series) thanks to nearly four great performances (even Reveys proves some acting ability). <br /> <br /> Help yourself This is a very difficult stone if you recover a comedy.
