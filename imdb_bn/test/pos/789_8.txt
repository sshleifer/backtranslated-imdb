With good music music, this is the first time in the UK TV. Lift scene class, especially when he does the ongoing phone booth and then quarrels with the floor guide. The jump through the transmom is really impressive, and there are many more. In addition to all the elements that have been mentioned before, have to fight with humans that are raping the woman with dogs - it just looks so easy. The only error is the plot - he mixes with Dead Eye Dan, who escapes but does not appear again, even some gangsters are involved later. The shooting scene at Fat Inspector looks funny, but it would have been good if Dead Eye could drag the trigger.
