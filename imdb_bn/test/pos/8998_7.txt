First, let's say this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a feeling-good movie with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. Actually, the dialog is a little good, production quality is quite good. <br /> <br /> 3 Rugby view ... just barely passable. But here's the tactic: This is not Hollywood acting, and it is not trying to make a fiercely accurate screenplay of sports. Instead it is a beautiful representation of most real people, real situations and a real story. Of course, they really did well, but my vote: this is a great job to do. <br /> <br /> I can not do much football, baseball, hockey or football movies, which seems to be true for sports ... I think ... Bull Durham?) <br /> <br /> I'm not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) but I graduated from Highland, joined the '86-90 ', and sometimes trained with rugby. But my father-in-law David was the founding member of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother Billy, I think he played the next year.) If you are interested, then rugby site in a Highland Highlandbrubby network addresses the team's history. <br /> <br /> The day I was there, the club existed for nearly a decade and had long earned fame for excellence. It is a fact that they concentrated on "broad" training topics: devotion, respect, discipline, effort, not technique. I thought rugby was a little 'closed' on the head, but I think I could be a little jealous. They were the hard-core dedicated to the belief system of the GOLFICS. <br /> <br /> Concerning the "cultural blend" raised, it could be interesting to remember that I was there in the 80's, one of the biggest schools in the city - the South High School - and its students, the other three primary SLCs Distributed in the school. To be honest, the Highland Pre-80's were fantastic whitebags ... I got a picture of the group (I think) in 1977 which shows * all * white clubs. South High, on the other hand, had a more ethnic integrated school before closing it: There was a pair of friends from my south who joined a group, a tangan, a Samoan, and remember there was a bunch of island nation players '88-90 ' Joined. I do not ask the party's credibility to accept Maori (or other cultural) traditions: If there was anything clear about these people, they started walking. As a team strength compared to the best education teams in the world: Yes, it is true that US-rugby, when taken as a whole, is not particularly presented, well-versed against good elsewhere. There are exceptions, but hey - it is a simple fact that there is no specialty or exposure for the promotion of multiple traditions of superiority in the United States arising out of other countries in Rugby. <br /> <br /> Judge Hailand is on his eligibility: <br /> <br /> - * Only * that company * is eligible to qualify for 25 years of history per year for the United States Rugby National Championship. <br /> <br /> - A win of 392 wins, 9 defeats! Read more ... Winners of any sporting sport in the history of the sport. <br /> <br /> - Regular international travel <br /> <br /> - Some interesting win against some legitimate international team. <br /> <br /> Are they the best in the world? Probably some years, probably not the maximum ... but they are quite good on consistent basis. And the Highland Rugby may be the best ambassador for the sport in the United States when it is disrespectful to play them in order to flush them out.
