John Wayne's first acting role just blew me away. In the AMC television letter format, I had to verify and I had to make sure that I had the exact date. Sure, this 1930 film was made using the 55mm wide-screen process. In addition to this, I have seen the west trail of the most fascinating, most realistic footage in the West. Wagons, men and animals are really lowered down by a steep mouth by rope. The trees are stolen by men - and barbarous women - so that the train can move another 10 feet. Indian slicks of "beautiful boys" who later do not depict them; They're the real deal. A river crossing a rain storm is so realistic, it must be real (in fact, I lost almost complete Cast in Castell Walsh during this sequence). I could smell wet canvas. Each day is a pain. Various sub-plots are forgotten but not entirely movies. I can not think of any other headlines that could defeat the Big Trill, in the development of the Oregon Train's living history. Salad
