After reading Tom Clancy's "Red Storm Rising" novel, I found this movie. The 13th-century Russians are the non-chronological writings attacked by the Germans. Films were made in 1938 according to the directives of Joseph Stalin to warn Soviets about Hitler and Germany. The war scenes are wonderful, it shows that you do not need computer animation to create a great fight scene. Probably Sergei Eisenstein's greatest work. Also see 'Battleship Potemkin'. Any history buff or polio-scientist will see this movie. 10 out of 10
