What is your freaking problem? Do you have to do something better than to sit on your fat ass and blog you find something in bad taste? Here's a concept: Go outside. It's OK: For 13 years you are living and go outside to walk out of your mother's basement. "But I can not move! Star Trek is within 30 minutes and I'm still not married to the avatars of war avatar of the world!" O my God, in that case, stay inside! OK, I could have gone overboard over there. I mean, Star Trek is okay but I do not really see it anymore. In both ways, you really will write a shit about Mencia's mind. This is a good show. Maybe you are just carrying your anger because that girl has left you in the World of Warcraft. Or you're constipation. Try putting your food fiber.
