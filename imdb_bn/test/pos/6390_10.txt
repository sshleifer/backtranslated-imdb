It gives the common man the opportunity to sing television as their favorite star. <br /> <br /> Most of the time they sound like a singer who is portrayed as them. <br /> <br /> This is another twist - a group of people and clothing makers that dress up in a competitive dress like singer. They may not feel like them, but the likelihood of hearing like a person like them is very thin. <br /> <br /> This is a fun load for your Saturday night - and the competitors are not 'raging' like they wannaabes at other TV music shows. It does not involve any prizes and for fun it means that it will attract a different type of person. <br /> <br /> My only miserliness is with the kids' version - it seems they've done stage school round - what has happened to normal kids?
