Unconscious love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. This is an emotional roller coaster. My favorite scene is a pub scene. When Dirk says to Grace that he does not want to go for pub because the villagers do not like him, then you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass and says' In Victor Fox's memory and following the whole pub case, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is violent! Julie makes it generally Julie Andrews style it. Johnathan is as nice as Price Victor. Grace Kathy Betts is one of the best performers. Meirethth Eaton stole for each of his scenes. Wonderful work like Rupert Everett Dark did some good work. A pair of Rupert and Meridith took me to another point in the hysterics. This day and the rights of gay rights are being questioned, I think this movie should be seen by everyone. At the age of 40, when I die as a gay man, people lose everything. So this is the image of Koduo for everyone involved in the creation.
