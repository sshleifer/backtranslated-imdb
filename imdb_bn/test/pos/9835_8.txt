History, myths and fantasy "Mystic Knights" have dragged me from getting me as a fan of the show. It's semi-honk scripting, dresses are fantastic (exceptions), it has a great performance, and the hero and villain play well with each other. <br /> <br /> Scripts - half the script is quite good, the other half is flat, but it all mix together, which means that so many episodes are so counter. Also, some important players are repeatedly given dead lines (for example King Kong and Angus) to give them something ... more. I'm not sure what the author should be able to come up with. Activity - In addition to some people acting by villagers (horror lines they end up in too much effort), welding is very good in choosing their leads. Everyone works well, bad, well together! Costume / Weapon - Everybody who wears clothes is spectacular! The little misty night armor of the distraction and garette is. A chimneyed bikini probably has good protection in its case ... and will not look plastic; His appearance looks like brown plastic pieces, it will show bronze. Iver Trident seems to have bought it in a discount shop and when the Garrett's arms look cool, they show the plastic. <br /> <br /> Recently "Mystic Knights" has watched many "Power Rangers" features, if you see the show, you know what I mean. As the series progressed, it should find its prominent and perfect in its style. Overall, this is a wonderful show that should be enjoyed by all ages (most of my friends and I see it and we all are 20+). The plot thickens and twists, even though it gets a little teenager in place, and everything just keeps getting more attractive. This may be of little interest to fans of the movie "Willow" or TV Series "Adventures of Sinai Adventures". Many adventures, a fires of mysteries, romance dashes, a hole in nature's forces ... Check it out! (My score: 7/10)
