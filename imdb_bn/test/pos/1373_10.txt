It looks like the people here are here! The Planet is a B-giant film and it is quite different to enjoy such fun and enjoy. The director has some clear offers - some are not sure about throwing. As for the effect? There are no budgets of more than 8000 pounds. For the one-on-one or this one does not accept giant movies with great importance, it will happily recommend it. If so 3colors blue look instead I noticed a review aimed at it was ripped off the alien. Things like alien do not yell off. The best thing about film? Director. The worst thing about filming? Cast. Maybe the manager has time to go from Glasgow to London and find some talent. Already - well done. At least you're trying to do something.
