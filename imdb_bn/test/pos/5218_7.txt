(Some spollars) faced the medieval crisis and Syndy was annoyed with his marriage to Teddy Siddal, who did what he did and where he used to be, he also spoke at the air force, USAAF Elite Red Bear BG. Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole, decided in the morning that they would move away from all and start a new life as a citizen. <br /> <br /> David first got this idea when he enjoyed the Halloween party Sweet and Alison, Karen Silas. Telling Allison that he is in a secret military, has kept his background hidden from him, for him the perfect cover. Jackson returned to the AFB from Austin Tex. David Syndi and the United States began reviewing his options and decided to run away from him and change his identity. David then called on Allison, who met only once and made a date with him. Before knowing David, now he uses the name Haywood, marrying her. <br /> <br /> On his death, in a bike accident, David deliberately left his wife and children in cold condition and his army's responsibility to his country. It did not take long for Dave that citizenship did not apply to him. Dave is now too late, his first wife, Syndy and his two sons, will face Brigade and martial court martial, if he returns to the United States. Dave took the only work to support him and Allen and his son, Chris: Using his skills, he learned to hide bank at Red Barrett. <br /> <br /> "It has been said" based on the real story, Dave Bay / Heywood is not three, not three, three are alive. A ruthless bank robber of President and universal hero, Prime Mississor of Gigabyte in the US, is a robber and still dead and highly decorated as one of the hard working families. Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. David Bay and husband David Haywood David's actions, however, are inappropriate, understandable in relation to his depression on his marriage to Singi. The pressure of his mockery reached him at the point where he had just lost his or her children and wanted to go away. But he should have sought professional counseling from the US Air Force, which he happily provided instead of simply choosing. In the end, he was taken straight to Levenworth Fahrral prison. Maybe it may be that Dave, who greatly thought of Mao, was a bad sign for her career as well as for her arrogance to help her problems. <br /> <br /> Like Alan Karen Silas, the glue explains her intimate disappearance with her new husband for the first time and keeps the film for more than two hours, because she is secretly keeping the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absence were his plans and looted banks. The only way to know what he learned is to be isolated from what he learned, in the activities of wicked people, Elite Red Bertes all those years. <br /> <br /> Dave's mother Caroline Bay (Linda Goranson), because she was a small boy in Portland, told her that she found the truth of double or triple quality, because she has been leading her since her marriage. This led Ellison to find out about AWOL's marriage with Linda and her two children with the death of her marriage and from the United States AOL. It was something that ended with a real story that you were supposed to make it an ideal Hollywood or TV movie. That's the film "Lied, which is a lot better than what you want it to be.
