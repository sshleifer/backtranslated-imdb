This review was written by someone who read it (several times) and knows what they are saying! First of all I have read the opinions of others and noticed that the objections were somewhat stupid. Those who have read the book and other Jane Austen's or any good book will know that staying in the book will have to be believed in any writer who is important to you. If the audience does not like it, it looks good in the book because it shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and are not really the true fan. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> If visitors really prefer books or Jane Austen, it should not be difficult to see it for four hours. Secondly, there was a lot of care for the appearance of their society and so much, the style of fancy hairstyles will show how rich you are, which was a key element of their day to go to "good" society. I admit that the women's clothes were not bright, but it was created only for a few bad guys and men, but also for the Navy, their unboundedness is not very uniform in their uniforms! Today people do not leave their uniforms away from school or work because they are casual clothes and it was the same in the 19th century. It goes as well as acting, because it's fine because Jenny Austen wrote! And at the end the scene is beautiful. You can not compare the filming in the 1995 edition because the technology has improved so much as it is ridiculous to compare between them. Actor who played Anne, he is old but acting his air and how he makes it. <br /> <br /> People seem to like the 1995 version for any reason! It can not interfere with the book and these are flat, inward emotional, they change the main scenes, there are only good actors and they do a good job for the work you give them. Obviously those who really like it (I'm sorry) do not understand stupid and so it needs to be extra. The 1971 version wrote beautiful, romantic, beautiful scriptwriter (who was inspector Morshe), was a very good actor, and indeed this is a movie that you can see many times, and each of you can be happy about it.
