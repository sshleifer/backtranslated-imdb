It was written by Dopelganj, (or more familiarly as' Journey to the Sun Distance), (by input by late Donald James) and produced by Gary and Silvia Anderson, which is best known for their super-supararionation television such as' Thunderbird '. <br /> <br /> The International Space Agency Eurocaq discovered the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and offered to send a manned flight there. The committee revolves around this stimulating cost, and preserves the project. But when the security leaks are discovered in the company, the Russians may initially be scared, the project gets green light. <br /> <br /> American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thins) joined British scientist John Kane. (Ian Hendry). Suddenly after a few weeks of training, the Phoenix explosion stopped, the title for the unknown. <br /> <br /> Three weeks later, their ship seems to be a slow, mountainous landscape that crashes. Ross survives, but Kane is seriously injured. It looks like a light is moving towards them ... <br /> <br /> I'll put the summary here. To this point, the film has a special effect (by Derek Meddings) and Anderson Barry Gray (why it was not issued on CD) is a mystery. But when Ross and why were discovered in the role of the missile and we discover the secret of the indirect world - it is a similar to our own, each of it is the same, only the main difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting and ends with a shattering anti climax . I think the movie was a wrong place to do this, actually Gerry and Sylvia did something similar to their 'Space: 1999' show. The risk of his life (and ultimately loses) in his attempt to return to Earth - his world. but why? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ray Thinens recently played 'The Invaders' television series and gave an efficient performance. Where he row with his wife). Ian Hendry 'Why' as well, but very soon disappears from the story. A number of actors were present at Anderson's UFO. Such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Hug and you missed Miss Nicholas Courtney (from 'Brigadier' ​​in a small role 'Dr. Ho'). But the acting honor Patrick Wiemark is known as 'Jason Webb', the head of Eurosack. The character did not move away from 'Sir John Wilder', he starred in A VV's 'The Power Game'. Webb is such a devious character he is wonderful to see. Herbert Foam's contribution (as a spy with hidden camera in a false eye) is more than a como. <br /> <br /> As I said, special effects are surprising, like sets. So the movie is worth watching, but once you go towards the mirror planet, hopefully not a lot will happen. With a strong script, it can be another 'Planet of the App' - I can say - '2001: A Space ODC'. <br /> <br /> In Anderson productions, he feels like the future of space, where an advertising field where the science was calm, everyone folded the car, whose doors were vertically, sexy women were open and there was absolutely no suggestion that the world was slightly Serious mistake We are now observers in the future and people are still 'to do' on the other night. How frustrating If the mirror is present anywhere in the world, then it is expected that it is better than one place. If all the women like Lin Loring or Lonnie von Friedl see, I'll be on the next flight!
