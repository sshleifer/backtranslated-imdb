Beginning in 1942, the character of Sheelkak Homes was portrayed by Belel Rathbone, then the 'modern' was founded in Britain. Many Homes purists praised the first two entries of the series (produced by Fox), but followed 12 features dismissed. I was not a warm reader for one, and thus I appreciate this movie since they are without any initial preference. Indeed, for this entry the World War II setting takes place as a fixed period with the British campaign throughout the film. The execution of the modern homestead is carried out more carefully than the previous entry (Sherlock Holmes and Terrorist Voice) and rents are better for two reasons. First of all, Roy William Neil was going to be direct (and for the rest of the series), and the second was holls pushed against the Nazis, as Professor Moriarty included it as much as the intellectual war between two opponents. . Lionel Attil's performance has been criticized by George Zucko and Henry Daniel as inferior, but I think it's more scripts than the character's interpretation. Especially it is seen that Atwill was much more diverse and enthusiastic among other horrific roles. Basil Rothbone, on the other hand, is unique in this entry. He seems to enjoy himself with the role of Homes, but for this, I will blame the writing. For example: The role of Homes in Voice of Terror works very hard to prove that the intelligent intelligent homes are on the screen, but this image shows Holc's bright deduction, but its shortcomings show. Even climax hollum initially has upper arm, then the blood goes out slowly from his body. Now there are some errors in this picture that I can remember. First opened; Germans are not fooling very easily? Maybe it's just me, but the bookmakers just say in the bar, they can not hide the door after a few weeks after hiding the table, but allow him to come inside and go for a walk with him? What !? Secondly, Tobel must have been in danger all around him. Genius left the secret part of the bomb with the scientists. Keep notes with her drunk. Like what he thinks? He was endangered to them all. I thought he was trying to save this great scientist England? And it's not 'the whole idea of ​​using them on them' before using it on us. Clear publicity Thirdly, will God's name be fitted under the chest? It's really small! Actually, the former curse does not really explain the complete execution of Homer in the search for Marriar. I saw this image fifty times better and still there are some parts that I found in a very confusing fashion. Fourth, all right, so Holles finds out that the first three scientists have died and immediately guess that Maria did not know the name of the fourth person because she did not die. Well if he did not know the name of Holes, how could he guess? People may very well be confronted in a lake. Lucky guess Fifth, again with confusion. When Hollus was thinking of going to die in Mary's operating table, how could he recover so fast? He is definitely acting as he lost some Pittas blood, but that day is not enough to save him. Now despite these flaws it is a very entertaining film. Incognito is well done, the mystery of the dancers is done well (especially Holcill and Marriar's backwards scenes are all out of their analysis) and Dennis Hoy is always a plus as Inspector Lestread. And as a final note, the ask is still still annoying to the scene, I always thought one of the best work sequences in the whole film. Overall, this film keeps a special place with me because it suddenly made my Rathbone as Homs's passion. A classic. 7/10
