After being lonely from loneliness, Lestat woke up from a 100-year-old new vocal song, wants to be part of it and the band "The Vimpere Lose" was born. With his loneliness and his music, his sympathy to end his "life in the light" attitude, his fellow thirsty anger and a slew of sleeping wounds for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This image is not for anyone who is looking for a true book-to-film adaptation. For those who hope to read the book and see it on the screen is for a huge disappointment. This picture will appeal to those who really enjoyed "Interview with Vampire". <br /> <br /> There are some plot holes and inconsistencies, but entirely, this movie was satisfactory. Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat with lack of previous films and sex. The pictures illustrated in the film were very sexy and sticky. <br /> <br /> As a movie, the story forces you and attracts you. Casting is excellent. Love this story and film. If you like tender sex and sexual excitement you like this picture!
