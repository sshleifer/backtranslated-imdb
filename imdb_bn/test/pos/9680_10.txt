To be a Russian myself, sometimes I find it difficult to get reference jokes about American TV personality or celebrity. Nevertheless, Family Guy is the most smart, funny and most politically incorrect show seen in the world. Voice acting sounds wonderful and sounds too clear for me, even for a non-English speaker. Animation is good, even very good for a TV show. Here's the equivalent of our adult swimming channel, but there's nothing compared to this gem. Even in Simpsons or the South Park Hope the creator will continue to entertain and entertain. Do not want to see the whole thing spiraling in intermediate entertainment.
