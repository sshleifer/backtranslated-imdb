You do not have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this image. For the first time when I saw, when I was 9 years old, I was a supporter of the TV show, and my parents laugh as much as I did. Since yesterday it has been done in the classic style of Baggy Bonnie Cartoon and considering today's fictional cartoons, I think that anyone would appreciate a cartoon movie that depends on "disappointment" after the blurry, some may get a smile.
