Note: I have tried to give away any important plot twists (or the end), but if you are concerned about that, read more Think of watching the film before - thank you! <br /> <br /> This was apparently a fairly high budget production, released by Paramount. Following the exploitation of the Highway-Man Jack Shepard (supposedly) in 1700 London. He is a divorced person who received blackmail in criminal life by overwhelming "chief-taker" to save his brother's life. After crossing the half-taker's double, we got the support of the general public by becoming the type of Robin Hood. He got away from running in several jails (including the infamous Newgate) as well as many advanced women "entertain". <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this picture, though this plot was somewhat anticipated. The film was shot in Glencreek and Wicklow in Ireland, and the set was done very well and seemed realistic. I think Clavell kept up the exciting atmosphere of London for most of 1700 and I enjoyed creative use of its camera corners. And, in contrast to many films depicted in this period, Claval did not bar us in such a tragedy that the poor lived (at one point several people got a meat that became dirty in the street). <br /> <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed this picture. I would admit that Claveville's next film, The Last Valley (an example of the Vietnam war) is a lack of strange scenery and intrinsic political speeches, but it still has two things to look for. It is unfortunate that it was never released from (my knowledge) video or DVD.
