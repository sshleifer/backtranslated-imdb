Family Guy will be my favorite cartoon forever. This is definitely the most fun TV show and better than Simpsons. I'm never so disappointed with a TV show in my life that the show makes it so funny. The plot, the character, and the themes that show up. There are a few themes that have not worked with the Guy Guy. <br /> <br /> I only made every episode of Family Garr and the show was good in the first two seasons. My favorite character is Peter because he is very funny and the best character in the show My second favorite character is Steve because he's one of the most funny villains on TV. Show up If you love Family Guy, you should find the American father because it's the same and made of Seth McFarlane. I hope this show will never end because it's a comic genius! 10/10
