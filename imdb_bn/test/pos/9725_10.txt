It is the best television series for children (and adults). John Hurt has played with many wonderful performances for many years, but he was born to play the story center. For almost every episode the tech's fantastic piece of script, and the passion of the productions, funny, sad, happy, exciting, and always being happy, the passion runs smoothly. It's hard to choose a great episode from many excellent competitors, but "Solar and Death", with its timeless stones, is impossible. It's a series to watch frequently with your children.
