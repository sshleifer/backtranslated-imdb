Can have spoilers !!! In no way, shape or form this movie breaks horror movie molds. Not by a long shot. However, it provides a weird atmosphere, credible characters, and trustworthy. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and does not bother to unwind itself more than its needs. In the early 1900s, a cluster of children died in a mining accident. Then, they were killed in the mountains by the city of their little fa city. <br /> <br /> Simple: They want to take revenge on people who die years and years ago. Naturally, its great, great, great grandson town and he has a real hole. <br /> <br /> With him, a mother and her two daughters inherited the old house after the husband's death. The eldest daughter is rebel, objectionable ... a common misery. Little curiosity, with bright eyes and with the children of ghosts. <br /> <br /> The most part of this spark is the hacking of victims of pretensions and victimization of children. Nice acting. It was so scary! I mean, Colonel Flickr's children are one thing ... but it's the top among them (such as for scary kids). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I bought it before I see it and I was not unhappy. But I have a horrible fan through and through.
