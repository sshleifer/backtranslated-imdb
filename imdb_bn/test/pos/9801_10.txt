It will always be the best movie (my opinion). When I saw it in 10 years (2000), it really taught me that we expect as soon as the freedom of a child goes away. Also Joseph Mazelko must be my favorite actor and I think Brother and Elias did a great job in the role of the brother of wood. This movie is quite sad, and some people do not understand the end. But the story is very unbelievable, it is terrible to torture parents of the parents of a 7-year-old father, who are sad and important about what these two boys do. My favorite part of the movie is that Tom Hans (Old Mike) lists seven things a child lost at an adult age. But there are some parts that can be done better in this movie, such as the Mother Shield (Loren Brac√≥), which I think is a horror actor. "King" played his role, because it plays a solid role. Joseph and Elijah were definitely the stars of the movie. I could not believe how much they loved the father's children, the age they were (7 and 9). But overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes great child actor and a great movie. :)
