For those who want documentary intentions, I will give you a small lesson to make American films. <br /> <br /> Documents are based on casting. Choose the characters you like and love to enhance the drama and entertainment of your pictures. <br /> <br /> After you shot a ton footage you combine it to create a movie with up and downs, bend points, climaxes, etc. If you have problems with existing footage, you pick some more shoots, find some stock footage, or be clever with your details. <br /> <br /> The allegations that filmmakers using footage are not part of the locality of the movie (beside the beautiful beaches Favalus beside the beautiful beaches) do not diminish as a dramatic piece of film, and the special image is not enough to imitate just enough to justify its true inherent involvement. Do it. At any rate, use the footage you can use. So they do not have police violence footage for that particular neighbor. Does it mean that it does not include and talk about it or maybe some cartoon animations so that the audience is not "fake"? Oh, no. <br /> <br /> Why do you end up? Yes, Americans made it Yes, Americans are hopeful bastards. But why end up a down note? Just set up in a foreign country and foreign movies and end up big on a big note? Foreigners represent unhappy views of life. <br /> <br /> Americans think we can have a happy ending in the future. May be just one.
