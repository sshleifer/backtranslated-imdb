It is an appliance drawing a soap opera on the idea of ​​ethics. A movie about human suffering and death is certainly not a good movie. I did not get any emotion from this, the ideas are not new, there is a lack of tension, it gets weary in the second half, but in the end I think it has become interesting in an intelligent way. I mean, you get more women than this junior, paralyzed lip folks who don Juan. For more than 28 years, the person who suffers from paralyzed completely, he has no problem (and perhaps he also hopes), people around him seem to be the perfect slaves. I can not get out of my mind, among many, Bergman's Chris and Whippers, among many such, that does not appear emotionally only and all human beings) etc. This film is a suitable recipe for housewives that looks for some mental adventure. But do not expect to fly away. This film is valuable to see all disciplines, which brings sincere intention to present today's modern moral problems without any desire to instill the audience. Amnabar does not rub your face and he is not favorable, he does not pretend to us for a specific concept. Yet this movie is so honorable why I have no source.
