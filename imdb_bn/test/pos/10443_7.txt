The film was released at the age of 15 and I could easily relate to the pictures of the pictures painted. <br /> <br /> It was 24 years ago and I have not seen the film since then. This time I almost cringed some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is. <br /> <br /> Life is not always fair and good guys do not always win. I think the movie has done well that pricks especially reflect as a teenager has always been good with many girls. Also, how you do not matter how well you can do to someone like you. Girls / boys like trying to do the other way they want to choose. Sometimes you will go and tell next. <br /> <br /> Gary shows the intensity of her feelings for a good job Karen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this performance can not be compared to the Fast Times at Redmount High, but it just throws the donkey in this movie because one of FTARH's Loom viewer is a friendly ending where this movie is realistic. Nice not ending !! Gary comes across as a link worthy enough to link cringe but we're all sensitive people who say this like this. We all know David, fun guys who make you laugh <br /> <br /> Here some people have died but eventually hello can happen in real life. There is more to do with some children, especially on how bad they behave at that age. I have experience that first hand. <br /> <br /> Great sound track too !! U2 "I'll Follow" - Is Jesus Old ??
