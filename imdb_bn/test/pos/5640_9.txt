This painting of the Philippines's ruthless Japanese forces is a complete tourless force of war. After World War II, it is an effective representation of the pacifist attitude of Japan. In this movie, Japanese soldiers are going to live for themselves in the Philippine forest. They face cancer of the coming hunger, and gradually lose the small humanity they leave. This film will be some of an understatement of frustration calls. Visitors are left with a sense of despair of losing value in modern warfare. The final scene is almost too nihilistic but the film is a worthy statement no-less. Highly recommended.
