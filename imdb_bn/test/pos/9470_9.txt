He wanted everything that I wanted and even more. I love the teen type "chick flick" films and I knew this one would be great !! 10 things that I hate about you (making my all the time) He's a man of the man, a very good comedy, very well written comedy, very funny, and I've seen a long time physical comedy. Perhaps I saw this year's most satisfying movie (except for the sunny pink Panthera). But Seas Man is actually an intellectual funny and most of the humor depends on this wonderful script, the mistake of identifying the style of "The Company's Company", and mixed messages, and cast. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star !! Even from the days of horrific camps (still awkwardly entertaining "The Amanda Show"), he has shown a brilliant talent for comedies, perhaps one of the most talented talented actors in it. His comedy, camouflage, and his style of diabolical dialect. Abhishek (where she was a star) rather cheerful and good "what a girl wants." Man gets hold of his hand, but the next girl is actually the next girl, it is shameful that she does not work in bigger screens because she can be the next "brick" girl, all American, intelligent, under the world, The bubbling grief (though he is now twenty years old)) and whether or not he will be able to carry his talent and style to be an adult actor. But he is perfect for this movie! Her two brothers are incognito and make it believable. Completely ... but credible enough. Most scripts try to be a man, depending on the joke of his mistake but it only laughs, non-stop laughing. Channing Tatam has revived himself from the dramatic drama of 2005's "Hackoch" plays. He jokes, the captain of the football team, and finally Bynes's fondness, unfortunately he is the roommate of Sebastian (who Benes.) He is a good leader and chemistry perfect among them. Laura Ramsey Olivia, who was attracted to Sebastian (who is Bens again). She did a good job though her part is small and she does not really affect one of the novels. James Kirk realizes his small role as real Sebastian is great. His equanimity with Amanda bises is wonderful ... they are absolutely trustworthy as a pair and many more, from a distance you can believe that Binness is a Sebastian. The rest of the cast is perfect anywhere and their roles are less supportive, but basically they all support the story of Bines and Tatum, but everyone supports Bain's awesome performance. He easily takes the film without any hesitation and makes it valuable. <br /> <br /> This is a film that shows many of the trailers and yet it is not a film that comes when it comes and is not funny. The parts of the trailer that make you laugh are more fun in real movies. Related film director Andy Ficman did such incredible work in this film. He weaves together a potentially complex storyline and naturally makes the flow and makes everything fall together. Shakespeare's 12th night's story could be translated into this modern day film. It's almost entirely off the wall but you'd think the classic comedy is more accurate. There is not much to say about farewell, but the last half hour can be reduced and predictable, but it does not change the joy of the first half of the film. Yet you laugh tears and it's right in the theater's most fun movies! 9/10
