Imagine you were on the plane for 18 hours. You have been a business trip to South Africa. You are a high paid professional. You have lived in the United States for 20 years. In your thirty, you have a boy a little boy and another child in a wife. One thing, though, you have a green card, you are still Egyptian. In the transit you will be asked to come with 2 security guards, the next thing you know is that you will be rewarded with additional empowerment, hooded and disciplined and after a brief (but still reasonable citizen) interrogation! This happened by Anwar el Ibrahimy at the beginning of the movie. The story of his pain and (literally) torture. It is one of the many story lines. One follows his wife's efforts to get more information. One return follows (cold) bureaucratic. Another story related to Anwar El Ebrahim's family of interrogation. There are some other stories and ultimately they all come together together Although Reese Witherspoon (as an overwhelmingly pregnant wife), Jack Gilenhal (like CIA Rookie forced to see interrogation in North Africa) and more famous actors like Merrill Strip (as CIA's Hotshot Corin Whitman), it is actually the story of the more unknown actor and the heart . For me, actress Miss El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwali) played the heart and soul of the film. Sadly, a man's screenplay happened very well. The real thing is that he is being tortured for coming! Israeli actor Iglal Naura was also very impressive, because the section worried about family members and the most cruel chief of torture. Look hard and just do not have fun, but still very suitable.
