(Very light spoilers; outline a basic plot, no real details) <br /> <br /> If you go to this movie with enough lower expectations. A few days ago in Maryland I saw this movie free screening, and the only reason I agreed to go ... because it was free. I hope a few chocolates, but I'm never a big fan of Tennessius D, but not much. <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of the movie is a sunny, as we have been given the soft Christian source of Jack Black in Midwest American town. The film later took us in the future, in the first half of the Tennesses D in the first session of Jeb and Kyle Gass. We saw band formation and the origin of its name. Eventually, according to the title, the second half of the film searches for their "The Peace of Destiny". Again, the beginning of the movie was a fun and funny, and most of the movies smiled on my face. That said, while it was felt a bit longer; It was just 100 minutes, but it still seems to be a little less. The story looks as weird, it is not a movie if it wants a great plot. That is fine, without the meaning that many wounds are too hurt or missed ... and when they miss, they feel bad. The same thing with the song; This is a musical, but the appeal of the first minute or so after the song has been lost ... then whatever has continued. <br /> <br /> I would say that the R-rating actually saved this movie from the bomb; D's humor can not easily work without cussing, sex, and drug references. But if you are not the actual fan of the band or know very little that you appreciate Comedy's style, then I would recommend you some money and rent. "Peak" you have to do a bit ... but it's worth 9? I do not think so. I was tempted to rate it 6, but since I think many people will enjoy enough to justify it in the theater, 7 seems more appropriate. Just confirm your style.
