After all, before I started my review, I read here every review for 'The Muppate Movie' and I can not believe that it can give negative reviews in a movie like this one. (Fortunately there was only one.) I mean, I understand how anyone can not like 'Star Wars' because of the entire psyche style, but do not like the movie to play some of the most beloved dolls in mankind's history. Almost sad <br /> <br /> All right, I will now close my subbox and review this movie. <br /> <br /> I came out of 'Muppate Movie' at the age of seven. All my friends wanted to see their birthday movie, so I think I saw it four times in the first month in the theater. <br /> <br /> A lot of things as a child have attracted me and all other pipe movies and TV shows. The singer was probably the main one. Most of the songs in 'Muppate Movie' are classic. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'm Going Out There", they are entertaining and thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I almost see 'Muppate Movie' light. Yes, something that makes me excited about it as a child, is still there, but it's a little tasty and they're just a little sunny. <br /> <br /> Meaning, when you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick person. <br /> <br /> Cammiet is a frog and it is a sweet pig that can wear butterfly gloves and cut into two pieces of the cart. Fozzie is a stand-up comedian beer. Gonzo is an 'whatever' that is infatuated with chickens. Then you have two elderly boys, hello, a piano player, a rock band with a smoker drummer, a Swedish chef which you can not understand, and other characters that are simply simple. However, for this reason and much more, Henson has given millions of children and adults the opportunity to entertain, which gave special attention to seeing and remembering him. <br /> <br /> 'Muppet Movie' will always be in my heart for many reasons, but I think this is a big movie because it is a movie, unlike many recent children's movies, I feel comfortable with kids' clock. Plus, I do not bother my mind with the jokes that my kids submerge below the level. <br /> <br /> It is a great movie that is sure to remember forever.
