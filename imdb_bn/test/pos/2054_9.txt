I have never heard of this movie until it only reaches the TV and I do not understand why. Gina surpassed Arnold as the action hero in this film! Gina is a former CIA assassin who has gone astray and introduced himself as a school teacher with a peaceful family living in a rural town. He continued living with her husband and daughter for 8 years. Obviously he starts coming to him that he can be someone else, especially when someone tries to kill him. It seems that his former employer has discovered that he had never died and he wanted to make sure. He recruited Samuel L. Jackson, a former police officer. Together they create a pair of entertaining entertainment such as Mel Jason and Danny Glover. When Geena finally got her memory back, she was once transformed into the holding machine, she was once with the song "Playing in the background". Guyana and Samuel will have to go after a bad boy and have to remain optimistic. Through the rest of the picture, Gina should decide who she really is. Killing machine unpleasant? Silently silently silently, silently silently, silently silently, silently silently, silently silently, silently silently, silently or both a combination of? In particular, bad boys hold Gena's daughter. Great action scenes up to rank with any of the Maya Hard Movies!
