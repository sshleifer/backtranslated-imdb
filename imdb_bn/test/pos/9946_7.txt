Four or five episodes of Johnny Saco and his Flying Robot were edited together. Funny giant robot kids are clearly battling the story of the target goal monster monsters. Like a professional wrestler, robots / giant wars will become violent and the kinds of things that can be found in Al Capone's St. Valentine's Day School and Gangster Training Academy are human beings on human disaster. I liked it, but then again I grew up in the series. If there is a problem, the diversity of the "men in benefits" effect is that the movie is running together like a sewing phase and every measure comes in 20 minutes. Recommended for those who have run Ultraman or Godzilla
