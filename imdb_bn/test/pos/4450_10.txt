I saw this movie five times and never got tired. This "gaelo" style has its features, but also with the setting of an unbroken Italian countryside, where ignorance and unsettling are more serious than a serial killer. With an extraordinary position (sometimes in Fellini, sometimes the Tavani brothers memorable), good characterization and best-paid actors (with an unforgettable role, including the extraordinary Thomas Million and Ida Lupino), it is not an euro-trash, it's just a wonderful composition that after generations The generation should be discovered (Recently, while praising a double feature of Luci√≥ Floris from Paris Cinemath, It was nsita)
