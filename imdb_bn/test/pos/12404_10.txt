I recently rented this video after watching the "Final Encouragement" by the same author. I was not ready for how intense this film was. I found it to be associated with starting from the beginning, and their attempt was rooting for teenagers away from crime. The ending was definitely boring with some specific violence, but it worked well. I highly recommend this picture
