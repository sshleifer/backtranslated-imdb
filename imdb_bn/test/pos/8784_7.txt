The first draft of the "North by Northwest", "Sabotur" has some nice Hitakovian moments (the best one in a table, when a woman asks a hero who does not yet see that he is wearing a handbag; Tried, he even put a knife on his floor!) But the weak elected leadership (he is giving patriotic lectures, Lane risila doing romance, jokes are made, or are trying to become worried, Robert Cummins wood), and the lack of truly independent villain (Oh, there is revolution, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough screen time).
