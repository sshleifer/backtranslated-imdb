I have always liked Muppets. Although most of the kids' entertainment was not desired, The Muppet had it. Muppet's very, very fun. They are probably the most desired children's letters. <br /> <br /> Only Muppets did not have their own programs. They acted in many movies. Christmas carroll from Mippet to The Muppet Treasure Island The Muppate movie of the first Muppate film was also as nice as the show and other movies. <br /> <br /> About how Muppette movie has started. Cinnamon lived a frog Kermit One day a film executive told him that audition for Hollywood frogs was there. So Kimmitt takes Hollywood! He is on the way to many people like Fazzy Beer, Gonzo the Great and Miss Piggy. Also, trying to capture a evil man Kermit. <br /> <br /> All the Muppate films are very enjoyable. I mean they all are very funny. There are many film appearances in this movie. Such as Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Eliot Gold, Carroll Kane, Richard Prior and Orson Wells. Mupp pet movies are all very enjoyable. I hear that Jason Segel is going to be one of the stars soon. I can not wait to see it.
