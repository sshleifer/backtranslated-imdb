After his previous movie "VideoDrome", which certainly shows the likelihood of this movie, director David Craneberg once again analyzed his virtual reality, of which true and fiction is mixed. This is a completely other virtual reality level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a very original movie which is well-directed and played, but very well written. The film contains a charm and good thoughts, which are widely executed by director David Craneberg. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Just when you think that you find things, another surprise is waiting around the corner. Never think things like how you feel, especially when searching the line between truth and fiction. You do not really know the reality and eventually the game-world key. It makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and it provides a great end to the movie that lets you think more. <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect type of play-drama story, most of which is characterized by its character and its puzzling facts. Before they can live in the world, they have to complete a certain step or task and find out what their purpose in the game is. <br /> <br /> The film knows how to maintain the perfect balance between reality and supernatural, sometimes without top-on-top ever. The story story keeps movies as easy as possible, but it is not easy to follow the film because of events, conversations, and unusual environments. <br /> <br /> The movie is not only strange. I was really surprised that "videodrome" has a high rating, it seems to be an irrelevant and weird movie. The movie still has to be amusement and has a good fast pace. It never lets the film stop its philosophical moment and deeper money. This makes it perfectly watchable for movies that do not usually look like movies. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good, subtle influential special effects are a great visual appearance, which also gives the film a certain "gaming" feeling. <br /> <br /> The film is well-thrown, the Law of the Jews plays a role that you do not often see in shameful situations. It once again shows how to act as an actor, versatile laws, and more beautiful than Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also a great female leadership. He never played a large part of the big productions, but with this film, he shows why he has always been considered as a big film star. The film also has minor roles such as some other famous actors, Ian Holmes and Willam Dafa. <br /> <br /> A very original movie that is good to watch, especially if you saw "videodrome" before <br /> <br /> 8/10
