"The Dispersed" (1943) is a real classic, not for the story (which is fairly regular), but for its technical production elements. It is a Landmark Western, the largest and most unique of all time during its release, because it is a lightweight studio with a light-weighted reputation as a Colombian product. A few years ago Fox's "Jesse James" (played by Randolph Scott) played this role to this genre. Although it will be accepted by "detector" and "high noon" within a few years, "The Deparperus" was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the Red Valley city sold Utah roundups and wild horses in the Union Army. Here the script has been narrowed with reference to the railroad reference (which was many years away in Utah's future) and the last stand of the cast (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania) but it is not an important plat element. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a decent Sheriff in the Red Valley, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several people are corrupt; Every time the government calls for their cows, they looted their bank. The city is a famous visitor to Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous friend, Steve. She wants to go straight away, especially after the fall for the pretty lavish stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Kiss). Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinea "Big Boy" Williams) is primarily for Comic Relief, such as Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and city judge (Raymond Wallburn, who modeled his character on Frank Morgan's "Wizard of Oz" crystal ball) Gambling). <br /> <br /> There is no possibility of their huge budget, Colombia has done this with several steps and each Western film element but with Indian and covered wagons. The best wild horse stamped is ever illustrated, a spectacular Baroum cat, an explosive measurement, romance, and three-strip technique. All these things are not necessarily fit together but who will take care of in 1943. Unity is a problem that both Western and a comedy try to do serious work. <br /> <br /> Cinemography was probably the best time during her filming. Indoor scenery is strong but it is indeed impressive outdoor photography which is impressive; Filming moving camera in both mathematical static shots and action sequences. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor were the top bills, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, who would soon be their biggest star. And director Charles W. D. used this film to show his new wife Kises ("Gone with the Wide" painter with more audience than any other section of history in the film). <br /> <br /> The most unique and important feature of Ford-Keys dynamic "The Deparperado" Rather than leaving Clive "Love Triangle" with Scott and / or Trevor (which it will appear first), the whole romantic focus is on two small actors. Probably probably got the best kisses and he did most of it. Both leather pants and dresses look great and fight like and fight like "night pirates of the Caribbean like" At this time there were revolutionaries and combined with the WAAC 1942 formation for the WWII military service. <br /> <br /> "The Disadorness" is a movie that is well-cared and printed seems like it's new. Unfortunately the DVD has no special features. <br /> <br /> Do you know again? I'm just a child.
