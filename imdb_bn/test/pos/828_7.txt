Van Damage films are gradually getting better and in particular C-grade flops are comparatively better with "Derailed" and "Second In Command". Shepherd: Border Patrol is a great step that is really some great action / war sequence. It is good to know that Van Dam still knows that there was no martial art of his last film "Death till"! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . "Death of Death" Most Van Dame was lacking in most of the movies, but dark and wonderful, and actor Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. Yet The Shepherd is definitely a film for fans of Van Dam or just for action movie fans, but if you are looking for a movie with some more story lines ... you can skip it <br /> <br /> I believe I believe that this film was well done, especially in a budget it was shot. My only real problem with this photo is title; "Shepherd"? I did not get it! I think it's not the same ring except the word "Shepherd" in front of "Border Patrol"! <br /> <br /> My rating for this movie is 7 out of 10, but by no other film division, Van Dame does not have the film quality. <br /> <br /> This is good for a Van Damme film.
