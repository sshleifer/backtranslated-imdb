Hello, Looking for a movie for a Friday night family? Can not find your search? I had this a very enjoyable movie. Good for the whole family. I saw it was an extraordinary rare combination, it was appealing to both adults and children alike. It's brilliant, at least say. Bruce Willis's performance was peak-free, it had a lot of humor and, overall, a great movie. In my opinion, it is a must see movie. And I do not think that about a lot of movies, when I say that it tells me to think a lot for a movie. It is clear that a lot of work has been done by Bruce Willis and this film has been cast. Excellent story, well played, and again, overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
