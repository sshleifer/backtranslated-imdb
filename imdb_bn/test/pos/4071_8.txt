If you've seen this movie trailer you know a lot about what you can expect, because what you see here is what you get. And if you look at the previews, it does not take long for you to do what you are going to do - especially, a good time and a lot of laughter - from this cute character of 'Reality TV'. The show and 'Body Cop' film directed by Tom Dey, 'Showtime,' Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />; But in one night, a case is working, the incident suddenly goes to the south when other police, Tray Sellers (Murphy), indiscriminately interferes, shows a television news crew and Mitch loses its cool, causing the department to pay some big money in the case of the television station. They might also be able to go around, thanks Chase Renzi (Ren√©e Rousseau) who works for the station and likes to see what Mitchyi is - enough to give an idea to her boss for a 'reality' police show, anyone else except Michael Preston will be shown No, who wants to be the real life of Chase, 'Wright Harry'. <br /> <br /> His boss likes this idea and gives green light to the light. Now, what he has to do is convincing to satisfy the match, which should not be very difficult, because if the station shows it, then it has agreed to exclude the case. But Mitch is not an actor, an actor and he does not want to do anything - until his master's heart is in the heart, Captain Winiship (Frankie Fiscone), who has briefed Mitch's future for a brief perspective And just like that is the show. Oh, yes, there's one more thing; For the show, Mitch needs a partner. And do you think they're coming for it? Let's write it like this: Tray Sellers are usually more than one of the suspects. <br /> <br /> The second picture as the director, his first Shanghai Nun, - a comedy - and he certainly shows a trend for the style. From the first frame he set a motion that keeps moving along the story, and he makes his stars their highest talents and personal strengths, with the most of their merciless time. Dyer certainly started with the stars like De Niro and Morphy, but he kept track of it, it showed that he knows what works, achieves the right mix of true trick and employs subtleties of action, and great influence dialogue. <br /> <br /> Business does not have more natural actors than Nero, and he goes on to the skin of Mitch's skin. After a few years of hard work, he cut the drama (after which he became another extraordinary performance), 'analyze it', 'Meet the parents' and now, he has firmly established his skills. Doing a comedy, as well as Mitch is not a particularly complex character; Actually, he is a common man, but there is a challenge for the actor - to make him trustworthy, to think of him as a person who can be your neighbor and be a member of other communities. And counting on all, De Niro succeeded. He is Mitch, the person you are going to a grocery store or bank, or 'Good morning' on your way to work; Who likes watching TV and living a life, just like you and me, who lives as a policeman The character of Michi is to create this movie, because it makes the 'ordinary people' angle credible in exceptional circumstances. This is a role - and work - it is often erroneously rejected, because it seems so easy; And, of course, it makes D'Nero so exceptional - it makes it easy and it does it with the convenience. <br /> <br /> As a tray cellar, Eddie Murphy turns out to be the winning performance, as well, and this is a role that fits him like a proverbial glove. Trey is a policeman, but an aspiring actor - and a bad actor - and it gives Morphy the opportunity to play in the extreme margin of his personality (Day did enough, however, to prevent him from climbing up the top of Jim Carey Region), which is Character and works perfectly for this photo. To take part in an ultra-timed vowel from his vowels, throwing him from a fishing boat - direct cameras while filming the direct 'Kalpana' event (as long as he is concerned) Murphy is a riot. And he has chemistry with De Niro, which is really clickable (which is not unexpected, because it is one of many responses to De Niro, the ability to connect with him, and the ability to extract the best among his co-stars, all of whom - the evidence to prove - with him After working, their coffee is good, like Merrill Strip, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, with just a few numbers). The most important thing is, it is a part that lets Morphy achieve the best, and she must make it the most. <br /> <br /> She also has made her role as Rosho Chess, who is not a protagonist of a character, but she is presented with a strong, credible performance. And William Shatner (played by yourself) apparently stole some of the show's directorials. <br /> <br /> Supporting Cast Diana De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Rodai (Camera Man). Well-made and distributed, 'shottime' was a comedy that was well understood: pure entertainment that provides lots of smiles and nice hours that will keep you chicling for some time. It's the movie's magic. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
