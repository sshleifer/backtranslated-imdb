I never heard of this movie while translating, so I did not know what I can expect. I got checked out at IMDB and weird. It does not seem to be a jewel long. Excellent performance, great story, and it's both well-directed and well written. It's hard to compare to other movies, but "stand by me" comes to mind, though it has many differences from "healing". Great story of young boys, plus dramatic and funny elements is the most obvious match between the film and "Stand by me". Still, "healing" is a fine film, it's a movie that is widely recognized. It's dramatic, but adventurous, sad, but funny. I can not think of anything that bothers me. Not saying, I do not want to give the idea that it is a "perfect film", whatever it may be, rather I enjoyed it, it was very simple by and it would not change anything. I will not go through the details of the story / plot, because partly it will be very common or very public and partly you can get that information elsewhere on the site. While closing, I can only say: Wonderful movie, if you get the chance see it.
