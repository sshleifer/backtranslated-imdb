I was actually the Black Snake Mawton, a great movie that was held in the south. This story follows a man named Lazarus, whose wife drowned him for his brother, and left Rai by the verdict and peat. Lazarus has found that Rai has been misused as a sexual rapist and child, so she agreed to decide on some issues by shaking Rai with a chain of remedies for her wickedness. Together with Samuel El Jackson and Christina Rixie chemistry, and their performance assures you that through their struggle and that Lazarus and Rai find the best way to be saved. I was surprised to see Sam's electric guitar or the ability to sing. Espath Mercensen is great for Lazar's love interest, Angela, who plays Justin Timberlake Rai's boyfriend Ronnie, who is sent to the film, but he can give good performance.
