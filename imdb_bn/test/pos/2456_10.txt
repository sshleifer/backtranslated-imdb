Esther, Martyn Shane and Kathy Betts are fantastic in the illustration of this Vietnam vet of the war, but still scared of it. Bates plays a strange mother who just wants to be the family "family". Sheen is such a horrible, who tries to understand what is going on through his father, but in reality his teachings are wrapped in his principles. Setting Thanksgiving Day and relatives coming for dinner. Estiv, who does not want any part of the family tradition, who plays back the pot, and insists on his fighting fatigue for dinner, said, "That's what I finished Thanksgiving." Bickering and family arguments are invaluable, especially "peanut fragile crisis," but the end is both gripping and terrifying. It will be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've never seen one of the best movies.
