I liked this photo for my husband - who works on radio broadcasts. I thought it would be more than a movie that he would enjoy and that would be related, even though it was eight hundred-so it was a small date. This movie really attracts you. Occasionally you want to mock the host, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some people to call real density camps. Sometimes I'm sorry for Barry because if you've gotten too big for her jeans then you know what I mean. It was the drama channel on the dual- so I'm thinking of this a true story. If you really love the drama you will love it, even if you do not know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business. If you're an Alec Beldwin fan and you see it to see him, then you do not have to. Its part is really a bit of a part of this movie.
