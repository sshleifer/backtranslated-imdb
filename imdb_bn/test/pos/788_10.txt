This is a wonderful comedy short - one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of stupid mistakes, Buster was wrong for a wanted killer. And, as a result, most of the movies are involved in the police and especially a detective group. Although I'm not the fan of film with most chasing scenes, this is the only top sportsman and acrobatic expertise. I saw something that got a flood stunt, but they were able to find a place that was not so low and was able to move away with amazing grace. In particular, in a scene where he goes on a table, people's shoulders and dives jump through the transmissions as humanly possible. Plus is so funny and perfectly timed, as if he actually believes that he really killed someone. However, this image is very similar to that of COPS, but it is basically good enough to see both with enough energy. <br /> <br /> This image is brilliant and only Keton's short that I might think that I probably liked even more in the Playhouse - where every role played in Buster theater.
