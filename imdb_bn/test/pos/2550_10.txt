Because I love movies, I really like the "chop shop" as "Central Dr. Brasil" ("Central Station", 1998). There is no sugar cover, this person's life can not be tried more beautiful or beautiful. You will get what you see, and that is often radioactive and repeatedly heartbreaking. But as the story unfolds in a nicely and careful manner, it is so surprising to create a movie like "chop shop". It is as good as a young brother and sister who often wants to get to work in a auto body repair shop in Queens (and living), who is often near homelessness. Is this a good or bad thing? This movie is basically posing the poses of the audience. This film is really an extraordinary place of life piece that looks like a documentary instead of drama, and it's a great thing, because it seems and looks so real. Meanwhile, a small gem is found by stumbling at many current films, "Chop Shop", based on superfluous and often unstable plots.
