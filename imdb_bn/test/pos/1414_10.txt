The intimate aspect of relationship between Hawking and Space / Time Arming. This film publishes Galilean and Newtonian laws and relates to Einstein's general relativity theory. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Interviewing with her family is a little longer so sadly her theories and ideas have less development. <br /> <br /> A Philip Glass soundtrack congratulates the film nicely. Only another person could compose such violent trace (Gene Mikele). <br /> <br /> Overall, I will recommend this movie on the basis of Hawking's 'Enlightenment' basis and on the basis of proper interpretation of an event Horizon!
