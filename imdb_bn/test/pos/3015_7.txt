I went straight to the big screen to see this kicker. This is the only flashing thing I know that Tarsem Singh has managed but the boy was very intense. This movie is almost heart-stirring and one of such special effects. <br /> <br /> The letter is vibrant and not small to your own mind or nightmares. This movie is scary and interesting and fully sensible bombs with fear and festivity. This movie compares something else which I see without a nicely odd level. In this case, it is a fairly big step on 'Clockwork Orange'. Surely watch this movie on the big screen and do not wait to tap out. It will not be half as good as tape. <br /> <br /> This film is not easily lazy. It will mess up with your mind and it will take some time to forget. But for those who want to be freaked ..... glad!
