The opener is open with a very close shot of bird's all-time watch, and thus one of the most bizarre and enjoyable features of Argentina (actually my second favorite, behind the deep red). Though inferred, occasionally, the movie is quite weird (murder, bird attack, burned garment, ending?), But it's Argentine's fantasy world and once you've contracted with him, you find that it works. I do not mean to cancel these flaws altogether, but the artwork of the film makes them more than that. For example, the above mentioned birds are completely top of the attack theory, yet see its wonderful execution; Flying crawls in chaos, driving squats to beat their driving rods, circulating, bird-eye view of the bird-work, and then crowded into the panic seen through the attack; Truly Aria of Terror A complete show in Argentine's amazing, flowing cinematography opera, and definitely one of the highlights of the film. I enjoyed the soundtracks of operatic themes and rock music, each effectively a wonderful contrast to the music (the rock meets the murders at perfect times and gives a lot of sense of humor to the scenes). Sound Effects are too much, Stubs, Scissors, Beaks and everything else. <br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "I've seen many of your movies. Yeah, you're really an expert on this Mao:" I think the film is a folly to use as a guide for reality, are not you the inspector? " /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "Depending on what you mean, depending on the reality." <br /> <br /> This is a ghazal, stylish killings are essential and Dario is frustrated. ("Bullet by the door" view is probably one of the greatest deaths, if you forgive the punishment) Black-gloved, deep voice, cooling of the poultry brain (cool shot!), Cold and brutal killer, and keeps our tape pin in our heroine eyes So that he was forced to kill him. + As for all that is, as a gaelo, there is not quite a mystery as well as the opera. Killer audiences  াছ থেকে গোপন রাখে তবে প্রকৃতপক্ষে খুনের সমাধান করার জন্য নিবেদিত চলচ্চিত্রে সামান্য প্রচেষ্টা নেই। এই, এবং অদ্ভুত শেষ, আরো কাজ ব্যবহার করতে পারে। যদিও এই সমস্যা সত্ত্বেও, অপেরা এখনও একটি উপযুক্ত এবং সন্তুষ্ট ভয়াবহ চলচ্চিত্র হিসাবে পরিচালিত হয়। One final note: It was nice to see a movie, once, show the right view through telescopes (only one circle is not two circles at all! Beautiful eyes, Dario for details!
