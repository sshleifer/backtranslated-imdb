Some people might think that the fantasy heroes have a film like "Egaby goes" but it's not. Fantastic heroes, the director allows us to feel the Trasis family and the people around them. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is awesome, and acting extremely well. Weaver and Hirosh's acting are credible and help to create the film. Actor, director / writer, Dan Harris has created a movie that many people have to see. It seems that this is not a teenage film, it's a family and a movie about their problem. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10 because I believe it is not the best movie, which can be a film, but it can get the closest it perfect.
