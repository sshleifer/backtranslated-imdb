"The Devil in the Dark" is William Shatner's favorite episode. This is one of my favorite mountains. The program is pure Star Trek because it is one of the main themes of the series: Respect for other life forms. I do not think there is a clear example of one of the most interesting ideas of the show. In this episode, Kirk and his crew have to face a monster who kills the miners of the remote planet. This story is an excuse for the discovery of humans which is an important part of the environment to destroy animals. Today's concerns for environmental reasons are more relevant than ever before. It is very well written and performed with gusto by our favorite cast. A memorable sequence involves Spock joining the monster mind. Tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem by using different methods) is added lots of fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimo do their best work here.
