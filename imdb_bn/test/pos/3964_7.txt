When the trailer came for the first adoption, many people started to get excited by this ... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went to Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, it is not acceptable to be a good film type to determine the type of film. This is a movie which meant that the crowd was happy with much effort. That said, for those of you who hope to have a great film, you need to think about what a comedy like this could be. Imagine, and you really enjoy the movie (because you will abandon your idea that the movie will be fantastic.) Button Line: Watch the movie and have fun, but do not look for a place.
