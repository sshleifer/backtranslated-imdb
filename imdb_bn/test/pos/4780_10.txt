This is the first cartoon with Mickey Mouse cartoon release and the sound of the first. In cartoons, Mickey does not wear gloves yet. She does not talk yet. She plays all the whistle and music. The song that he plays uses many farm animals as the "Tark in the Straw" musical instrument. For example, he plays a golf-like cowboy and snaps nursing piglets like an Accordion keyboard. I taped this cartoon on the Disney Channel and I think it's nice. It was based on a silent film starring "Steamboat Bill, Junior" title Buster Keton.
