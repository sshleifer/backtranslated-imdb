I was in direct movie. I saw other coen films, without the exception of Arizona raising, and I noticed that each of them has the color of the film. Fargo Gray / White, Leibsky bright orange, and this movie is yellow in yellow color. <br /> <br /> The bright beautiful features of this movie have started. Looks great soon, great music is as well. It is enjoyed by the words of old people, music that was written at a time when music is enjoyed as a part of daily life. Enjoyed by everyone, chain gangs, church choirs, even in prison escape. <br /> <br />, now flee to prison. I do not know what crime their criminals might possibly be potentially committed, they are very friendly groups. Cloney gorgeous, fully raises his role. <br /> <br /> Check this as soon as possible. I believe it can be enjoyed by someone at some level. For some reason, I was full of the old ladies of the theater and the old men, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You love it too, I promise. I was forced to get my hands on the soundtrack directly.
