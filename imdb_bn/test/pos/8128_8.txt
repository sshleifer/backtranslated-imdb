This recent british director director, Rose Troche, who has exploded with the budget-free story of NY Dykes, _Go Fish_ took a little bit of a look at this story from London and took a brief look. Male bonding society announces its desire to find a true colleague of men. Highlighting for me is a scene where the society tries to return from being a primitive hunter-gatherer, but orders to move away. The film is completely amazing, and Troch, who will never be accepted by some lesbians portrayed in his earlier film, _Go Fish_ likes the big budget involved in some wonderful linking pan shots opposite the cropped hyperkinesis. A really enjoyable film
