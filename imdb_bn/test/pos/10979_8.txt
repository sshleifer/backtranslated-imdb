Last night, knowing something about this movie (nothing else seems attractive and I had a buffalo connection in this movie - UB Grad). It was a very enjoyable movie. The choice of speed (it takes a slow start) and the story. Good writing plots and good character development and relationships. Highly recommend to anyone who likes to watch movies that are interesting stories. After saying something about this movie I found myself - most of the discussions do not last for more than a few minutes.
