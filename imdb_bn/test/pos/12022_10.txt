While commenting on this movie, it must be understood that it is based on a real story and must be reviewed for the quality and accuracy of the screenplay of the events and its entertainment value. It may be impossible to think that Jack Shepherd should surrender to Jack Wild twice because Wilde Holded the Base. Someone less, it happened. It must be aware that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he relied on explanations and tested techniques. At the same time, Clavell did not have the confidence to follow the script in writing. He would be good if the film is good. And yes, I had a copy of the script (a copy of Stanley Baker - one in five), which I recently returned to my father, Raffe Newhaus, author.
