I watched the anatomy many years ago - a friend dubbing at home, I do not remember it, and then I saw in the video store, the second one - actually did not create a little camio with the first Franko Ponte. And that one was not exactly as good as the first. I'm seeing the first night tonight - the collector did not dubbed the version. I really like German movies like this. It's very interesting and people like movies and sounds like I can exist, I know. But it is very impressive and frightening. Anatomy 2 is a little different and the letter is not as good at first. But if you really thought that Anatomy was interesting and good, you would see the second one.
