Leland Leland P. Following the story of Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), who was an unhappy teenager who apparently killed a deadly disabled colleague, the brother of the girl she is dating. Was the issue or did he? Leland accepts it, right ?? Rather, why? Interestingly, instead of a crime drama, Leland has become a character story, why are they testing it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the title character, Pearl (Don Chadell), who is a teacher of the teenager's corrective advantage and who thinks directly separate from Leland. We meet Leland's remote and arrogant father (Kevin Spacey with an extended camio) who does not feel emotionally enthusiastic about his son. But when we immerse myself in Pollard's, disabled child's family, the real taste is coming. Firstly, Leland's girlfriend Bucky (Zenna Malone), a drug addict who can not keep herself clean; Her sister Julie (Michelle Williams) is perhaps the most ordinary person in the film, who just wants to get away from it; And Alan Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with Pollard and Julie's boyfriend Finally, there is Ryan (Michael Welch), all of whom are called Gufal, who can not communicate and are less aware of the surroundings. <br /> <br /> Leland primarily focuses on its unnamed hero, but the movie is slowly? Occasionally very slowly ?? In every person's life, ask the main questions, why do people work? Leland discusses openly in a magazine, Pearl allows him to examine the idea of ​​good and bad and personal responsibilities, at any time in the movie, all the letters face moments where their own happiness or other basic choices should certainly be, perhaps the most fundamental choices a person can make . And what goes on in those choices and the movie gets a good focus on their results. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, you are just hit by Cast depth. Spacey For cheadle Gosling. Michelle Williams Even Chris Klein ?? These folks, who mostly promote any film, and make a titled seed that puts them all together. The film stall seems to be a place in the middle, along with sputtering it unfolds; It shows up for a while so that it is just asking questions and not providing any answers. But when we reached the extended stretch of the house and the film began to hit its stride and came together, then Leland became a quietly strong part of the making of the film. The interpretation of Lilland's earth and its activities, ultimately, brings every story to focus and closes the film's investment you've made. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is excellent. Sunny day is nice. Is it void in his career at this moment ?? It is one of the best young actors of today, and is happy to see a cartoon that can be an unfamiliar character in a sophisticated character. Gosling employs such subtlety here that it seems like little acting; He will face most of the film opposite Don Chadle, whom we know has his product, and he is not only the owner of himself, he also improved the play of Chadle. Chadle herself's top notch form, imbuing Pearl with a fully rounded humanity ?? For good and bad. Spacy is a kind of note, but it's a character, and he runs nicely. I was surprised by Chris Klein; With this level of acting, I thought he would be buried in a mix, but perhaps he probably gave up his career. Dreadful work around. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Leland is a humble, and again, it is draggy in the scars. But it ends firmly and has a lasting effect on the viewer (it, anyway, anyway). There is a fine commentary on racism in the film (the first day of the landlord is Juventi Hall in the class, the only white person in the room) that most movies are liked very effectively. Do not go so far as I call this essential watch ?? Could some find it very slow or too weird ?? But I think it was one of the best movies, which I saw several times, was much stronger and more satisfying than most rent there. I like to recommend it ?? With caveats above ?? If there is no other reason than gosling to see its craft perfect.
