I gave this shot an opportunity because of the Gelal White, not for the character of his Urkel, but mainly for Sonia's Hejehog Voice XI, however, as I said, I gave it a chance, and I liked it very much. I have never cared for the character of Urkel, so I'm happy to see Mr. White in the role other than the so annoying Nerad. And his Calvin J. Frieser (first known as Calvin, but the second episode arrived, everyone started calling him "J") was very entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was during dating. Cheerleader with ex cowboys snobby kid. ("Do not talk like" my mama! "" It has grown up, stay there! ") I had only one of the beef that the show had three main characters, but Mr. White's character was always the most attentive and the other two (Those who were married) were always behind stories ... it is not a good thing, when the story goes back to both the potential pregnant women. <br /> <br /> I hope this section Thanati may be a little too long. Unfortunately, it seems that more people were not interested in jalele hoyaite, isbarabhittika <br /> <br /> boring ass urakela known as the hope that they at least DVD .... box, it will leave the set.
