While touching the airplane episodes through flashbacks, this movie restores the historic flight of Linberber across the Atlantic. Stewart was about 20 years old to play young football, but in particular, the great performance of the solo flight cricketer made it a little soft. Wuxman's racing score is a big plus. Despite the long running time, WILD managed to make it very exciting, and knowing the results, it was able to maintain the drama. In 1957 what was for a year Wilder: as well as he "Afternoon in love" and "witness for the prosecution." And the next two were "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment." What a run!
