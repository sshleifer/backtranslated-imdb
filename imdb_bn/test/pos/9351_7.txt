** SPEAKER ** Actually a gay man was killed by GIA due to sexual violence, based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole". The movie "Crossfire" is about violent anti-Semitic GI, who takes it in Jewish persuasion because of its failure and frustration. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It looks like Montgomery Sammuelas has been a little shy because he is talking to his best friend and GI friend Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel is also going through, which is going to end the WWII war, about Nandartal Montgomery, a sensational artist who can not do G., outside the industry, an artist and painter, about war. As well as shiny peace, if it is with the dawn of atomic bombs, it is now following in this dangerous and troubled world. After doing more about Samuels, Montgomery can be really bothered, perhaps he is Jewish. More than that, the racist Montgomery Samuels has enough reason to want <br /> <br /> Samuels invites Mitchell to join him and his lady Mrs. Lewis in her apartment with Marlow Dyer. Drink couple and continue the very deep and stimulating conversations that they started in the bar. This is one, which seems to be very jealous and hurt by feelings and Montgomeri has undoubtedly rejected his casual but somewhat, Samuels's Montgomeri plans are friends and colleagues, GI Floyd Bouwers, Steve Brody, later that night, Samuels is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> It's already matched with the party, Mitchell and Miss Lewis have gone, two drunken GI have unknowingly destroyed the place. In the sick and anti-Semitic mind of Montgomery, Samuels stole Mitchell from him and whipped him in white hot humor. Montgomery and Bay owers sneaked into Samuel's home with Samuels 'close abusive behavior against Samuels' excessive pressure. Against Samuels's strong objections, Samuels is very expensive and refined to use wine and spirits which are very low under water and cheap guzzling Montgomery. All this quickly triggered a fierce and brutal attack by angry psychologist and drunken Montgomery on Samuels, with the bowers drowning on the sofa from all its vintage, who beats the lives of the poor and innocent people. <br /> <br /> The film "Crossfire" becomes long and tedious, because it was clear from the beginning of the Samurai's killer, why Samuels wounded and decorated WWII senior, who had purple hearts in the battle of Okinawa, was investigated. Acting as a murderer with Montgomery, he is really interested, yes sure, to find Samuels' killer, who really is himself Suspend this so-called volunteer step in the part of Montgomery so that he killed him. <br /> <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even a person who thinks himself silent, is fooled by his big yap open to becoming intelligent and anti-Semitic and racist suppressive against SemiWell's. Molestation! That only doubt itself and someone else doubts the doubts. I think that the guy can not help it. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that Montgomery killed Samuels, who was among his sick minds "their" one. He was afraid to kill his friend, even Samuels' murder, bower from fear of death! Who is "our" one in Montgomery racist description? Because he was afraid that the bauer would talk to the police to save his own sorrow and thus, in the death of Samuels, a spotlight would be required in Montgomi. <br /> <br /> In Captain Finley, Robert Young, intelligence detectives do not take long for detectives, see Montgomery's obvious lies and cheating and then they have set up another GI "friend". His lirry (William Phipps), who had his cats on all the stupid and racist mountains, proudly shook. This Montgomery is returning to the scene of his crime, where he killed the Bovers, where a trap was set up for him. Montgomeri needed all Captain Finlay, which was needed for frustration, when Montgomery saw that the zodiac was up and running it to run directly in the crossfire of the police attack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In 1947 a very difficult hit was released. "Crossfire" addressed the horror of anti-semitism at the time when it appears below and outside of the cover, in almost every post-WWII Hollywood movie about evil of racism in the United States and Europe. Even after the second world war and what happened to the Jews. When it was full and honest exposure, the film went to the public, it was so well-suited.
