If you were "there" and "done it" you absolutely love this movie. I and there "there" means the underground clubs and home teams where people are drunk, they are far more rare than people doing their ears higher than the extension, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> "I" will wait for another week after waiting for next weekend if I want to dance and sweat like eight hours of dance and sweat and even break-out, even if I want to sleep somewhere in the morning and almost die. . <br /> <br /> So this picture is now one of my most beloved, but I understand why some people, or even most people, will dislike it.
