It is certainly one of the best western films produced in the new millennium. It is revered by all the stars of the great TV Western classics and this is the ultimate resurgence of western film. After the war between the United States and the end of several aspects of the law, the story of two brothers is not new but interesting and shootout-out and the atmosphere is great. Some graphic violence such as bad guys are dead with corpse or chipped blood, and Lee's funeral does not take part in the action, so I gave 9 out of 10 points. But it's still one of the best new West productions I've seen. I enjoyed the joy and pleasure of meeting Chris McIneyay at the West Festival and had a nice contact with him, and I had the opportunity to meet Talk Taylor, who played the role of the doctor of the city. According to my opinion, for Chris McInterrey to act in a new western country, we must be forced to take a look at the classic TV Westerns and many stars around it. Chris also has an outstanding talent to choose the right actor for his main characters. Both young and promising, and I think we will see them more in the future Western production. I sincerely enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. I hope Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other western movies and offer us some great productions like this. Great work, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (pit)
