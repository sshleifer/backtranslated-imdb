Richard Conrad Canadian is wonderful, and should be shared with the world. For example, to start with "start" and unclear nominated "The Apprentice" and to stop the initial work, such as the digitally created "La Sula", Kandy is a reputable local hero. But no single piece of work puts the stumps like "Big Snot" in his career. And did I have it nominated for an Academy Award? Darn Totin '<br /> <br /> "Big snot", although apparently a date correspondent dating back to the 1980s (Short War-Esquire is rotating around nuclear ruins, but do not worry?) It is a hell of a hell), it Carries a larger connotation, such as most of the condoms work in a small way. When the planet covered by Armageddon is assembled, then a couple insists on one another's annoying habits (true candy fashion, when he shakes his eyes, the furniture is hacked?). And do not forget to see it repeatedly, 'cuz always have something to look at. The candy loads these infinite people with countless visual goggles and memorable catch-phrases. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage you to track down this weird piece of animation. In Canada it is usually seen on a national film board video that includes other Stella Shorts (with the same "Fun bit back" similar to fellow Winpeiger Cordell Barcar). Americans just have to dig a little deeper, but keep it ?? Reward hard price
