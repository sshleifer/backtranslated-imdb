Jenny plays a painful girl named Lewis Z. He smokes and drinks. She does not have many friends and she has a drunken mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Z shows herself growing up to her mother's boyfriend (Rob Estes), perhaps she is attracted to her. Of course, I will not tell you what happens next to you. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is blamed. I also did the best in TV movies in this movie. Beverly D'Angelo works really nice as a sweet and loving but neglected and blind mother. He could not see what was going on his own roof. Here's his best as Rob Estes sleazeball. Jenny Lewis standout. She looks like her character. <br /> <br /> Everyone likes this movie!
