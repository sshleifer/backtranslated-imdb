A young theater actress immediately took part in her first major part in a staged game as Lady Macbeth thanks to the Dave accident thanks to falling in front of an ongoing car. Due to the success of winning his feat, Betty (Christina Marsillac) is afraid of him instead of being responsible for terrorism on this deadly road. <br /> <br /> While her first-time director Lover Stevenow (William McNamara) was knocked out with a shiny knife, her uncle was tied with ropes in a huge palace with a rope, thanks to her eye-skipping tear-off her eyes If it shines, then its eyes closed. By allowing him to escape, Betty finds herself again in this unfortunate position, when a certain gold chain was found on her Lady Macbeth's clothing, which became crazy after being beaten by crooked crocodiles from her cage. Clothing clothing designer who was hit on the floor by the first iron, and later suddenly got knocked down by a pair of scissors. (To stop this painful scene, the chain has fallen into the neck of the murderer to open his neck, especially if the law does not elaborate, the camera uses the sharp words of the scales for the maximum impact of the cameras as the back of the predator's back ). Inspector Alan Santini (Bayrett relies on comforting some of his remaining friends), theater director Marco (Ian Charlesson, Ghandhi, and Charyes of Off), after the advent of Inspector Alan Santini, who is playing cold and soft at the request of Dario. Fire will die; A sad footnote, Dario revealed in an interview that Charles had told him at the end of the shoot of HIV positive) despite the rejection of critics, he tried the stage after successful horror film career, and Paul Mira (Daria Nicolody, former Dure's Swiss), her agent and confident. However, the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will certainly happen in the theater, because Marco has added an interesting change in production using the Set Crow. <br /> <br /> I think it's Dario at its most brutal and nihilistic times. Although he must have made terrible films (though his master of horror entry and SLEYPLESS would recommend), this film really has come to the east in pure violence towards psychopath victims. Betty's observation is that she admits Dario's fault about the kind of horror film the horror film wants to move away from. I looked at my eyes with my eyes and looked (.. brilliantly, Dario is touching from our point of view to a painful effect, as if we open his eyes with the screw-tapped needles). I like how Dario Betti will have wide eyes, he is scared to look after him, when there is no alternative to blood, he weeps in the blood lying in his eyes. Ronnie Taylor's photography job is ultimately indictable as a point-of-view shot of comedy in the theater, as it searches for the killers. Or, when the camera "travels" through the rooms of the theater, the killer wants to see his message from the box box. Or, in the sequence of dreams where one of our maternal deaths is taken to Betiar's memorial, the same masks and gloves, which is causing panic in the present. In my opinion, the highlight is the Pipfol bullet-fire sequence, which impresses everyone involved, the camera follows a bullet that falls in the eye of the victim, bursts behind its head, and plans to go through the telephone betie. Use the call for help. We even caught a murderer from the murderer's eye ribs. (To join this harmful scene, the crow is turning around the jaw, eyes are seen). Focusing attention by the film's heroine was not only my viewpoint, the "final" end that I personally felt was a little unnecessary, but I think Dario wanted to say that Betty is not exactly like her mother, a woman with sodomoscopic tendency, In a wrap, why the murderer tortures our heroine. The rock music used during violent scenes did not bother me, because I thought that those moments of evil graphic attack need a jingle bag that can often supply heavy metals.
