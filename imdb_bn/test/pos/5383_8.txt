In 1983, the Human Animation Company Bravastar was released by Humans graduate and film: The Masters of the Universe and Shera: Princess Power, respectively, 1983 and 87. The plot of the cartoon was martial Brackwester, a native American cowboy, whose inner strength, wolf's ear, speed of a train, and a windy eye, and his faithful side, thirty-thirty, who had a gun beside him, 'Sarah Jane' and Deputy Faj The judge provided protection from Tex Hex and his offenders band in New Texas with the help of Jeb. <br /> <br /> Futurist Texas, it is still today and so far, one of the few cartoons set up in a particular city in the United States, so in the south - thousands of light years ahead in the future. It was made in the 80's, the makers tried to revive the wild western face but did an impressive job to create from a scientific-based perspective. Bravestarr just did not sell morality and good verses, as well as teach children about the life of children, but it highlighted the theme of culture and community and we should not allow for things and life. And even though it was an action adventure cartoon, story lines, themes, and problems that deal with them make sense to children and adults by agreeing with them. In addition, Marshall Bravaster was one of the first major cartoon characters in the ethnic minority background to influence TV. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were amazing, the music was great, the theme songs were equally memorable and the animations were wonderful. Characters were well designed and had a variety of stories and taught children morality and what is right and what is the importance of the mistake. Something sad about today's cartoons can not be said, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He loved Hen-Man, more than I was able to detect realistic and contrast. For some reason, they pay more attention to people because, for example, the 'commitment' where a child dies from an extra dose of medicine, that there was no happy ending - it is important that the children in that sense see that episode, actually, that is actually If someone sees this episode, he will realize the devastating consequences of his own drug and anyone who will not evaluate the dangers of the drug. <br /> <br /> Bold, bold and sometimes thought-provoking, Bravestarr is definitely that brave, brave and excited thinking. For many years a ritual cartoon classic came, it dared to take some risks, but it was good and really closed up to the end. It will be remembered as one of the most attractive and best of the 80 cartoons of cartoon fans, and exactly so <br /> <br /> 8 and half of 10
