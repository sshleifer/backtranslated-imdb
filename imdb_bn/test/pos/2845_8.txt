Nurse Betty has a boring, unease-inducing plot-winning combination with that weird but remarkable character. Likewise, I hated Fargo at first sight, then realized that I was still thinking and enjoying it some time later, I saw nurses, betty, after a long time I saw it. Understanding is difficult, it is difficult to explain. Others said that it has become quite strong in many ways, but this seems to have made it so attractive. <br /> <br /> The great work of Morgan Freeman is Greg Kinnear's good work (though I'm worried that he's being stereotyped as Principal Villeneu). Chris Rock was not good but a standout. Ren J. It is so natural that it is ineligible - that is, inability to be "normal", the head is not good, no one is playing. In addition, Alison Janni liked the performance of "abrasive skin" in a small part. <br /> <br /> You do not expect as some "road movies" which you can guess from some sources. ("Road", but it is only very relevant.) Rate 8/10
