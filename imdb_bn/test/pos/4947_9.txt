Iron Eagle is always one of my favored films for my long time. It looks like Topganj but with a different plot and (many people with me will disagree with me here) in my view it is better than topgun. <br /> <br /> This movie has some amazing dog scenes when fighter jets are zoomed through the air. Its background is in "A Vision" background, which is a fantastic song in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the ferrous eagle was very good, but its continuity was garbage. <Br /> <br />
