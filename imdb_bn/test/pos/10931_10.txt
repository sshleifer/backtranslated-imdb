I just have to read what a film is believed by Irisman to be an analysis of this film. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a brief analysis of this picture that the four pregnancies are among the four serious sins, with four types of justice. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Justice, greed, pride, atrocities, anger, etc. and reward, distributor, blind, and divine justice. <br /> <br /> I can show three examples in each of three specimens; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
