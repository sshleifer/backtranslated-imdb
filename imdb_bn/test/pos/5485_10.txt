I am a big fan of big, high, loud, totally stupid action movies such as The Rock, Con Air etc. I'm very happy to see them, but when you think so much about it, it's very stupid. Fire Line tells a story and says it's good. Predictably, with tensions and mysteries, it also addresses many important moral questions that you really think of. The last shot of the movie is Eastwood and Rosho sitting together with the steps to show gentle, peaceful music on the feet of the White House and I feel a deep feeling of satisfaction. That's why I took care of the letters and I was happy for them that their stories came in a happy conclusion. It felt like a true story. As an adolescent secret service agent, he failed to protect JF on that lucky day of Dallas, Clint Eastwood was fantastic. She conveys her personal needs to brighten her paranoia and her opponent. On the other side of the spectrum, John Malkovich spoke openly about the plan to kill the current President by torturing Eastwood in 1963, who is a violent hunter. This Oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin. Throughout the film, talking to Melkovich Eastwood, they are friends. He does not threaten him, he does not lie with him, he does not laugh at him, but he is tortured with his helpless friendship till the last moment. As well as this thrilling main plot, Ren Rousseau, another charming love story involving another agent and Eastwood. Despite the age difference, there are excellent chemistry on their screen, and the manager does not wisely tend to dominate it, but it keeps it as a part of a nice working background. For the number, I love this image because it has a mind.
