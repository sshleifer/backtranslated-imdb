Sally and St Anne are a very funny movie. For the first time I said to my mother, I was 7 years old and I was for St Ann My Communist Center. My mother knew it, so she asked me to visit with this. I've seen it many times, because it's really fun. Andy Griffith was aunt Baiya from the show and Sally's grandfather played the Santa Claus in Mira's 34th Street. So, we have seen many actors in TV shows. There is a bad guy trying to steal the house, and Sally is trying to collect money with St Anne so that they can keep the house. There's a boxing match with Hugh O'Brien, who plays his older brother. This is a good and funny movie which I still love.
