Flatliners have quite a significant impression on my head. The story is fast paced and you are constantly absorbed and a lot of time quite exciting. Out of these five excellent doctors (especially Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon) doctor, among whom the dead (or flat-rewired) process has been created for a few seconds and then returning to life. <br /> <br> The procedure is very complicated 'associated with medical knee-knee injection, electric blanket, oxygen mask and various discriminatory substances. I firmly doubt that doctors have created these words so that they never need to be torn apart. But happily, they follow KISS (follow the original version for engineers: Keep it simple, fool) (see Extended version for doctors: this stupid, straightforward) philosophy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, he hopes to get the answer (and famously) through applied science. He left the flat line for almost two minutes and then returned to our world quite shaken. At the time of death, when he is a young man, in an event, he has a vision in which he left the most powerful impression on his life. He died accidentally by killing another boy, and he is still responsible for her. <br /> <br /> Following the success of the first flat-fishing, others follow their expanding flat-line <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . The second female camera-Ed to take the women to bed, watching television play her videos. The third had scared a young man who spread him into school. The fourth one is afraid of his suicide-deceased father, for which he thinks he is responsible. <br /> <br /> All of them are insane by this envy and obscenity and think that the past wants to take revenge on them. The main goal of flat-ray drinking is to keep your whole life in your death, at the 'dead' moment, at any stage and keeping your mind at the top left with the most powerful impressions of life. As they did not die, these strong impressions were somehow revived and their lives became distracted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Realizing the only way to do it, flat-raining again. During this flat-line session, he saw himself fluttering for the first time and tried to kill this boy, trying to kill him this time. The boy kills him for a few minutes at this moment and thus seeks revenge. For a few minutes of the movie he was surprised after coming back. Thankfully (because most of us have a happy ending) the boy has gone past him and he comes back to life again.
