Gary Cooper and a Marshall change identification, they both agree that Cooper will be more effective on extroverters. The extraordinary costume in this movie, Marshal and Steve Korpan are both bad guys. Coconut behind his guns, perhaps capable of crossroads. The movie begins with a showdown on the Wild Bill Hikoc with a sensational start. Ruth Roman, the very fairytale looking martial fiance. There is plenty of arrangement, there is no slow moment, but you have to pay attention, because the story is a bit complicated. Good entertainment
