Footpath is definitely not the average run of your Gillo Mill and it's not a bad thing. Contrary to his previous efforts, the fifth cord forsakes instead of almost all Giallo trademarks and murder of the film of Luigi Bazzoni (which was your 'classic' Giallo); Attention is very much in the psychological mystery. Before the film opened with a view on the moon, it is clear that it is going to be a completely different movie. The order of the Chancellor does not clear anything after being a problem woman with Elise's dream. Alice has been saddened to see the dream of an astronaut stuck in the moon, which is apparently from a scene in a film called 'Footprints on the moon'. After much mistake for him, Alice decided to leave most exiled former traveler Germa. After his arrival, the person he meets with is already telling him Alice is also a young red-headed girl who already seems to know him; Without nickoles and short hair, she thinks Elise is right, and it is all right that the footprints are not showing much by footprint, sex, murder and trademarks of other Galileo. From the very beginning, with its primary audience, most people going back to the movie are not getting what they are expecting (or, perhaps, wanted). But on the other hand, Footprint shows respect to the fact that it does not just follow from what happened earlier. By 1975, Gaylora's popularity rate had declined and most of the movies that came around this time (with a few notable exceptions) were just repeating what happened earlier, so Lugi Bazoni is taking a great chance in this movie. . Florida's main role in Balkan gives a strong performance; And that's not really the truth that he's not the prettiest Giallo's heroine. Build mysteries nicely, and it can be a little turgid from time to time; The footprint is usually intriguing for the duration, to speak. It will not come as such a surprise that once they reach there they do not understand anything and do not really clean them up; But it nicely adds a bizarre culture value to the film, and in all things; I pay footprints up to a thumb!
