Closed Land is not a happy movie. It is not connected to any social reality. This is probably his strength. Strengthens distance distances over time and the nation, makes it stronger, and during the burden of nationalism and publicity, you often express feelings in the film for criticizing the country against your own dispute (I'm basically speaking about the US campaign) some commercial movies). <br /> <br /> Bit closet land is much more than a message. It's a movie of pure, spiritual beauty, it's full of the same clean, clinical form, which you work in 1984 and it's the same. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Alan Ricman, with the golden limitations (and, I can add, the inconsistent sexual appeal ;-)). Outlaws between him and Madeleine Stove are fantastic. Every time I saw him, he could finally play a bad character ... <br /> <br /> But sweet sweet. Lack of film work. I do not want any crashing cars, but something like pure talk would happen. After an hour, I was really tired of interrogation, a much more complex approach than predictive actions and what I wanted, the world, the prior life of the letters, and all the other structures that were missing. A nice touch for some people. Anything less positive for me <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> For those who always love Evil Alan Rickman
