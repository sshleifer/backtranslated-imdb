Where do I start? Tell me - after watching the special feature in the whole movie and the DVD - my wife and I have seen the whole movie again with the managerial comments. I can not remember a movie for more than 7 minutes before commenting. It's audible <br /> <br /> I am not a South boy, but I spent some time near Memphis a few days ago, and have a feeling for the area. The smell of this picture is almost south, it's so real. My greatest actor of all time, is impressive as emotional cruel Lajja, and Christina Richie has described her career as Rai, who was seriously injured during her short life. I always liked Mrs Richie's work, but in this performance she gives herself 137% per second on her own screen. Prizes and small statues are not enough to reward her for what she gives to the film's audience. <br /> <br /> There are some places where you can read the story summary, so I am just commenting on the work. The name "Justin Timberlake" was heard earlier, "BSM", but he did not even know what he saw, even why he is famous, why is he famous? Stopping my head 60 year old, I say, at least out of his target population. After seeing this picture, I can recognize him. He can work! She gives a significant, credible performance as the county slut loving soulmate. <br /> <br /> The director shows respect for Memphis, and his home. She is a fine story Taylor. <br /> <br /> ..... and I must mention the music. I like blues, and a real festival for Black Snake Mauen's Soundtrack Blues fan. <br /> <br /> I am writing less than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is beyond my sentence structure. See this picture, and I mean now.
