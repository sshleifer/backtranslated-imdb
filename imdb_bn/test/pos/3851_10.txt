O my lord !! I love sooooooooooooooooooooo this movie too !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's incredible ... I love it as a watermelon babe and still love it as an adult. This is my favorite Disney movie allllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I saw a ton of it ... it's so ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone in a child or heart of a child. My favorite part is all the strings of songs and dance numbers and Thomas O'Malley. The author / producer / director completely nailed it ..... yes, the wall nailed. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
