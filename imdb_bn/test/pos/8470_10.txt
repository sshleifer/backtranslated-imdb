The very first talking picture came back from forgot, and now you can hear it and see it! In the autumn of 1894, in the Edison Lab Complex in West Orange, New Jersey, Thomas Edison's associate William Dixon attempted to combine two existing technologies (phonograph and kinetoscope) together to record words and images. Eventually, Dixon failed to synchronize sound and image playback, so this experimental film was not released to pay for viewers ... and as a result (Dixon does not have any official title against Edison for many silent films). Silent image (recorded at 40 FPS) has been in the Congress Library for several years, known to silent curiosity to film historians. It was also known that 'soundtrack' edition was recorded in one of the unrecognized wax cylinders in the National Historical Site ... even though no one knew it. <br /> <br /> But now it has changed. Recently, the ware cylinders of the carats are located, which broke pieces. These were re-added: a playback was received and the word was digitized. Hollywood's old soundtrack editor Walter March has cleared the background and tweeted digitization to narrow the film's image, which was contracted to 30 digital digital digitally by March. Sound and images are synchronized in the last! <br /> <br /> The image begins with voice calling offscreen: 'Are everyone ready?' Go ahead! ' (The Invisible Speaker remains unidentified, but perhaps Dickson's assistant Fred At.) On screen, Dixon, in addition to the camera's overall view, then a tipod (an Edison's sound recording device), two male lab assistants embrace each other for some fast Bollywood dancing in Dixon's music tempo Do it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Which is not saying, here's an alert: A well-known but highly misreadable reference book (The Silhouette Closet, by late Wei Rousseau) includes a frame measurement of this movie, and it marks it as 'The gay Brothers'. It's wrong. 'The gay brothers' is a completely different movie created by Edison Lab Dixon in the same period. 'The gay brothers' did not have a soundtrack: This is a brief short story of two brothers, which means 'Russian' means not 'gay'. Dead Mr. Rasso, for his own sake, wanted to feel Dickason's experimental sound film (logically the first movie musical!), As an array of 19th-century homeopark. (Hmmm, what about gay men and musical instruments?) Sorry, but there is no content here. <br /> <br /> Of this very important movie, there are 10 ratings out of 10. I have often maintained that it should be re-established until a 'lost' movie is deliberately destroyed: I am happy to report that this movie has finally been made available to viewers that its producer is more than a century after it was created!
