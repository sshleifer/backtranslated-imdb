Rendering in beautiful water colors, Cliff Ponio is a sight to watch clearly, oddly trailer remembered, I did not find the witch, I was amazed at how beautiful and detailed I was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Miyazaki builds both memorable imagery and is credible with their young people. A master is showing young people with confidence. <br /> <br /> Some parts that can not fit well with me. It would be impossible to think that the song "similar" is like the street of Wallkirians during a special scene, it is a shame because such a precious film can take the liberty and otherwise it will hit really great scenes. The opponents and the story behind him have never been interested in me, but I guess it served more as any other background. <br /> <br /> However, great movie. All I think stands in the boat trip scenario with its imagery and sea creatures. Pure and magical And yes, handrawn artwork is animated on the computer then it's more intimate, I'm really pumped for the princess and the Frog.
