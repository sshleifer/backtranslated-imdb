If you enjoy the development of drama, mystery and character, you can enjoy it and educate and educate you as well. <br /> <br /> The author knows their content and shows it. The direction is always compelling and does not blaze, and acting awesome. Why does not this program win any prize? Hollyard does not know about the "power" that is in the play or not something else. <br /> <br /> A plot twist of this episode was finally surprised and finally it was very well played. I was glad that this series is not used as a shock scene for any climatic end which was more general and dull. Rent this series once! Let's hope it will come back from extinction of celluloid.
