This movie was an excellent performance, was excellent guided and overall a wonderful story. I had to test the real life with a boy like 'radio'. In my town football program, we had a mentally challenged boy who has fun with the practice, travel, and football team each year. This movie is really true and I can identify 100% with it. A boy like 'radio' just needs to feel something they belong to; They need to feel like living value of their lives. How do I feel about radio and why this kind of program is set up in my high school. This is a very sensitive movie which I'm glad to bring to the big screen. My dad and I like it and I always remember this movie, which describes a story about the goodness and kindness of the people!
