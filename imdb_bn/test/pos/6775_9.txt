The miraculous art industry is alive and rich in the current Danish movie! Well, at least it's this movie. There is no joy in this movie. They are all bored or amazed, and if they are not yet, they will soon be! Screw it up, kill, embarrassment, dignity, and, ultimately, a story of love and release. The cold, weird ridiculous style is absurd and will not appeal to everyone, but personally I find it interesting mix of odd and peculiar right. You regret the characters from a distance, even you dislike them close and personal. But their stories are so tragic that you forgive them and be happy for them, even when they kill and leave. <br /> <br /> This is my judgment, of course the best Danish movie. In the last few years <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
