I've been waiting for the dead video for many years, most of my VHS copy has been cut off. One of the most beautiful films ever made for this holiday. It was held at the Epiphany (Twilight Night) festival and is a simple, spooky character of the characters participating in the dinner prepared by three Dublin women. The center of the story is a fairly lovable couple, a wife who died for one young man and wanted to feel the same emotion of his wife, but felt unable. All performance is stunning, and the script weaves into various characters in the beautiful dinner. Of course, its source material is a short story of James Joas of the same title, and most of his fiction has been kept completely intact. John Huston's long career as Hollywood's greatest film maker was a well-known creator with his film, which was written by his son Tony Houston. Star her daughter, Anjelica Huston; And his wife, Maricella is devoted. Thank you, Lions Gate, for the release of this movie and to be released from the DVD. Irish for all lovers or people looking for educated, fine, yet incredibly-running holiday films, this is a real gem.
