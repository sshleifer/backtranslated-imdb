Tim Burton is essentially an evolutionary film maker, discouraged in character levels and overwhelmed with gothic opportunities, choosing style on steady material throughout his career. However, with his style being so cruel, I can forgive many innumerable errors in many of his movies, and become mad in a million dollar industry film. <br /> <br> It is almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involved spirit in the second installment of the medieval franchise, especially when half of the 15-year-old boys target the audience by targeting those franchises. Batman returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring box office draws and sures (in fact, very expensive) thrills, sometimes being entertaining without involving his audience. As a result, Tim Burton must have been forced to administer the third schedule. Instead, Barton supplies something that can only be defined by the phrase 'out there'. <br /> <br /> Through a liberal opening ceremony, a high society couple threw busins ​​like prisoners having their new born deformed children. In a river, it is clear that Batman Returns is not a picnic in Buckingham Palace. After 30 years, the bad guy's business tycoon Max Shrek (terribly portrayed by Christopher Walken), the red triangle circus gang attack took place during political speech created by Gotham City. Batman (coming back to Michael Keton's role) his first appearance is to play a new logo, finally save the day. Shek is soon kidnapped by a circus gang and blackmail, which supports the child's political prospects, now fully grown, Penguin Man (Danny Davito secretly makes perfect make-up), only Batman suspects for his return. <BR> <br /> <br /> Shakek tried to stop his dirty and painful assistant Selina Kyle (who played Michael Pheliffer completely who was perfectly capable of more recognition for his performance), who is a sexy sexy and psychologically catwoman for revenge and harbor. Be transformed. , For some obscure reasons, a fatal distortion against the Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns silent The production design is exciting, it offers a cold hunting Gotham City with a more mysterious feeling than the predecessor. Danny Elfman's score is a great way to support the film, which is tragic from aggression. The sound and direction of the whole film is deeply leaked, a sad nightmare shot, justification of the direction of Barton, which is almost completely incompatible with a diabiliac screenplay and is also perfect for the visual style of film making at the same time. . And during the lively struggle for continuation of Burton's actions, real tension is in the direction of the fall of his main characters, the death of penguins, the mental condition of Catmum, and the fate of Bruce Wayne's lonely fate. <br /> <br /> The reaction of the critical and audience is mixed, when the brothers hate it. Finally, they wanted a Batman sequel, not a weird, somewhat horrible movie, in which a distorted psychotherapist orphan tried to kidnap and sink a child, always flip, which can only be described as green pigs. The production company sought an audience friendly character, for the propaganda of McDonald's for their happy food, not with a film of terrible unreasonable characters, pushing from a pregnant woman and a body of cats resurfaced with a sex secretary, his whistle over the ice cold cold fingers. Ignorance <br /> <br /> Extra disappointment is easy to understand after the release of Batman Returns. The film does not feel like a batman blockbuster. Barton actually knew that Batman was indeed a Batman or even if he took care of the character, he was taking care of his image, and the film neatly guided and guided the hunting industry, the singular character that was very consistent with the standards of society and the expectation. That is why Batton failed to make a great Batman movie. He did though; Create a nostalgic and stunning, sturdy piece of cinema that is my personal favorite and favorite of nostalgic. <br /> <br /> This may not be a great Batman movie. But it's a great team Burton film.
