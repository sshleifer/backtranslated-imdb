I have read many reviews about showtime on IMDB and many seem to miss this mark. I've mostly noticed this call to the ideal "friend" film in the reviewer. De Niro is not a friend of Murphy most of the time. In fact, part of the comedy's part, De Niro's unwillingness to be friends. <br /> <br /> Morphy is really like this. He has returned to work best, acting like a ham. He is a policeman who wants to be an actor and comes to the reality show. De Niro is stupid that perfect as perfect as perfect as perfect man. I had two great chemistry in them and had a perfect casting choice. Ren Rousseau is also a great producer of TV. Of course, he likes morphy stuff and tries to work very hard with the diner (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For training, how to act like a police, but my favorite scene is associated with the "confessional" Morphi is expected to get a Wesley snipes - like De Niro, instead of copper with the team. Comedy often depends on your personal taste, you can poke the hole in the plot, you can definitely make a comedy with me. I was on the bicycle to see the pair of Murphy and De Niro ... I think it has lifted the best in the morph, which is again its play It was nice to see him at the top, I can only imagine that it was a great honor to join the great D'Niro of Murphy. The 8 ratings.
