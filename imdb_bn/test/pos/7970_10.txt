This movie is similar to Death Warrant with John Cloud Van Damme, and similar to Jackie Chan's Island of Fire, and I have heard that there are other similar action movies, but this film has even better steps than death. Warrant or even the Island of Fire (that's right, Jackie Chan's movie). Very rarely there are such great action sequences in American Action Movies, although there were many negative reviews in this film, it easily eased most of the action films of the day, who were more successful. There were many martial arts scenes, David Bradley was quick as Bruce Lee in this film and what was even better, which was much more than the war scenes in most American martial arts films. Shooting out scenes were similar to those of John Wo, probably not good, but still very relieved. There were many impressive explosions and a great Chase scene. I saw some other David Bradley's movie, but this one, still the best in the performances. OK, there are some delicious moments in this movie, but there is no movie? The performance was good, Charles Napier was incredible and his character was real hard. Adam Clarke, who played Squid and Ughi Okamoto, was also a very good player. Other actors played very well, although this type of acting is not important in movies. If you want to watch the movie, the action film fan (I'm the fan of real action film, who really can appreciate good steps).
