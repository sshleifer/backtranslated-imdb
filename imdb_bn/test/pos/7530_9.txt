I just saw this picture, and I would have to surprise it. It is a good work, with the good performance of high school students in Japan and deep love of youth, in the love of teenager <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most powerful story seems to be itself, which is very fine. The relationship with the main theme and other characters is a bit complicated. But overall ideas of realism and levels still pull you away. <br /> <br /> Must be back in a major draw, those who like something simple. Which is not here. To get even more into the film, you have to keep things open, with a new culture. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed this image. It's worth watching.
