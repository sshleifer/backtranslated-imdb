I saw this at 99 and I remember loving it. However, on this day, I can remember the parts of the movie on my head, such as rotten patch. Unfortunately, since 99 - I can not remember this name till I see through my cousin's photo and I came across this (she played Clive Kaneer). After reading the description, I knew it. After grabbing, I wanted to know that it was not just released from the video or DVD but it was still repeated. It's a big shame, I'm begging you to repeat this fantastic TV movie at least ITV. Nick Hankak has shown in this movie that he can do more than host an event with his character Mike Toner. This is a movie that most football fans love and even those who are not interested in sports, they will be able to enjoy such a comic value. Yes it is a short review but it is nothing different from an underlying film, ITV, I and other fans of this movie are kindly requesting you to be able to repeat or be released from the video / DVD. Please consider one of them!
