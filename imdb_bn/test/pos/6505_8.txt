Scratch DJs and a documentary about scratching their art. From the storyline of the film, you will not understand how entertaining and educational this small film is. It is a cool and well known celebration of a cool subdivision which is a little known. It will fill with great underground hip hop music and you'll see some top DJs showing them stuff (eg DJ Q-Bart, DJ Shadow, and Mix Master Mike from Bike Boys). Going to the film I was not sure that "scratching" can actually be called an art form, or the turntable can be seen as a device on its own. Scratch completely changed my mind to these points. What these guys are really amazing with their turnips - it's certainly some sort of art - and turntable, if you know how to use it, it can be transformed into a tool that you can "play" a drum or a guitar. And you even get a lesson from scratching basics from DJ Q-Bert (eg how to use the Feder to get different word effects). After performing his song "Rock It" (the song that you think is not?), Inspired by Harry Hancock, these DJs are inspired to inspire the art of scraping their own, live in gammyes. Their attention is not Hankak, but its DJ and its scratching. Scratching is not just scratching, but it is a creative way to "scratch" some of its gratitude that the documentary is shot and edited. The moments in which the clips are "rewinded" fast and then "forwarded", what happens in the mirror (in the medium of film) when a DJ quickly proceeds to record his turntable and uses his father (the word "wik-wik-wika") ). Whether you are a fan of hip hop or you can rely on scratches for a very enjoyable night in the movie. After watching this, there was a cage on my own to buy a turntable. And I mean this as a compliment.
