SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's a recreational mess. Forget about plotting, mock lightweight and action sequences, though it's good-tempered, it's not exciting. But I smiled. Many Credit De Niro and Murphy inspired pairs are added. They have great chemistry. Murphy one-fishing supplier, De Niro, cracks us with a look or stain. This movie will receive a Russian hour reception like critics from. Do not listen to them. If you are a fan of De Niro or Marfi, you are going to enjoy this movie.
