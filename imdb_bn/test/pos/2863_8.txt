My taste in the movie made me amazed and probably displeased the reader of my reviews, but each one of them has a poor spot for me and a madman, Slashar Flix, and no recurrence is the same! I think the biggest mistake made by the film's producers and filmmakers is that they promote it as a WWE movie and "acting" cans. WWE may be a big follow but this is a very, very specific group that incredibly chessy and (sorry people) trailer park "sport" followed and who does not like it, the hat follows the IT !! This will clear them on the other side of the general poor slash flick that people will come to see the drove. No Evil will not break a new horror ground, it is actually played by some of the most common horror games with the leading, terrible bloody scenes to crawl your screen. Just because they really drive it home and go for unnecessary violence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He's the final cross between Leatherface, and Jason Voorhees. He is not a real killer and even killed his daughter for even unique or original force on his mobile phone for not forceing the main exception of killing a girl ... yes !! He does a good job and people are legally engrossed !! He stood 7 feet tall and no special effect was busy !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamy, Samanta Noble, Michael J. Pegan, Luke Paglar, Christina Wilhelm, Rachel Taylor all share the "unknowingly" partners who will be unknowingly caught by serial killers. The story is for the lesser crime of narcotics stolen for one month of their detention, they are sent to an old hotel so that it fixes to "community service". A serial killer lives on top of and he clears his victims eyes to clean them of their sins. Luke Pegallar stands as a scam bag, which eventually becomes a hero and also keeps his ex-girlfriend alive, whom he would beat. The rest of them all play well in their perspective role but it does not have a great stretch of acting ability. <br /> <br /> Sadly Director Director ... Yes PORN ... Gregory Dark, put together a modern day slasher flick together. He even goes along with the murderer to some parts of history and although his back story is not unique, but in fact it is a little small, it is still quite attractive enough. And there are few shots where actually watching the movie singer through a murderer's eye, it is interesting to hear the voice and distort things like that. She touches in mandatory soft-core nude shots, and is remarkable, blood-soaked scenes and everything turned into a groove. It fits nicely and makes it entertaining for a horror fan like myself. Karen's serial killer is horrible and he stalks them all down with brutal intelligence and a silent fear. The image is being panded and shaken and I do not blame anyone because it is very painful but is not it? It was a horror movie and I was right to just fix it. It jumped me, it turned me into crunching, even made me many parts ... affected by any value. This is an entertaining story, and if you want it up to 15 seconds until you set up a lot, do not show any evil! It is true that the picture is full of trickery, ridiculous detail but it is full of roads due to fierce fear and horror. Does it all come down to make you love horrible movies ?? Really love them If yes, then you think it's a terrific slasher ... unless ... you hate it ... easy and easy. 8.5 / 10
