This program is definitely my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia creates a very good program - I watch the TV (and I live in Australia) from most of the United States and England. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of this event is controversial. When they pretended to be Canadian diplomats, the APEC summit had exceeded many security barriers. This event is pre-protected stunt, general satirical discussions of current world events, and sometimes on-stage skits. All of these come together to make a fabulous, extremely funny TV show. Parts like "Add-Road-Test" and "Osama bin Laden's Message" are fun. Anyone interested in seeing the sunny satire TV comedy - then this course will show you the show. <br /> <br /> All the guys do a great job of entertaining you for great and half an hour. <br /> <br /> I hate it 10.
