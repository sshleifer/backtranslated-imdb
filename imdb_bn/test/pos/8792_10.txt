I just worship this picture! I love all the characters and I can see it again <br /> <br /> Again ... and I used to hear the subtext again. <br /> <br /> Although I saw about two of it a few years after it was created and I <br /> <br /> I'm never a young man as a jeep and company <br /> <br /> <br /> I understand their story and I like their story. And if someone thinks that this movie is the key, I disagree with it and I say it is <br /> <br /> is full of positive energy and friendship and love ... and young people! <br /> <br /> Landed on the weekend ... Enjoy it!
