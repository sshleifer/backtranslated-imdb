How nice! I hope better than that! The best animated Ast√©rix movie ever! And Roger Carroll likes to hear the voice of Asterix again! I certainly recommend it to those who prefer Asterrix's comic book! But I recommend you go see the French version, because it is certainly the best and you hear the original cast! Do you know that Roger Carroll has played for 40 years for Asterix? I think he did a great job! And ultimately the song from Celine Dion fits the good gathering of credits! The music is good, the drawing is good, the actor is wonderful ... a word: a wonderful composition! Go see it! You do not regret this!
