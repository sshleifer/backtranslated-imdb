The movie was very good. I was a weird mystery fan and I was going to kill those who are usually and those who were killed. Although I was shocked, I did not understand who I did not understand. I was not happy with the screenplay of the Garda character, but the year was taken for the movie, so it is possible that the woman was 'cloiding'. Please know that these pirot movies are good but their series is not as dynamic as they have japps, Miss Limon and not particularly Hastings! David Suchet is definitely poirot. I've seen all the actors who've played him. Peter Ustinov was the worst!
