Spoilers !!! In order to understand what actually happened, you must be a true war, be a warrior, analytically, critically, and not linear. Otherwise you will come to the false conclusion that Maj.Gray was a fool or a troubled person. The truth is completely different. He was strong and strong and the only way to be killed by Captain O'Mallley is that he wanted to kill him. It was his way. She select it. She was not the people who did not retire. If you are not in a first line, you can not understand it. He deliberately prepared his own suicide. At first he wanted to deliberately provoke Mary Jane in a more intelligent way than a mobile phone - to stop the incident in front of witnesses (after following her trial, after following her to protect her), she can definitely load her gun from bullets giving her boy) , Came at night, loaded his gun, woke him, put guns in his hand He said that when he fired for the first time, he fired and played "one shot" and shot him dead again. After the first shot, he stopped knifting to try to take him back. He gave a message with his last tears. "After the first kill, everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life, I am the only way to die for human beings, but it is my choice of killing anyone who loves me and not my only special, war and army." As far as you have thought, Finally grow up and do not save your life ". He left the military life at the end. She understood him. And he does not die in vain. The Judge who helped him to trial and later to prepare for the trial and the result of that trial, Colonel Sam Doran was supported by Team Messi. Messi did not know what actually happened and what the outcome would be, but he did what he wanted to do. He gave the picture of Marin Zen and Major Gray, who gave the order to the order of Colonel Sham Douran, because Major Gray told him. After leaving the army (Colonel Daryan asked him what to do), instead of the prosecutor in the execution of the massacre, he accused of killing him (he knew that he would not be found pure). Colonel Darn also suppresses the suppression of debate and debate to prevent the suspected suspect of premiered assassination, but it gives a huge impact on jury to reveal it during trial. I have no doubt about the outcome of that trial. Why did Colonel Darnen do this? Because he did something Maj.Gray asked him to do. Why? Because he saved his life in a battleground. Mary Jane Why go to trial? Because he was a person who kept integrity, a principle. And therefore Major Gray likes him. It should be worth someone, someone honored. He also gave evidence of his secret to his secret about what happened that night. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
