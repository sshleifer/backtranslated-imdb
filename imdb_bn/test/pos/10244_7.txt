I guess the people who previously had a somewhat unilateral relationship were their main character, Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman who is still a pink of health, demonstrated by her daily, morning sleep routinely, Megamilla bottles, like a bag in the house of the house, will be used to watch the clock, to empty the empty bottles, and to be satisfied. We have to do the payment and issue issue. And to achieve customer satisfaction, there should always be a delivery stop at the top to scale the long flight scale. <br /> <br /> And great enough, this stop is a man supplying stops with whom he has often been in love with his teenage adults, and he does not appreciate the product, but he has shrunk it. Going to the same school we can see that they are not talking to each other, and they seem to be very physically close to their daily lives, but still far away. No eyes communicate, save for cursor glances by chance, and a little recognition of the existence of each other. We have learned that they have shared such a past which probably destroyed all the ideas of being together, where the obvious attraction between them was prevented from further improvement by the previous generation. <br /> <br /> Though I think Minco was a funny woman in her own mind, who has kept her feeling so long, nobody can think of any kind of harm to it. If I read that the original Japanese title means "you read books in a while" and that's right, I think the movie ended with a wonderful shot in the stock of its well-stocked books, probably not all of it, and perhaps to deal with the pain of being alone. He went back to his favorite method, and returned a lifestyle that he had been accustomed to for 50 years. As well as submerge themselves in two jobs, they work as a form of escape for books and occasionally make some sweet commentary on the song's dedication groups on the radio. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka has mentally commended the work, a strong woman resigns from her fate and decides to love anyone else, her love object, Takshanashi (Itko Kishib) was more interesting, which was a more interesting character. Because of the promise of marriage, he spent a considerable amount of screen while looking after the ill-fated wife (acting by Akiko Nishina), Jagannath took the job of social welfare in the children's affairs of the City Hall. I felt that as a childless couple, the job was not only for her own but also to provide care for other people's children, those who are neglected and left to save for themselves. At a rare moment of anger, we see how he knows the wrong parents, who do not realize the life of their children and do not waste them. <br /> <br /> The story of KG Aki offers a little trick to appeal to her characters. Despite being a member of the Hiku Club successfully, Takshashi supports supporting letters of how frustrated Poet Poet and the old Minagawa couple, where some goddess Mashao (Koichi Uyida) is made, though at a tragic moment, she turns to Senele, when the wife describes Toshiko (Misko Watnabe) and 50 At the age of one year the single woman brings us from this love story. Even acting akiko nisina as a painful wife and even her character was nothing to be arrested. Her husband's intelligent illumination of the past, and taking ill selfish, and painful decisions in his illness. <br /> <br /> You can expect from Japanese romantic movies, seduce lovers as the Nubail star star, but with romantic set-up, love songs and other other elements of the place as captivating restrained but loving behavior. I thought the story did not fall in love, when the dramatic love ended, but director Akira Ogata was inspired to clear the usual composer moments in such stories, although the story calls for the development of some plain plots in the final act. Which you can predict, especially if you've already gone before your Romance Movie 101. <br /> <br /> Not your average romantic story, I thought Milkvuman told a powerful story with unfamiliar love as a central theme. , And obviously a proposed romance movie (though called at a measurement speed) if you want to live without some extraordinary love, emotions and suffering.
