I try to capture this movie every time I show up on television, which is mostly happy. But I keep forgetting the video. Because, I really know the script by heart, but it does not prevent me from crying well, but it probably adds more that I'm crying to know what's happening next. This is a lovely movie - well made, well cast, good photography I love it One of my top ten films.
