I saw this last night and it's an "8" vote. Since then, it is grown on me and I want to give it a "9". <br /> <br /> The middle of the first and second half (in the first) faces a seemingly little connection. The first half is a little indication of the ragged truth of a comedy and era, life, war, religious intolerance that will be revealed in the second half. At first it may be a bit annoying because it is a sequence of a little unfamiliar story, it works on reflection. <br /> <br /> The performance was good (the hallus, interpreter, especially great, in the role of Alex). I mostly scanned "user comments" and saw that some people reading the book are satisfied with the movie, though there is nothing. Both feelings are, of course, legitimate. <br /> <br /> For me, a retired family therapist and a trusted believer, the film was relevant at two different levels. <br /> <br /> First, as a history, a strong reminder of how many constant rituals can happen - with demonizing and smrim, anyone tries to eradicate different moral values ​​from our own system. <br /> <br /> The second is in the first display, each of us publishes something common for our family - we all have to go back to our roots and understand ourselves more fully. <br /> <br /> TS Eliot expressed his nicely in these four "quadrilateral" when he said: - "We will not stop the search. // The end of all our inquiries // Where we begin, reach / / // for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan has started a perfect journey that one of us can find fantastic illumination - to discover and discover our roots; How those people were going, who they were - really! - Before, when, and early in our age before and after our birth? So the first film gives us the impression of a comedy, then sends us the history and the human deficiency, but all that gives it to us very much - a message about each of themselves. We will all be rewarded for a lot of time to go back and understand the place we started from.
