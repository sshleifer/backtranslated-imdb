Here, to fix something in a previous review, I do not believe that this movie is used only to know London, it is used to make a public statement very specific. Jack Rocenthel says in an article in the script published that it has become a character that acquires some self-knowledge by continuing this abusive knowledge test. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of the most perfectly written plays I've seen: Technically it is very interesting by addressing very complex details but also happy how it is involved with you. Initially you do not know much more than the main characters of this London Knowledge Exam, but until it's very important to you, you scop up properly with them. You become proud on those characters who are successful, and you are crushed for those who do not. Especially, whose fall, whatever you do without anything, your hand will fly towards your face. <br /> <br /> Also the character of Nigel Hatharon, Mr. Burgess is called Vampire, not Dracula. You do not need to know it, I'm not saying this very important, but it's a measure of the drama: Once you have seen it, you want everyone and you will publish the Gospel to every detail of it. <br /> <br /> I hope you can see it. <br /> <br /> William
