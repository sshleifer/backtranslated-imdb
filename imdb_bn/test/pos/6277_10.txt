From Frank, perhaps the best version of my book, as a sound movie version of Jazz Singh. The 1927 version is actually a silent film, despite being made like the first boxer. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is an outstanding comedian and he is very good lyrics. She does not have Jewish stuff with feelings. Pegie Lee is great and any of his films are always entertaining. Alan Joselin is not very entertaining and we could have done it in addition to him. One question: Since Cantor lives in such luxurious homes ???
