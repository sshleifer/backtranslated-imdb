I liked this movie, it was tricky and funny! Loren Holly was amazing, she is funny and her role is very credible. Costas Mandylan was very good, very nice to see !! Brenda Vaccaro, had to watch as usual, she did a great job with her character. Interesting, interesting and full family was happy to see a movie that could be seen by it. It's hard to find a nice nice movie now. Best wishes for the movie Hallmark, they are wonderful! If I can buy it, if someone knows where I can buy this movie, please tell me !! I bought several Hollywood films and were very happy with them. I hope I can buy this one !!
