In the IMDB there are discussions about the greatest director ever (Spielberg, Coppola and others). The greatest reason was that Spielberg was around and he was not a great director. Spielberg's problem is that he was a master technician, most of his films lacked depth. Rayyan is really outstanding from the technical side, but his message is soft and it's very entertaining, it does not make you think about anything. The best movie I ever saw was because of a deep philosophical viewpoint on many topics, starting from a general war, conflict of civilization, the situation of war soldiers (a soldier's hero or a murderer. Brando says he is not, but the French lady says that he is both .. .) And many others. The problem of some people is that they try to debate whether these points are true or false. But a great movie, and generally a great piece should spark the arguments, do not solve them ... Perhaps Coppola is right, or perhaps he is not, someone really holds it. You can see this movie for its outdoor looks, amazing scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be fully satisfied. But in reality this film makes an excellent writing an internal quality. You can not compare with the latest Fahrenheit documentary. Both Copolla and Moore deal with the same issues, but while Coppola presents topics from outside, motivated perspective, Moore takes a very favorable position, which is indeed a documentary compromising the whole point ... It is a shame that Fahrenheit's 9/11 Won an honored award like a movie case. But anyway, if you want to start to lose some of the war in Vietnam, the Iraq War, the Second World War and in general a war, you must of course see this movie, the other is not ...
