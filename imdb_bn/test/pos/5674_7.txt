"Black Water" is a movie that surprised me, and of course my real expectation exceeded. "Black Water" is really a very well structured, unpredictable, well-directed, well-directed, and well-obscured movie. The plot is actually somewhat original, and definitely you will keep the plot with it. The way I like about this movie is the direction, because basically it has exceeded my real expectations. My original expectation of "Black Water" was that it was a miserably created, played, directed, portrayed and annoying movie. It was not really that. Acting is nothing to be praised because sometimes I felt that they did not show enough emotions, and there are some lines that seem to be script-only. But I love the side because all its shots seem predictable, but not so. When it looks like the camera gets a gradual shot of water, and it goes perfectly, you are like attacking the croak. However, Croke's attacks were very unpredictable (which was bad for me, which does not handle such films in a big way), and it jumps on you. Plus I just love that it's one of the horror movies that suddenly do not depend on the big sound explosion that can make you jump, rather than the actual movie. I like the story about people stuck in this tree, it seems very real and of course keep your eyes on the screen. I want to say that I do not think the opening 20 minutes did not work well, and I think they made the boat less bulky than real life. Plus I did not really like how to try their absolute best for the situation to feel totally disappointed when they were not there. Also again I do not think some character action is realistic. For example, I would not go anywhere near the water, he knew it was a crocodile, let alone the killer. But these problems were not really big and I was still able to enjoy the film. As far as the movie continues, I look better, but as far as the horror of the animal attack (which I feel easily) is better than that one. And it sure is not perfect, but that does not mean it is not a shot price.
