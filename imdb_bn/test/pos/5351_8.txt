This was very good, I mention two specifications except that. Animation is awesome, highlighted by Nick Park and the impressive tooth and face of the characters in the company's trademark, which lets you almost laugh at almost anyone. The color was too great, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the animated movies where there is so much to see and hear each frame that many goggles will be needed to hold all the gags. It's just a funny exaggerated look at the strange "Wallace" and its silent-and-smart dog "Groome". Alongside the road, some of the funny people who move away with their vegetable gardens, are something similar to those, which are portrayed in the "best show" of the wonderful dog lovers. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was two common features of today's films, animated or not: 1 - Let's look at Claric as stupid in the film; 2 - Let's overdo the final action scene with forecasting results but the way overdone On the other hand, it is still a very interesting movie that can enjoy a movie to enjoy many people and enjoy many times.
