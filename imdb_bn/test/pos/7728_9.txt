There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and some of their past comments are shown. It is an open content analysis of a movie as a free entertainment and therefore can not be compared with opera, books or other Carmen films. It just stood for myself and I must say that this man is very good at it. This is one of the wrong reasons to compare films to the industry's autonomous creative work. Vicente Aranda is a master of the atmosphere, and art direction, clothing and photography put together to make a very pleasurable aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the movie's general Spanish clinic. Well, historically this movie has been studied very well and you can see the results of that serious work of each scene. It is not an exact figure of knife and espadrile "black spain" which is so clearly illustrated in Goa, but that part of history is also seen by a foreigner fascinated by the local side of that society. Sincerely, anyone who does not want to see a cliche about Spain, does not have to buy a ticket to see a carman, but in those cases the clich√©s are presented before they become united and their way of viewing can be the escape of our own ancestors. <br /> <br /> Another important requirement to understand this movie is to speak the language. It's not acceptable to criticize the performance of an actor for understanding his line. If the rest of the audiences did, then the problem might be somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immortal fiction with his Andalusian accent and he understands all and is credible. His Argentine partner, Leonardo Sara Bagalia, found a strong portrait of the Basque officer who became a "bandolero" and learned very well for his pronunciation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Paz Vega feels "awesome" that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We were already a critic of Spain's most prestigious papers, without explicitly specifying that they were used to suggest us to create homophobic photos. And it was not entirely fair for everyone else, especially for those people that were not written with his physiological parts that many readers did not have to take care of. I'm not suggesting that the critics were the same inspiration at all, but we had to expect to see as a gifted and beautiful actress almost as expected of them as one of them, because we got that. Pazz Wyge E.S. Carmen, and Vicente Arand, have a nice movie.
