All I have to say is that this movie is a bomb. You're going to cry when you see this. I mean, this is a reminder for everyone, how difficult and easy to fall in love This reminds you of the days of your youth when you are discouraged and are bad for you, which is washed by a single kiss. Although I am still a young man, how am I living my life? When I am with that particular person, then I am sad that everything is removed. So, I give this movie a 10 for her hearty message and touching plot. Actor Josh Hernett and Chris Clean give me a 10 for having a nice face.
