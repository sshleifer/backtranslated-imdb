On June 22, 1941, the German city of Poland was divided between Germany and Russia. When the German attacked the city, the Nazis sent the Jews to a veto. Younger Catholic Fussia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), her young sister alone, lodging and hiding many Jews in her house Attic for two and a half years until the end of the war. Another good story of human sympathy in World War II is "hidden silence". This movie looks like "Rescuers: Brave Stories" and it's also based on a true story. Unfortunately, actress Kelly Martin performs a strong and powerful lead character, but she is very weak for such role. In many dramatic circumstances, its facial expression is not believable. I noticed that many IMDB users liked its performance, but I'm not sure whether they like its amazing character or its performance. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Octalas Medo" ("Fear hidden")
