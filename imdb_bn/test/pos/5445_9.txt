I totally disagree with other opinions! I have seen this picture at the very beginning and it is quite enjoyable. Robin Williams top form. True, the voice is familiar, but it's Williams of Good Morning Vietnam: smart, funny, at the point. After much darkening, Williams finally did his best job. Supportive performers give great performance, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself as normal, but he is delighted every time on the screen as the next president "agent". Louis Black is basically playing itself, but he is used surprisingly here. There is a fun turn by Jeff Goldblum. What the movie trailer recommended, more than The movie is funny, but it is not a pure comedy recommended. It has a thriller line that everyone should consider seriously, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
