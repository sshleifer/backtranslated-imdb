It is an excellent part of the making of films, most of them theme themes and occasionally becoming hot in these martes and poets bohemian, bombardment of London airspace in spontaneous war years, and external peace of the Welsh coastal retreat - friendship, love and love, outline of art, and dedication to art Experienced worries versus real anxiety, jealousy, per Bandbita, cowardice and pride, valor and self-sacrifice, and so much more. A mature, fine script that recommends and occasionally brings dramatic focus, the underlying tensions serve by the proper performance. (In addition to the strange smile of the Care Nightly trend, probably from this side, although other characters often refer to it). But with all the subtle visual additions of each moment, along with the innovative and elegant use of the point, camera angle and discussion, along with the point-of-the-mind home movie footage, is a surprise and delight to see. It is neatly beautiful to see as Bartluchi, but the relationships here are more believable and some more compelling than master's work. In these days, a very rare movie - it gets attention and stops emotions without leaving artistic honesty and not feeling overwhelmed with simple, short shortcuts.
