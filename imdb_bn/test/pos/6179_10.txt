I absolutely love this movie Great, realistic fight footage for a thing and a touching, real story looking realistic. Franta, the protagonist of the quiet character, makes him very friendly. The human relationships of the story seem to be more common and possible than what they could expect during the war. The relationship between Fran√ßa and Carroll can be for the comrades of loyalty to each other, and it is often described in books and interviews with the older ones. Subtitles are not cut off from the story and actually help check pilots get under RAF problems. The postwar story is a great reminder that, especially in the occupied countries of Russia, the suffering of WW2 did not end in 1945. Cinematography was very good. I wish I could meet it on the big screen.
