I watched this film with my family on a long Thanksgiving weekend weekend. I am grateful that anyone insisted on it, even though I did not pay too much attention to the end of the film, when it seems to cover the head, but does not get frustrated. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I saw this movie a few years later and liked its lively, irrationality, dazzling, and just general fun. I think that the film has a female tone. Although I am certain that anyone thinks of the film as pure exploitation, women are not absorbed in it. I think the movie has played with time. <br /> <br /> I think someone should rebuild it. And the meat out of something original.
