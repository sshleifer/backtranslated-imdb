Momma has got it, now it's fun to be released. A genuinely playful comedy, it does not make it very difficult to choose and is better for it, memorable smiles from loud lines. Even small letters have been well-written and well-played, such as Billy Crystal's best friend's girlfriend and a beautiful show of Rob Reiner as an agent of Crystal. A little bit insane and a lot of fun.
