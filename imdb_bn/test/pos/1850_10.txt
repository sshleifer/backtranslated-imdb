I saw this photo with my mother, and I like it! It was a sweet story, (Can not mention funny due to supporting cast!) They never make such a movie ...! My favorite part is when Grace (Minnie driver) finds out about the death of her boyfriend's wife, and has a heart on her dead wife, and she shouted, "What is God thinking?" I believe everybody (you do not believe in anything) have some thoughts. But it is very sad, but it can trust you for real love and for the sake of one. (Sigh) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ > <br /> <br /> <br /> Especially the previously mentioned scene, this is terrible, and yet so funny!). They are a good pair, and I hope to see some soon again. 10/10 star
