* Could be spoilers * No doubt the best drama is one of the best I have ever seen. An alien or just a crazy bug prot? This question will ask you throughout the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacy is simply amazing, as Jeff Bridges You never do such humorous plus some humorous times. Some of Kevin Spice's work in this film is very interesting. For example, when he was on top of the tree, for example, and when he was talking to the mentally ill "queen", he hid his face around the wall and just saw it. <br /> <br /> <br />, you will be hooked right from the beginning, and if you really love the drama, you will not be dissapointed. <br /> <br /> is a solid 85%.
