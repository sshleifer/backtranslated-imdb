This forty-minute movie introduces us to the character of the Butcher, later the feature of the Seal Conte Toss will be examined more thoroughly. In this film, it followed his early life since 1965-1979, but he concentrated in the late seventeenth century. The first pictures are the victims of the horse, then the birth of the children, the daughter of the Butcher, we see increasingly every year. Butcher (played by Philip Nahon in both films) is the people of the world. He hates a lot of things. When a man attacks his autistic girl, his anger comes from the head. Then the slaughter blames the wrong person, and finds himself in prison. <br /> <br /> This picture follows the life of the Butcher after being released from prison, then the Seaul Contra Tas goes away. I have seen movies wrongly, Seul Conte Toss first. If you can try this first film and see.
