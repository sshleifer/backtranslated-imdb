Animation is still a little rouge style of first-time Simpsons Roasting On A Open Fire, but already this first regular episode has more "layered", faster, and more characteristic features with Bert the Genius. This episode has firmly established Bart's "Slacker" personality, and Lisa has established the intellectual superiority of the whole family more neutral. Although the main theme of the whole episode is this (there is a nice secondary theme of the relationship between Bart and Homer's father / son), the first one is given briefly because this episode opens with Simpsons Scrabble. Lisa brings "id" for her word - short, but you need to be well-educated to know something. She has to read the definition of the rest of her family from the dictionary, which is working as a way to encourage sofa. Merging can only come with "he". Homer already has "oxidized" sitting on his tray, but it does not recognize that it is a word, so he instead represents "work". Birt comes with "KWYJibo", which he insists on a word. Similarly, on the main plot line of this episode, Bart picks his IQ exam, which leads him to enter a special school full of gifted children. We know that it will not last long. <br /> <br /> "Simpsons" has always played a lot of fun with the intellectual skills of people through his character, and more importantly, they are able to fit the degree of intellectual ability (or not) in such a manner (or No) and is felt in society. In this context, starting from the place of Bert, Lisa, Homer and Merga, this episode has already honed the kind of natives and singers outside of the Simpsons family and started to have fun. Through the dialogue of the students in special schools, as well as those with visible references, this episode also shows that "The Simpson" is not going to pull any panchayat through writing or conversation. Down his audience. It can be just a cartoon, but it's a cartoon that intelligentsis, gaiques and nerds are trying to understand more than anyone else. And that, aside from it's a very funny show, the show's longevity is key.
