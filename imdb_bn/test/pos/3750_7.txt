I think these pictures are old. It's a cool, cool, atmospheric horror picture that goes to a Scottish castle, only discovering that something stunning is happening in the night. And unknown events happened in Hollywood's most known hedge mood. Yes, this feature has been seen in every feature-length movie that is sometimes associated with a sharp puzzle, and "The Shining". But the fifth part of this story is about the last thing you can guess. I certainly do not see it coming. The film is a great example of how good and convincing it is, when the premiere is completely lupi, ridiculous borders. I would recommend it to anyone.
