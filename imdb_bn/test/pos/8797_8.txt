This image has an impressive soundtrack and fantastic soundtrack from some fantastic faces. I especially like West Ducklands as a bad boy character who works very hard like American rappers. The zodiac and quip, they come across as the best companion as true in real life. I have enjoyed some of this movie and you will first say that these people are not acting (especially talking with zip and crap and coking). Danny Dyer is fantastic as a free prescription dealer and has the most fun line in the movie ... <br /> <br /> "When I feel my bump song, I'm happy, you got me! I knew you would not give me up , I knew !!! "
