There was a "sleeping" to make sure !! I'm a lot better than thinking! I could never understand that it was a blurred blurred ... and this fantastic, whispering voice was named, Whin Diesel. Otherwise adding spices and intricacies for unnecessary movies ??? The giants of this movie were quite unusual, there was not the same miracle as the mug-up-up types! The last was very good, even for the change, "bad guys were bad" !!! I have 2 thumbs up !!!
