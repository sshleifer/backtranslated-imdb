This is a movie that will leave you, is not he? Although many complain about the confused end, give viewers a place to think and interpret from its symptoms. This is my explanation and theory, and I believe it's the very words. <br /> <br /> First, plots here. One day, Prote (Kevin Specey) suddenly appeared in the middle of a busy train station. After trying to help a woman from the Mughals, he was arrested and sent to Belwho and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) hospital. He came to the K-Pack planet and came here to report on earth. Naturally, he is classified as a lone and locked in a lower security level ward. She convinces them with the friendships of other patients and their story quickly. In fact, he told them that he could go back with a person with him. Soon Dr. Powell started to question the protests of the protests and due to the progress of the plot, it is difficult to prove it difficult and difficult. Finally, Dr. Powell learned that Proton Robert Porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico, when his wife and daughter were killed. Protest claims that he plans to move to a specific time on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the murder of K-pack. The time comes and goes, and Powell finds a catatonic state proto or Robert. One of the patients is missing and is not available again. <br /> <br /> To my theory: Prote is not crazy. The protests came from KPack. A friend of Robert Port Prote. In one of the prototypes of the Earth's Eastern Tour, Robert was taught about the constellation from his father. Prote and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family, and Robert Killer, Robert decided to commit suicide. The protocol is K-pack at that time, but to stop Robert, he (the light multiplier) goes back. So the protest takes Robert's thinking, to talk about his body. After a while, Prote (still living with Robert's body) comes to New York and becomes locked. When K-Pax leaves on July 27th he takes the base with him, but he must leave behind Robert's body. So, now we have Cattolic Robert. <br /> <br /> Explanation or formula: <br /> <br /> Knowledge of the planets around proteins: As the proto says, a child knows about their own system. Only a few people in the world were relieved of this system, and Prote added their knowledge. When Robert Porter knew the smart and his tomb, he was no existential. <br /> <br /> Dr. Powell has been elected to the Prit: It is true. The printery can leave the institute at any time, but did not like it too much. Dr. The last words of Powell's proto are: "Now you've found Robert, take care of him." Perhaps he was there to confirm Robert's place there. <br /> <br /> Super Human Embolism: It is a proven fact that there was considerable sensitivity in the field of sunlight and even the UV rays could see. Protons supply their normal K-pack, but there is no reason in the world. It has been mentioned that the proto was given very high levels of medication without any effect. Patients Assistance: During the film you see prototypes to help other patients (or patients discussing advice to patients) in a good intelligent world. With the help of the proto-psychological talk, Dr. Powell discusses the new life of this disease at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Sprinclair Scan: Springer is associated with Porter's house in New Mexico. Which is ridiculous to Roswell). Porter attached to his family's death? Is he trying to save Powell's daughter from the terrible fate? I have a different point. It seems that Porter had committed suicide in the river. Indeed, Prototype (under hypnosis) is very concerned about Robert. I believe that the Protector is not a danger or a catch with water. She is trying to protect her daughter from death like Robert. <br /> <br /> Hepunosys: Dr. Powell believes that he can reveal the true identity of the protagonist under the honor, but when the prototype gives lots of information, his talent releases the person and demands K-pack's birthplace. <br /> <br /> Security camera: Why the camera will release without any apparent reason? <br /> <br /> Harmful Dispenses: At first, the protests disappeared for a few days in the northern answer. Funny, patients are not at all dangers. In fact, they tried to assure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the workers. Naturally, the maximum diameter of the ball, the winning essay of the essay contest. He did not disappear at the same time, but only the remaining residual letter was his winner's composition. <br /> <br /> This is my low theory. You can finish what you want. You are Powell's theory can be accepted that the protest was a personality only by Robert Portt, mentally accepting himself to protect himself from reality, but it would leave many plot holes.
