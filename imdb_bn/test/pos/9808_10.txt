Even people who hate the movie, because they have found the last confusion, must congratulate the strong performance of Allyas Wood and Joseph Magellar who played two young Lead in this film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler wiring: literally language level, the last no sense makes sense. Those who think that the ending is divided among those who give some other level ideas: 1) Think that the father of the younger brother was killed, one time Mike (big boy) had been dealt with in the neighborhood gang, or flew out of the situation through death The wish of his garden to get the spot and 2) Those who think that the younger brother is fantastic and flying machine is in his wagon. Nta his humiliating flight, depending on the circumstances. <br /> <br /> I favor 2). It makes a lot of terms in many ways to deal with insulting situations in children. It is not unusual for the abusive child to divide his mentality and to project the soul of abuse; A stuff animal, even a mythical friend. In this way, it makes a lot of sense that the little boy is always tortured and never mike. In reality, both brothers are totally unlikely to abuse them, though they happen. Also, it is Bobby, the younger brother who is passionate, he insists that they can overcome the situation. Also, due to the misuse of real life, death became extremely disconnected in its history in order to become such a fiction in its history.
