Personally, I do not like many B / W movies, but there are some magic about this movie. <br /> <br /> The image starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwick). "Lease" he wrote a magazine column about Connecticut's 'Martha Stewart'. Of course, he is lying. This became a problem when its publisher, Mr. Yardy, requested the Navy Sailor to host Christmas on Christmas. In addition, Mr. Yardy, who is going to be alone for Christmas, invite yourself to the farm for the Christmas party. From there, things just go crazy. <br /> <br /> As the film is set in New England's firm, the film has a warm holiday feeling. Plus, the characters are lovely. Mr. Yardy is always shouting, and Felix, Lease's friend, is always shouting 'Katstraf'! When things go wrong. Finally, the movie ends until the end of the Christmas movie; A ridiculous laugh laughs to the people and "What a Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.
