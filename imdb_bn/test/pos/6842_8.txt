After so long hearing about this, came across this film. This is an extravagant atheist movie for those who love silent movies and movies. No "camp" but ridiculous <br /> <br /> Great cast! From the Great Karla Gagino and Emma Thompson to the German superstar Til Shoigar, this film is a festival for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as the gang's opponent. Take a look at the movie spin with this character and ema Thompson all the time and their arguments (many tracy and hapburn, etc.) <br /> <br /> <br /> Intelligent story, excellent twist And Opportunity Photography (Dawn <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> Check to believe!) <br /> <br /> ********
