This is a great movie. As a courtroom drama, it is compulsory as a complaint to the American judicial system, it is horrific. The consequences of this system for Brennan Butler may be devastating. This movie highlights the fundamental flaws in the legal process, not about crime or innocence, but rather about good presentation in court. Indeed, the effects of this case are likely to convict a innocent person, or the possibility of a guilty person being freed. Every citizen has the right to judge, whether criminal or victim. But do they get it? The film is well-liked, different and I saw one of the best courtroom documentaries.
