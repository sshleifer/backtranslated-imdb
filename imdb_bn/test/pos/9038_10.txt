This image is set, illustrated and Miss Premiere of Oxford. Wow Folknare's Book of 1948 Extra most were locals. I went to Oxford, and it has changed greatly. Will Geer features as Sheriff in this photo; She was later blacklisted. It was the writer and actor of the social drama, such as the film and the Grap Off of Rath, which was the goal of HEHC a few years later. After the TV series Centeniyal (1978), I do not think the acting actor is playing the role of young Malisan's son (Claude Zarun Jr.), but he was a great actor in this previous movie. And do not miss Elizabeth Patterson, who later played in Little Women.
