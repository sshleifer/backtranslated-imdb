These pictures have no big explosion or expensive chasing sequence. However, this is really amazing performance and an exceptional script that puts my "indie-course view list" at the top. Taylor Nicholas and James Rimmer are cool together. Young actors surprised me with really consistent acting. Generally, indie images have some poor links, but there is no weak link here. Impressive Get this one
