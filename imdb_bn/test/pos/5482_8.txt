Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) Michael Leary (John Malalkovich), is attacked by a bomb terrorist, literally believes that he will not be caught. In the opening ceremony, the current serial killer of all, "John Crumer" (Tobin Bell). Can be able to arrest Frank Mendoza (Bell) through clever plans and effects. Since <br /> <br /> it follows the cat and mouse. Malkovic is an extraordinary actor and incredibly versatile. Once again, he gave me a different role in this film, and he surprised me with the ability to exchange his characters with the next film. <br /> <br /> I see Mancovitch as a marshing smart cyrus at Con Air. Chicken-challenged rabbit boyfriend Lenny as the mouse and men for some naming. He plays a very intelligent bomb attack terrorist, but he thinks he can enjoy his captures. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is not my special one. He has been too old to do a lot of work in the film, so he can really surprise you with the ability to create his dramatic scenes. <br /> <br /> Ren Rousseau plays Eastwood's love interest in the film and he supports her to play a bigger role than Eastwood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This may seem like an action blockbuster but it reads slowly and hopes. You have to wait for the build up and finish and it will stop at the end. Along the way, you will be gentle with the illusion of Malcolm and Eastwood chemistry and cats and mouse scenes.
