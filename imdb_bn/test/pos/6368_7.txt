I am surprised that more than 80 comedy scores are only 5.2 out of the IMDB voters. Dan Acrooyd, taking a great opportunity to steal the deal from his prison doctor, is a conservative who turns his usual satirical walk. He is notorious on radio television. Return to California to begin his work by claiming Lawrence Bayward. The only person who knows that he is a guilty person, he is a drunken priest (Walter Mantau) who has leaked him with the newly acquired wealth of the Acquired. Charles Grodin threw down the performance of very good support. For his style, I think this film is worthy of the same credibility as 'Feris Buller' or 'Trading place'. 7.5 / 10
