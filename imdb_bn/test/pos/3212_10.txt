I saw this show from the beginning, and I'm 45 years old. To me, this is a ceremony that appeals to women. This is a family story, perhaps an unusual one, but a family is not low. It is located around a mother and daughter, Lorelie and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and successful women on their own path. Lorelei's legendary star Hollow, City, is a small town in New England with a sense of history, and populations of populations that can be unusual, but also serves as an inauspicious family. Shaw Lorley and his parents, Richard and Emilie Gilmour threw away the old money from Dar Espace's Lolkelyn LÃ¶kelel's preferences, even though Lorlie did not take care. The relationship makes this show through stories and lines, in my opinion the best of the WB network (soon to be CW). See this show!
