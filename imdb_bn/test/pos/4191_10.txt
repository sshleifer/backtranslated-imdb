The masterpieces are all aware that these are the imagery characters of the movie, and what they do or say is already written in an (invisible) script. The head of Jack Nicholson, Raffleson, and Peter Torque was written during a three-day LSD trip in a suit in an expensive Hollywood hotel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> They deliberately flub their lines, set off to walk, tears up the scenery, punch another actor for no reason; And finally, jumping off a bridge suicide. <br /> <br /> For example, if you look at the frame-by-frame in the cyclic party scene quickly, you can sit Rafelson next to the camera and cameraman, which is very deliberately shooting in a mirror. He revealed that the party was really fake and was shot with actors in the studio, who suddenly came out of the character and walked through the conversation when the director "cut!" <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the mind does not exclude the character from the character because those characters are also actually. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They say they have gone crazy and gone through the sky (Which will draw on paper and pull from the ceiling as the set's background)? No problem! Hey, hey, they monkees, and those dirty boys just keep the monkeys nearby! <br /> <br /> Finally, their death did not free them. The film was about to end, and their stagnant, water bodies came out of the river, placed in another box and stuck in a studio warehouse until the characters were needed again for the production of another studio. <br /> <br /> It is considered to be a really fabulous character to truly be forced into the real world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It does not matter if he is nonsensical or confusing and it is "the only important thing that can happen and happen to you at the present moment ... You only have to do 'happen', as it happened, without analyzing or evaluating or by an abstract definition of experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " . <br /> <br /> I saw this photo in a very important time in my life. Instead of just having to do fun things (like sex), I just tried to run away from being "gyaki, weird nerd girl" thinking about it. But the revelation of the head broke my self-replicated repetitive trap and helped me learn more about Rafelson or Nicholson or Tor. For many decades, I have seen "Head" and I want to thank Pitt <br /> <br /> <br /> Was this a good movie? <br /> <br /> Oh, how are you, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> == <YES> ==
