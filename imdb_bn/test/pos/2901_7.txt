The second of these cinemascope philosophy was Rob after Fox. Notice how some of the Roman set is set to pass the Egyptian set. The film is all about first-class elements, beautiful photography, transmitted soundtracks (see Alfred Newman and Bernard Herman - see if a musician can score it in a specific scene). However, the main acting is a little weak. Edmond Prodom has a limited range of emotions and is not interested to see it. The best performance comes from Peter Ustinov, as a slave and Polish actress Bela Darvie as the "Nefar" temptation of the Babylonians. I generally think this film is powerful for the plot, which is rare for these huge specs produced at this time. In general, an interesting and entertaining work of social commentators on what the Egyptian society could look like on this film.
