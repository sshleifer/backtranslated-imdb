I saw the first, I thought, "Wow, this is the most spectacular movie, apparently speaking, I have ever seen." Since that time, I saw this top of the list but it is still considered one of the best in that section. I was very annoyed that the long-awaited DVD was done so badly, the quality of this transit is very good compared to VHS tape. <br /> <br /> Wild scenes illustrated in Cameroon, and "Lus" adjective to best describe what you see. Without the sound of the jungle, "see" is almost everything in the beginning because there is almost no "hearing", there is no conversation until the bully (Christopher Lambert) Ian Homom and his friendship with the opposite ... so be prepared for this you saw this film No <br /> <br /> <br /> Like the story, I would say it is not Tarzan. Many of us know about Johnny Wesculla's movies ... but this is not a complaint. Those who are not worried about hunger work, and are not worried about cinematography like me, you will only go past in that uninterrupted role. <br /> <br /> In this Tarzan edition, our hero returns to Scotland (his roots), attracted to the environment ( Most of the time .... and very quick to be very fast) and then come back to the forest without Zen. Written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, this is more true for Tarzan books. <br /> <br /> Here special effects are done by Rick Bucker, it is the best of the business Intense DVD or not, it's still a stunning movie to watch and it's very interesting in 2 hours 15 minutes.
