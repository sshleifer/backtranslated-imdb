I have seen the extended underground release with these short films. I found the film in the first annoying and old form and closed it after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to bed and did not have any fun, my nightmare about this movie was asleep in half an hour. Why could not I wonder why I stood up, turned the TV back, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, Alex Froen Sir, you've managed to convert this movie to the head of this old, ironical film singer, and it should be done. So 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> I say, I do not like this picture but it has a lasting effect despite its error and low budget.
