This picture was different from what I thought, but still my expectations crossed. The correct mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and mockery in this movie (not necessarily in this order). In addition to sponsorship or Wikileema, it also exposes our open and fine issues of capitalist democratic high tech society. It makes you smile immediately and later remains in thought. For those who like you, "Tear a dog" and like this man-made and man-made politicians, this film should definitely be loved! <br /> <br /> "Politicians are like many diapers: they should often change and the same reason."
