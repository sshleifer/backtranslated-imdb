Undoubtedly, I saw this movie for the first time just a few days ago, and quickly understood what all these events brought about. This movie attracted my attention from the beginning, and ran me across the whole range of emotion (and maybe helped me discover something which I never knew.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > Dustin Hoffman shines just like Ted Crumer. He is completely confident to have at least three different challenges in a person's life: joint husband, workshop advertising executive and loving father. Marily Strip, because Joanna was absent in a good part of her career as a less central than Juan Kramer's film, but if she is on screen, she will run Hoffman for her money. Although true standout, (in my opinion) young Justin Henry was to be Billy Crurmer. Children are innocent victims of marital breakdown and Justin feels completely natural and full of faith in this role because he works with contradictory emotions in conformity with his mother and his father, then why should he leave his father when his father leaves him Have to leave. Young Justin does not seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role. <br /> <br /> Everybody, the Oscar-worthy film, whose only weak point was that I really decided to go for the sad and happy ending like disappointment, which went through Tad and Joanna to fight the destructive custody was completely unreal. But there is nothing to complain about here. <br /> <br /> 9/10
