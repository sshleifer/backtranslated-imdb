Although my kids enjoyed the movie (and later declared that they wanted to buy it later) I think they got more than this. In the beginning, the real estate show in the airport shop (I did not use comment comments loudly, but I did not think it). This is a sensual medieval film, a little unexpected and works less well than others in some scenes (why do children live with Bice Willis after learning about her father's death?), But always good and always good. It gave us something to talk to our family - did my children think that my life was boring? What do they expect 40? How do you like a movie that has good conversations with your kids?
