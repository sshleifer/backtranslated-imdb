It's one of the best shorts of Stooges. It was their only shorts to be nominated for Osaka. In this short, Stuiggs plays doctors, who have some problems as usual. These are short invisible sight-gags, puns, and jokes. At the end part, where Stooges machine is breaking separately. This is definitely a classic. I would highly recommend this three Stooges short.
