I have long been acclaimed for the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and for a long time supporting Jim Renoan, I knew that I would definitely want to see his "French Cancun" immediately or later. The film tells a fictional story about opening the Moulin Rouge nightclub. Impressori Dongleard (Jean Gabin) tried to make Montmartre Laundress Niney (Fran√ßois Anaral) a teenager star, without the enthusiasm of the rug of her intense play lola (Maria Felix). This "French can can" is just one of the many love triangles - true of stereotype, this French showboy is always in love. <br /> <br /> Reno has given attention to his ideal gentle humor and supporting characters, and wrote a beautiful Waltz song song featuring the movie. Gabin is fully aging French playboy hero Avatar. Anaral is an intelligent reddish, who holds his right in the number of dances, without a few basic shots where a double is definitely used. <br /> <br /> "French Can Can" was billed as a musical comedy, and there broke the song between the number of musical numbers held at the nightclub level, etc, the only character, Kasimi, between the dialogues. The actor who played Philippe Clay, he is having fun - a really tall, skinny young man, who sings songs, dances and frames <br /> <br /> The movie ends with the long Can can sequence, the characters win over their problem and learn to do art together. The dance is enlightened more lightly and is consistently edited than "Moulin Rouge"; Actually, if I have a complaint about "French Cancans", then the whole thing is very technicolor. Even when Nini feels heartwarming or someone sings a sad song, the light is bright and flat, no shadow penetrates. Yes, the results are a delightful and warmhearted musical comedy; It is true that I can not think that these things were never colorful and innocent in real life.
