We see the need of the Little Director to fly Dieter Dengler to the beginning, the subject matter of the film, a emotional-compulsory. Or at least it is like opening / closing doors and inside of the house it's like a big stockpile. One way is the director. Warner Harjug sets a central question, in a manner, why the Dieter is so. Well, in fact, she is not necessarily unreasonable-compulsory because she's right, well, ready. And why will not he live his life? One of the most, dark and delightful and horrifying and survival and survival is only the story of cruel hunting, which is the main part of the film, For example, Dieter had a slogan from the very beginning of his childhood, in post-war Germany, poor families without much food or prospects, eating wallpaper for "blue of the walls" But there was nothing but a passion, which is flying, which is a un-yielding desire (which, of course, Herzog's bread and butter and its films are part of the human love of people), and is nothing more than to fill it out for the dieter. Even after becoming a US citizen, he could exchange more quantities than it did. <br /> <br /> Diet is one of the most engaging, playful and compassionate images of Herzegade in her entire career. A man in memory became enraged by the brutal memory of his time as the POW of Vietnam, although at least it's the most compelling story in a 20-year documentary. Surprisingly, the story comes from the story - like the wild blue yandar - in most cases, from the Dieter to the numerous capital camps, with some detailed details of its time (like torture tactics, bugs, brutal, cruel violence and threatening wedding rings), and his best friend Dwen Leading with the most interesting and sad part is. They escaped from prison together, but their journey to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, most of the time, this thing is something that works as fascinating as the Dieter goes through his story and reconsider it sometimes. (Fashion can only be made by Harezg, through the diatre, the medium is handled in the handcuffs through the jungle), one can take all the pictures in this mind. It makes all the more vivid and makes this little story more alive to combine it together into reality. Herzeg makes these parts easy, and knows when the diater returns to her answer, she makes an important figure of interest. He's never quite 'normal', but unlike Timothy Trudeau, you never feel laughing at him. So, with his hero (difficult to say war or not, those who are talking about death due to Diet's controversy were genuine heroes, but perhaps quite true), Herzog's early life of the diet (footage of WW2 scenes and While posting the German ruble) is always an impressive sight, and HarzG gets a notch up with her music and music together), and the jungle and field The philosophy of the air capture footage of Vietnam. Harzgog also is not very effective that in practice many things can not be done in the context of politics, there was nothing used in the 'used by America' or in the mix. There is even a sense that Dieter does not bother with what happened to him, what happened during the war (and, of course, he bombed humans from his plane). Now, with most of these reductions - even in prison, which was going to the bathroom and food scraps, with little bit of luck, fortunately herozag also makes a cheerful examination. One of my favorite scenes in this movie for a moment from Hirojag Diet, when he showed a 'train' film used for American soldiers, which meant that if he only went to the jungle, what would happen? . With all the gears that might come with their knife, a fireplace gun, and a helicopter very quickly (and it works slowly-dead-voice voice-over). However, there are moments where laughing just focus on unexpected moments during the perfect crisis and how nobody can do anything that does not like being alone in foreign areas surrounded by people who can do anything. The person said as a form of parallel to the battlefield. As well as knowing that the director of flying, flying and flying the air of the only way to which he would ever get, (and Harjog finished the film in a wonderful wrap, where he flies on a large field of airplanes), knows all the costs to survive. But still, like many of Herzog's dramatic opera movies, there are near or unstable souls that are firmly stabilized, even through weak moments (even the fate of the world) and even solving all the problems in all ways. Helicopter (he American, or a spy, they asked the helicopter). Diet is a man with a spirit, and he gave a fantastic, tragic, creative, good shot through negligence, even though rarely in his life. And, of course, it pumps me more for the upcoming drama Rescue Dawn.
