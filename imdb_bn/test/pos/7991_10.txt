I think when it came in 1992, Batman really remembered coming back, but now I think it's the best of all Batman films (even Christopher Noull's superb 2005 Batman is more than two and most importantly over-hypessed overwhelmed 2008 The Dark Knight!) . I basically think that the first Batman Wat / Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still like it). But I think this movie really hit the nail on the head. 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman, and Max Shreck) are all vivid and memorable. Do you really see Batman / Bruce Wayne Keaton's wonderful characterization? Keaton is the best Batman, not a killer, not a clone, even the up-coming Bell, who was exceptional in Bibi and could steal the top honor from Keaton, his character was not destroyed by the production of the Tulle Noulean Hack film! <br /> <br /> Danny Davito The Penguin is as boring, scary, ridiculous and deadly. There is no need for visual chewing to give a great performance like the Davito Gorgeous and Nicholson Joker. The visitors can actually sympathize with his disaster and fit in the normal outlook of this set-up and the normal society. I was not really big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this film, but this is definitely my favorite performance of her. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is the first fool and weird, then she is transformed into Catwoman, she is sexy and scary, total deadly sexpot at once! Also, I think Keaton and Piziffer have more chemistry than Batman Keaton and Basing; They form a sad love story. And Christopher Walken as a laborer, well, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> Batman back, more than Batman, is more confident and focused. It is ensured to produce movies from beginning to end. By introducing Burton, Penguin's hearty backstory keeps you from the very beginning. The first 5 minutes are in a movie at the beginning of my choice: Danny Elfman sets an unexpected foreboding voice of music that defines the rest of the film. This is the original batman and a great one! <br /> <br /> After 33 years of Gotham, the flash went forward and introduced us to the powerful businessman Shake who wants to build a new power station in Gotham. During the same scene, we met Shekak's cruel, cruel, confident secretary, Selina Kyle. And it's not long afterwards, this is what Batman must do for the Penguin's Red Triangle gang, Outstusts and Circus Performance, a fun and lethal clash of romantic opening action sequences for group warfare. Penguin Gotham plans to attack Christmas celebrations, kidnaps Shake in anarchy and helps him reconsider society. Meanwhile, Selina discovered Tariq's criminal plan and so he took him to his high office and killed him, then he was revived by cats. <br /> <br /> Sound Smiling? Yes, but Burton never claimed to present a realistic story. He has created a world where visitors can accept such things, in a dark, dirty world, misbehavior, distorted separatists who deeply want only recognition and can fit. If you ask me a trusted story! <br /> <br /> Some of the action scenes and far away, but they are all breathtaking, entertaining, and nail-bite. They are not just for show, but something like Batman. And they all make sense. A tiring scene with Penguin's "army" is driving Batman to the center of Gotham with Penguin's secret area and Sidekick Butler Alfred (Michael Gough! To welcome the original!) And helps Batman, it's a short, hard, hearty fun ! <br /> <br /> I love Christmas time, winter setting, which joins Burton's Batman in the darkness of the world, cold feeling. I love Burton's way of presenting Batman "toys" without gradually shoving down our throat. Each "toy" is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are forced to accept them for them. And although the dark, refund is still a funny picture. Davito's Penguin has a lot of fun lines. So Walken's Shake is not so. Batman- Catwoman Exchange is very stimulating and good to be filled with humor! A great ensemble! Finally, Batman Returns Tim Burton's funny, comic book is a tightly woven story of the dark forces in the world.
