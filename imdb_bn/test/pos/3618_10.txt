Due to being a Cephalonian descendant, I was pleasantly surprised to see the film. I've heard the real history from my relatives that still live in Siflonia, but when the movie is read and the sketch bits of history are filled. It is true of all, Italianians sing, torture and earthquakes which often occupy the island. Earthquake in 1953 My grandfather died and both books and films expressed feelings of the era of great compassion. If you do not see the movie and see it and read the book, it's not just a love story, and yes, there was a lot of Italian love for the Syphilian women, in fact, the ships of the Sephonnian women were taken after Italy after the war, it is a true illustration of history.
