* This comment will definitely be the speaker !! I'm SPOILERS BOX, but it does not have spielers, but be aware of anything if I say something that you can consider a spinner and I do not! * Wow ... Super Mario 64 game better than that. I found it before the first day of the game, and before I got it I went to some gaming websites to see its rating (yes, they had already reviewed it before publishing it), and I was surprised. I was expecting something like Sunshine because the recent all types of Mario games are getting bad and bad. But this one beat other games completely. Score this game even beat 3 even now! It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> Story: Not the best, Mario games are never known for their plots, and this is not really a difference. Bossar kidnapped Peach, but at this time Mushroom attacked the Kingdom once a century and got a flying piece and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they keep the anchor inside the ground and throw the castle and its base outside. <br /> < br /> <br /> Graphics: Absolutely fantastic, Wii has the best graphics so far. Waterfalls are really nice, if you ever look at the water, it seems so real because it affects it. <br /> <br /> Music: Not surprisingly, this game is playing music. It's not all, but those are not still strangers, still very nice words. <br /> <br /> Gameplay: Very entertaining, you are trying to play more and more, and for me, since I'm usually very disappointed with the games when I die a lot, I mean, I'm not the only one, but for me This game was not too much. Now it's still kind, but Mario is not at 64 points, where I've been completely insane and stopped playing because it made me crazy, it never did. Diabetes: there are two types of difficulty, because you can only beat the game with technically 60 stars, which I think is easy, but if you lose 100% of the game you will always get 120, and That search is hard, but at the same time is still very fun. <br /> <br /> Length: Good length, of course not too small. It took about 15-16 hours to kill me in just 60 hours, but 120 took me more than 45-50 hours. Now I could not play it continuously, I played it for many days on the first day, then for the next few days, only a few hours a day, then I used to play all day in the next two days. Even though I thought the search for 60 was a little bit smaller, so if you want a long game, then I suggest you to get them all. <br /> <br /> Presentation: Now, the scenes from this movie are fantastic. As they are, I can see many things that I want to see in theaters. They have presented the best cinematic scenes of a Mario game so far. <br /> <br /> Overall: This game is definitely a great game, and I suggest you not wait until Christmas, get it as soon as possible. This game is a good mix of old and new, you will have some side-scroller levels where you simply move from side to side or up and down because it will change to gravity, even if the music has its classic classic. So this game looks like a nice composition. To me, this is my favorite Mario game all the time, but others may be mutual. But it's still a great game. Every gamer who wants to make fun of a game I find in these games suggests
