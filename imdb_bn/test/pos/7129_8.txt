Better than the original, "The Gammers: Darks Rising" is a good actress, fine special effects, and a comedy that extracts the "gamer" knowledge-based and tries to play a fun comedy by doing it in a low budget. I've seen a lot of low budget films which are terrible and almost no one was as good as their high-budget critics. This movie mostly removes mainstream film! The parts are a bit weaker (bits with pirates and ninjas - some funny - a bit more without explanation, and the film takes you out) but overall it is a very powerful film. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy that as soon as I bought this photo and brought it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From this opportunity, can we wait to see another feature gamers movie? :)
