Although I accidentally brought this picture (I think it was hello Halloween (stupid eh!)) I was amazed at how good I was, many continuous incidents of previous films, but tried to explain the facts and succeeded. Prequels, why Michael Myers seems to have killed people and how he has supernatural power. I thought it was a top horror movie that was full of action, mystery and wonder, I was glad to bring it. I've given it 9 out of 10.
