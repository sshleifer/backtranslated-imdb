This is absolutely true and trusted adaptation of 'o ollow'. It may be advisable that the real mystery here is not the best of a Christie, but it is characterized by 'Hol' and I found the actor here, less or less without exception, in their part it was perfect. It is difficult to select stand out in a uniform good cast but I would say that Sarah Miles is perfect as Lucy Angkatell. The wonderful thing is that he did not just show Lucy's fatigue, brutality and more love qualities but he also managed to drag the underlying truth that Lucy is not really that good at all! Henryta and Claire Price GARDA as very dominant as Megan Dodds are very good. John Cristo is a truly remarkable character, but Jonathan Cakes still manages to show what our women can see. <br /> <br /> As I said, this script is very firmly followed by the story. I discovered that the only annoying thing was that Midge and Edward's relationship did not really come from anywhere and I believe that some of its cutting ends in the floor of the house! Although they have a second story and the initial story is very well done. The whole thing looks beautiful, really holds a perfect English autumn. <br /> <br /> It's every beautiful picture and good quality to see.
