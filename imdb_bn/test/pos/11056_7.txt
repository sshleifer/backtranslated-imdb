Filmmaker Garner did not get the film on the film, which introduced our horrible but thoroughly interesting character Duchar, Philip Nahan was wildly played. Nayet's instructions have all the features of his later films, which show that he started his own voice and style from the beginning. Its sudden cutting is used for harsh, high noise, avoiding flashbacks, and many other strategies to differentiate visitors. And it certainly works. Also, he is not afraid to show the violence, because the protesters will get to know the audience. Here violence is equally strong, and the Signal Sea Contra Toss, it is almost helpless. <br /> <br /> The image is open to the horse's death. It is shot in the head, and we rit it on the floor, watch it flow flowing out of blood flow. Then we see her bloody glory, the flesh of the Butcher a human birth. She was orphaned at WWII, and grew up in the world, and everyone and it hated everything. He serves his clients, but his internal solidarity reminds him of his thoughts - he thinks that he is dead all of them. The only thing about her daughter Blayende Lenoir, who will reconsider her role after six years, is the only thing about her, and we see her growing up together. She is silent though, and the bullying and toying issues. Butcher's relationship with him is often innocuous, when he takes a full bath at his own age, but it is further investigated in the next movie. When a man attacks her, the Butcher explodes with anger, tearing a innocent man into the mouth. He will go to prison, what he wants from him - his shop and daughter. In the short 40 minutes we saw all this, much more, its time in prison and back to its world. Due to the state of his daughter, the autistic also thinks that he is under full control of his father without doing anything small. The film is unusually running in the Seal Contra Toss. If you can, watch these two films, this is the first. It really has some nice acting, but due to uninterrupted tune it is very hard to see. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 7
