The red coat is betraying his country treacherously, but in reality he is not paying too much attention to the movie. Main Bolton (Colonel Will) and Chief Andr√© (Michelle Flood) Wilding steal the film as an officer and a gentleman. Boulton as a freind. Bolton, who secreted Gustavus in Britain, tried to publish it. Willi said Britain's suspect. And Dale (George Sanders), who hates every move and love of her, Anne Francis is a very enjoyable movie.
