My father was my favorite movie when he was younger. It was Andrea, a divorced French man who wanted to take his beautiful daughter (Catherine Higel) on a holiday, hoping to take a little stroll around her. But Nicholas could not easily start puberty, I guess. He is angry and hard to find that his father was never there for him and he decided to give him a hard time. One day Nicole looks at the handsome Ben at the beach, and she creates a wild story about her and her father. The whole island is involved and the movie turned into a ridiculous wild recreational movie. I will give my father the hero 8/10
