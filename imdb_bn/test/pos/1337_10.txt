Hey, do you expect to make a very low budget movie?!? Although I did not see "Dahmar" (2002) but I can say that following Jeff's media, it's a pretty fine screenplay. I studied Jeffrey Dahmar's case and learned about this guy about what I learned. This is a low budget movie but it shows a serial killer mentality. If you can get past pregnancy and see the underlying story of a sick mind. I like this movie! Just bind yourself for low budget and no blood. This is a story that looks through an assassin's eyes and his actions and his arrest from childhood. My favorite line is: "If they get disturbed by the back seat, they can save a lot of life" Enjoy!
