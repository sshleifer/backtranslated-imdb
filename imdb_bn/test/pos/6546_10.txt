This is one of my greatest movies ever, forget it if you do not go to the car !! This film is the best muscle car in Australia, XYGTHO. Yeah so great to act - it does not win an oscar. The car action will come back for you more and more. A cool collection of muscle cars from 70's and a great '57 Chev - Dry it with a real cool cat! Also sang the main actor Terry Serio. Funny when acting is taken quite lightly, but the focus of this movie is the tire smokin and drag racing. Large car with steel (a plastic car), and some cool streets dragging. I recommend for someone who is only in the car and only looking great acting.
