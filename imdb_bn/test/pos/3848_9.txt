Aristocats are really quite charming, and are rated very low at IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as the jungle book, but they were not bad at all. Animation is really beautiful, the best sequence is being parallel to Paris. It looked beautiful It's probably Disney's most flimsy animation that I think, and another critic said exactly, who does not love cats? Another great piece of animation was 'Mali Duchess' eyes, because their romance was not so credible. (A good thing) plot (reminds me of greedy Butler and luck, reminds me of Bailey Billions) a little immune, but very good work, and the script was really fun, especially the fights between the cats. They always remind me and my brothers and 3 sisters. My favorite scene was behind Adger with two dogs, who were always fighting about the leader. Voice genius was a pleasure, especially Phil Harris, whom I recognized from the book of jungle and from Eva C abor of Rescuers. Supporting letters, such as scatters, are also well done. In conclusion, a really happy film, that is definitely underrated. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
