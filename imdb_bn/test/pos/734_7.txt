Basement does not look at the fact it is a clever and well-thought-out absorbent spark which gets worse because of its cheap quality and poor performance. Of course, this is not a great composition by any quality, but it's a lot of interesting B-Film and many extraordinary scenes that will be on your head. <br /> <br /> As I said, acting might be a lot better, but I am not really complaining about it for the most exploitation. The story is cute and some great plot twists that will keep you guessing. I thought Gore was very funny. Something great about old ghor films because they did not have CGI, so they actually forced them to set up. See this one for a good time!
