This is a perfect film, which is a growing sequence, the best story of humor and all the love. Anthony Quinn has performed wonderfully and after watching several of her movies, she will be classified as her best performer besides Juba. You are really surprised when the film is depicted in Romania, which is not a case of seemingly case. It is sure to fool Native Romanians, such as with its distinctive landscape, costume and living. According to IMDB, it is actually France and Yugoslavia, hamy shots. The story is compulsory, you want to watch the whole movie, see if you missed something. It provoked me to find out if it was a real movie, but in my frustration it is a novel based movie, apparently fiction. It seems to be a bit apparent for the reality, but nobody knows ... this is a problem with the film, it does not seem to be a romantic actor, and it is a romantic character film. Initially there are many Romanian Fils, but perhaps it is not filtered elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least fine and sandstone - an excellent composition in overall cinematography.
