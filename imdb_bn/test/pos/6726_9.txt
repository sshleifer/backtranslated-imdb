I like to see that I am not the only person to remember this great movie. I have very happy memories of this movie - I think I'm back at about 8 years old and I will see kids TV shows after school (Who is the Brum Cupboard?). This was the first and last film to fear me - and the picture of a wandering boy on a mountain will be with me forever! Like most movies of this era, it is a happy ending - the target of children, but with a particular skill to attract adult attention. The lovely Cornish scenes really set the film to feel isolated - and the "ex-scenes" are easy but very effective! I would like to try again this movie - see if it is still roaming!
