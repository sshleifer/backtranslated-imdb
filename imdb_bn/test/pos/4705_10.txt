I got the chance to talk to co-creator, Rebecca Camicas, at the Rochester, NY in the 2002 High Fruit Film Festival. He said that his style is completely open and united in film making, but very happy to be so tightly restricted in the quarter quarters of the group. The narrow hallway and small room were skillfully shot with a reality that was lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work. <br /> <br /> Helen herself is an extraordinary character, which is coming from tragedy in her own life, difficult, and an unusual combination of smart smartness. The film is a wonderful way to present our past, only a few carefully selected minutes spread. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not begin to hip properly to appreciate this movie. It really is a treasure of movies and a treasure of issues humanity.
