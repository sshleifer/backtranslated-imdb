As part of the "French Culture" thing, I saw this French movie in my French class. I thought how it was filmed and the editing was really good, but mostly it was the person who entertained Wandi's brother. Also the story line was really good and as well it was credible and still as well as the adventure. <br /> <br /> part: When William is making fun of the German people and how he reproduces when he works! <br /> <br /> <br /> My franchise is not good, but what I'm going to do with the subtitles is quite beautiful. See <br /> <br />!
