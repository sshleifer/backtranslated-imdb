What a great movie, it was made more so that my wife and I scratched it, so surfing the channel on a wonderful frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Betts is her usual best, the most wonderful thing we've ever seen, the most surprisingly good movie, and is bringing a very natural and human cast to a throw of characters. It was difficult to understand why the film did not pay attention to the liberation war in 2002. The big fanfare and attention left on the top of the trash of the trash was clear why seeing it was the head and shoulders. It is evident that we are considered "great and wonderful" by a strong and influential people as ordinary people, when true gems such as "dishonest love" lead to shine through all the dishonesty through real-life films. Rent or buy this movie ... you do not regret it!
