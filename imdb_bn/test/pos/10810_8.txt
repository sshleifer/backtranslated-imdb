Danton was a hero and founder of the French Revolution in 1789. This movie has been set five years later and the revolution has become somewhat ugly. Initially, the revolution promised independence, at this time the current small committees of the country are highly repressive and dictatorships. Dantan and his friends were angry when the country was not good before the country was released from its king in 1794, so they started criticizing the government. This film starts like a printer, which creates critical pamphlets in the government and its business is destroyed. Many things for "freedom, equality and bondage"! So, due to silence in this way, Danton et al officially criticized. Finally, Robespierre (committee leader) and his chronically crushed up charge, have a show trial and get rid of the opinion. Some have mentioned that Polish director Wajada criticized his nation for this purpose - which was Soviet-dominated and very repressive. This movie is understood immediately with the publication - especially when the government destroys all inconsistencies in the "people's name". <br /> <br /> Actually, the story is compulsory and I do not have any major criticism. However, I really wish the last end has been managed differently. Especially because, except for lovers of history and the French people, this idea probably does not help to end the government. After the curse of Danton in April 1794, in December 1794, Robesius himself was executed, because the country had enough - plus, the surviving French knew that they could face guillotine very soon, if this sickness system was stagnant. Some of the theorems of a theorem were beautiful - for example, to show soldiers for raberspeare. He first tried to kill himself, but he succeeded in closing his face - still alive, he soon became Gilotinad. It was a painful small epilogue and could be done in about five minutes. However, Demon does not show a connection between the death and the fall of the government, it is a strange matter.
