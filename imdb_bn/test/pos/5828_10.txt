Yes, many men had naked nudity in this show, and yes, the lines of the plot became top, composer and very unrealistic for years, but this is no problem because the show is superb. If you really are involved in the characters and each character, no matter small or big, is throwing perfectly. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine anyone else being the leader of the neo-Nazi racist rapist except JK Simmons, nor anyone else playing Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. The transformation of its character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing. However, the character that Oz Wojes had in Choice Keller (played by Christopher Melney). There was no relationship with anyone other than Bachar (well, except Ronnie Berlag, Ronnie was given only to stop playing with Keller's lover boy Becker). Their relationship has crossed the gender and Tom Fontana actually cares about them and they want to let the two stay together. <br /> <br /> I like Gordon's soft spot for his boys, and how Phantana made everyone sympathetic to Simon Adbase, even we respected this big criminal. However, some plot lines were completely unbelievable and unrealistic: * A man is making a bomb at age * age, while others in the spotlight on their windows in their windows are planning to do something on their minds - too much. * Ojus medication * Drugs and sister Pitt did not help anyone in the six years of rehabilitation group used. * Humans offer gym, closet and kitchen supplies. * Nobody hurts Ryan's mother; * Does not fight Cyril outside of the boxing counter (except for Warne) * Two prisoners leave alone in lift shafts and none of them die without investigation. * Carl Metzer dies, and nobody investigates. * The governor holds all his press conferences in prison * Everyone wants to say a cadet to "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see McManus" and they are not asked any questions. * People die oozing every week * On the outside, people kill someone and go for eight years in parole for eight years, but if someone kills someone, they are almost in queue immediately. * There is no work done on the site provided by the kitchen or mail room - Run both departments in prison. No question was asked * Aged medicines for prisoners as a time-consuming drug. * Royan has no friend or associate but he is never hurt, killed, assaulted, raped or Do not rush * Do not flush the toilet when they go to the bathroom or thump. * An NBA scout comes to the recruitment prison for an NBA player (yes it is okay) <br /> <br /> However, with all these flaws, this show is still awesome. It's terrible, brutal, sexy, lusty, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, J.K. Simmons, Christopher Melanie, Luiz Guzman, Adele (played by Simon Adebly), Amon Walker, Lee Tarzessen, Terry Kinney, MMS, Male Alexander, LL Cool J etc. All are awesome and show price is shown. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend to rent DVDs. Season six comes 9/06 (next month). DVDs are the first five seasons - watch them and then watch them again with audio commentary. I like the director's comment with Chase Palmetarty. Running down the table cafeteria table with Andy Schillinger and then falling in the hole is an awesome, top notch shot !!!! Glory! And Kathy Betts family business management and famous wrestling scene in Beecher and Keller - simply amazing !! Bright !!! In one scene that would be so curious to touch the personal part of Tergesen in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in that scene !! How nice! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Star Trek, etc.) Simon! Let's start it !!!!
