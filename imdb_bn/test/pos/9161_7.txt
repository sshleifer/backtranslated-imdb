Well, the film was originally about the last days of a particular Russian regiment in Afghanistan, before the withdrawal of the main army in 1985. This film has correctly portrayed the serious realities of the Russian army, which is "Cootovisina" (officer and NCO physically harassing, assaulting and insulting small employers), mixed character of war (you can trade with your enemies and kill him later), in front Lines of women's lives, footage of helicopter attacks, and footwear selling coffins And sent to the C-130 Hercules class in Russia's cargo planes with junk Stormer missiles, fatigue, annoyance, anti-warfare attitude, and mental aspects are easy to set up. There are some action scenes, but they work poorly, and are often unreasonable, such as Major Bandur's suicide walk and armed with a 10-year-old child behind him armed with one AK 47, whose father he just died. There is also no heavy grenade launcher in the middle of the mountain fire (and a half-bright person knows that it is almost impossible to defeat the 40-50 lens launcher in March). But at the same time, the films show that the war is a dirty thing, where murder is sometimes abandoned, for the slightest reason or not, the entire village is destroyed by irregularities, parallel losses during the war are inevitable as the arbitrary killings of citizens are ignored ... some food The best war films were made to think about why the Afghan war has lost .. However, deep and wise enough valuable.
