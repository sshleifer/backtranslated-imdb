Flipper is a wonderful heartfelt movie for the whole family. This is probably not a great movie, Free Willie looks almost better in every film making film. Probably, sometimes it becomes a little naive and is not the best part of the film and the script, but it is a great film (with water shots) and an entertainment film with some important moral messages. Elias Wood proves itself more as an incredibly talented and intrinsic actor. He can make a bad movie worth watching, okay cinema - good, good - great and great movie always becomes classic. Paul Hogan's performance was very good and he was perfectly suited for his role. As I said above, the whole cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best part. Flipper is a perfect way to do so if you want to see nice, sweet and entertaining movies. If you get tired of sick and modern Hollywood trash, sex, violence, obscenity and superstition, you probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7,7 out of 10 I feel free to join me on any comments and posts. <br /> <br /> Sorry my bad english
