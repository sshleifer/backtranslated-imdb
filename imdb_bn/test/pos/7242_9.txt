Agematha Christie (Writing 'Sleeping Marriage' in the government's final case was written in fifty years) Miss Mepail's writing 'Nemesis' was the last book and I was always very soft spot for it. I liked the characters and they loyally lived astonishingly with Joan Hickson, whom Harrison would be forever as horrific as Miss Marple. <br /> <br /> This is very faithful in the whole book. A few letters are omitted, the first (new) murder is slightly different and some new characters are introduced. Personally I felt that the character added to Lionel Pill was unnecessary and rather annoying. Travel Guide Majo was annoying but often quite fun in a different way. This is basically because of lienel, I do not get 10 out of 10 prizes! Other characters, especially Helen Cherie, have done all of the honorable Miss Temple and three strange sisters, but especially Margaret Tijak, who gave Clathild's superior performance. He threatened to go to the top in the end but just avoided. Ladies' bodyguards are very valuable and in this episode there is one of my favorite Hickson lines ... 'An Arcadecan?!' <br /> <br /> This is another relatively recent BBC Maple which feels wonderful and it has a magnificent nostalgic feeling. Highly recommended.
