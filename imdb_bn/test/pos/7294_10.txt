This is a very unusual movie that started by getting a new sports car for the graduation of the rich dancer and decided to take it for a spin in the local city. The rich boy meets the poor girls of the Dinner, the waitress and the local boyfriend are very upset and the war begins. There is a car's Chase and all kinds of problems seem to have happened and the wealthy boy and poor boy wind up wind to make community service according to the city's judge orders. The rich boy and the poor boy just do not go beside and the rich boy conquers the heart and soul of a poor boy's friend. Quite a lot of poems and poems in the forest and some deep thoughts about life. The poor girl says, "Some people live and do not find love, I can say that I have found love and stay in it". If you are sensitive you will need some tissues, there are plenty of romantic scenes and if you assume that this picture will end how much I doubt it. The producer and director came up with a good idea and finally finished a film. If you want the truth in life with poetry and very sensitive issues, it is your movie.
