I first saw all the rivers running on TV when I was a child and liked it. It shows a small series that was closely set and protected at home. Living perfectly around Ecuaca, I like to go to the historic port to see the pedal steamers. My first journey was Pivinci (Philadelphia in the film). I love what it takes to unveil the shows. Most movies do not seem like today. Acting was fantastic. All the river runs were completely thrown and I just love the Philadelphia crew. Mac is funny to always see with its trademark raw onion sandwich out at a big night. Easily 10 out of 10 qualifications and one of my favorite mini series along with the Darwat dynasty.
