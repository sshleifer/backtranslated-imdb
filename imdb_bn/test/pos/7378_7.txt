While driving on a lively street in a dangerous gizzy way, teenage Cliffs (J. R. Ferguson) had a car accident with his friends Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Mastersson). While spending cold cold nights in the forest around Campfire, they kill while telling ghost stories. In "Honeymoon", couple Rick (Ron Livingstone) and Valerie (Jennifer McDonald) traveled to Los Angeles to visit their honeymoon. Rick took a shortcut to visit Clayton Cavens at night, but unknown strangers (Hathorn James) advised them to leave the spot after attacking people in full moon of dangerous animals. On the occasion of the birth anniversary of "People Can Can Lake", Amanda (Alex McKenna) told her internet friend Jessica that she was alone. However, Jessica is actually a psychology. "The Locket", Bike Scott (Glenn Quinn) is crossing the country on his motorcycle. When he had a problem with his bike, he found an isolated house where the stupid Heather Wallace (Jacqueline Barrett) lived with his father. When humans come back from its roots, Scott finds the truth about the heater. <br /> <br /> "Campfire Tales" presents three great horror stories, monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and ultimately a wonderful twist. The weakest section is "hook", Eddie and Jenny, but other stories are a great one. The plot point is completely unexpected and this above average horror movie gives a great conclusion. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Contex by Mya-Note" ("Midnight Tales")
