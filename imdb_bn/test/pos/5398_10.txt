Filmed heroes is a fine little film! Dan Harris wrote and operated this story with the classic theater, intelligent comedy and tragedy so strongly that the climax of the film took your breath away. <br /> <br /> A different bunch of family of tragedies: There is no member to appear for each. The unwanted 'hero' child swimming champion Matt (Kip Pardu) began to separate his father Ben (Jeff Daniel) apart from his own family and separated himself from his family and became his mother Sandy (Sigari Weaver) pot and became angry. The daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) comes back from the school expected by her family's behavior and the remaining boy team (Emil Hirosh) leaps into her classmates, girlfriend and her neighbor Kyle (Ryan Donowho) in drug and sexual exams. The film tries to conceal his body secretly across the team, which spreads their secret secret, yet he still refuses to deny his girlfriend, his mother is angry with the trailer park trash, because he believes, and finally opens up the deep window, this family year Have enjoyed it Secrets and lies, here, and their solution is frustrating dramatic. It can be the best role of Sijurini Weaver, although Emile Hirish, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donoho and Kip Pardu (the role despite her brief) all have top-performance performance contributions. The story starts slowly and feels like a congregation and can defeat some viewers, but stay with this small Powershaus movie and the effect of the work will stop you. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
