May be spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. Lots of good sunny things However, do not see the TV version, they cut a lot. Dam Delois, rather than terrified as a paid mafia don for the murder of Ramin. I can talk about her ten minutes: it's a long drive from jersey. You also love to test the script to make Robin get another shot. Also: 12 century Fox. <br /> <br /> Any bad things? Rappers at the beginning and at the end think instead of date. The song was rather lame. Once upon a time while watching this movie, I could have thought more often that they could drop into another comedy. 2. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You must watch for a comedy fans.
