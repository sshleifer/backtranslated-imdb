After seeing the naked city and the night and the city (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more excited to see his "Masterpiece" (O-Word criteria) RIFIFI. <br /> <br /> Now I'm frustrated about a little story. <br /> <br /> So at least my mind has these five questions: <br /> <br /> 1. In the final countdown Louis Grater, a room shot from the main character Tony Le Stefanoise. He did not know whether he was still alive, but he did not take care of him and ran straight after reaching his vehicle (with money) at home. That's why Tony did not die and shot him dead. Big question marches <br /> <br /> 2. Among the other important scenes, Caesar Cesar's experts donated a diamond ring (which was a part of the robbery) as a woman working for Louis Groot at night, after a robbery. Stupid, because this character was not that stupid before. And of course, Louis knew directly that Tony Jahr planned a robbery. Small questions and answers <br /> <br /> 3. After the gangster behind Louis Grater, he planned to take revenge against Mario Ferrari and his wife Tony and his best friend Joe Louis gang. At the same time they do not protect Joe's wife and her five-year-old child. Of course the kidnapping of Louis gang son. CHEAP and SIMPLE <br /> <br /> 4. Perfect heist: Of course this is the best 30min. Long scene in the whole plot, without any words spoken whole time, but this was a perfect hist? It can be compared to other movies handled with this theme, when I submerged for firefighters to ban Tony's alarms. Also very easy. <br /> <br /> 5. The grubor gang went home, because they knew (but ...) there will be joharat there. Then they killed Mario and his wife. And then? They are not looking for it! No They run out straight from the apartment. And more. They do not observe the apartment after this, so Tony could go inside to take jewelry after a while (which was the same day). Big question <br /> <br /> <br /> Because the bright 30-minute silent henstream scene. Very good reason to cut (the car's view is stunning through Paris). Because Jean Servais is a very good actor called. You will see this due to this black / white fever. Written about other users for any other reason, but please do not tell me it's a wonderful story
