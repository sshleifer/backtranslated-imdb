'Thriller' is a great plot of pop music proms, a plot, a great visual, and a tip-top movie surround movie. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree at this time (and did not change much to change it during his plastic surgery regime). Here he is well - the song is horrific, he leads Junkie to dance like someone else. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ola Ray watched her daughter's boyfriend (Jackson, Noche) incredibly transformed. A violin! Then at the old line 'Pulsing Lam' near 'Midnight', he fell around the graveyard with other Jummy and night animals. <br /> <br /> This crown is the pride of the smell, the great horror star Vincent speaks in the middle of the record. Horrible
