This is an unfortunately unacceptable classic. <br /> <br /> The appearance of a beautiful, design, dress, etc., is a refreshing, post-war scene and horse-charged both cool and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are animated and really human. As a lawyer and Fabrice Lucini, lawyer Darwin stole the movie through his performance as a clever pedantic rodent, while others are excited about the ups and downs of others. Depardieu is good but perhaps a presence too big for this role. <br /> <br /> where the film is really excels and changes her from the novella of Balzac. These changes are editorials that have a lot of discussion in Balzak society and this movie breathes with characters. Yet Yeves Angelo has retained the original content, not only the missing people are trying to recover their place in the society, but every character must find their place in society: Comrade Ferreud is trying to buy a colleague, his wife (aement) is born with a low birth and with Kernel Chabbert After getting married, they achieved their position in revolutionary French Revolution. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and it creates a good play because their objectives are in conflict with each other. It seems very modern: money is important to buy status to reach power, but they can go as fast as they can go. Darville enjoys this tactic, when he told the church he had seen the worst person. At the end of the novel, the original realization of this statement, Balzak enriched the human comedy with the great mockery.
