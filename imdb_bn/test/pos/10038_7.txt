Naturally, with all of them, I wanted to expect many Hollywood fantasy revisionists who were drowning with their buttons on Cast's legend. There is enough evidence of a source of legendary progression on the truth, just like everyone else in the game of Erlil Flynn, who is a sport collector. And in most cases my expectations are fulfilled (a gentlemanly and ridiculous way). <br /> <br /> Even in this apparently favorable (and critical) re-release of the Cast Story, I was slightly hurt, the points that were created in this film are sometimes clearly, but still firmly, the general clich√©s of the manifest faults and the extraordinary heroism is usually the first of the 20th century Are found in the west. <br /> <br /> The film, for example, tried to whitewash his hero, in some scenes still suggests a more vulnerable and stupid character in real life: <br /> 1) The West Point is its primary entrance to the front gate, in which His arrogance and laziness have a clear view of his character. <br /> <br /> 2) His unfortunate record at the West Point, which is undoubtedly responsible for the custodial demand of military jobs for any other reason; Cast to West Point at the West Point, where he feels ruthlessly stupid <br /> <br /> 3) The General General of the Custor is not presented as merely a ridiculous mistake, but it acts as a sledgee comedy. I expect Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello to get halfway through the scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> The racist stereotype of unknown barbarians, it is still astonishing to me that the film actually went a little bit in detail, why Indians are going to their land Dadera gained justify the attack and blamed for the war was perfectly clear black and white mountain foothills. Indeed, no one can argue that Anthony Quinn is not as clear arch sealing bull, but Arthur Kennedy and Co, who claims black Satan's lie in black heels. Sure, the part of the story is true, but I do not expect to portray it in a movie like this completely. <br /> <br /> Another thing: In general, these films make it seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid drunk anytime by Indian alcoholics. In this movie, it is actually the 7th cavalry soldier, or the Indians, who are at least two scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie slips into some wonderful moments in the middle of Hollywood turning.
