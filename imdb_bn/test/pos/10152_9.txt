This movie is the one you love. Alfred Hittak should always have topped any director of his time. The most influential aspects of his films are Shear Simpleity and Griping Drama. One of the best things in Hitkoch films is Definat and Grapping End. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to be said about "the person who knew a lot". Cinematography, Acting, Dialog and Camera Works are fantastic in this movie. The song "The best of the best" will last forever in the memories of our lives. The movie that started from the beginning is so enjoyable that we do not know when it's last. Hitcoz will rarely include humor in his films, this film has comic scenes that fit into the film. <br /> <br /> This image is absolutely brilliant and as well as the Vertigo.
