As a rule, some things are more annoying than Hollywood's brave attempt. Beware of heavy interference, "message movies" are bold to deal with the main problems and to back them back. CROSSFIRE is not completely free from this stain; There is a speech of intelligent hate nature, which is embarrassingly obvious, that there is an excessive similarity between his listeners who are depressed to think. At the end of 1947, it was a big deal for the film that anti-Semitism was present and it was bad. (Of course, it was impossible for Hollywood to base the film on the basis of the original theme of this book, it was not a case of homosexuality.) But thanks to good writing and excellent acting, there is a provocative examination of crossfire, we will now talk of hate crime. <br /> <br /> The poster was one of the main elements of the film Noura, and crossfire communicated directly with it. This film is still in uniform in the Washington, DC, but is inactive, spending their days on poker and bar-crawling. Joseph Samuels (Sam Leven), an intelligent and kind Jew, explains that the end of the war has made an ineffective: the power that hates and fights the enemy is now stagnant and bottled. Samuels joins three soldiers in a bar: Sensitive Mitchell, who is near neurological breakdown, weakly deliberate Floyd Bouwowers and Montgomery, who is tall, too sympathetic, who brutally lowered a wild soldier from Tennessee into a stupid mountainous region. Three soldiers sail in Samuels' apartment, where drunkenness became increasingly humiliating, calling its host the "Jew-boy". Samuels was beaten to death, and Mitchell disappeared, the main suspect in the murder of himself. <br /> <br /> This crime is being uncovered, Detective Finlay (Robert Young), Dry and Bai-Book, and Sergeant Kyle (Robert Mitchem), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows Mitchell, is unable to murder. Among the pieces of the puzzle, Guinea (Glorya), the Nightclub guest who met Mitchell and gave him his apartment key and Floyd (Steve Brody), who was scared of a secret roaming room as a witness to this crime. Although there is no real "Hoodune" mystery, the story is kept secret, and the trap trapped for the murderers is very clever. <br /> <br /> Strong Noah's atmosphere preserves the movie from scenic or loving feeling. Cinematography is a striking shadow game, in which dark dark and strong light, cells are often illuminated by the lamps filtered by cigarette smoke. World fatigue is as widespread as silent lighting. "Nothing is interested in me," Finlay says quietly; "Nothing," Nightclub Gunner Toast Noor woman's character, Gloria, steals the movie with almost two scenes. Platinum-Blonde, Zed and Kustic, she is poisoned by the wonderful B-girl, "Stinking Gene Mill", where she works ("Sunny," she is nasty), when Mithal tells him that her sweet face is crying, she reminds him Gives her wife Now and then a cheerful generosity is seen through his protective shell, when he dances in the desert with a desert, offers to cook spaghetti in his apartment. When he goes there, he meets a scary, frightened person (Paul Kelly), who thinks Gini as a sponge, and whose conversations are a dense layer of lies and false confessions. Gloria closed Mitchell's beautiful wife on the screen, where she asked Mitchell to give alibi. His girls' tress with her lice, she lets us see how many times Gini is insulted and dismissed as a tram. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is a non-duplicate actor, and there is no scope for Mitchem's charisma, but he did a good job of performing his pipe-smoking character, which is related to giving a sincere message to the movie. Mitham, gets some quiet conversation, but is not nearly enough; Yet, when he is not doing anything but lounging in the corner you can not close his eyes. Third, Robert, Ryan, an unknown, troubled rebel creates a complete galaxy and scary convincing portrait; We see her irritating anyone with her terrible geniality, her rape, advantage, her "Am I right or right?" Self-satisfaction; How easy was he to label people and he got satisfaction from their ignorance. <br /> <br /> The crossfire message seems to be alert and dated, although in the same year it is not a giantman's contract. Finlay's statement about the rebellion, finding the police force by reaching hundreds of years for example of white mourning, reminds us that once the Irish Catholics were tortured; Later it could be people from Tennessee, he said, or those who wear braces neckties. Or black, or Japanese, or gay, or communist? The scripts are afraid to mention any real contemporary problem. The Jewish victim makes his message sweet, although his innocence was not enough; And taking care of it to dismiss the military, a senior officer has announced that Samuels is honored with great shame as the army Montgomery and in the war. Yet, after World War II, some of its pictures were immediately presented, an American who was happy in the Nazi army, and the fundamental foundation of the movie is still valid. Today Monti is alive, he left on 12th September 2001 and beat Sikh.
