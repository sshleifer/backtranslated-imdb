This is definitely Nolan's most intimite, and thought-provoking piece. Memento or insomnia are not bad, but they are more than Hollywood's standards ... when something more happens after an indie flick. The story is very bright, and very well developed. Above all ... if you have a fan of your snout, I'm sure you can appreciate it more.
