Being "Wallace and the Gromit-Fan", I was looking forward to this full-length movie. Surprisingly, I saw this at the world-premiere of the movie festival in the sea festival of VLUISHNA (NL). An amazing feeling to be the first one to see this very funny and funny movie. It is Wallace and Gromit (which I do not believe that a contact is not needed) has its own pest control company in the city, which hosts a giant-vegetable contest within a few days. With a wonderful fool, everyone is expecting to win his giant carrots or watermelon golden carrots. Unfortunately the city is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. This is where W & G comes in. People have their own cracking contractions under the control of these interesting animals. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who liked the three effective small films of W & G (which is much more!), Would love this full-length movie. Nick Park truly delivers a wonderful and original result with a great sense of humor. Like chicken rains, it really makes me wonder why she can hold so many stories and emotions in a few frames. "Well done, lad" ;-) Oh yes: the music was fantastic! It really is a ride completed. Enjoy!
