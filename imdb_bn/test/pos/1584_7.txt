When I attended the local science fiction conference, I heard about the first commander's log. Craig Bollsby, Linden Bank, Sophie Bankss and Brian Oberclle came to show the video and gave some panels for making a TV in a shoe budget. I want to say that finally I was happy to have the opportunity to watch the show. Red Darf's comparisons are inevitable, because the first season of Red Dwarf was shot in a low budget (although the commander's log could set some type of records for the money spent per minute during the wind), and thus made for the lack of "eye candy" with good writing and acting. The Leiden Bank, who played Chief Petty Officer Bladder, did a particularly good job to present a sincere but weird personality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the evening, among other shows, although for some reason, the space was not cool to any idea, and So transitional moments were transformed into one-hour show, which is usually shown in two half-hour episodes. Existing DVD does not include Episode 3 (which was a 2005 release of Seattle's Casacadia-Con a premiere) or Episode 4 (which was published in 2006 by Vancouver Vicon), but if you contact your local fan community, may be.
