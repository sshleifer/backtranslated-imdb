Since this fine movie has many reviews, I will write in a list and try to solve the issues that have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. During the filming of this film, Anna Andreas was 38. The script of his character was between his mid-20s. Andrews, an extremely intimate actor, plays brilliantly a character who is supposed to be very young. <br /> <br /> All great actors, such as Frederick March, have sometimes been forced to refrain from leading actors. When he reached the camera, he was drunk at night and the next morning he was checking his hanging in his mirror. <br /> <br /> Wisdom was fantastic as "Andrew," "The Ox-Bowl Event", "A Walk in the Sun", "Purple Heart" and many other movies. Why did Frederick March win Academy Awards and why Dan Andreas was not nominated for his extraordinary performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave me the best performance I ever saw by an actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I understand this in the 1940s but Dan Andrews shows her romantic interest in an exceptional wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Roy Til, who played right-wing right-wing, was famous for portraying the "sage" of Bonana, a few years later. <br /> 7. South Professor has written that the film is running slow, annoying and bad. More than likely the professor is unaware of the classic films. The beauty and significance of these stupid classics is that they are gradually running character studies that can avoid violence, excessive violence, and unwanted sex. <br /> <br /> *** I was surprised that my vacuum was valid among 3 people.
