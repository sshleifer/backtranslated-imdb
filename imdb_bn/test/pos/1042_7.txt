I always like Stanwick frequently, perhaps, in most of the 30s and 40s, was the most difficult actress, although her movie role is a few memorable Today he is most remembered for the TV show "Big Valley". Stanwick was very durable because he was durable; It seems that he would take any role, and most of it would make the movie successful, and so the directors loved him and his many common images gained credibility with his presence. <br /> <br /> And so it was a "Christmas of Connecticut" a common practice whose plot created credibility and even not even about Christmas. However, along with Stanwick and Dennis Morgan, there are several characters including Sidney Greenstreet and SK. The fact that Sakal has so much of the plot twists and fun moments is that in 1945 they take longer than real. To begin, the plot expresses concern with a newspaper (Stanwick) that the newspaper's readers believe that it is married to a domestic goddess, child, and lives in a farm in Connecticut, but lives in New York City and does not know anything about cooking it. Housekeeping Even anyone could get away with such a fraud? Apparently, even if the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is cheated, even though someone would think that he will be seen for a long time after cheating, but the story is going on and Stanwick, Greenestridge, a sailor who recently survived his vacant ship (Morgan) and Stanwick's Strawitter Friend (SJDakal) Stenwik Barisal Krisma in Connecticut on a farm of boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner) Did not find myself spending. As a fraud you can imagine all the possibilities needed for it. Gardner wants to marry Stanwick, but she wonders how she can stand up to him. Morgan and Stanwick fall for each other but she is supposed to be involved and she is supposed to be married. However, they seem to start believing in the dance of cheeks cheeks off the cheek and stealing in a sleigh drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly silent Greenstone character that Stannieck and Morgan saw, goes away but still does not see that one of the neighbors has been borrowed as a cheating and calls to report the police kidnappings. Stanwick and Morgan were arrested for the theft and the hack started. <br /> <br /> At this time the movie is not funny, ridiculous hacks as funny or strange, and it ended like regular sculble comedy. The good guy gets the girl and probably they live happily afterwards. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie every year on Christmas so that this character can enjoy actors in their story that happened in 1945. A long held charm with Barbara Stanwyck. Thanks to the love of Christmas or 95% of Stanwick's movies that they forgot a long time ago and we will not see each year again.
