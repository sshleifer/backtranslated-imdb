Ou outer limit I love that show. It was extremely vague, or right down the mysterious. I like all the style of the ceremony, horror, from thriller to mystery, whatever it is, it was good. I guess it must start showing up after the course of cancellation, when Sci-Fi has been shown to run it again, or its marathon played. It was a really good show, I do not know anything about the season and everything but I remember that every time I saw the screen and said the voice of the TV: "There is no problem with your television." I am happy to be squeal with the picture. It was a good show and I enjoyed coming to see it. I give it a healthy 8 in 10.
