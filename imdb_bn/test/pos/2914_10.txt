This second cinemusic film based on Mica Walter's book is full of rich colors, beautiful music and panoramic philosophy. These plots are sometimes confused with spontaneous words, but in all things it has a strong social content: people are ruled by its emotions, and that each action has an equal consequence. But actually enjoy this film, watch the first movie, then read the book. Although different, it lays light shades on a whole lot that is not seen on the screen, and gives breath more and more of the sunu's depth.
