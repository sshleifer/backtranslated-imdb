I basically saw it because I think it's going to be the Seagel of progressive Gentlemen's League and this movie is going completely different here - a comedy! However, I like it anyway! <br /> <br /> <br /> Gentlemen's league is apparently some strange character and some British TV series with some sharp humor It's a British trick, so it's very stupid, wearing clothes and making fun of the Germans and the French, references to homosexuality - it's fun! <br /> <br /> This author revolves around authors. The television program has decided to cancel some characters and characters that prevent them from getting bogged down by the authors' level. It has a fun turn and lots of great scenes in this stupid adventure. I greatly appreciate the many times sunny and humorous brazen styles. It looks like Mr Bean drowning under water. (Rowan BlackAdder series is much better on BTV) <br /> <br /> This is not Monty Python, but you can not compare when you talk about Britain. Humor, and some similarities, but it does not have much to do with its own thing and being fresh. It's in the 'curiosity style' to young people and guest house Paradiso <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like it, then watch the movie The Young Ones Series and the Guest House Paradiso, and of course I guess the TV is a league in the Gentleman series, rather it's fun.
