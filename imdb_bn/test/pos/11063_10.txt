I grew up in New York City and every afternoon in the ABC 4:30 movie - Saratoga Trunk was like my first child, which I remember to see as a child. I liked this movie and it stayed with me for years. I recently saw it again and it still looks like it was cool - maybe I'm just romantic - but I thought it was good. I was not good because of this main actor only - I actually saw this movie when I do not know - I guess I knew the value of acting as a child only. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I particularly love seeing the old New Orleans during this movie. If you ever have a chance to see New Orleans, you should show those times that the city will show in that time - when you can see some of the French Quarter (not just Burb√•la Street) or Old Town's old homes, you really dreamed of living 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies - it feels good to me !!
