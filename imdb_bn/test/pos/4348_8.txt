<br /> <br /> Oh my words !! I have not seen any film that resolves any other matter than any moral verdict or autopsy. Michael Winner observes the validity of the human will to show the deep-damaged execution of the Gang-of-Tooth World. He is not allowed to eat spoons on the face of the head of the headbath, but he also showed us the spoon that he is feeding us and said, "Your observer is looking at yourself and ask the question: Are you enjoying it?" And even if you do not tell yourself It can not be !!!! You know that deep inside you know ... this is a wonderful composition
