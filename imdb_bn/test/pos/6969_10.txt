Horizon 4 might not be the best of the series, but it is not too bad, if you do not fully appreciate it you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> This plot is about a woman named Alexander, a former friend of Jonathan who breaks down in the museum and receives a red gem, he awakens James's dark facade, his boyfriend, but he needs a jewel so that he can live in the real world. You can enter and John is sent to hell. <br /> <br /> Something went wrong and Alex lost the jewel, so he needs to find a new one, because he leaves the gateway and two small obeses called Light and Drak appear. They are not really gaula because they look like a man wearing a mask like a troll dress, but they are not funny in any part because it is not a matter. <br /> <br /> Because of the light and darkness it is possible to send them back to their homes, because they try to find Janathan and create greatness. Another difference is that two guys are better boys like those unlike in earlier films. <br /> <br /> I got to be better in Gaoulis's fourth but this picture can not go for everyone, if you like less then check it out. Budget films like the Troll 2.
