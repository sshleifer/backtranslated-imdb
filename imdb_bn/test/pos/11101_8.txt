John Scheelsinger's career as a film director was outstanding. We saw this movie when it first came out, but it was only recently shown. This image looks like today, just as it is today, it is interesting due to the intense performance of two principals. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it, please do not read <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . Chris went to a seminar to be a priest, but gave up. Daulton became a small time drug user and trafficker. Two lives seem to be running parallel because these pairs have become involved in an illegal activity which will prove their concise approach. In fact, it shows how their efforts to fool both the young CIA and the Soviet Union fail. These two, on one hand, had such a great homage that they could drag big and even well-equipped people could not even imagine it. <br /> <br /> Chris's inspiration is valid, because he feels offended because of discovering the involvement of some of Australia's organizations that he deals with dealing with other nations, in this case, Australia is found to be a little coconut. When he engaged in the dolton, we know that the whole thing is destroyed because nobody will, as a drug, sometimes in some quantities. In fact, Chris and Dolton had no idea about what they were trying to do, or the consequences thereof. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton was at this time in his career, going to an actor's place. He proved his talent with his work in other films, so it was a normal choice for Mr. Schlesinger, which makes a good choice. Shan Pen, also a young actor who showed an intensity, as never before seen. Actually, sometimes, Mr. Pen, reminds us of Robert Young, a young man who has created us. Actor contributions to the film are both incredible. Some people can not play both of them, but they can not feel. <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman", although not as similar to other great John Schlesinger movies, it is not interesting to us, too far behind.
