I have always watched all the way through the Grand Prix at least twice. I enjoyed the story of the movie, the characters and the actors were not bad. It is refreshing to see a G-rating movie. This is a good feeling movie. Most of the story is from children's perspective. The interaction between kids and adults makes the story interesting. If you are looking for a family film then I recommend this movie If you like Little Rascals, then you will probably enjoy this. I saw this movie on the wire. Is either double or on the showtime family. This is not a movie that I went to see in the theater. However, I only go to theater for big screen effects, so most comedy, romantic movies, plays I do not go for a big screen - I wait for the TV / version only. Get your kids together, pop some popcorn and enjoy!
