Joan Cusack stole the show! The compound was good, the plot line was attractive and the plaque was just fine. The story of a gay man's arrival was very positive when it was very easy that it is not usually very positive. Then again, it's fiction. :) All in all an entertaining romp. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed is the "inside-joke" aspect. As the target audience was probably straightforward, they could not get the "gay" elements relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> One aspect of his acting skills has been shown by Kevin Collins that writers sometimes do not take into account the idea of ​​kine for any part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> this symbol hits.
