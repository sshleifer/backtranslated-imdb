Did not watch the film in his commercial debut, we just caught it through the DVD. The worst expectation, "Hit" it proved a delightful experience due to the three principals. Thanks for the Instructions of Andy Tenant, the film is in smooth motion, and there are some winning moments in the predictable, comedy. <br /> <br /> "Date Coordinator" for the victims of the hit Albert will consider a hazard. Yet, Albert is a real person who can not ignore the same woman without a professional help. Enter the hit so that he is ready to overcome obstacles that he can overcome and Albert overweight and can not achieve social evil but he wins us because he really is in Manhattan <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Most production designers make a fundamental mistake while locals prepare for the Hollywood movie. The apartments that they have set up these characters rarely find that these people can live in this place by the magic of movies. Clearly, most of the filmmakers are working on the imagination because most of the city dwellers will kill imaginative places than the scenes that show in the movies, these same people depicted in this film can not afford them. <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a carimental actor. She has a unarmed way of charm without doing much. Although the film's surprise, Kevin James, who has not only won us as Albert, he has proved that he can hold himself in Mr. Smith's view. Eva Mendez hits as fine as the main interest. In small roles we see, among others, Adam Armin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport, and Philip Bosco. <br /> <br /> "Hit" is a fun film to see thanks to an Annie Tenant inspired aspects.
