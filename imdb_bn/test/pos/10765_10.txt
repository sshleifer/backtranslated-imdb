I was lucky enough to see at this year's Tribeca Film Festival. I was stunned by how wonderful this beautiful little film was and how entertaining. Director Grafin Dunne has done a great job to combine this film, which has many characters and several story lines that mix so smoothly and continuously. The main story involves the family and it is a very worrisome and exciting story that involves the audience in every vision. The film is fully fidelity and honesty, but it still has its commercial edge - if you want a "Indie" movie for the public. Cast performances are all excellent but those Diane Lane who shines bright. Diane Lane is just exciting and should be nominated for this fantastic movie. I know the first day, but Lane works his socks here.
