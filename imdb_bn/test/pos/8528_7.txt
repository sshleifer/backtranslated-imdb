In 1965, producer Kevin McLory-who was a partner in bond cinematic rights-associate with Ion Productions (Harry Salzmann and Albert Brockley), created the 2007 franchisee fourth film "Thunderball". Star San Connie, of course. <br /> <br /> In 1982, McLory won a legal battle and could create an "independent" bond film. "Never Say Never" (NSNA) is one of the two "unauthorized" 007 films made out of Eon (the other is the 1967 comedy Fault "Casino Royale"). NSNA plays a remake of "Thunderball" and its original bond, Shan Connie, after many years back in absence. <br /> <br /> The picture was released after a few months after "Octopussy" with Roger Moore. , 13th episode of Ion series. At that time, the press called him "war of bonds" ... In 1983, both films achieved great success, even if "octopacious" earned more money in the box office. <br /> <br /> <br /> NSNA is an exquisite filmmaker, director of the movie, "The Empire Strike Back", Director of Director of Exciting Technology, Director of "Hack of Array Riders" and screenwriter Lorenzo. Sample Jr. - wrote "Condor's three days" - in others <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A relatively unknown Kim Basing, Barbara Carr√© Person, Klaus Maria bryandauira, Max von pseudo, Edward Fox <br /> <br /> <br /> all the original ... the original "thandarabala" remains of the remains. It lacks many basic elements for a real bond film: There is no barrel sequence of traditional guns, "James Bond Theme", M and K are not played by traditional actors ... It is a copyright reason: EON only allows to use this material Is given. In short, the lack of atmosphere in the NSNA Classicistic 007 atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandwire is a very good villain and women (basing and carr) passionate and pretty. But the main highlight is Shaun Connie! He also played a big role, he is old but "diamond forever", even more free and just watched, his last performance in the role of British Super Spies before the NSNA
