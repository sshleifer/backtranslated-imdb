As much as I like Walter Martha, I felt most of her role was due to her personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He is a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. This role needs to be played in most of its other roles. The film was honest about how a professional could be dishonest to avoid the promise of a relationship. Her goal was to find ways to relate to a very young woman, but it should not be done in any way. Alii pretends to be his wife using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman). At any time in the film, pretending Mr. and Mrs. are actually believed that they actually got married. The last was good, because a middle-aged person considered it appropriate to follow someone of his own age. The movie was fun, entertaining, and not sold by the preacher.
