First of all, let me tell you that I've found films like Shawncunch Redemption and Green Miles, and Spielberg's most awesome and stomach bends. Although, the national valve of the surface is considered to be of the same trend and I fully enjoy what should be a cringe-worthy moment, sunny and fool around the world <br /> <br /> The basis of the plot, impossible as a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entered at the Grand National can certainly be, but it will take you to act as a fairy tale or metaphor only One thing There are characters in depth and throughout the story. Anne Reveyor gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the most wisest women portrayed in an American film. Her interaction with hearty Donald Crisp is fun and sweet. Although Leigh Taylor Margaret O'Brien (even BTWT) has tried very hard to be curious than to succeed, his passion and love for his horse shines with his face. Mickey Rooney gave the trainer beautiful performance. <br /> <br /> This is far from a perfect movie. Some situations and scenes are a little bit more dated (eg children's antics and runny scenes and for example in Pabor's scenes) but this is not the case. The plot character is true and still leaves quite unsafe. We have unmatched excessive dramatic and promotional moments - sometimes even lesser. The final scene is a great example - the physical conversation is kept in the filled viewer. <br /> <br /> Firmly mentioned performance, round letters, pithy dialogs, intelligent and internally consistent tales. We believe in the characters and are moved by their stories. Yup - they just do not make them more like this ...
