I saw this movie several times and every time I see it, becomes quirkier and funnier. Probably the 'punk' personality of Nicholas Cage or the chassis factor which was lacking in research because it was a common eight film ... Despite this, it is a funny story about a very funny, unique character. I think it's okay with "Fast Times" and "Curious Sciences" (Distinguished eight flights!)
