Bedrooms and Holidays are a film that lets you understand that the drama of life is hidden in detail. And that drama can be very fun! Though your own love life and your own friends may not be as unique as the characters of this movie, everyone is also forced to recognize themselves and others in the colorful novels of this film. And this is the great power of the bedroom and hallways, the satire of life is that the most confusing things can be the most interesting / funny / funny / sexy ... thing for you! Hope you enjoy the film as much as I do!
