The 1980's 'My Dinner and Andre', with Wallace Shawn and Andrei Gregory, is basically a conversation about the world and how it can affect and lift the soul. The 2005 'You Are Alone' shows how world events can sever the soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three main characters. A beautiful teenage student in Daphne talks about almost every decision in her life. Then, prostitution or paying escort, Britannia, as self-confident, Duffen is self-aware. What makes them interesting is that they do not share the same body, not the same person. The magic part of this movie is one of the early scenes where Daphne reaches a room in an old hotel. He stopped and probably leaked by the decision not to hit the door ?? But it can enter Brittany's door openly and openly. <br /> <br /> Body on the other side of the door, if no one is middle-aged, but find the personal qualities anyone wants interesting. As far as he entered the room, he was confronted with a conflict about Britain's chosen profession. However, we soon learned that the body of the next house of Body Duffen and that he saw the growth of women from small girls in years of growth. This thing complicates things for viewers. Buddy is just a neighbor's neighbor or does she want something else? <br /> <br /> If Buddy wants to have sex, she is here. Britney loves sex His definition may be Clintonac, but he does not read his encouragement. He likes older men and is invited to choose from his clients that plastic wristbands wear an empor dress. Does each color band indicate a specific job that he will perform ?? But the band is broken off of her wrist and the choice is not made unnecessarily until just no action is expressed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The body is stroked by multiple men, but her legs and muscles area is buried by a woman in the blood red lingerie. The image is just coming. <br /> <br /> One of the body's unfortunate life recognitions. He lost his wife, dog, even the next trick of youth even his fantasy. It is not a special incident that he brought Dafen or Brittany in this special hotel room. On the wall of the dinner plate, there is an image just next to the head of a fish. This body is a perfect metaphor for life; Good part is all over. So here, where he was a college student, he brought his wife, he made his stand ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main act of the hotel room serves as a strong anchor for the film, which is by many inter-cut scenes Helps add characters, their situation and levels of collision. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film progresses, she asks Buddy if she wants to get her out. She said yes, but she only painted her underwear. An actual prostitute will probably remove all her clothes (the job gets one five). But it is not bad that we are disturbed, we are After the film ends we see that people have deep emotions and inspirations. A comb does not work until it is actually delivered. There's Britney, so you're 'alone'.
