I think consensus is consistent with the recent TV miniseries: It's OK but it's a lot of crying from "Looneymo Dovo". This is only because of the prevalence of that famous story. <br /> <br /> "Kommech Moon" certainly a fan in the west. Do not just hope to be as intense as "alluring doves". Steve Johann and Karl City are not Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play, how Duval and Jones portray the same two are not strong. Some say it is not wrong to criticize this movie relatively well, but you have to compare it - this is the story of the two leading Texas Ranger characters: "Udro Call" and "Gus McKay." <br /> <br /> <br /> The main difference, I find that these estimates are very slow and more related (two rangers and their women) occasionally. Nevertheless, I do not think the two main ladies were beautiful women and generally preferred and acceptable people. They played nicely by Linda Cardlini ("Clara Forrest") and Elizabeth Bank ("Maggie"). They helped to make this long film playable. If you saw the pictures of the women of the Old West, none of them showed cardinalini and half like banks. They had a joy for the opening of these male eyes. Maggie's son "Newt" was a very nice kid - just like a boy wanted to have a baby. <br /> <br /> The most decent character, I thought "Kil in the Eyes School" Like the western film, "Tombonstone", Kilma often steals theft from the show. "Skull" is really an original, if I ever saw one: a strange dude, indeed. <br /> <br /> In fact, here, from all helpful actors Keith Robinson's "Dates" did a fine job as "Buffal Hump" from Wes Studi. I think the studio is impressive, she does not play any role. I wish these miniseries had a big role. <br /> <br /> This film is common with one "Lonesome Dove" and other good westerns: Scenery and photography. It's just a nice time to watch and enjoy. We have excellent directors of this movie: Simon Winasser, who runs "Loneme Dove" and another extraordinary TV Western "Crossfire Trill". He has also made two other favorite feature films, which are located in his own country in Australia: "fan lap" and "qigli down under." Unfortunately, although I've enjoyed it, the movies mentioned above are "nothing like nothing" as mentioned above. However, I still saw it all and sorry it ended, if it does not make any sense. I want to see it again in the Woodrow and Gus, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: The title page is 360 minutes. That TV Advertising must be included. I saw two disc versions were about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
