It's funny to scream (well, that's a little sad if you see Bruce Hospital scene). <br /> <br /> Both Ted Raimi and Stacy Keech are both excellent and valuable observers. Sure, this is not a big budget-controlled blockbuster, and BTW-women are wonderful in their part, even though I do not know from other movies, I want to show them again. <br /> <br /> The two brain walking scenes are inspired and certainly for a fantastic showcase of Bruce Bruce - he's a delicious guy! <br /> <br /> Thank you Bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!
