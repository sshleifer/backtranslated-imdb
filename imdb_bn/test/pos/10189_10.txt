I recently visited Magic State as an adult with my mother, her best friend and my adult sister. Disney World is often mistakenly perceived as a place for children, but when you see quality shows like Mickey Phil Pharmmagic, you realize that Disney's magic is for everyone! We left the theater and turned around and got a line that was a great show. And then a third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I would encourage anyone who wants to go to Disney World to check out this event, which is not just a show but a world-wide wind, a fun filled ride with Donald, because once again he let his anger get worse!
