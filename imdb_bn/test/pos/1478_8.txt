I'm rating this pretty high because of Sam Eliot. I could work without woman's nudity but if Sam watched his stuff strut I would almost sit through any nonsense. He has surprisingly enthusiastically wrecked deviation, in which I agree with most, and it is glad to play a role that he really is only standing beside the roam and encouraging him instead of seeing the viral. My boyfriend thinks that this movie is similar to a movie that was a Hispanic partner of Ed Harris (in this sense of the word!) Who was more interested in proving himself. You can draw your own decision, but if you like Sam, you'll love it. Can you say I bet, but by no means? I want to buy a heart at the DVD!
