The film follows a bunch of NYC High School students of Performing Arts. Coco (Irene Car) is a black singer who will take the top despite everything. He helped Bruno (Lee Karen) with a white musician. Then Doris (Maureen Tiffy) who wants to be an actress - but she is shy and frightened. He became friends with Matgomari (Paul McCracken) - who was the only gay student in school and romance Raul (Barry Miller). Then Leroye (Jean Anthony Rey - who died sadly in 2003) who is a violent and great dancer - but can not read. Then various teachers (Albert Hagg, Anne Moin Stand Out) are trying to teach the kids. <br /> <br /> The songs are great (title tunes and "Out of My Own" was nominated for the best song - "Fame" won), dance energetic and young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent. But this picture missed the boat in the drama section. Many plots are brought to the line and the film ends in the end. Why is cocoa a porno? Do Doris and Raoul lie together later? Or did it create? How about Montgomeri - What happened to him? And Leroy has graduated ever - and how? There are many long lectures (there are two rauls) and moments that are just nothing to do. I think the script has diminished somewhat - I can not believe that the movie has kept it open. <br /> <br /> Still, acting and again, valuable to watch music. Basically there is no full power of bad songs and dance (and at one stage the traffic is off - literally!). My favorite "fame", "out here ..." and "I do physical electric songs" is a great stop song. So I recommend it but it might give a 7 - the script was really needed to close the loop end - and it did not. <br /> <br /> TVA: They wanted to shoot this image on the actual school. Performing Arts but not getting permission. The Dean of the school read the script and said that the film had too much oath. This is true - there is a lot of criminal language, but how do children in high school speak. Avoid TV version which unreally overdubs it.
