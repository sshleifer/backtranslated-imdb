Dirty dance - I think everyone saw it at one point or another at the moment. I can remember this movie as a child who likes it, and without seeing fatigue, I see him again. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a little bigger, I recently bought the DVD and were still not frustrated with the performance <br /> <br /> Swayze and Gray created the atmosphere for this movie, although they claim that they do not, Chemistry of the movie is incredible! As film returns, we are sucked into their relationship, and believe every single of their actions. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is amazing, music only adds romantic mood to the movie and adds relationships between baby and patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene created this movie, who could ever forget the famous line "Nobby keeps the baby in the corner." The song is perfect and the dance is amazing! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie at any age, it is a funny movie that anyone can enjoy 8/10.
