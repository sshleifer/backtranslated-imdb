I love other reviews of this movie. They mirror my attitude I'm a 70s, minus disco and "star wars" kids. Without a Chase scene, there was nothing great about this movie. It was good because it was solid, basic and profitable. Roy Skider operated the film, which was based on the crew 7 compromise, which supported the "French connection" Gene Hackman. Among these people were credible and average, those who burned their coffee, they were scared in the cross scene and almost lost it after the nearly closed crash. <br /> <br /> It's probably easy to tell you what it's impossible to do. There was no fancy weapons, just sawed the original revolver and shutdown off crude. There was no solid man philosophizing, Ala Tarantino. There was no Kung Fu or samurai nonsense and there was no novel technique. There was no clever person who managed some complex projects based on hundreds of things, which was in the way he planned with others' reactions. The criminals were bad people but they did not shoot people for hell. In fact, there were only three body members. Some days that the average movie will pass the opening credit these days. It could be a G movie today! No bus has been kidnapped for children of orphan school, nor does terrorists threaten to kill half of the city. There was no high-tech hygiene, or the crime was not very moving or impressive, I found that the most technical thing was the touch-tone wall phone. It was no subplots or amusing character development. Also, in addition to a woman or woman, except for the wife of a church, who screamed like a hero, cried like a badie. <br /> <br /> It was such a small official who contacted the local population and the police. Local mobsters kidnapped for some easy payoffs. Organizers Vito was created by Tony Lo Biencono, who did a good job as Ray Schneider, Body 7 was a compromise policeman, whom he had told and exploited. What ever happened to Tony Lo Bianco, he looked like a pasino shoe, looking good and talented? This is what a simple crime story was a great NYC backdrop. That position is shameless and dehumanizing without a sociological study. It was a common plot that was involved in the abduction plan, where a Badi police officer was involved in the incident, literally, incidentally, was eventually shot dead. Body and his 7 ups both the Hot Dog Unit, NYPID Brass and Mumbai thought that he was involved, because the abductors forced them to follow the police after being treated with spices. Obviously mobsters figured they were the lawyer and the right to protect from their normal police. Even the brains were not plain, old and ugly, no godfather royalties, or implanted hipnas. <br /> <br /> This is a good basic movie, with a standout Chase scene between two 70 de Pontiacs. Even cars like acting and story were simple and profitable, even the GTO or Trans mango. Batman uber-hype or "24" Intensity At the levels of the days of the Judgment Day, this film reminds us that less good. It should be shown to movie screen writers and managers that without stuttering, eventually stunts, gadgets and shoes humiliate us with psychological behavior.
