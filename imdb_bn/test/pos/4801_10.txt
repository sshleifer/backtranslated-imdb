Mexican poet, writer and diplomat Octavio Paz, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said about "Nazneen": "Following the great tradition of mad spaniens invented by the Nazarene Servants, the crazy insanity tries to try and try according to the bus." A modest and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabble an amazing performance) tried to live by Christian principles, but after leaving a local prostitute he went out of his church to help with shelter. In the 20th century, Mexico traveled the streets of Najrin, offering alms for food supplies to help the poor. Two of his followers, a murderer prostitute Andara and her sister, Batteries, who are unable to find free suicide for suicide, feel satisfied, but they do not prevent them from hating and humiliation from both sides of the street and from the church, because of hatred and humiliation. He ended up being beaten in prison and started questioning his faith without being able to forgive his attacker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Boonuel narrated the story of a Christian principle with praise and sarcasm for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The picture is simple and deep, as well as beautiful, satirical and heartwarming. <br /> <br /> I think Bunuwel is one of the best filmmakers ever. I have seen his 20 films and all of them are involved in various periods of his life, but their magic touch is common, malicious realism and supernaturality, his curiosity, his worldly mind, the sense of humor, and his dark and burning imagination. I'm very pleased with the fact that I'm a little loved and almost unknown but surprisingly clear and touching the supernatural tragedy-comedy "Nazarine" on the list of my favorite films.
