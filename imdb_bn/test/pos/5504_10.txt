I think this movie misunderstood most of Jerry's Lewis career. It's a little slow, but it's very fun after it's gone, and Jerry has never used the mockery of the previous movie ... ie, who is The Store of Minding, Nutty Professor, etc., the concept is a knock of Dirty Dozen, Instead of suicidal missions in the movie of the death of the soldiers in death, you have 4, 4-F and 2 tags. Former L.A. Dosers All Star Centerfilder, with Willie Davis Link! extremely happy! Love that movie
