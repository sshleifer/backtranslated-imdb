I show respect to MTV by watching this show, although I think MTV is seeing this haphazard, radioactive element as its main selling point and it is very concerned with the relevant facts published. <br /> <br /> I write and play songs for a living and this show makes me really emotional. For me, Wondershowzen most gives a complete distinct function to the TV. Instead of spoiling or confusing the senses (which can often be nice sometimes), it raises my right and wrong attitude. It makes me very uncomfortable, but very comfortably. <br /> <br /> I do not think many visitors exploit most of this show, but if they do, they will be able to communicate with television viewers everywhere.
