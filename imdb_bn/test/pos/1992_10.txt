David Craneberg's 'Existhenge' is a well-designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It solves problems of culture that are connected to technology that it can not distinguish between imagination and reality or biological and mechanical. The film gives a glimpse of the audience with the transformation of mechanical technology with organic, metabolic one. In this context, technology is capable of being part of the human body. After the virtual reality game of 'exstenzed', it seems to be a game in the real world, and as a result, after the game is over, people's behavior changes to apply violent game requests. In exhaustion, the technology has originated from biological sciences in the human nervous system directly from the plug-in; A concept that reflects the beliefs of Marshall McLuhan, a well-known media theory, that computers enhance the human consciousness. An example of a telephone, such as a telephone, an expansion of the television eye, the telegram is an extension of the central nervous system, which enhances the consciousness of the high-tech virtual reality. In EXISTENZ, technology is biological and thus thus more human in our world. But technology became biological, people became more mechanical and so less free, unable to prevent their play-protest. eXistenZ simulation of a virtual reality human being Gene Baudrillard has conveyed his Simulacra and Simulation descriptions of his book in a mediocre society, which has appeared in all capacities to work. The world itself has been accepted into a pure simulation. Buddhist mediating society in the ecosystem is seen to attack the attack on the body, damage control and transform one's own transformation with others. <br /> <br /> When you are exhausted, gradually replace with another identity of consciousness, your role in the game, reflecting the real life subconscious of each person. You step-by-step to the step-by-step step-by-step. For Bowdilard, 'Simulations or Simulacra, more than real, has become higher.' Our hyperrebration of Craniberg Computer Simulation worldwide, 'Now it seems, and, all the motives and objectives, which are more real than the real world.' (Baudrillard) can be basically called 'Experience', the purpose of the game is quite metaphorical. Because you do not even know the experience until you experience it. Existentials say that without proper explanation, the life is irrational, extinguishers are also odd. Croniberg, miraculously reflects the ignorance of our lives. For example, in the game, other roles stand until you ask them a pre-programmed question. And when you put their pointless fun in the representation of our lives, then the open irrationality really gets shaken. <br /> <br /> To understand what the theme of the game is? This hidden metaphor makes the question busy with access to the game. They have no doubt about their existence, but they do not know the underlying cause of their existence. Summary <br /> <br /> The existenceists believe that people do not have any specific nature or material, such as other animals and plants; Every man makes that choice by making his own nature. In the formation of the 20th century French philosopher Jean Paul Sarthe, the meaning of existence is from the east. 'Choice is so central to human existence, and it is inefficient; Even a choice to refuse to choose. Freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. Since people are free to choose their own path, the creators argue, wherever they accept the risks and responsibilities of following the promise of its leadership. 'Perhaps I want to mention,' Exsthenzed 'also works with the idea of ​​preferred freedom. You achieve your final role in the game by taking the right decision. If you do not play the game becomes overwhelming and annoying. So, you play, start asking your existence than your existence. You suddenly become aliens schizopfrenically from the game and understand your position outside the game. As well as the last word, Existence is the opposite of a well-designed lifestyle simulation. This is how it exists. <br /> <br />
