I saw life on vacation, when it was filmed at a movie festival in Florida. It's a beautiful surprise to find an amazing or non-exploitable British movie. A beautiful romantic comedy for change, which is ready for spectator pants to sit and enjoy the mild motion of the film. I got a little confusion in the narratives of scenes, but it seems that love life is a winner, a ruby ​​in dust. One for all the families. A beautiful change to see a British film for teen listeners that are not annoyed with the words of four letters. Try and see it.
