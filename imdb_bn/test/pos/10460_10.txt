I do not need to repeat the synopsis presented by Glenn. At that time black and white representations are more powerful to illustrate the dark life of the village. A deeper measure of friendship shown to the two older sisters is touched by heart strings. Supporting Cast is excellent and their performance is fantastic, since the entire character completely depends on it, since it would not be justified in a single unit of character. I'm not a professional critic, why I am so rating this film so I can not keep my finger properly; Due to the scenes of this kind of movie, the viewers can always not agree with my ratings.
