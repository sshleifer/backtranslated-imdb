I still count "Police Squad!" As the ultimate fun TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere, Beta Max is not low, I have all six episodes. I knew that this show would not end and I would have to save it for myself. How stupid ABC was? Visitors did not know that "Police Squad!" It was a comedy because it was a ridiculous track! Right! When there is a line like the drebbin, "You take the possibility of getting up in the morning, driving to work, or putting your face in the fan." How comedy can be? !!? I've seen every episode at least ten times and still missed something which I missed before. Even deeper backgrounds always have gags running. If you have an opportunity to watch a episode, do not miss it, but if you read it, then you probably have some copies that you already have.
