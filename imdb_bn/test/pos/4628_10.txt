It was riveting. I just could not look away The film is rolling as I think it was strong and confronted, but I did not understand how intense it would be. <br /> <br /> The movie offers unfortunately daily life insights for many school kids. Some of us live outside the environment and do not know what is going on and will not walk. <br /> <br /> This movie will be specially seen, only to see a glimpse of what their children are doing. Often parents consider their children's problems trivial, but unfortunately they are huge in a high school. And unfortunately the problems can move towards a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Definitively everyone must see.
