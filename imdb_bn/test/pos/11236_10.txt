A key series by VIP Ki, the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca), has made big scores with this entertaining, yet inspirational gameshow. This show is hosted by four fun, handsome faces that judge their 'games' (the ability to choose women). Each episode has two favorite games that go to Head-to-Head in various pick-up games. Among the exclusive Toronto Night-Club VIPs are three different categories and the winner scores a night. <br /> <br /> Being a person, I naturally think of this shot as fun. We all know that women are difficult to face, and these guys spark the curiosity of men naturally. Those who compete in this show might even give you a few pointers - if you pay attention.
