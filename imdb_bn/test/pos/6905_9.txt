This photo I recently saw was a breath of fresh air from the Hollywood shit load. Acting is fantastic and character engaging and surprisingly respectable. The story is not really so much, it is easy and it works well. Just a simple film to sit and enjoy. The mood was fantastic and the set really helped push along with the movie and gave some nice visuals. The film is perhaps a horrible aspect, but it has been made more and more in some interesting aspects. You will not smile high laughter with this one, but you will smile the whole way through. Humor works very well with characters and does not hit the superb acting. Based on the fact that Ron Perlin was in it, I really saw this movie. I am a little smaller than his role, but it does not matter; The rest of the cast is not enough ones to keep you involved. If you like the horror, see this. If you like the comedy, see this. Just go ahead and see whatever this is, it's really nice.
