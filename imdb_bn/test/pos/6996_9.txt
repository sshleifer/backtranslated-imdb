I like Alien as a Sci-Fi movie fan. But the pitch black is definitely better than the Alien 3 and Alien: The Resurrection. It maches well into the alien series But it's not alien, it's something else. OK, enough comparison. This movie but I think: Why are people afraid of darkness? You can not run away from the darkness. It's impossible. You will face with darkness and with that, what is dark. In this movie, I also like Vinc Diesel's character Richard B. Reddick was not usually a good boy. She was a secret and she did the bad thing in the past. He is the hero to other people who try to protect all of them. First, he wants to find himself out of that planet. These stories have other metaphors. Every big sci-fi fan will see this picture.
