People who compare this movie to large blockbusters like Load of the Rings or Matrix will definitely be frustrated with the way this movie is playing. Although it lacks special effects division and there is no war with hundreds of additional forces, yet there is a balanced combination of two old folk tales. Acting talent, though not a list, is still great and the interaction between characters is probably more cordial than a large cast with a listed cast. From this film my special favorite Bridget Fonda, whose performance was played as Snow Queen, was widely supported by a great dress and makeup. Injecting a sense of humanity and stone into the character of the season season polluted by Satan's evil magic. Apart from Fonda, it was not what we expected from Hollywood, which is a good thing because of coming out of the idea of ​​how to train his acting talent to describe Hollywood's role and so they have become old and dependent. For those who use our same technique to take away CGI and other special effects from our actors. Instead, this new idea shows some of the more realistic thinking of actors that they can find new variations in the old themes of love and danger.
