All right .. you guys have to sit! This movie is not that bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! I must admit that I was never a fan of Lily Sobiski, but she grew up on me in this movie. I think Josh Hartnet is looking good, but Cham Klein is the most fantastic man I saw !!! She is good for that movie for me. Virgin girls .. When there is no shirt near her and goes to the water, I know your face is diminished. Yes, I know at the beginning that he was a jerk, but eventually he realized how he acted and learned to be a great person. If he could not come to the end ... then I would have been crazy. I do not need to say a few lines, but all this is a great movie! I definitely recommend it!
