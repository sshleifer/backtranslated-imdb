I think some people miss about great science fiction that it predicts some part of the future. A dramatic movie that I can remember, predicts that a disaster will occur when the space shuttle went on to study Halley's comet! There was some difference: "Churchill" (film shuttle) actually went to Comet, "Challenger" was only in orbit of low Earth; "Churchill" was burnt inside only, where "Challenger" exploded - hello had to go back to Earth. One great harmony (and this is always bad luck!) Both mixed male / female workers were - Holly's comet and the legend of disaster continued! <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say than this movie that was not called before. It does not provide any new things separately as external space / science fiction / horror / sexual movies, but it is a combination of all the great food that counts. And taken together, it was a very original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just want to eradicate her prey from other parts of Matthala's body.
