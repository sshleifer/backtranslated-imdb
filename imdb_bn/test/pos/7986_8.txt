There is no doubt about the best Batman movie of the 90s. This movie is a city filled with insecurity and nightmares. <br /> <br /> While villains are a bit cheesy, they are colorful but sensible for the night-sounding cinematography movie. <br /> <br /> Performance is really cool and the comic tones behind them really give the expectation. <br /> <br /> Chess is not fooled by the parties, it is a movie in the pure style of Burton. That can not be described; Burton was the director of a Suu Kyi genera who had taken Batman's franchise on another dim level, but did not forget his angular style. <br /> <br /> If everyone is recommended for fans of the action movie related to Super Heroes.
