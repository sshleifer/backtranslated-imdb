Two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Von) and Gordon Ramsie (Jake Weber), a cracking crayble about a child psychologist, Catherine Dane (Jennifer Lopez), and a fantastic thriller, who used Cart Sanger's (Vincent D'Aferni√®re) to treat her. Serial killers (using strange and terrible torture techniques) are found in a coma by feds. What Novak wants Novark to return from Daven is the last victim of Sturgers and if he is alive. Daneren falls in the mind of Sturger, which combines similar relation and atmosphere with the color combination of David Lynch's "Dunne" or "Blue Velvet" and Wes Kraveen's "Alum Street at a Nightmare". Because a young man (a Jack Jack Thomas), Frederick Kruger, is like a man disguised as a rage bird. I do not want to give up at all, but in addition to dynamite performance, Howard Shore scores and directs the unclear musical instruments (by Tarsem, who can indicate here that he can direct).
