"Door Torture at Dcling" (1972) is a horrific gentleman, Grade A thriller from Lucio Flori. This one, someone has been strangling ancestral sons in a rural, southern Italian village and, there are many suspects, usually for this gialli. Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia), you see more scrapattiites than you have ever seen, a rich girl is hiding after a drug scandal; Florida Balkan (Martier), local missile Voodoo female; Her witchcraft-practice bees; Zeusep, local rebel; Sweet masked chaplain; Her drunken mother; It seemed to be there. The film has some unusually violent set pieces, among which one of the main characters of a cemetery is identified with a chain whip (one of the most realistic bloody sequences I've seen) and a Nifty Duoout. The crack of the violence in this movie compensates for the saying that there is no fear or doubt about the speech. Yet, this Gyilo fascinates fascinates with unusual scores by its unusual rural backdrop, child murder, weird characters, and Ridge Adalolani. It is believed that Monte Sant'Angelo is near the Adriatic in South Italy, which is photographed beautifully (at least, thanks to the credit card closure of the city's police force). And when subtitling will make this fine-cut DVD work even better (American Slang is not convinced in this rural Italian setting), Thanks for thanking me for another work. Oh ... that title finally makes perfect sense!
