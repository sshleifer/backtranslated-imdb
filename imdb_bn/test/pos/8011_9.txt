I have seen this program till my tendency but still I have been able to respond in many situations that we were when we were thirteen years old, but it was a family-based show. By the middle of the 90's, it gave more attention to young adults and their condition. <br /> <br /> I like "step by step" for this reason. I mean, it provided conditions for every age and on behalf of many such programs, it provided expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest; This was not a very funny show, but it was in some situations that you can only relate to but only fun. <br /> <br /> There was a very good charm among Patrick Duffy and Susan Somers. Duffy rock! Sommers were flexible and actually fun. I love Stacy Kigon because she was very sexy (she loves her legs) and witchcraft. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with her codish character. The man came back on that day! Oh, memories. Nowadays, this program has not been properly favored for the new generation, and for this reason it should be kept in memory vaults. It's just memory. <br /> <br /> Thank you step by step to please my young man.
