1. I saw Branhaus Hamlet: Branag speaks with a very old, often spoken word (unwittingly funny!) - is not a traitor Hamlet, and the qualities of its managers - the poor! (See also Edo not having anything from Branhigh - The funny part of the dialogue is not talking about the mistakes of the man because of most dialogs!) 2. I saw Hamlet 2000: I think the scene is a fun idea - but such ridiculous actors - all of them 3. Osborne Wales Hamlet OK - but this is the best of BBC Hamlet! Derec Jacobi is a believer - thinks a bit of a crazy - very suitable! And Patrick Stewart - wonderful, and Claire Bloom is a very interesting queen. The actor that you believe says - I think it is best appreciated.
