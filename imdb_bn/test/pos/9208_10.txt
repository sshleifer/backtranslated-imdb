I want to vent my dissatisfaction at NBC canceling Las Vegas. The show has been the top note for the past 5years. The addition of Tom Sellecks was great. She really brought a nice fresh join to show. What is NBC now? Lum's reality and night time game show. I mean to keep old and tired law and order? Putting Jack MacCo as DA can not keep appealing interesting. Let's keep quality programs like Gee-like deals or no deals or ed? ER should be out of cattle. NBC was bad now in the days of East CNFLead Cheers. With cable and the Internet, NBC can not be flat on its face. Bring the backgrounds! I remember when homeyceide life on the street ended. At least they were finalizing the two-hour series. What are you listening to CBS? It's a great show to pick sculptures.
