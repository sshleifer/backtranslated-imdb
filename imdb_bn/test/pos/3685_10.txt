We love this movie because it was very entertaining and close bits - not your usual Hollywood wine. <br /> <br /> My husband was Blockbuster Coupon and went away with a string of violent Hollywood Stuff new versions. When he saw this he was about to walk and decided to take an opportunity. There was only one copy - and with some glit in the DVD we were finally forced to flip the Wide Screen version and then return to the full version of the screen so that it stopped. But it was worth it. Kathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role. And he could sing! <br /> <br /> If Huoload learns from independent filmmakers! Maybe we will go back to the original movie. But for now, we're really sticking with beat off and really entertaining films like this! Other examples we've enjoyed include: A box full of moon light, April piece, Milo, Celestine prediction. Most of Christopher's guests are: Shock is the best, for your consideration, a strong wind and waiting for Goffman
