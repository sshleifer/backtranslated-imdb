This movie is just one of my best-known movies. It took years for me to take this film and it was good. The film is called anti-drug campaign, but not even half-way through the film. Seeing their desires in the face of the players, they receive donations of drugs, who observe it. Her drug-induced life till the end of the PF, in the final stage, Heroin comes for her statement. Dad! This is a drug-message message that was so incredibly demanded. Soundtrack butt kicks for this movie! So far, it is one of the best albums of Pink Floyd! If ever opportunity, take a spectacular view of the movie to see, look, and take the moment.
