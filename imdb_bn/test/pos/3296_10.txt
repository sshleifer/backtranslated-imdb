This twisted comedy is well played and directed. Extremely funny and outstanding in production quality. Why this little picture has been accepted so much festival and won the awards is easy to see. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Kevin with bad days, bad weeks, bad life. Travis Davis plays a fantastic role! As Richard Richard Mole is dark and foreboding that this film just gives the right twistedness. The old man adds humor to the story. And those who love goldfish will not love! <br /> <br /> This little smile will bring a lot. And do not miss the credit as they are playing in the end!
