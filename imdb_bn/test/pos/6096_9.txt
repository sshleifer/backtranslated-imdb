This will be one of the funest Danish movies ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas B Larsen delight while running across Sweden. I do not know how Ulrich Thomsen did it, but by any means he can manage to play insane in a very simple way. But if you can not understand Danish (I'm not mentioning your pastry here) Do not waste your time this time ?? I do not think it would work with subtitles.
