This film played Lexington Keyyay for 7 days. I saw it on the last day of its run and expressed regret that I could not recommend it to others because it is a movie that is crying for the Big Screen experience. The aircraft shot is an excellent compilation, when these two main characters flirt over the deck - when ballooning away from the equally crowded dock - these ballots and sex workers are often more often than many clear films. I just wanted to think that more people will not have the chance to see this fine movie in the theater; DVD experience does not have to be the same. Here's an idea: If you are in a college city then see if you can lobby to show in the campus film festival.
