I'm borrowing a series of DVDs from some emotional brother, I'm hoping to return the first few episodes and return it. I just screamed at the end of the first season of Cliff-Hanzar - just a week later and I saw the whole season. I have no idea where I've found time for this. <br /> <br /> This show is great. It does not take itself very seriously, it has good character like good actors and special effects (ignoring the strange valve puppet here and there) it is "special" that is enough to feel polished. At first, I did not realize it was mostly pictured here, and it seemed impossible to hear many accesive accents in a Sci-Fi show - it was the most fun to return to Sydney through the original character (John). First season <br /> <br /> I believe the creators of the scene must have seen this scene, the biggest strength of this show. They have gradually introduced new aspects of character, which explains previous actions and stole public conversations with a fun and irrational slang. On top of this, seeing the whole Voyager and the next general series, I see a small plot rip-off - so it has been able to maintain the basicity of originality throughout the season. I hope the rest is good. <br /> <br /> Similar to the other forms of cybercrime I've enjoyed in the past. I have heard that the first three were not as good as the fourth season, and now I am very upset that they rejected it five years ago. I hope they will revive this show - in a movie or any other series with the same movies. I would be ashamed to leave many plots line unnecessary, because I imagine that with a program that has so much thought, it must be kept unattended without sufficient caution. <br /> <br /> Go to the whole ... Sunfel in the second season after returning to my brother's place. <br /> <br /> V.
