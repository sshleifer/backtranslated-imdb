It was a great 1981 film, which was accompanied by three men and two daughters who went on camping trip together and went through thick forests and high mountains with a great water fall. This group manages the property owned by George Kennedy (Roy McLinn) who plays the role of Forest Ranger and runs a white horse. Roy McLean warns the youngsters where they are not going to camping, and they will be back again. Of course, these young people do not pay attention and swim a ball in the nude around the fall of the water and play lots of music and dance or lots of beer and wine in the fire. An old wooden room is a school house that is filled with cheeks and boys and it starts from that point and becomes very scary. There is an occasion when a young woman has to climb up the tree and start cutting the tree to move away from the body of her body. Do not miss this picture, there are plenty of things to do.
