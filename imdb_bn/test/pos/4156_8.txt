A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man tortured a middle-aged woman with a criminal paradigm, after returning home after lunch in the toilet shop. A Romanian girl who has seen everything, has reported what. <br /> <br /> So, in Romania, debates about the very severe flow of immigrants, by generalizing them as criminals, everyone is arbitrary. <Br /> <br /> I'm not just 15, but I thought: What is the concept of the prosperity of this poor people in Italy? How much land will they give us? Yesterday I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question was an answer. When you have only one donkey and some goats, that campaign postcards show the United States as land with milk and huge vegetables, so it's an impression. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a heavenly symbol (river of milk, sight, game and mountain of screams) , Name and character Lucy / Luce) and cruel reality (the mass of the hopes of the ship, the method of Alice Island). There is a mixed cast from angel Charlotte Gainsberg, realistic Vincentjo Amtou, until the bitter and Aurora Quatrochi are like moms. But was it really difficult to enter the new world?
