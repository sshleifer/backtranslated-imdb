Charlie Knight starred Sarah Ranna, who moved away from her marriage to Long Island's housewife who discovered her when she was pregnant. He plans to drive in America's heartland and start new ones. She is calling herself a 'killer' who is way to pick up a friendly hitchhiker (James Ear). Soon he discovered that the 'murderer' of good nature actually damaged the brain and chose him as an unofficial, and took a huge responsibility. Both of them were driven to Nebraska, where a worker was given a job to help Sara's killer on the reptile farm in the street. Here Saradha meets Gordon with a local police officer, and soon everything becomes a terrible mistake for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is a strong drama about people disconnected from society, imposed on them by others who are separated by their preferences or limits. With such a low budget and very relaxed attitude, the film is able to retain what it needs to say by clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex, divided role and has some scary acting moments by her. One of my favorites is when he is on the telephone for the first time to call his worried husband in his house. It is such a breathtaking view on both ends, and in each small gesture and a word modification, so much about her is spoken with. Then comes the character of 'killer' played by James Kane. This character is unlike what I have seen him, and he performs wonderfully. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the flashbacks Good with long shots in some important scenes with graphic and customizable contrast. Also, because this image was based throughout the United States, it offers an attractive, authentic look in America in the late 1960's. <br /> <br /> I did not see many other films by playing Mrs. Knight. I'm simply known about her more recent work on television, usually playing a nasty girl or a dotty old lady. It was so great to see her young, beautiful, and wonderful fine in this movie. It is also shameful that James Kahn has become a typist for the 'tough guy' for the rest of his career, because this picture proves that he is much more capable than him.
