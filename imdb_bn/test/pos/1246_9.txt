I liked this movie very much. Yes, there was a slight disrespect for the film, but Bruce Willis asked, "From the kid, there is more value in respect to others and the life of his discontent has to be changed." A refreshing change from the trash that tries to trick us into this movie from the lake. There are some very good lessons learned in this movie. I really believe this is the best of Disney, although some things can be omitted. I was impressed with the lack of oath and lack of sexual inuendos. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than everything else.
