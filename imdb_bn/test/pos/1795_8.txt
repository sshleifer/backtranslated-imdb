Apparently, due to the isolation and frustration of Hans, the mother of the stratotypically fierce bourgeoisie, a shocking wife and boyfriend refused. And despite complex paintings - Hans does not make these claims properly - the above must be a significant part of the concept of the fascinidary (its use of Freud and Marx). But the audience does not see anything from Hans's sex and sex to find out the true cause of his impressive soul. <br /> <br /> First, due to lack of his mother, the army was forced to sign him abroad. It was probably more likely and it has been specifically mentioned that it offers adventure, men cameras (mothers and sisters fleeing from female women) and men's identity - both of whom offer sedatives and war. <Br / <br /> Second, Hans lost her successful job as a police member due to her sexuality. Falling for workplace prostitution, she is not only prostitute for a rubber stamp as a fraud organization, but it shows that she can not control her sexuality in professional occupation - and even willing to take risks of a desired career. <br /> <Third Third, he makes serious oral abuse in front of his sheep male friends, without making any difference in his absence - or when he looks for him - appearance <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After a few hours, in a violent and drunken state, she beat his wife in front of her daughter, who intervened for her mother. It is obvious that terrorism between her and her daughter is created. But he both - and the audience - moved with a nimary of conscience or protest. Why? Because of his wife being cruelly identified as cruel and sexually explicit (yes, it may be the view of the physicist that women's capitalism is owned, unsafe, and what a product - but it is not entirely complete in Hans's cruelty or in the battery scene). <br /> <br /> And this male role is pressure, which Hans can choose to reject and protest, but instead takes it. He is also very brief for a male and very non-heroic to achieve male achievement in the world to suggest male roles. But how can these frustrations cause them frustration when they not only get lost love as a lover, but rather marry a tall woman who feels more attractive than herself. Finally, Hans allowed her war colleague Harry to believe in his wife. Reverse application, in their home. By this decision, he not only makes it clear that he was more tied to Harry than his wife, but he encouraged his love for women in male bonding. And finally, own life, because it's Harry's superior skills and the soul around the house that causes Hans's stars to fall. Hans, businessman, degree holder, may be victim of capitalism, but more, he is the victim of his own loyalty to his own male identity. The ultimate reason for his incompetence and despair is the final reason for his separation and despair. <br /> <br /> Some things that have been lost in this thing, I lost not just a fasebinder, but only a degree in Han's sister Ana. Anaan (and phasimbinder) for his brother's support - on his mother, just so far away. He is very strong that only he can save himself - in his support and love it can not end suicide itself. Unfortunately, he does not offer his wife the same support and love, which can be even more confusing than Hans, but eventually he is able to cut pieces into pieces and save himself and the girl and appear opposite on one side. Han's Fall.
