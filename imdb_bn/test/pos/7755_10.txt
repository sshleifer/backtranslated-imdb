I first heard from a critic of YouTube about the Revolution of Haruj Sujumiya. He literally slapped the show with a big bad rant, condemned it shameless and confusing. Curiosity, I decided to watch the show (once I got the right of an episode, thanks to those who made the list), and I was completely bright and enjoyable to see it. The great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely lovable and joyful; A unique and not a Pluto plot that makes sense that I now saw; And in my opinion, two of the best anime moments in history. Plus open and ending themes are great. <br /> <br /> Based on the successful manga novels collection an easy plot is followed, once you realize it. In the original character of the show, Huru Sujumiya, his outlook came from his friend Kewan. Kyon is a regular high school student who does not really believe in supernatural elements (such as Santa Claus, Aliens, Time Voyager, Scratch, Espers), but he will soon end up talking Haruhi, who is the most curious girl in school and all people worthless , Prefer an alien date. He has joined every club in school to find something even interesting, but joining as quickly as possible to join. After "counseling" from Kyun, Huay decides to form his club with the club of Keenon. Sitting in the house of a literary club, HUHOO constitutes the SOS Brigade - his goal of investigating in the occult field (in the mind of the skuboo-do dog, masked man and mystery machine). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Three additional members. The first is Yuki Nagato, a kind of bookstore that talks very little and most of them spend time reading and sitting. The second is Mikuru Aasahina, a shameful girl, who has been compelled by the Haruhari Club, thinks it is a nice mascot to get some things. Haruji often forces her to wear her to increase her hypocrisy. The third is the eTukki Quizumi, a friendly and exclusive transferable student, who always smiles. Although Haruji thinks his group is filled with normal people, he can not be more wrong. Although you can get the queasy as normal, on the other hand, three are rather unique - Eki is an alien, Mikuro is a time passenger in the future and an espaiki (a person who has ESP). These three have come to monitor Huhui, who may have the power of only one god, and if he gets disturbed, then he can discover his power and create a whole new world, and the Qune is involved in some way. <br /> <br /> show great characters, music and some ridiculous and wonderful moments. However, for parents, there are some sexual references, among which Mikuro's clauses have been expressed or touched many times, and several oaths have also been used. Without that, the show is a great one.
