HLOTS was an outstanding series, nypeed blue would never be, plots are real, conversations are real, relationships are real. The story was fast-paced, emotional and full-series full of weeks and weeks out of the story, with all the loose ends closed, all the gangs were back together well, even some were seen (as it does not say) with HLOTs back as a movie. Homicide, street life, drama at its best !!!! 5 they !!!! Thumps UP and all that Finally, thank you for giving us NBC!
