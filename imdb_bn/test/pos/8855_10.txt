In 1982, two films were released each other in a week, which was both about alliance. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter The Thing. Two of them, ET, won the hearts of the world, although Things made the first debut. Because people were so close to Spielberg's warm, unclear perceptual novel, they were far away from droves. <br /> <br /> Why is not it hard to see? The two are diametrically opposed. One optimistic story is still designed to heat the heart of the explosion of explosions. The other is a harsh, disrespectful film that indirectly depicts alien life as determined to destroy us. I think the viewers were ET's much curious than the bite of biting and chic coating! <br /> <br /> It took some time, but Things have won over a prominent religious audience. It should be Thing is a rare example of a superior remix. It takes the best of classic classics of 1951 and revives them in surprising and fantastic ways. Indeed, the presenter did so well in his work that he actually succeeded in creating a film that is equal to every in-the-winner Alan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a setting in Antarctica Keeps the waste, because it's a perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a higher feeling of isolation. Although a bit thin on the character, the rimik gets the rights within actors' mindset and the uncertainty increases and fears that it slowly surrounds them. <br /> <br /> Often the curator collaborator, Cart Russell came back to Palo from New York, throwing him as one of the constant anti-heroes of the carpenter. He has played Helicopter Pilot MacDaddy at the Antarctic Research Station (somebody's idea of ​​what they are searching). The problem begins when a Norwegian helper flies from a station near McDride, trying to gun down Siberian Hookie from the air. <br /> <br /> They are dying for their troubles and trying to solve the camp. What happened to the mystery, they take the Husky and add it among themselves. Since this is not Husky, all is a Husky. But changing the shape of a variable is variable. Norwegians discovered it frozen in the snow, and when they thawed it, it killed their crew. The ability to deliberately exploit its victims, it can live directly in the shortest story. Soon Paraniah and the 12-crew crew suspect his way through work, until someone is sure that there is no man and none. <br /> <br /> Thing is one of John Carpenter's best films. Actually I'm tempted to tell her the best movie she made. Even beyond the classic like Halloween and Dark Star. Why I kept the tops of the carpenter's list is that it seems like its last movie that can be truly classified. Still the rest of them thought the carcart was frozen. Films that have not flown with cold sophistication and intense intensity in his previous works <br /> <br /> But Thein's greatest strength was John Carpenter. He did not raise the mystery from such an intolerable degree. Not even in 13 terrible attacks of species. On the other side, the aliens are showing her presence, the centrifuge intensely imposes on the tension level. And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonizing flick. <br /> <br /> The picture is a mixture of pure atmospheric and glue awful. A method that often seems strange to each other, but the hands of the carpenter nicely assemble. Robbing the Hawling fame, you can see in any horror movie that any amazing transformation effect. Immortal size Half of the human features formed are completely opposite to the gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tanker cocktails. In fact, the effects of the film were so amazing and it was in the fire to be foolhardy, very realistic! <br /> <br /> Such thinking completely misses the point. This is only the film's quality shortchange And there are so many. When he needed a timber only an effect setpiece stage. This is the quiet moment of his film where he especially met the story. Things are shocking, whispers and an often malignant story of influence. Characterization was not one of the strongest of John Carter's, but its facility works in Theing. Because we do not know anything about imagination, it only makes the present situation more confusing. We are not sure who the next one is from. And for this reason, Things hold very well and maintain its mystery on the next philosophy. <br /> <br /> Ano Marichon's excellent film sketch should be specially mentioned. A pulsing bang every two seconds. This creates a terrific, pulsed feeling that makes it very difficult. A wonderful exercise in the whole film paranoid manipulation. Check each other blood to see bloody scenes of such cruelty with carpeters, and if you understand yourself, you can bite your nails. <br /> <br /> Things are a pure immaculate classic. Even in the end you are not resolved everything that leaves with a vague suspicion. An underlying film, well received reappraisal value. And much better than it!
