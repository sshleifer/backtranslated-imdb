I saw this picture 20 years ago and still think how much I liked it. It really touched me, and I enjoyed it with the work of Nobel's cowardly. Highly recommended: atmospheric and touch. <br /> <br /> I think of this movie periodically, and I am disappointed that it did not enjoy it like many classic movies like a revival. Today I searched for it that won the Academy Award for Best Original Story for Ben Hector and Charles MacArthur. <br /> <br /> It's basically a nasty character that destroys the carrier of others and curses because of it. He died, but if he could convince someone to sneeze a tears on him, the release is allowed. Most of the film shows him in search of this goal. Well written and lovely I knew him for his play, so I was surprised to see him play this role on TV in one night in New York. You will see if there is ever a chance.
