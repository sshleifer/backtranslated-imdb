... instead, in the mid-1960s, the African American men in the Chicago city of Gateo will be known from ages to age and age forever. For everyone aged 50, "hat-hopping" is four years (1975-1979), which was a light-hearted but playful sitcom with a few serious moments relevant to a group of African American high school kids for a few years. A working class neighborhood. I liked it a great deal - it just has no real connection to this film. "Coolie High" started as the basis of "Watches Hopping", but its serious nature did not register well with test viewers, so it was rebuilt as a comedy, although the credits of "What's Happy" were still based on this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> Boys working on sex, betrayal, unemployment, depression and even early death Ray. The finishing is quite strong and serious, and the film has a great thick soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this film is not new enough to be a premium cable channel, and it is not considered old that it is considered as a classic movie and it is played in some places for those movies.
