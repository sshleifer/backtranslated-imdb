Fires On The Plain (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You no longer see such movies. Fires on the plain: Incredible portrayal of the Japanese Imperial Army soldiers' life. The best compose of Kon Ichikwu follows a soldier named Tumura, which was surrounded by the Philippines in the last year of the war. He was sent to the hospital only by his commanding officer refusing treatment and so he was sent back. His CO tells him to go back and if he denies him again, his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is denied again, but the squatters sitting outside outside of the hospital meet with a band. The next day they were shelled by American soldiers and flees to Tamo, not to kill himself, and from there he wanders from the place trying to get Palompon. He discovered that some men ate man's meat to survive, others could become tobacco as much as they could, and they could do business for tobacco. <br /> <br /> This picture is silence of despair and with a hint of madness, secrecy. We all see skin and bones covered, drap covered and wrapped rags wrapped. Some beautiful shots of the Ikeica debris and Japanese soldiers use their camera to walk. Kon Ichikawa was famous for making a number of comedies in Japan, and there are moments in the fire in the tombs, which are hateful. For example, take a shot facing a dead person under a pool of water; A soldier walked, but he jumped loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly, and then his mouth was even deeper in the farm than before. In another hilarious series, one person finds a pair of boots on the legs. He took boots, replaced them with their old ones. Another guy walks and boots shoes and shows the switch for his old boots. Finally, Samoos found the exchange spot and firmly checked the left without any one. He carefully looks at himself and on the land, and has decided that they are both hypocrites, he removes himself and goes barefoot. The pictures are filled with incredible scenes, one after the other. Like Mizoguchi and Kuruswaw, Ichikwa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning images. There are many stunning shots of humans in the wild plain in the air, but there is nothing except smoke in the air and the smoke of the broken earth. Another unbelievable scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers try to cross a road protected by Inx in the middle of the night, the camera shows up from the top as their hands and knees are mounted. <br /> <br /> The movie gets its name from the sea smoke. They represent the lives of the soldiers a little more general; Life of a burned home in the living room of Japanese peasants Their hope for normal life is Bacon though unfavorable hands. <br /> <br /> This image stirred the beginning of the day with its graphic content. On the horrors of war, the emphasis is not only on the enemies but also in your position and yourself. Con Icchwaz's Fires on the Planes is an incredibly authentic and moving, and a somewhat boring, awful brittle picture, which becomes the lower level of Imperial Army. Letters from Evo Jimar Clint Eastwood, although it does not come near the realization of the horrors of the war described in Flayer, a very good movie, plain. (Eastwood was influenced by the film without any doubt, since he claimed to be such a classic Japanese movie buff.) Many war films show that the winners of the war pose hell in battle In plain on fire, we have shown that the war is even more brutal when the fight is over in the losing end <br /> 4/4
