Finally, I hold the beautiful Sasuma DVD of this photo which is loaded with interesting additions. I've read a lot about it, and unfortunately it's missed at the Stockholm Film Festival. I thought it but if it's a weird and unique movie it's still valuable it's not quite distributed. At this moment I see it again compared to recent so-called horror films flowing out of Hollywood. What detracts from me for the experience, the specific music cues which sound the sound and the cheap synth sound depends too much. For me, all these score / harmonic elements of the score may be raised and the David Christian may be replaced by the excellent sound design. But this is just my opinion. Otherwise it is a bold, angry picture with welcome meditations and poetic parts, such as the sequence of photographs are beautiful, which is beautiful. I look forward to seeing the Ascension, and I congratulate Mitch and Karim for their efforts to produce non-mainstream films. They soon started the journey for my own little film product.
