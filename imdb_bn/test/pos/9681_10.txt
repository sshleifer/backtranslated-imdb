The Family Guy has been so lonely for so long but I think it's lost its sharp and random humor at the beginning of the season. Although I was able to cut the blue crop, the rest of the paragraphs seemed to be "wrap-up" - the episodes where producers made little effort to meet the fame of American social mock family fame. <br /> <br /> I saw all the episodes from session 7, and I am surprised by the fact that the family Guy found the true color again. Season 7 provides a lot of great episodes and jokes about the current situation in America which is just what we need - more fun. <br /> <br /> I think Simpsons has lost his Spark together, although this show, although they proved how totally ironic it would have been a terrible recovery from below down. Nice work!
