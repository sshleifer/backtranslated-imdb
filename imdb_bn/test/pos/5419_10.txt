Just went to YouTube and finally saw this Oscar nominated animated shot directed by Richard Condy. I saw her funny start up there beforehand. In this one, a couple is playing scrabble. The wife shakes her eyes while there is nothing beside her husband. The wife looked at her beside her bed and bathtub (!) After a while to vacuum. Earlier, the husband held a TV show called "Savings for Tinas" on TV show and they saw it with their own eyes. This program is interrupted by a special report of nuclear war incident (the correspondent is a skeleton here) because at this time the husband is asleep as the husband falls asleep, and it seems as if a parade is going on because he and his wife continue to dispute the game ... to end the sensitive Before that many strange things are going on. Outside for any animation buff that is quite ridiculous and good value. Mr. Can not wait to see more animated shorts from Kandy ...
