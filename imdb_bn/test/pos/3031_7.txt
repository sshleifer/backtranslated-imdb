'The Cell' is the journey of a serial killer's mind and I mean this literally. About the movie journey, during this tour of the world it shows, the destination really does not matter. In my opinion, the journey through this mind gives such beautiful images, other things are not as important as they are confused. Actually, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> We started with Catherine the boy with Catherine Diane (Jennifer Lopez). This work really does not matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. He and Henry West (Dylan Becker) and Mariam Kent (Marian Jean-Baptist), along with other scientists believe that this process can work. Catherine enters the heart of the child and talks to him there, in a world that the boy is fully prepared. He hopes that he can do something that ultimately results. <br /> <br /> then the original story. Carl, a serial killer (Vincent D'anfrio), simply threw one of his victims. FBI agent Ramsey (Jack Weber) and Novak (Vince Von) in this case. Another girl (the subcoff) disappears, and at that time, after forensic research of the dumped body, Carl can be identified and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Karl just went into a coma; She has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and house are not in the same place with his last kidnapped prey. In this case, this part of the story is quite a measure. <br /> <br /> The topics are going to be interesting again. To find out where she is, Catherine must go into Karl's mind. It is dangerous for many reasons. In short: Carl's unknown area, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine begins to believe Karl's mind, the real world can satisfy his mind with his mind; He could die in Carl's mind. A tape of what was the last victim's death, this fate will last in almost 200 hours, ensuring that Catherine will try to find out the position from Karl's mind. <br /> <br /> It's a journey through sickness. Seeing the mind, this film also makes that mind. Director Tarshame Singh, who previously made music videos, goes back to the video of this song. Fantastic Each room in the world is beautiful and sometimes other small clips that exist from hunting images. The visual style for me felt completely new, one year ago there were new visual styles in 'Three Kings' method. If you like something like this, 'The Cell' will not be disappointed. But thrillers and horror series fans can like this picture. The story itself, except for the great imaginary world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open psycho, obviously the event is not possible in our real world (yet). Still, a very entertaining movie, which seems to be very awesome, is a great idea.
