So it can not be completely historically correct. And there are little or no real character development. But Scott's first attempt is for Jake (the son of Ridley), it's suitable for ticket prices. <br /> <br /> Captain James McLaren (Johnny Lee Miller is looking like never before) could be a gentleman, but he got money or clothes to prove it. Plunkett turned out to be an apothecary (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes). The situation at their strange meeting involves a corpse, a ruby, and finally a partnership as the Gentleman Highwayman. The tag line says, "They loot rich ... and this is it." There really is not much background or even deep development, but it seems to be enough money to pay for the transition of two highways in America and to relieve the nobility of the zoo. One small problem: MacLean fell in love. Rebecca (Levi Tyler) with Chief Justice Ward The thief caught the attention of the General of Tycoon <br /> <br /> This plot is largely enough, casting is excellent (especially Alan Kumming Drug-Queen Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller - together also "Trainspotting", they have not lost their mobility), are costly, superb, makeup disrespectful, and music is technically strict with a peculiar classical practice. Jack Skot is a good sensation of light and shadow, shiny and balance between the plot, and he is not embarrassed to show the more unpleasant aspect of London 17th Century. And lucky for us, he likes the close ups of the faces, especially the eyes. Johnny Lee Miller's eyes And live Tyler, but hey, who is this movie? Rebecca? No. Plunetate and McClean But there is more to this film than a more beautiful look. The word Cliche is risky, fast, furious, and sometimes frustrating ride with the most enthusiastic highwayman from Robin Hood. Suddenly, lazy, and violent, Scott made his first film in an entertaining evening in movies. <br /> <br /> "I was terrible, and it was a bloody good smile!"
