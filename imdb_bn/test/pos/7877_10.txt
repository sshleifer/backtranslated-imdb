Oh Man, this movie is amazing, it is very good that it is a story about a person who does not accept black people, he sits in the water at night and he does not deserve to get hippies who are anti-war, and how to get black and hippies to check any welfare. This film is very realistic, because it portrays a person as "Joe", who has represented many people again and is still there. This story goes like this .... Joe is in a bar and he is jumping with a rich man, who only beat his daughter's hippie boyfriend. And what this rich man has done goes to the bar for review, and when he does this, then "Joe" repeatedly against the Hippies and the people who are against the war. The rich man suddenly told Joke that he killed Hippi; And maybe Joe congratulates the rich man, because Joe hates Hippi, it can be seen to see what the amazing movie will happen next. I like this movie, because it was memorable in the early days of the 70s, I liked the way the movies were shot in those days, very good, it's not like today's movies. In fact, the movie gives you an internal look in character character "Joe". I like the movie theme ................................................. .................................................. .................................................. ..............................................
