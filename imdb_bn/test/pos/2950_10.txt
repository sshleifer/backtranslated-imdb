This picture made me wonder. To make the habit of finding out as much as possible about the movie before the trailer care because I provide the spoiler after the trailer and the review spoiler. Regarding entering the theater, I knew it was a documentary about a long married couple and the IMDB readers gave it 7.8, Rotten Tomato users took it to 7.9 and critics were amazing at 8.2! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, <br /> <br />, and Coming Daddy less, Mike. I immediately find this couple interesting and the filmmaker (Mike and Minna's son Doug) had no idea of ​​taking us. In fact, I suspect that Doug himself knew where he was going! <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected twists and turns and follows this nicely publisher movie journey. It is difficult to describe how I was removed and how it was described in its verbal manner. Absolutely riveting from the beginning to the end and if you see a fan in the documentary section even if it is really a must. This image will think about your own life and even raise memories that you have forgotten. "51 Beach Road" is one of the rare movies that deeply impresses and never leaves you. The best news is that instead of playing a limited Art House audience in HBO's hands, millions of people have the opportunity to see this incredible work. Bravo !!!!!!!!
