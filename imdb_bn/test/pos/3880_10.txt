I thought it was nice! It was a great observer of tracking down each of them presenting it. Duit Schultz still looked similar, he was not rarely changed in appearance, Dirk was not Benedict, he still looked as dishy! I thought that Mr. T looked a little thin, but at the moment he was still very good to see how he was feeling. I thought it was tracking Cast members, like Decker played and the woman who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr. T could not complete the reconciliation. George Pepered was a big shame to be killed, leaving a gap to talk like this. I just wish I just taped it to keep it. Let's hope they repeat it again.
