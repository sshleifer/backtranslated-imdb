If you ask me what the movie was like on the film, I'd say it was great! Anyway, I left the feeling of the theater unhappy. After a little thought about this, I believe the speed at the end of the problem. I think most of the film has gone slowly and eventually developed very fast. So, I'll say the last left left me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I used to think that the letters were well developed. Both Castner and Kutcher portrayed their role very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can work! Also, the different relationships between the characters seem very real. In addition, I thought that different plot lines were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Good character, Great plot, Bad writing / Edge finish. Still, see it !!!
