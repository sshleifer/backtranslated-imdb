My wife wanted to watch this movie and I went along with the sad. I have never been a big fan of biopic - believe that the film is more exciting when it is not formed in non-fiction. Even so, although I really like the music of Ray Charles, I do not think I'm a fan of myself or her music. <br /> <br /> I am troubled by this film or I hope the coast. <br /> <br /> I was wrong <br /> <br /> This is a compelling story that is called in the classic cinematic style. The reality is among the various aspects - after the dramatic moment of a character's head or by their eyes when they sing. I actually found myself involved in this movie while watching it. <br /> <br /> Jaim Fox, which has said a lot, once operated a cast of casual remodelors, but in an era, a life that was not really about 40 years old to us. This movie adds time to viewers and time without pieces of Titanic's Grand Sweeping Panorama or other timepieces. This movie does not present you with the music scene of 50 and 60, it takes you there. <br /> <br /> This is a film by Ray Charles, but your gratitude towards her should not be limited to her story. This type of movie, such as Savings Private Ryan or Scandaler, is what a movie can do - it brings you to another place.
