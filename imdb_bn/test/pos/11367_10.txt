It was a long time ago (1960), but I did not forget this series and it will often appear again. So, taking it, I contacted Mr. Rothbun, President of Standard Oil, which sponsored the PBS presentation. He sent me a picture of Tapeastry (actually a charcoal rendering) that was used behind the credits. <br /> <br /> In the inaugural theme music of Beicao's "Elizabeth Masuk", my family and I are drinking our black and white TVs in the words of Shakespeare, spoken by a group of nice but relatively unknown players (at least to the American audience). <br /> <br /> We got to know actors as Sun Connie, Dame Judy Dunk, Tom. Fleming, Patrick Gerland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. Since I have continued to enjoy their accomplishments. One of the most interesting things, the performers of Shakespeare's "King" plays are going to play their respective roles, probably for the first time in the growing sequence. <br /> <br /> I like <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good news! PBS has just issued a DVD "An Age of the Kings"! See their July 2009 CATALOG, page 19, or call them free. I just order mine!
