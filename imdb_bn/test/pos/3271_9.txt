A good addition to the "Two Hands" Australian Film Catalog. <br /> <br /> This is a strange combination of real life, strange life, tricks, tragedy and love that has developed on their own. <Br /> <br /> A poor laser is basically a helpless man. She wants to read with a local "Big Man" Pando (Brian Brown). But at the moment he placed his fingers on the dark paths in the dark way (he rose Bayern). Here the reason for the error is to unexpectedly change his life. After getting Ponda's wrong side accidentally, things became very bad very quickly and if it was not for some strange help, it was a small tragedy. Yes, Jimmy can learn some lessons in life and no one can escape from excuses on one way or the other, but at the end it feels good in his feelings. Although there is a legally available theme through the story, it is not glorious and shows how destructive crimes can happen in normal life. <br /> <br /> Hit Laser is as wonderful as Jimmy, at the same time innocent and intelligent, surprising as everyday as Alex and Brian normal as hypnotic. These characters are a small ensemble credible and I've found myself disliking good guys and disliking baddies. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually usually in cheap alloy so I would recommend adding it to your DVD collection, it would cost money well. <br /> <br /> 10 out 8
