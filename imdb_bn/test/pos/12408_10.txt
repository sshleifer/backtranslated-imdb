This movie is a nice film about a group of small towns deciding to loot local banks. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to get out of his small town, much like Jimmy Stewart, "It's a wonderful life." However, except George Bailey, he is going to loot a bank to finance the dream of attending the Brian Art School, even if his father is not supportive. Brian offers work like a customer and is confused with the guard. This is a seductive suggestion that if many are given, I ask what they will do. However, Brian does it. When Sheriff (James Rimmer) and his forces surround the bank, things get worse from the worse. A standoff with even moving it to kill the kids even if it has a shot clear The sheriff must resist this and try to finish the stoffoff in a peaceful way. Unfortunately, the increase of tensions, and the teenagers introduced each other inside. Some are out of control. Paper cutter is disgusting and difficult to watch. Very intense!
