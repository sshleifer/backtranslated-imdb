After watching Harry Potter films, I congratulate three actors Rupert Greene, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; Yet, we have the same letter year or J. Who Waiting for two years to play as well as other projects. Rolling series Mainly instead of three, instead of three, the camera and magazine articles pay more attention to Daniel and Emma, ​​because they are the precursor male and the only major female at the end of Rupert's death. However, each actor has a shining time and Rupert's light hits him once in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Driving Lessons" This generation is called Harold and Maude is the role of Rupert Grint Ben, Marshall, who is a young British boy who jumped with his parents (Laura Linnie) and Vicar (Pastor) parents She did not want to get jobs in the summer, but at the same time she can not take her driving exams. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She accepted the job and realized that Evelyn (Julie Walter, Harry Potter series Rupert's mother Harry Potter series) acted as an actress and for her money, Ben is racing for the poet. Acting as a child-relationship with Avi and taking Ben for a road where he worries, they tell each other secretly. From them, Britain is not operated all the way from Scotland to Scotland, because EV is required to be sent to the local library, but at the same time an elderly lady falls for that young man, where Ben begins to become a man. I'm very happy about this movie when I came to the theater and I was very impressed with the role of Roopert Green, especially if he showed the rest of the world Although he brought a bit of Ron Wesley in Ben Marshall, his brilliant performance actor is not stopped.
