Finally, caught with this "masterpiece", it hit me that it must have seemed very terrible in his day. It played under the French, arty, anguish points, and finally the downbeat. But in the future, it is seen from 37 years of convenience, it is just a small, indirect, and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Others make the story short, but I do not think anyone has shown a dramatic error. At the heart of this movie: The main characters, Corey and Vogel, do not deserve what they actually get. They play square in their code, do not harm anyone who does not ask for it, and show great courage and initiative. Moreover, Corey was a victim of his former gangland, who stole his daughter and tried to kill him repeatedly because he dared to borrow some thousands of francs (Cori). These guys who really ought to be for a break! Instead, according to the logic of the story, things have to be made worse for them. <br /> <br /> Someone may be logical that this whole point: that the actual villain is not caught; They collude as necessary police, sell their friends, and always come out to the top. But that is not shown. Cori's old gangster friend is not meeting with the police. He is shown gloating over his victory. In fact, after performing material material several times when he needs it, he does not see any dramatic tension (his opposition to the corridor) until completely disposed of him! However, I would say that this film is suitable for its beautiful photography, its slow, deliberate pacing, its great depopulation performance, its wide-ranging fashion sequence, and the artistic style of the late 1960s.
