The movie starts with a board meeting with a major advertising agency. He has Putin swipe on the board for black, and for any reason other than "token" on the agency board. The meeting is being ignored, the Jet Magazine is reading on the big table, and everyone is ignoring volunteers ... Suddenly, the CEO escaped from the spot. No time wasted. A manager was called for the robbery to be slaughtered and the board immediately tackled the business of selecting new CEOs. And after one vote of one vote, the tension was created and finally snapped on a whispering climax for the vote, which gives a delicious meal of taste logical effects to the rest of the audience. If you sometimes talk back to some stupid television commercials, you'd see this movie. Very bad there seems to be no real Putney Swopes in the world.
