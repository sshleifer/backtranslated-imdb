This film is employed by six people to transfer money from the bank to the business. Tie Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war to serve his country and now he is being assisted to stay alive only by confirming that his friend Mike Cochran (Matt Dillon) is to leave his home. Mike told her that her parents were not waiting for her and that her brother, Jimmy Hackett (Andr√© Kiney), should now live better than her. Ty and Tyler told that he and Jimmy were always members of his family and wanted to do something for their help, Mike Ty Ty said about the plan. About 43 million rupees will be divided among other transport men, although Ty does not like his idea that he will not hit anyone until he hits his friend Mike. Last night, Ty was forced to speak with a welfare lady who gave her a reluctance to lose her life's important care about the care of her companion care. Although the plan seems to be safe first, there is no covetousness in living. <br /> <br /> When you come to Hiesta, you or you are outside, so if you do not go with anybody, make a tough plan to play the hero and stop greedy people making huge amounts of money. This movie comes with your stardomed stardom, starring Jean Reno, Lawrence Fishburn, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skit Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglius. Shortly I recently reminded him of "Stump the Yard", which was about a child, who lost his brother and dreamed of going to college. This was probably one of his best movies and I fitted it with the character so that it can be seen again on the big screen.
