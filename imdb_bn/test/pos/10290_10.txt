I have seen this picture again, I believe six times. I would doubtfully see it more often. This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Although the film seems to be mysterious, writer and director Gilson Mimouni is more mysterious. He has not made any other film for ten years, and this is his only one. The story of this fascinating film and execution is perfect, and it is obviously a tribute to both Hittk and Booster Keaton. The split of this movement-the second time, just as a catam of Steamboat Bill Jr. falls next to a room, is carefully controlled like the scene and does not die with just an inch. People in this movie get frustrated and ignorant of each other, and if they have a second stop, they will happen. The story thus prepares a tight dress of event events in such an intense degree that you can not even take your eyes on screen for milliseconds, or you miss something important. By Peter Chase, deliberately repetitive, heating, memories of Hitcock's Vertigo, and the entire film have the same ruthless quality, but a woman can be two women in Hitco, but two women in the Midiune woman can thus change the plot structure. There are references to other hitcos movies, but this is 'Vertigo' which is central to the inspiration of this movie. The theme may seem to be romantic love, but the film is the magic of everyday occasions, invisible threads behind the testes, unacceptable. Everything is fascinating with enthusiastic love and affection, but the desire passes through its object and struggles behind and behind objects. That is why it can be so easy to move from Lisa to Elise, when it is realized that it is more mysterious than Alice, and that Elise invents the true eternal mystery. This picture of Roman Boehngar is finally 'made' He is more attractive than Monica Baluchi, who really wants to draw a bit, that Baluchi is a knockout look, even though Boingar English call 'plain'. However, Roman Bohejinger was even at this early date than to achieve 'master of personality' artistry, by which beautiful girls fall on the street and do not notice because Roman is so impressive that you can not close its long eyes. Sufficient to look at beautiful girls, and you just think about her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, his father Richard Boehnger spent many years in the bathroom listening to the opera in the movie 'Deva'. I want to see Roman than Richard at Bothegger, but seems to be attractive to some genetic secrets, because Richard Boehngger is also spellbound, and he is not a woman. Ramen thinks that when he returns to Anna Magnani at a very high age, that means he will get Oscar, if someone can write just 'Rose Tattoo' for him. There is so much emotion inside the girl, she can set fire on fire. Would not it be wonderful if he and Julie Delpy teamed up? This picture made wonderful use of Paris's position. But where is this 'square square'? It looked like the place for me Furstenburg. Maybe I missed something. I will definitely see the film six times, just the accuracy of time and those who study past Bros. and make sure that I have decided. The whole thing is like ten chess games simultaneously, which is blindfolded by the Grandmaster. How thrilling it is! Roman, you can see my window at any time! Mimio, let's talk about improbability, incompleteness, coconutism, prosperity, what is happening is invisible and how visible it affects. And again, here we have debuted Bretan's novel 'Nadza' in a great French art. More! More! More!
