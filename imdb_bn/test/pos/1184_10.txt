Only after 20 years saw the hair. It hit home. Among us who stood on the shoulders of civil rights movement and fought for the protection of privilege and power; Johnson / Nixon administration favored the fascism; Now every single day in the Vietnam War as civil war veterans finally killed US animals and fled; For those who did not say to each other in different ways - it is amazing how much we failed. Dutch Dutch, which was the main table. How the screen behind the wizard is powered. We are 20, 22, 24. We did not know the nature of the enemy. For the next thirty years and the monster who consumes the monster daily for the next year. How could we? Even smoking and bat (bat!) In our hands, such as Treat, we were very young, very middle class, very invested, lots of the haters we hated. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment there. Under Gregory meets my mother. . . In the late 60's and early 70's, when we probably found something other than yellow brick roads there was a moment or two. There is nothing burnt by Bechtel, Prison, Enron, and Dick. Some associates. Once innocent and critical is something. Something with dance <br /> <br /> But we missed it. Like the gear of the neck, the "revolution" itself was introduced. In sexuality. Racism Homosexuality And class crush politics Until we got "w" The behavior "hate" will be hate. And Iraq and Pathology lie. They had that film. Then then. But the moment passed and "W" was nearly inevitable. Drugs, street plays, children's lives, and gross misconduct in China's shops. <br /> <br /> We should have done more. A little better But we did not know clearly. <br /> <br /> Now what?
