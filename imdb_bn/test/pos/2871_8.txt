Loose is a new murderer, and he is doing God's work. Yes right The killer watched Jason Vuures kiss, and Freddie Kruger looked like an angry doll against this father. He is a Joe Jacob the Goodnight (WWE Glenn "The Ear" Jackbox), a 7 'monster who is an axis, and a hook and chain. None of those weapons are ripping out the eyeballs to the hunter socket. That's completely systematic! When this conflict happened 4 years ago, Jacob killed a ruku policeman and hit an experienced person after firing on his head. How did the good night live on earth after 4 years? Now he is in the hotel named Blackwell. And this hotel got a lot to say about the story. I was interesting alongside this movie hunting as well. I like the part where the goodnight checks out the girl's tattoos behind her. And the good night itself is really deranged to thank his psychological mother. If you thought Friday was something 13th, you feel good again. This movie will go to the edge of your seat. And I think the rib bone of the eye was cold. This movie proves this, and it was not my waste of time. I enjoyed it. Title is not false! Rating 5 stars out of 2.5!
