This is the most fun movie I ever seen. Anyway, I smiled hard on a lot of movies. Because the brightness of the best show is not in a snapstick or one-liner, but sophisticated and level wise intelligent. The revised dialogue is so fast that you do not end up laughing at each curiosity, but if multiple curiosity does not build each other, each joke disarms your senses until climax and you can not help to loose it. <br /> <br /> This is a good shot film, but the acting does make it tremendous. I was fascinated by my first viewing, but when I saw that almost every scene was re-established, I saw it, then I was surprised. It was completely enjoyable for curious people to work together, to create a joke and to be completely submerged in their characters. <br /> <br /> I think this was the golden days of the second city.
