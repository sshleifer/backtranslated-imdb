Classe Tous Risques is repeatedly recommended when I see the Gene-Pierre Melil movie, which I had to watch as soon as possible. As I discovered in Melville and apparently working back through his film, it would be easy to make a mistake in my film, but it was made by Cloud Suiteet in 1960, before Melville's arrival and before joining his campaign, French Noah -Nir. <br /> <br /> <br /> Two of Leo Ventura and Jean-Paul Bellamondo's best lead during the clash toss resc Ventura played Gangster Hubble, who was detained in Italy with his wife and two children, who wants to return to Paris, because the police are closing on her. After roaring and climbing with a big surprise, Hubble finally gets hooked up with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to go to criminal underworld. Stark was Hubble's Hubble, and finally, the only friend of an underworld who came back to Hubble after Hubble's everything was done. This picture shows the duality of two men, after the tragedy, the old Hubble hit him at the end of the tragedy and little Eric began to love Hubble as well, who fell in love with a beautiful woman, who is a part of the world by lathi charge. Do not end it superb for them, or their loved ones. A personal criminal is seen coming to his death, when his relatives love his loved ones, he is at risk of risking him. <br /> <br /> Just like Melville's film, the simple story simply becomes more complicated. Goes along. I think with Melville's films, I'm going to regain my head (well) and see again for the first time I missed it. Classe Tous Risques is a special defender.
