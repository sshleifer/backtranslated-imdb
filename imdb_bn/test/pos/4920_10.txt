When I first see the trailer, I decide whether this series will be perfect for my decision. But after hearing about it, I decided to buy it. When I bought the entire collection in the box box, I wanted to see it. It was very funny, and the characters were quite calm. Favorite characters on the show are: Mourin, Carrot, Hedge Knights, Big Moma, and Dutta. I like open and end theme songs. The show also has some great voice genius from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas, and others. However, this show is the greatest one. So if you want to see something cool Then one of these shows.
