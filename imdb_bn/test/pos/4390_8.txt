I was really surprised and wondered, O my brother, where art you? The video shop was out of all the movies I had planned to rent, so I came across this. I came home and saw that I became abusive and began to laugh myself a bit. Coen's made a great film again. But I think for the first time you see this movie, you can know the characters. The second time, now you know them, you can hit it very hard because it hurts you. I will review someone to look at this firmly because if you're not, you really are missing a movie genre for ages. 10/10
