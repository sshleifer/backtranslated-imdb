I saw when my husband rented the tenant "Passion Laboratory". I love the movie of almodovar We both like movies We can not stop both laughing. In particular, Transvestite has enjoyed a scenes shooting a photo novel, and it has been said to answer the phone while being deprived of an electric drill with an assessed killer, "I can not speak to you now, I am being attacked by a painful serial killer. If I live then I'll call you ". (That's a great answer machine message will come to mind it). We like the lady to tell her new adult lover, "I went to an orange after the concert but I could not think of you." (I'm waiting to use that line on Twitter). "Passion Laboratory" is a high-end jeans, sunny dialogue and a rolling turf with eye candy for everyone. The film has been a good age: 1980's clothing and hairdos add frustration. I would give it 10 out of 10 rating, but I'm giving it an 8 for two reasons. The first scene is in the Laxatives, in which a lady spontaneously shots a shot: completely unnecessary, and for a moment it brings down the sound of the movie in the Hollywood Gross-Out comedy. The second is that Quetti advised to sleep with his father: wounded, yes, but again, it destroys the film's voice. Still, I would suggest a movie to someone who wants a sophisticated, spicy and fun time.
