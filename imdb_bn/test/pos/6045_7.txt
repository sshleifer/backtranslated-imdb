Jack Web's movie 'The D'Eye' came out of real-life investigation in the death of a few trainees in the 50's in Paris's Aile. As always, Webb, he came from many defense like being the patriot, like the rest of his show. I actually found this movie tame by the 1957 value. I have served in the army and can understand the intensity of camps in Paris Island (some by Camp Death) so this film can not come near as 'Full Metal Jacket'. I think this is a good movie which is actually patriot than it. But again, think of what it can be called in the timeline (1957) and at that time. I've always watched the Jack Web being clean and very loyal. I know that many have criticized the film as one-sided and public campaign. If you feel like this, then see 'Metal Jacket' with R. Lee Ermey. I enjoy the film for the webbank fan and its worthiness, not the accuracy. As I said, Webb believes in this country and holds institutions high moral standards (LAPD-DDNet, Adam 12, emergency etc.). Just come back and enjoy this from a strict moral period in this country. Mr. Webb does not have too much judgment Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
