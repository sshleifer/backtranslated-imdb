Recovery is a specific and balanced playback of a sensitive subject that does not sensitize the original characters. David Tenant and Sarah Parish take a couple of complex and contradictory emotions deeply toward love and struggle to cope with the changes of both of their personality and it is also important to survive from a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Allan as a result of tenant humor creates a dangerous quarrel, since an engineer recovering from a road accidents brought harm to memory. Allen is not only portrayed as a victim but he can do his best to understand his new life with the feeling of the person. Taraisa of Sarah Parish can not do anything for her husband's support, not her husband's housewife. He struggled with the fall of love with Allen, because he was once new and loved, now completely different - unknown to him. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some opinions, it's - in my eyes - watching the perfect Sunday night. Often, we have shown soft family dramas or intelligence series, such as heartbeat, which surrounds the brain. Program commissioners believe that the day of rest is also our day when we go to sleep. The more challenging and thought provoking drama like Recovery will seriously change the situation.
