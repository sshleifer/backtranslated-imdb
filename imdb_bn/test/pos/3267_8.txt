Jordan is our 19-year-old Jimmy, (Hath Ledger), who has got jobs for a local gangster and needs to be corrected before going to him, after a great effort, he took us to Sydney for the offense of Szeged. Gangster, (led by Brian Brown), is an appealing bunch with a ridiculous streak among them. This is the film's work, because we always see gangsters as a rough bunch to screw badly. But this crowd is your fun bone as well. Jordan has a cleverly structured script path crossing and web plot catching.
