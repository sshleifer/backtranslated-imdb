I just want to comment on the woman above, that the movie alms does not have credit Beethoven. The credit at the beginning they show it. Thank you. I think this is an amazing movie. They pick the right music for the mood of the movie, the animation is amazing, and they pick up very good words for the characters. Teach it to leave the children, and always have the hope. The princess does not release Annaica, and it shows the child that they can do the same thing. The movie has humorous for parents and children of all ages, laughing at it. The colors of this movie are great, and kids may really like it when they see it. I saw this movie for the first time, now I'm a huge fan, and I'm sure your child will also be. Walmart sells the magic girl of Barbie and Pagasas stuff, so your child can enjoy the movie while watching it. Thanks!
