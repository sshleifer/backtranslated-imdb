Although Disney has been an animation studio for over 70 years, has always been their greatest competitor. When this review was written in 2009, for example, DreamWorks and (slightly less) Warner Bros. and Ardman companies bring animated movies that challenge Disney's impact as a challenge. In the beginning, in the early 30's and on the 40th Saturday, when Disney was serving the wedding ceremony of films like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was provided by Brother Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite the release of two pretty movies, are they not quite in the market ?? Because of the commercial failure of Mr. Bug Goss-to-Town, many of them fall, the same week the attack on Pearl Harbor (which makes the American people feel more important than watching movies on the cartoon) was published!) The picture is a travesty that has faded into relative obscurity . <br /> <br /> A patch of overgrown gardens in the city is a serious danger to a bug. People use shortcut as a shortcut, excludes mud and cigars and other hazards, just as the bug goes above the house. Honey shop owner m Bumblebee (voice by Jack Marser) fears that the future is silent, and he will be able to raise his daughter honey (voice by the polyline lath) around the more secure. Bagsley C. Beetle (voice by Ted Pearce) is a very unscrupulous creature, but if she gets her hand, she can give her a safe place to live, but honey is her childhood sweetheart, always happy and hopeful holiday (voice by Stan Free). Happi believes that everything is being settled for fixing, but Bagsley Beatle and its logical side pair pairs look stupid while using their own terrible ending crisis. Only to the very end, their patch has become the foundation of a huge new summer moon, bugs change loyalty to Happily, when they take away a new, safe home from people's destructive effects. <Br /> <br /> What really works in this movie is the lovely character ?? All bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal. Explosive villains flying floats and mosquito's smack (ridiculous name, if you stop thinking about it) is especially memorable. Equally commendable driving drive ?? Even small children can enjoy this story, as well as the human ability for skillful older observers to express the message that it can affect wildlife survival. The time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and at the time of viewing this, the audience must take (and apologize) signs of common age and wear. But a complete, fun and very gently presented animation, with full message to be able to bog the entire buggy to town.
