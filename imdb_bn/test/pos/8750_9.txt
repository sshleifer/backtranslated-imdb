What a terrific mini-series The original trophies completely stole me from anything else. Much more compelling than the American remake, the original tray FIK has created an extraordinary cast of less famous actors from North American audiences. Juliet Binoch is the chiefly recognized actress who plays a drug addict in a government official. But this is not the star power that carries the film (though I enjoyed the American version, I think it was reduced by the famous American Americans). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the American version before finding the real BBC mini series. Of course there were no photo filters, local lows, and big names big / directors. However, the stain and stain of Europe (through Dowword) completely admires the imminent sense of danger, which enters the film. Problems such as preventing foreign governments, such as the closure of drugs by supplying them more drugs, anti-poverty drugs, and helping to destroy their drug peddlers, make all Traff FI bold, submerged and horribly similar. <br /> <br /> <br /> This incredible part of the film comes from Pakistan. My God, I never know how bad the problem was in Europe ... even all! For actual education on drug problems, you must see both this and the American version to overcome how human body affects you. Each display is one of the very clear and undeniable truths. The leaders of the world who are in the world, have such a culture that has become the cause of death and sorrow for many. <br /> <br /> The drug is worse than the war. They are the shadow, the dark secret work of a "successful" society.
