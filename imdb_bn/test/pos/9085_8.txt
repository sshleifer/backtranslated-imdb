Nelson is a medical professor who wants to put him to death and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an afterlife. So they want to know soon and soon the medical students do not have life after death. The next life is not about pearl doors and lights at the end of the tunnel, but rather worse. <br /> <br /> The ghosts of the past come back behind them and of course this film will disappoint anyone. It's some fantastic horror moments that can translate into real life, and it makes you a little surprised at what happens after you die. It's a good movie to watch and you're feeling when it's raining. It's a little weird. <br /> <br /> See it with a past past.
