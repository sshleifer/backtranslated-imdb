I just got the chance to dig in Austen film, and I liked it because Jensen Austen is my favorite job, and my favorite Austin heroine Anna Elliott, has been in the preschool, always and always will be. So I had great expectations that popped up my player discs. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed, either. I knew I was bound to be some draw -back, so I would tell them, and try to be very thick about them. The most intimate of the characters of An Eliot Austen; She is at least talkative and least malicious. There is no text in the book where Anne does not say anything - only his feelings have been described. It works fine in print, but how to successfully move it to big screen? Thinking voice overlays (which will be tired for more than four hours) are you with a long legacy of shots where the heroine does not say little or nothing and the person has to communicate with the expression of her face. It can leave the feeling that the film is slow, and aimless. If you need more types of Austen style, of course this movie is not for you; But if your style is more and more and you are interested to choose a vague 'Vobes', it will fill all expectations. <br /> <br /> Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot), thanks to the actor whose mouths can reveal a lot. I always imagined that Elliott would see: No one out of the house - Anne was considered to be the elegant one of the family - not her first young man - who ever made the lights and make-up. What you see is like the character of Austen: you can once again cross the look of someone; But listen to her, and look more closely, and she gets more interesting as you know she is better. It's brought to life by Anne Eliot, as Anna Firbank's <br /> <br /> <br /> Captain Wentworth's script is directed by Brian Marshall. Bitterness is not clearly clear (save at concert scene); And, yes, I found it difficult to believe as Louisa Musgrove was attractive attractive as she is shown. But this is another topic of Austin: He did not find her attractive, she tried to find her interesting and, finally, failed (relief pains). So it also fits with Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> I like Lady Russell's screenplay, I think the book is not portrayed as troll; This adaptation comes out of this. <br /> <br /> So this is one movie which closely follows the book; I can write more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but I want to finish the place here. Charles Mussorgov is one of the most upbeat characters (fun fun), Mary was the most annoying (I was just dying to shut him up - but I felt after reading the book), Captain and Admiral I used to think charming <br /> <br / > <br /> Cinematography became very tough. There was no other small or functional fade from one screen - perhaps it was a TV movie. One scene - chop! - Next scene, the actors enter from the right, go ahead to the left, and - chop! - Another scene, where the same thing happens. The only part of this movie that made me a little cheated I have to show myself somewhere in a low budget, I guess. <br /> <br /> And, as I said earlier, if you want a little speed to go with Jane Austen, you will not get bored with it, find a very slow way. Although I enjoyed it quite a lot, although it came with a nice adaptation of my favorite Austin novel (sets are very elegant!). I highly recommend it!
