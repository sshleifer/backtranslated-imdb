All right, I do not love myself this child that it is usually the life of homosexual love, but in real life is the romance when they are on the screen? This movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and I have enjoyed it perfectly. Hugo Weaver was a riot to see a sexually-abled gay real estate salesman who used his clients' rooms for his efforts with Flaming Darren (Tom Hollander). And in Priscilla saw him, just one day before the queen in the desert, she is probably one of the most protected in-manassulin actors. :) However, the plot was easily flowing and the male-tone scene was a hoot. Thumbs up! 8/10
