I think that Mario Van Paibel is a very important movie in Poseys. It is not aware of which film is an excellent entry point on an edge of history. It is a story of ancient black colonists, cow boys and cats returning from the Spanish-American war to the golden cache. The main character Piles is scared by the memory of his murderer father. Racism has been applied to new black colonists, and Infantryman searches with the excellent casting of this movie, including Melvin Van Pibles (Mario Pita), Billy Jane, Stephen Belvedin, and Big Daddy Kane's extraordinary performance. <br /> <br /> One pencil that tried to use as many of the most significant black (and some notable - cheerful) actors as possible, is a sensation :) Probably a lot, some significant individuals (Essex Hess, Pamela Gear) , Others like tone people briefly. Attempts to release these actors and some of Pibel's efforts will be understood. Big cast (achievement for any director) works well and works well to tell the classic "revenge and war versus justice" story. <br /> <br /> The most notable is the surprising descriptive role of elders. Actor Woody Stroud (from Waste Upon a Time in the West), who had a life-long break-breaker, still did not fade from memory in the context of the previous era. No other actor can do this role well. Here's a mini-bout of Woody Stroud as a premiere: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The image does a good job of balancing steps with a slightly similar humor. If the little contemporary dialog was nice! And others mentioned that superstition was not right for that time. The sex scene was a bit more - really not needed. There are some historical errors, such as cattle branding, electronic branding etc. But Passes is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative work reflecting other extraordinary stories and events. The real credits of the last credits Real Cowboys were very nice touch.
