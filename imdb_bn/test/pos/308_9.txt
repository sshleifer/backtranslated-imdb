Well, I've seen this movie for more than 25 years and it was almost as interesting when I saw it. It is one of the most unique movies to be made. <br /> <br /> I still think that Martin Shane is big time "disconnected" in billing. He has still influenced this film in comparison to Marlon Brando, within the last 30 minutes of this two hours, 17 minutes from the movie (Dramatic Edition). How wrong is it? <br /> <br /> Shane is pretty fantastic here, especially its description, which runs across. It's one of the best descriptions, if not good, I've ever heard a movie. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thinking to adventure like this incredible, nightmare. I will fail to praise his work in this movie. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I have a number of memorable scenes of films about the movie, which I have never forgotten, like .... <br /> <br /> In the first scene of the photo Shane sitting in the hotel room! The subsequent attack on Robert Duval and the dramatic classical music of Wagner, who came out of the surfing scene and then out of the hijackers; Playboy Bani is providing the soldiers' comfort; Frederick Forest is becoming open to see a tiger surrounding the forest; Strange scenes of long riverboat ride; Appearance of Hippi journalist Dennis Hooper by greeting Crabodian's crew and then Brando's bizarre character. It's going on in a strange sight and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some very unpleasant scenes, such as a cow in half Is cut (it is not seen anymore), a silly family was killed by the Shun's young stone throwing force in small boats and the crew was very clever from time to time. Then, there is immense amount of immorality, which is managed by many F-words. <br /> <br /> So there are many good and many bad things in this movie: One thing to make sure it is seen: This is a movie that you remember!
