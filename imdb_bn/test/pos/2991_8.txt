Out there with all the dreck, a decent movie about this young love. Yes, it is true that young love often makes more than qualified, but why are not people "Romeo and Juliet"? Paul and Michelle have a better behavior model than them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they escape, and set a standard life, but it's not a movie, real life. Pill is more sexually interested than Michelle, who came in a bad way. Finally, they are sex, but no one is forced to do it. The film lets kids know that sexually transmitted children may be the cause. <br /> <br /> One thing, movies have nudity. The camera does not focus on it, but it's there. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is a great opportunity to find Paul. At "Paul and Michelle," they are different for a while. If you do not like the end of a movie, think yourself. The alternative is not for the last DVD.
