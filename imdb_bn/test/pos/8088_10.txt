This movie is the perfect way to explain a good movie. It is a movie for both children and parents, and it is "inconsistent". I watched this movie eleven eleven o'clock and must admit that the actors are in the advance class, but the game of ClutterSensen is far below the world and moving. Why I say eleven of the ocean, there are several things in this 2 movie and Klatret√∏sen is good! That it can withstand compared with the oe. More than 3 young people who are used in Denmark, they can not believe them and play their part perfectly. In many cases of impossible tasks, it is managed in such a way that you will not believe many young actors (and sometimes even from "old boys"). The story Again, this is the common thing in the ocean with the oven because it means theft and they have to clutterocaine in a powerful room. The part of taking care of the younger brother of Eidu is a fine element in the film. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's good to see in a theater, because all the children in the room are commenting on the movie and these comments will be in your heart forever :-) <br /> <br /> Reddys Claws.
