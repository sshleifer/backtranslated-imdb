Before reading the film, I read the book and it immersed me emotionally, but I felt that it had truly moved to Afghanistan, a culture that I knew very little. I had a lot of hope for this movie and I was not disappointed. I did not read this book with those who saw it and enjoyed it. Their movies had to reduce some things but it was a good acting and good shot film. After it's over, leave your thoughts about the movie. You feel for the characters and their plights. I highly encourage this movie that likes emotional drama and likes to experience Afghan culture. There are some annoying scenes suitable for watching children. This is a heavy drama that describes the horrors of life under banned regimes.
