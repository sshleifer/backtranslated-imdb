Shirtk Holes (Basil Rothbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atul) are involved in the fight for the Battle of Switze inventors to control the construction of new bombshells. Holly wants to protect it for the British, until Mariani is sold to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that many fans updated during the Battle of Homes 1940 will be disappointed, this special film proves light-hearted fun, which is not lost in the war campaign, because it may have happened well. Dennis Hoye Inspector Lestrade and Nigel Bruce Dr. Watson has shown the tendency to steal this event because their characters provide continuous humorous humor to leftist methods. Sparring between Holmes and Moriraty is thought to be colorful and well-booted out. Even if she is not as memorable as the role of others, she is not good enough to act as a mother. Although this series does not provide anything particularly new or exciting for fans of this series, it is a wonderful landing from reality, in my opinion, something suitable for 1942, it measures the mirrors of many film serials of 1930s and 1940s. Do it. Boasts more compact, less repetitive plot And while these are still true to the basic souls of Sherlock Holmes, this is done.
