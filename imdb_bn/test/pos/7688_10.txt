"Purgie and Base" My first parents found me the first movie. Even at the age of 5, I became so big that I shouted loudly on the screen, "Crown, please do not base!" Many years ago I was fortunate to see a TV broadcast of "Pergie and Base" and now I have memorable memories (and record albums) to remember this wonderful, wonderful movie. I'm waiting and hoping and hopefully one day there will be a copy of my "Perry and Base" - but it does not seem to be that way. What's up? Obviously, there is enough public interest in the release of this movie. After all these years, I think it and make sure that I'm not alone. This movie is intense with the emotion of people - jealousy, passion, anger, courage, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a graveyard jewel that demands visitors to move towards the light to enjoy new audience and older audience.
