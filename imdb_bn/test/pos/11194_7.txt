My explanation is that the word 'remote' is used in the opposite meaning of 'warm'; Those who do not warm up to others. This picture reminds me of the teaching of 'Dalai Lama' in 'The Art of Happiness', where its main point is connecting others with happiness keys. The characters of the film are not only fuzzy, but they are ruthless, stupid, shy, calm and immoral. These features, among other things, constitute relationships and enjoy them and prevent them from being able to talk and deal with their problems. And as a result they are very unhappy. I see it as the firm determination of the teaching of the Dalai Lama (I am not intellectually by the way). If you are one of those people who think that their behavior is a natural reaction to living in a big city, but I think you can be right, but I recommend the book of Dalai Lama. City life will not be like this. <br /> <br /> I see why some people find it annoying - it drags in some places and the letters are not particularly special. And it is in contrast to the Lost In Translation where inbound characters are more selective and connect with each other, although they are not usually associated with people.
