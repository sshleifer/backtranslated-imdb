"Fata Morgan" by famous filmmaker Warren Herzgold is ridiculously disrespectful. Although there are characters in the film from time to time, there is no real story. The film is not an educational or historical documentary. It is a movie in addition to a movie. <br /> <br /> This image contains strange background music and some unreasonable story VO, whose combination covers a long string of most of the pictures, though not specifically the Sahara Desert. Some of the images are fantastic, fantastic, and out of the ordinary. Camera ex-photos, or mirrors, tantalizes and mesize optical confusions. <br /> <br /> These common cinematic tendencies are sometimes disintegrated by observational acids in deceptive matter. For example, in a sequence, a man wearing a goggles gives us a mini tutorial in our disguise. And the most interesting and bizarre sequence for me was, in a small interior room, there is a man with a dark goggle, which sings a voice that he uses that microphone completely distorted, with an old lady who tunes a futuristic piano . No man or elderly woman seems to enjoy what they are doing. How baroque <br /> <br /> "Fata Morgan" has an underlying concept, which combines a wide variety of strange images and eclectic words. But that idea is so subtle, so unclear that you can never find it without help. This fine theme makes the film truly sensual. But without that point of reference, the film may seem tedious and obstacles, a unmatched parade of random soil images and hidden descriptive pride. <br /> <br /> Unexpectedly unattractive, theoretically annoying and film-based discrimination, "Lollipop Morgan" will probably swoon you with joy, or you will be throwing. You might be tempted to look at Zenne's film's talent or to break the DVD into pieces. Most visitors will agree that: "Fata Morgan" ... is different.
