If you are a fan of Primary Dook movies, this loan star is a good old one. What else can you expect from Duke, Yak, and Gabby? Much better ridin 'and shooting' a lot !!! I was surprised to see the voice of Dwuck's song, Voice Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and Duke's friend, so the two brothers could be bills. However, if you like good, clean, early Western films, do not miss it. We do not have to be surprised about hidden meaning or try to find out the underlying theme. Just come back, relax and enjoy a Western movie from an easy day and time. It is called entertainment folks !!!
