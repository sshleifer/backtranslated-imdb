Now, Mom was not a great comedy from the train, but it's a fun load and makes you laugh. The title may seem a bit weird, but the whole film is not literally about it, though it is a bit of a terrible thing. <br /> <br /> Danny De Vito originally wanted to kill his beloved mother and wanted to move quickly. A little bit, some random and fun events take place. Premiere is quite funny, and that thing in Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito get great. Some of the scenes seem not suitable for me, but it does not make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It's a vague comedy, it closes well and should be seen once you just saw it.
