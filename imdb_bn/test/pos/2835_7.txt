It is a brightly photographed and unusually well-written Western by the "enlightened" elder creator of Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is his main help in this regard. His strong plot line can be said in a few sentences. Captain Richard Lance's cavalier officer, an accidental book, was captured in a castle after the assassination of an Indian enemy leader. He strongly advised to bring the man back to trial for sending Tixon; His commander sent another person to try to capture the prisoner for the trial and the checkpoint was wiped out. This means that the leader has escaped, and Lance will now have to manage the second Patrol - and he can choose the fort of the castle, which is the fastest one, a company of problems - can protect the fort in advance and it can save the command from others. Close the bottleneck pass in that sector to attack. As Lance, the young Gregory Pack is quite powerful. On the other hand, there is a large cast of this film which shows life around a cyclone, such as a discriminatory and combative army establishment, the ward bond is hard to trouble with hard-painting sergeant, Neville brand and Steve Brody, Warner Anderson and Lawn Chanie cause mental problems and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Hayes, Colonel's String The grandfather's wife Bryant as an associate officer. Even Barbara Petton plays a solid role due to the love interest. Michael Ansara was a prisoner war criminal, and played Jeff Corrie at Fort Scout. There are two great scenes in this very well made western area - the long part of the castle before sending the last gate, and the long holes for the debris. Defiant itself. Once in that castle, the Peacock gave a huge lecture to the people who were ready for the order, and he said about why he had brought them together. One of them read shortcomings; They will say, why they think that he sent his best friend to die in his place, instead of taking Indians instead of going towards him - and he proved his mistake for the rest of the film by winning his lone war with intelligence and courage . Franz Wuxman's music is good, production qualities are commendable; The argument about what would happen if the Lance war criminals were assaulted; Other than this unsuccessful mistake of the central character, it is great in the west, it is great. It has been a favorite of mine for fifty years.
