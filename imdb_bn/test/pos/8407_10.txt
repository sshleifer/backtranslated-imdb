The boys have a letter. I tried, I really tried! I tried so hard not to see this movie. When I was in the house or I saw the computer, I jumped on the computer. This is his second favorite movie, Godfather is the first (which I love). <br /> <br /> I ended up catching a little bit of this movie and finally one year later I was sitting with it to see it. I can not believe I say this, but I like this movie. Dalton plays a great Rite and has a pat down his ass. Whalley plays a delightful scarlett. The fullness of fire and smell and nothing will stop. <br /> <br /> When my favorite scene is abroad (Ireland?) and the government is going into the farmer's room because they are behind rent. Scarlett gets all this crazy and carries the whole debt, thus making a huge name for himself around this small town. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone wants you to try this movie ... especially if you are a fan of the wind with the wind. It takes a little bit of the new actors to use it but I think you'll get refreshing them.
