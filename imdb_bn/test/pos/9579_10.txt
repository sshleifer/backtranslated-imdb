Do you often see a movie that has refreshments with a talented show? Waldo Last Stand is a Refreshment. Here Waldo is selling Leibnad but not making any money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mikey and Bakheat came to meet him, because the miscreants are a Tibbous among 3 men and came in competition between the Alfalla and the Waldo for the love of the bride. Go back to the story: Waldo likes lemons to see if Walmo has kept it. A fun moment is when Alfalla receives a glass cup for Limonded and Waldo is admitted and she expresses anger over Darla and Alfala. Spanky Lebrad proposes to go with a floor show and even Mickey agree too much. When the show starts on the floor, there is no one in the barn but a customer (crack) comes. The Spanish ask him if he wants lebaked but all he does is not everything. Spanky promptly asked him the number of times and every time Froggy nods any Spanish who show many expressions on his face, which is funny. Spanky tries to thirsty him many ways. One way is when Mickey said that so lowly that "those crackers have become nunu and they thirst me" This is a bit of a lot of recreational bits. The opening number is Darla which he dances and singing. The second closes the album Alfalla (usually) "Mikey, Leonard, Spanky, and Bakwitt" I'm so dry! " (I believe they have sung songs that thinner thirsty. It makes me laugh.) Closing numbers include boys and girls dressed in old fashion. The last of this waldo was short of our gang. A grand musical short 10 out of 10 that is pure.
