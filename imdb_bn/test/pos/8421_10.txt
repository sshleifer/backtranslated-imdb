It is a film about a six year old child from a village in Maharashtra (a state of India) and to his grandfather's child's treatment in Pune (a city in Maharashtra). Here grandfather knew that the child has cancer in both eyes and he will be moved to save the child. The film is about the main characters and their feelings and activities until the operation is done. <br /> <br /> This film is not usually an Indian film, so don songs or romance or melodrama would like to see. This is one of the greatest imaginative sensitive movies to reach the point of resorts to silent expressions rather than the above conversations. This scene is witness to the grandfather about the need to remove the eyes of the children. Acting fantastic, dialogs broken dialog. Your heart goes away to grandfather whose operation is unreasonable to tell the child and his mother. <br /> <br /> The management of this topic is excellent. Under the direction of director Sandeep Sawant, a lot of trouble was created, which opened many doors for the collection of rupees. Six million (about $ 130000) budget. Even then the final product seems polished and has decent production standards. Adding some random shots in the lives of the boys in the village, witness the opposite city villagers, shown by the director. Sabbath must have liked the life of the village. <br /> <br /> It's all acting. As a social worker, Amrita Subhash's role is capable of adding the necessary human touch. Shankarani is a great doctor, as a doctor shows the perfect method. Ashwin Chitale as a natural child. She does not seem to act. Everything about him does not seem normal and forced. <br /> <br /> But Arun Nalawad is the greatest of all. He is wonderful in his role. The mere words can not describe his work. It's a performance of fondness for ever. <br /> <br /> Sincere efforts for making good movies It should not be overlooked that it shows that if things are kept simple, the results can be really surprising. 10/10.
