Like Steven Sigal, I have followed a big van Dam fan and most of his films have been followed since his acting career began. <br /> <br /> <br /> To work as part of the border patrol, from New Orleans to New Mexico. Faced with his past memories, to Jack it ended a party of former navies to isolate illegal illegal drug smuggling from the United States. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Action scenes are very intense and throws a couple of plot twists to keep you guessing even the movie. Unfortunately, Van Dam was not the same intensity 10th year ago, regardless of Shepherd: The Border Control is the third strong firm film that probably opened the door for a big project in Van Dame. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to the general fan of Van Damme fan or action movie; Shepherd: Border Control is a great film, better than death, not as good as death. Try to try this one, you will not be disappointed.
