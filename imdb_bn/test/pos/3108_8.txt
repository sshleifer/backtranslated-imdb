Both Jackie and Candice are awesome in this movie. They have the possibility to make their roles well suited and shining. In particular, the term candy is called "Puerto Rican" because it can be of the same type, but at the same time it is the same. I saw the origin of this movie, known as "Old Aquacinity", starring Bate Davis and Mary Hopkins. They do not complain, because the film is about female friendship, because it can be a problem. Here, the actress definitely praised and respected each other. Hart Bouchner and Meg Ryan have supported the part and both are excellent, especially Bokner, who has got a lot of good part in the film, so far as I am concerned. George Cooker did not make another film later, so it was good to go there.
