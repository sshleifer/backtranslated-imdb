I saw this picture for the first time tonight (5 November 2005). I wanted to see it because I saw the basketball diary (Leonardo de Caprio) and loved it but it was too heavy. I think it was a good illustration of a drug. I mostly express feelings with Nick Stahlus, probably because I'm crazy about someone, but I want to help stop it. A promising student and athlete who spends his time training and studying well-understand that he wants to try the life of his teenager (his crazy side) and he is addicted to his friend's efforts because of what he has about it and his terrible family situation He wanted to see the results of his most tragic death. A real tragedy but an error I noticed is that it does not get enough insight into the losses for the family, but rather than those, the excellent performance in a truly heartfelt movie.
