When the Advisor of the imperialist Hanbus dynasty was reduced by the Samanosuke dynasty, the faithful defender Cogna (June Fujimaki) escaped with his eight-year-old son Tatfumi and his daughter Kozasar. They serve a revengeful soul in Prison by the priest Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), a monster prison engraving beside a local mountain, the worshiper Majn in Hanbus dynasty. Ten years later, Cognaca and Tadfumi (Joshihiko Awami) tried to take revenge against Lord Samansouk (Gomti of Yitra), but this attempt was made and execution was executed. Pristes Shinobu, trying to save his master, threatens Samassouk with God's displeasure, only for his efforts he was sentenced to death. Samansouk ordered a vain, ruthless, narrow man, to destroy the statues of the mazis, so that the last hope of remaining among the remaining Hanubous loyalists can be adopted. But God Magazine, who is still silent, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Daimajin is an impressive, timeless, deeply-running fairy tale. Generally produced in a respectable budget, it's a movie about quality: fame, justice, modesty, loyalty, sacrifice, and love value. It is about the consequence of the scripture, and the rule, and the failures of disciplining the administration. Apart from dresses like William Bennett, our democratic bars are not much talked about, but it is still relevant, and why does Daimajine show us? <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why the Japanese cinema is so magnificent. Prices described above have specific relevance for those involved in this film, as they work for Japanese filmmakers. There is no lip service, no condescension, no taunts here. Instead, there is a real effort to abandon a world where these values ​​can get life again and to show what will happen when they fall ill. Just compare Daimajine, or the Lone Wolf and the Cub series, or any Kurosawa movie with the extraordinary Tarantino's Nihilistic Kill Bill B * Lysit, I want to see what it means. <br /> <br /> In a film whose contribution is equally extraordinary, I just want to point out Akira Ifikur's royal score, talent and beauty of the actors Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Awami and Mivi Takadah. Stunning illustration by Otome and Tsukimiya. I have never seen his death scene that is the most current and meaningful one.
