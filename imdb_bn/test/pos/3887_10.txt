Girlline is undoubtedly a Comedian comedian and a comedian for a good comedy. His first film, which fully describes his own creation and production, a struggling Chicago actor James Haroon, with which Jeff clearly identifies. He played James in the two-dimensional role of James on Paddy Chefsky's "Marty" and Jackie Gleason's poor soul. He played the second-person actor of Jackson, Jeff's friend in real life, the other former student of the second city city. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He happily believes Sir Silverman's heroism and strange humorous humor, despite the common sense and talents, can often believe the satisfaction of life often disappointing. Bonny Hunt gives a respectable performance as a romantic interest. <br /> <br /> Do not let a simple story confuse you, character and conflict are good thoughts and truth is true. Those who follow Gardner's career and understand that his humorous reality is based on ridiculing, they can not easily create spoken fiction, appreciate his conversation-driven story. <br /> <br /> We must surely do a lot of work for Girllein as a director and writer with other talented cute comedians who carry one of the challenges of life.
