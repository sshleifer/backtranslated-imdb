I was really pleased to play this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were great. But still, I felt that I wanted more than this game. It's good for James Bond but it's not as good as his other games. It would be great if they could create a 360-something ramax for it. It would be better then. It can only be bad, I'm actually bad games, rising dead and in games like games. So it could be better but it was just right for the game. One thing I absolutely hate Natalia! He was always bored and could not even run. I recommend this game who likes more than me fps games. 7/10 Star
