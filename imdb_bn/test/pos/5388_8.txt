I can make a difference between many people on this board but I like to see Mensika's mind. I like Mensychic's mind because the hosts are not afraid to talk about their mind or to absorb stereotypes. Carlos Mensia What we do with all of our friends but is reluctant to accept it and then something. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no problem joking about any race, religion, gender or orientation in Menyaia. That's why he got a lot of cracks, but in this politically correct time it's a breath of wind breeze. If Mensia insults someone, she does not take care of her, but she is not racist and even jokes about her own race. <br /> <br /> The typical layout for Mindia's mind is like this: There will be an open skit made fun of a person or recent events. Mensia came out and stood for 5 or 6 minutes, where she talked about different issues. The show then has 2 separate skits divided by ads. In these skits, Mensia performs various types of fun, making fun with her, giving her personal opinion with a fun twist, or simply parodying people, events, or movies. After the show, Mensia came out to say one final skit or something else for a minute. <br /> <br /> People criticize Menace for criticizing and say that her statement is very objectionable. Carlos thinks only about some other particular nation but are not afraid to say it. Because Mensia is objectionable, she only talks about her mind. I can not find any fault with him. <br /> <br /> The show is not perfect. Skits can not be well together and sometimes Mencia does not go over its joke line. Most of the time, this is a show where the comedians say what's in mind does not matter the consequences and gifts of fun things. So if you are afraid to smile at stereototype and someone speaks his mind and often tell you what you wanted to say, then see Mensychic's mind. But if you are easily unhappy, you will not see this show because you can laugh even if you get offended or bad.
