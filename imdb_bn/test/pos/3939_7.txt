Richard Shikel's 1991 documentary about Gary Cooper - "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" shows us as an extraordinary, universal star through her film and her life. Described by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely taken as "Gary Cooper, American" through the quick clips of her many scenes in the West and scenes from "Meet John Doe", "Mr. Dids Gown to Town" and "Sijt". York "The best part of the documentary is Cooper and his family and home movies of his childhood photos, which he has shown as a beautiful golden child with a beautiful smile, will have a whole life, it's a sunny clip." Jack Beni Show "named" Jack Beni Show "Cooper's name "Bird dog" - and Beni lost it.

Instead of sitting on a bad scene in Howard Roker's "The FountainHead", he gave a speech that he had admitted to the writer, he did not understand - a young man, a tall coop in Tocus was a nice touch. This documentary, lazy, is certainly produced by a man.
