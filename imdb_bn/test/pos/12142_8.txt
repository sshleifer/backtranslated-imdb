I've only seen about half a dozen movies with Leno Ventura acting, but it seems like a lot more like the others. She is playing a physical criminal - the words who subdued those short and still occasionally explosive. I saw his silent personality in films like Shadow and Second Bright Army, the lowest style of his performance is very effective. In other words, because she is so silent and intelligent, she sees you when she works evil. And, like these other movies, he's a very strong, though rolled, moral code. <br /> <br /> Hubble is being resident Davos (Ventura) and his partner, Lilane, both living in Italy and working criminals. Both grew up in France and eventually they had flea due to their criminal activities. Now after the movie begins in Italy, they are continuing to live in the lip and the heat is going to catch them. Surprisingly, instead of going to the third country, they decided to return to France - although Devos has been tried and convicted in absentia - and if he is caught, it can be a life of prison or execution. The first third of the film expresses concern over the return of their secret. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Davos, the return does not go completely and now it looks like the police are looking for him in France. In addition, the reaction of his old classmates to crime is not at all what he expects. In fact, their reactionary reactions to the end of the movie have ended, in the end of the film, the series of horrific events. <br /> <br /> As well as along the way, Davos came with a newborn baby, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Despite Davos's friends, Stark and his lady friend do their best to succeed. Anyway, another monkey threw it in the wrench, but two little boys of Devos - what to do with them Devos - hide them with them? <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very good crime movie - like the French film Nir. Unlike American Nero, I have found that most French versions are more realistic and they have a silent point of view. Lethalism reigns supreme, sure! Acting first rate (especially from Ventura and Belmonds), the direction is very sure and very nice to write, although I'm sure many will not like the end. It seems like tacked - just like a tackout. I understand why they did this, but they can also see how dissatisfied it can be. For me, it has left me a tad plane. Otherwise, an exceptional film.
