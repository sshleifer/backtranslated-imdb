Looked like a romantic comedy that does not lead to the well-known people, it also plays the role of male lead and female lead, and although the story is a little long and little can not help you, it likes it. <<br /> <br /> I think the story ran a little bit till the end, but when the elaboration extended the story became even longer. Well familiar with Mr. Hanker with other 100 other romantic comedies, and perhaps tied with my tutor friend. <br /> <br /> This will play an interesting role in the Korean movie, not as big as my Sassie girl, but still good.
