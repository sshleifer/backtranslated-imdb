I like this movie. This is the wind? What can I do to get it again in the air because I miss this movie again in the air? I love this movie so much. Does anyone know how long it has been in Disney? It's been a long time and I'm so sick to wait! I would like to see the Susie question again. I swear, they all stop playing the air of the movie and play for those who are fake and retarded new stupid gay. I miss this movie, a star, want Kamalama with Shakil O'Neil, and a lot more. Where to go all the good movies? I want them back I miss all good movies and they do not have anymore. If anyone finds Susie question or an old Disney movie, please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no spaces) 148 Thank you and I hope you want this movie again. Happy day
