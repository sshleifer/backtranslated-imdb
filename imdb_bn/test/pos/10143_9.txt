A rebuilding of a film that was created by Alfred Hitchcock in England in 1934 with the same name, Man Who New to Many {1956}. In my opinion, his next attempt is much higher. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hittak will argue that the rimak middle and Peter Lorr do not blur the genus spinal. In both the films, the plot is basically the same, except for the original set of Switzerland and the reconstruction of Marachak. It tells the story of a married couple {James Stewart and Doris Day}, screaming out their little boy and meeting the dubious man, which is very strange about their past. It happens, he is an agent who is looking for a couple to engage in the plot to kill the world leader. Then he dumped into a McCain market because it was found that he had entered the spy and the arm of Stuart. After his death, he told him the whole story of the massacre. After Stewart and Day, they came to know that the couple they saw were the couple who were looking for the agent and kidnapped their son. This film has an excellent performance by Stuart and Day. Directly as a dramatic role, worried and fearing parents. This picture proves that Doris Day can work in disrespectful plays and unexpected songs. Alfred Hitchcock's guidance is at the top. Keep the film at your peak every minute. The scene of Albert Hall is a classic. The roots gradually decreases slowly and slowly gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually they gradually decreases gradually gradually. 10.
