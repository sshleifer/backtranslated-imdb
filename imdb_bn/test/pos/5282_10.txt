For a movie it is rare for you to be removed in the world and after the credit roll you will want more. Haoy Miyazaki Ponyo is such a movie. <br /> <br /> This picture is about the story of a young Sonarfish named Panoo who wants to become human. He swims on the shore and is found by a young boy named Sasuke, who promises to care for her. The father of course Panoe, a real-time obsessed magician named Fujimoto, tried to save Piano from being humanitarian to maintain the balance of nature, which eventually resulted in huge losses when Ponio transformed into a little girl. <br /> <P> Pinoo is a very rich film. It is full of wonderful imagination, loving character, and true heart. Here's what the director Hayo Miyazaki did to make a simple story, and when the real movie is making magic. <br /> <br /> Pinoy is a wonderful experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. Along with this, Miyazaki's environmentalists are still as clear as before. Miyazaki often shows the smell and dirt in the ocean between the wonderful light, that the father's father does not refer to a relentless mission to clear the oceans of the world. Although the story is simple, Miyazaki manages to add an extra layer to this extra level with a skillful skill. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful work of art, every hand-drawn cell looks like a wonderful pastel painting. The film looks a lot different than many studio gambling productions, but artists are as spectacular as before. Fujimoto's castle under the sea is highly inventive and visible, where the running serial across the jumping fish between the Typhoon to reach the piano sofuk. This <br /> <br /> This picture makes such a memorable experience that its nicely executed characters. Sosuke is a young boy who actually works older than him, and Energetic Ponyo is a minute smile. Each character is very enjoyable and very memorable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ponio is an amazing experience, interesting in a single way. Although the film can be sold as children's fairy tales, I believe many adults will be blown away in their fantastic world as well as their children. The film may lack Miazaki's previous work density, but here she considers herself to be true, it provides fun, heartfelt and entertaining movies together. This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I'm 10 perfect for 10 panio!
