This, without doubt, one of my favorite horror films ever! I can not really believe that it does not get much popular during liberation, especially when the main competitors were the Craven Siechual and the copyright thunder in the normal way, all the silly witnessing styles, mysteries and accelerated plot twists, Hitcoak / Despapa movie, some very sharp black Combined with comedy and a great plot. It does not promise anything more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie, but it's not hard to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> The silent girl working in a Russian factory set to set up a horror film set. In a series of incidents, he accidentally locked himself and leaned towards a snooze movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is the lack of screaming that attacks every horrific attack. Film never made. The main character silently, he can not make any words - something that is a blessing in some parts of the movie, and the curse among others. <br /> <br /> The director feels that his hitcoats have been very well-read, even opening scenes are both "tongue-in-cheek" in Hitakoop's "Psycho" and a fairly generic slash scene. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> All of us are highly satisfied, well-crafted and action-packed psycho thrillers, which I recommend to look for something slightly different from the recommended Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Maywers / Damien Registers.
