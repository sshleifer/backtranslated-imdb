The universal, physical, and / or emotional condition is one: an isolation. I think the film also commented on cultural displacement. <br /> <br /> The picture shows the experience of two Turkish men (cats). There is one money (and comfort to stay 'made' with a stable income); There is someone else and the job goes to search. Not happy Do not expect any celebration of life here - this loneliness, Martin and all. <br /> <br /> The image has succeeded in suggesting a strong gradual trance across the 'low ground' of human condition. Courageous film making. Well played and good shot in my scene (outdoor shot by port is my own choice). Anyone who should be encouraged by gratitude is not unaware of the happiness and perfection of life (not mentioning employment); Everyone else will find a companion in this picture. An ice floe is a film with all the warmth and speed. A bitter pill hopes, a 'happy pill.'
