In the dark, on the new New Year's Eve, a sick nurse, his life gradually disappeared, claiming that David Hall would present it to him at once. We still do not know who is David Hall, or why this nurse wants to see him, but his only desire to die is to talk to him once more. On the other side of the city, Holm (Victor Sjstrom, who was instructed) and his two drunk companions are waiting for the new year's arrival in the cemetery of the local cemeteries. "Here we can say that we can never get new year," Holm exclaims, a finger welding towards the big clock tower that looms through the darkness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once he was known as George, "an ally colleague" who "is smarter than the rest of us" Was there. A few years ago, on the day before the one-year New Year, George broke a potential catastrophic explosion, which had threatened that the final gestation will take his last breath before midnight, for the next year, death will be executed for the chariot and the soul will be collected. Dead "And, gentleman, George died the last day of the New Year!" Holm happily bothered to contain the skepticism of his mocking people's beliefs. Finally, on midnight stroke, there is an unexpected violent encounter, as the result of Holm's death. The transparent spirit of the human grows gluten from his earthly body, as he witnessed its horror, the remote method of a phantom carrier. The driver, a purple cloaked figure - tightly clasped his hand in a sickle - stepped down from the car and approaches. We discovered that the driver is no less than the person who is downgraded, ready to perform the terrible responsibility of the successor of this year. <br /> <br /> In the era of 'Corcenle' created, special effects are absolutely fantastic in this picture. The painter Julius Zenjan used bi-exposure photography for the car's perfunctory, geological silhouette and his cursed driver. Even today, the end result is highly effective. A special fascinating scene involves gems chariot for the recovery of a deep sinking soul inside the sea floor trips. Another scene of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' Jack Terrence (Jack Nicholson) memorable, Hollem broke the kitchen door with an ax to reach out to his fledged wife and children. <br /> <br /> A truly subtle work of Victor Sjostrom's 'KÃ¶rkarlen' film, ostensibly evil and his death sentence, successfully depicted Holmes's permanent drunkenness, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hopeful possibility of release.
