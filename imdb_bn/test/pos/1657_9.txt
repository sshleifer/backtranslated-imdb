What a movie gas! "Movies silent" has always been one of my favorite genres, but it differs from the rest. Only "The Big Big Slip", "Out of the Past", "Mard Me Me Meet", and "The Killers" can come near this Copper Classic. I know the four American films I mentioned are not cinema movies, but intelligence stories with complicated story lines, which still speak a "Naurian" like their "Riffey", their quality quality. <br /> <br /> What is different about this is the rough combination of this movie, which is not a radioactive reality of principals, but also for the use of a supernatural character and co-conspirator on the streets of Paris! The film draws near the end of "Le Stefanoiseis", a dark, moody, and complex exorcise voice drops in one last shot with huge amounts of money. Although he is a helpless and hard-working hard man, one still feels desperate to get rid of his past giants and for some relief (Hey, he saved Tony!). Dashin chose the right man for that role. (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Death. Only their women survive, besides Ida, Mario's honey. They all understand the underlying futility!
