Over the years, I was very much interested in this teenager who left such a deep, uninterrupted mark in the world. My consciousness is also afraid of birth, as it can happen again. <br /> <br /> And in the coming years, yes, I'll be scared 'It happens around us and of course' it 'was Annie being long ago. Of course, this' so-called civilized society 'itself or innocent country / country / continent and murder in cold blood can become citizens' excuse? <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler that a deep truth of Hitler was not mentioned that he was democratically elected and that all the torture of repeatedly punished for the public as a result of a tyrannical podel-press and horrific propaganda Was done. <br /> <br /> In one of the atrocities, brought to death camps by Ana Frank, who survived the miracle of the Diary's survival <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branaugha has done an excellent job in commentary and interviews, that's the rare gift of reducing his own personality so he can talk for himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> Many new events and interviews have never been lived in fascinating studies before, which I will not enter here because they add genuine reality and harmful sadness to the film. <br /> <br /> The song is perfect for a part of the diary and read the selection from her, she brings dinner and tanata on her role. <br /> <br /> Anne was interviewed with old childhood friends and the days before her death were recorded with her record and her vibrantness. Naughty personality <br /> <br /> It can not be missed. An astonishing and respectable movie about Ana seen rarely. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
