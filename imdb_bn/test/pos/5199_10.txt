This photo is an infantry for DOS boot submarines. If you appreciate Das Boot, you must know. <br /> <br /> This is a good work in the movie. On a par with das boots. Basically, it follows an organization of an elite German "StormTropper" infantry organization, who left Garrison's duty in the city on a large Italian coastline and immediately pushed the disordered Russian Front to the chaos. <br /> <br /> A good fight enlightens both film intelligence and cruelty of war, and simultaneously inspires our experience of war and necessary humanity. This is the movie that works. The film is full of drama and action and as well as the stage is entertaining.
