I love military comedies (Sgt Bilko, Stripes, Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope, but love it has a heart. <br /> <br /> Stingray SS-161 (USS Pampanito) was fantastic. Absolutely beautiful, come alive a piece of art. So it's a diesel engine sub, so what? I learned that the airline carrier USS Ranger (which stood for Star Trek's fourth enterprise), a huge ship, was 'conventionally operated', which means that Ranger also had a diesel. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Bakoman, this may have stinger in Korea! This may expire in 1966! Bauman: What is the matter (full of fingers and tastes it), sir? It still taste like creamed dessert. <br /> <br /> <br /> Pascal: Without (yelling), it's frozen ham !! Bakman: It's a problem. <br /> <br /> This story, perhaps a weed sneak impressive. Winslow Dodge was honored, and looked after her, so she wanted to give a chance to Dodge. He gave him a barbarian but still flabby classroom, and gave him the task of using the diesel sub to avoid nuclear navy and 'attack' Charleston Harber and Norfolk. 2-star Admiral Graham (his third star in his eyes, and anger against DJ) gave him the ragatagrew crew, hoping he would be disappointed so that he could lose Dodge. Tom can get the dodge sequence and work as a team, and can he take an old, old sub sub, and the best of the Navy?
