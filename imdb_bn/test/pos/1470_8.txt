South Park builder Tray Pay Parker and Matt Stone finally came out of their annoying schedule to talk to the cameras while throwing champagne on their hot tubes. Initially, while watching it, I did not feel as much quibble as this was as I did. I knew they were joking when they complained about different actors, and when the tray said that she would not give her any money to her mother, she was so fond of living that this documentary is full of jokes inside a sweetie. <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows everything about the south park (until the second season). It shows what goes behind the scenes with animation and recording. It has interviews, many who interview fake, but some, in all fabrications, give insight into the show. Tray Parker's spirit is showing clips from both Christmas shorts, as much better clips from shows. If you are a South Park fan, it should be removed from the thirst of your knowledge when it is seen in late 1998. Now the show has changed, but it's still interesting. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a fun documentary where Tray Parker (especially) and Matt Stone came as a proud shock, and just wanted to come off as well. They can be like this in real life, but here it was a joke, a 51-minute insightful joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** **** 51 minutes There are no rates, languages ​​and sexual content.
