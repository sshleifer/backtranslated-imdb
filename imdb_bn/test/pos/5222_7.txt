"Father Hood" is a strange little jewel of a "road movie". Holly berries, Subina Lloyd and Brian Bonsal's fine acting, Dianne Lad and Michael Iranside's two funny "over the top", <br /> <br /> and a perfect extraordinary performance from Patrick Soze. The film was assisted by an unusual story, but it is badly worn by flashback framing which is an introductory, sudden completion. "Father Hood" did a great job without these "bookmarks". However, this film highlights the "family responsibilities" and important aspects of the state's interference. As long as the Foster system prizes the state institutions for not having children, such abuse will be available. <br /> <br /> Please choose this. It is "worth the ride."
