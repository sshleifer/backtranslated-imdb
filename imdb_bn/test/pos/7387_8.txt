If the end does not happen so unexpectedly then I do not think I can rate it very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture contains many uncomfortable, annoying, "interconnected characters" interaction. Such things are not like my play, so the pace started dragging for me. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to relate to the main characters, and thus it is taken care of - husband (Alan Rickman) is rather bitter and cranky and wife (Poly Walker) is different and a little violent. The acting was just fine (Norman Rudas was very lucrative), but the letters were probably a little flawed (for me). <br /> <br /> The setting was beautiful and fit properly and was a bit confused. The cinematography was something I found to be young. <br /> <br /> The last 5-15 minutes of this movie are so impressive that the behavior of every uncomfortable scene, strange conversation and unreasonable character is absolutely worth it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Conspiracy and drama, mostly not.
