Great, Chris Dinontopolis has been seen as the best Roebuck Williams I've seen. He did it perfectly. Seeing Robin Williams, I saw him like this .. It almost cries after seeing him. <br /> <br /> I did not know that Robin John Belushi was so long as he was a friend. The screenplay of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on its own merit. Very sad, how both of them left. <br /> <br /> I really felt both Val and Robin in their rough time. <br /> <br /> I hope Robin keeps $ 100 bill in this guy's hat! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vancouver!
