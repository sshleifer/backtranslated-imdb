I just returned from the NLC AMC Lounge 34th GLBT Film Festival. A friend told me about this picture. The response to the audience was very positive! Lots of good solid laughs as well as plenty of some quiet moments to realize. Top grooves in each area. A movie that you think, and then you realize how lucky we can always come back and live without shame or crime. I imagine, that will come so close, not win, the audience favorite reward! The most surprising thing was that the movie started to be ridiculous and then gradually we were struck as a real commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reaction of that group. There is no intelligent humor at the expense of a group, but only the slow realization that if we all return without guilt, we will come back.
