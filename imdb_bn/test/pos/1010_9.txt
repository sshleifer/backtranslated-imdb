Hehehe. It was one of the best fun road movies! I smiled, so I left the chair. Many Norwegian and foreign celebrities play themselves Harold Jawart producer, Agent Codi Bank and of course one night's MacCull is known for the films. <br /> <br /> It's about the Norwegian crazy fans, Germany is going to the Football World Cup in 2006. And crazy fun that comes with all kinds. It was fun. I could not laugh I was not so funny about the ages. Rumors say it's a number two, but I do not know. It will hit hard one. <br /> <br /> Recommend everyone! It is a must see the film. I was able to see it in the movie, but at the time shown I worked. And have been trying to rent it for a month, but rent out all the time. The DVD got it today. It is well worth it.
