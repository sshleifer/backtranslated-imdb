I was released when this movie was seen and there is no doubt touching heart rate. I saw a child who came to know that what he thought of him was not true. It's a small kid that pounded a pound. And to find out who he is searching for. And before and after he knows about him, the relationship between him and his parents. That's a nice view. By adding a good re-recording and rhythm to its rhythm by the song. Moni Ratnam does not exaggerate or advise in this movie (such as Bhueer) but simply describes the characters. And because of this, the film attacked the audience. The scenes of swimming pools and snake charmers are not fully disclosed. Gem Ratnam has amazingly improved.
