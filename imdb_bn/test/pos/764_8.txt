I'm a fan of Rupert Green, who rented this photo a few months ago. I thought it was a very good writing movie with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining, and Rupert Green could play more than that of Ruposhi Weasley's most famous character. Ben's fine portrayal and the other's greatest performance made this movie very much liked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> She's got to find one and became, I guess you could call a retired actress Evie, "Assistant". First, it's just a way to earn some money. But after a while, he and Evey seem to develop a friendship. Evey helps some breaks from his shell and makes him fun and happy with himself, and ultimately, both seem to need each other. <br /> <br /> You are not a fan of Rupert Green, this movie is very nice and really entertaining with moments. I recommend it to anyone that wants to see a great movie with extremely great and talented actors.
