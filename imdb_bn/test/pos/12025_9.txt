This is one of the most exclusive entertainment things I've ever seen on television in Bravo. Contrary to my first and the Gym Gyms (the world's highest punk-supergroup / cover-band), the Dan Band should be really appreciated. <br /> <br /> On paper, Dan Bond is the only one-act of amateurs - people go into gratuitous prejudice in singing and singing songs. If you hear their "Dan Band Live" CD, then what you get will be old. (I just bought it because it had some songs that were not particularly on TV.) But Dan Finarty was present at the amazing stage of the hero of any Hollywood culture. This person owNS its audience for every second And backup singers are also a big part of the visual fifth. As the original band - they are mostly away from the point of view but definitely more energetic and enthusiastic than your standard lounge-act backing band. Hopefully, a DVD version will be released soon - almost all of the songs have been spent, and although heavy sensing adds a little strange humor, it also removes intrinsic humor. <br /> <br /> If there is any idea that the World, the Vegas casino owners will soon have to fight Dane who can create her own showroom. <br /> <br /> "Again my member ... number!"
