Hello, I thought if someone has a copy of the broken promise of the movie ?? I saw this movie growing up and every time it was there. I've been looking for years to have been years and want to get a copy. I've checked all the internet and are unable to find it. If someone has a copy to trade or sell M, please email me at NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thank you and have a great night !! Christine --------- "broken promises" 11-year-old Melissa Mickelsen was created, whose parents left her and her siblings. Taken by the county, Michaelsen had to go helplessly because his brothers and sisters split up and cultivated in different families. One of the kids is even institutionalized. Juvenile Court Officer Chris Sarandon joined Michaelsen in a struggle to reunite his family on one roof. The broken promises were originally given as a "General Foods Golden Showcase" presentation. It was the first broadcast on May 5, 1981.
