I first admitted that it was a concern when I first heard about the film in the Apocardhana. <br /> <br /> I mean, they have a lot to live in, do not they? When they did first stage shows they won Periyar's prize and when they did the radio, they won a Sony Award. When they move towards our telelie, they win the Batista Award, the Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose of the Metro. <br /> <br /> When the first series was broadcast in January 1999, the mind became dull! The original breathing of fresh air in the British comedy, and when the second series is broadcasted a year later, based on this and styled the shadow culture seal around the world, our web statistics show that we got visitors from every single planet on the planet! 'Local Show for the Local People' showed the giants genre for live performances and opened doors for more live work in the western 'art'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A tribute to Christmas special, a sketch show and more classic horror movies, still covered in the delicious league style. <br /> <br /> And then there was a 'hard' third series, still a must still hit with faithful cheerful fans, but the mainstream TV audience was a bit less than its time. <br /> <br /> As I say, so much more <br /> <br /> Now we have a film ... and a movie is different, is not it? This can be seen by a lot of radio or TV shows and I was worried about the third series. <br /> <br /> Well, you know I was lucky to see a movie yesterday. Press screening in London and all my doubts have gone away (literally) in the first few minutes! I'm not going to give plot lines like some critics, or I'm going to tell you catch phrases (though this is really the only) but I'll try to tell you what has managed to achieve with this movie! On Monday night I just wanted to leave the movie, 'Oh my god, it's brilliant, it's wonderful, it's better than that, better than the first, second and the special one! 'Of course I give a lot better explanation than my audience! So, why is it brighter? This is a film for everyone, casual fan, passionate fan, sometimes fan and anyone sitting in the wrong movie! The series did not see you to enjoy this picture; It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> This picture reminds me why I'm a gentleman fan! You can say that filming is a true labor of love too; The detailed attention is incredible. The set for the TV show was always in the details but I'm going to watch the movie again to watch the background again! This story is going on fast, our action is taking from the real world to the real world where we are meeting with the 'creators' who are the League itself! We can enter the favorite characters from the show but unlike the TV sketch show, in the central story always <br /> <br /> I am very happy that this picture was in the dark, a little scary and a little weird ... only for the gentleman Suitable. Gantes could take revenge on BBC Sensors, the word 'Mongoloid' is not as loud as it is on the roof! Someone may think that the gents are a little less painful to me, but it is a joke and my only concern comes up, I can laugh some of the viewers down loudly and they can be a little clever ... but I should not Worried, there is always a joke that always comes near the corner and the joke does not come about, they come thick and fast, and Wrong references, wig jokes, boom jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! Since I did not laugh loudly in movies ... well, I can not remember! Since the beginning, fans of 'fans' with the League are rewarded with 'In-jokes' load, some of which work on two levels, mainstream viewers may laugh at the references of a compact disc for one of the fans of the locals, the show will smile for other reasons together! Teenage talent! Peter Kai and Simon Peg You've created any strange double act, Simon has just got one of the movies, just makes a word! I heard for the first time when I was a little worried about the 1690's view of this movie but I was getting it just like a story story ... but that was to say! I just do not need to say that it fits nicely and joins the overall feeling of the movie! I'm not a professional critic of movies, so I think it's difficult to speak in my language to enjoy this movie, but now I'll just say that if in recent years the supposed map of the British comedy film was' Sean 'dead' then I'm sorry but a new dimension detector , Delightful and sometimes a little funky set ...
