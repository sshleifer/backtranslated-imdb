Two major parts of the plot element of crime and liberation, the two strongest plays and heavy, strong plays that Oscars love so much (which "The Run Runner" was nominated only for the best original score - the nomination's lack was possibly unjust). Most of the film adaptations in books (or any other means) are generally less than their literary reflections (and "The Right Runner" is not an exception), the film adaptation of Mark Forster is good. <br /> <br /> Most people are familiar with the story, the book has been taught by millions, so I will not leave the book nor say that the book is quite reliable from its source. It is said, if you do not know this plot, then watch the movie, or better, read the book. <br /> <br /> The best thing "The Right Runner" is going for it) Director Mark Forster. Forster's epic opportunity and unique perspective, which completely used to bring the book to Khaled Hossain's screen. A small part of me is worried that he would use the same dreaming images which included Ford's previous features, "Finding Neville." Take me wrong, "Finding Nevland" is a great movie, which is actually my favorite, but the visual trick used here is not a place here. Fortunately, Forster understands, and the brightness of its direction shows its diversification. Although the lack of nomination for the best director for his work is not just a debate, I could see several stores in the store for him under the street. <br /> <br /> also the adaptation of the script. It remains faithful to the source, but it leaves the place for Forster's perspective to explain the material. The dialogue is not dumbed down, and it's Along the direction of Forster, moves in a difficult speed. Like Forster, lack of recognition for the screenplay was not a tragedy, but at least nominated I could not complain. <br /> <br /> The partition line in this movie is superb and outstanding with outstanding acting. Most of the performance is firm, but there is something that is not mostly cut, and it hurts the film. The most notable performance is from Zakaria Ibrahimi, who plays young Amir. It is not bad, it just can not be that effective. He can not translate the crime that Sriram had given to Amir. Actually, at this moment I was lost at this moment, I did not read this book at the moment. He sees pride, and sometimes annoying, but we can not feel his passion. It is a difficult part to illustrate, and in most cases young Abraham has his own right, which is particularly surprising. This is the role of his first film. <br /> <br /> Best Actor comes from Abdullah, who is an adult Ameer, Shaun Taub, who played the Rahim story. Abdullah may not be a familiar name (though he was in Paul Grangera's "United 93"), but his work here is amazing. He needs a quiet, submissive man, and when he needs to emulate perfectly. A less-competent actor could make Rahim Khan's character a cliché, but Shaun Tibb used his skill in performing his work which he was trying to portray in the clichés. <br /> <br /> <br /> I go to a rant here, but this is something that I address, and that's the film's PG-13 rating. This film has received so little rating that the incident is violent. There is no argument for this. Some might argue that the rating is for everyone to see it, such as "Savings Private Ryan" in Gore, which has said that it has earned an NC-17 rating film. But that exception can not be applied here. The only purpose is to visualize the scene. Foster tried (perhaps, at the direction of the producers) that he could allow the film's most painful and annoying scene to kiss the film with PG-13 rating, but portraying the content element is very annoying. Regardless of any means and less than an R rating, irrespective of how it can be described as "tasteful". Bad, this edit hides most of its power scenes, and makes it unexpected to get less ratings. In addition, some scenes of violence are incredibly annoying. How long does these scenes take from the movie, it does not add much, but at the very least, what is the qualification of the R rating? MPA, whose ratings have always been corrupted by the systems of the system, this movie has gone a new lot with such a low rating. <br /> <br /> But it should not blame the film for this. The film is a strong movie which is good to watch, especially if they are fans of books.
