This is a wonderful movie during the romantic period of civil war. This film must definitely see this for Eastwood Fans and Eastwood. This is one of his favorite movies. I could not agree more. Be careful! This is a spoiler-eistown's death at the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel correctly argued that the end should be unexpected and should be dissatisfied for some reasons. They wanted one, the stick for the book. Secondly, there can not always be a happy ending. Thirdly, it was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement of this terrible struggle of war where people were being killed inappropriately. I agree with it all. This is a wonderful shot film and I love most movies involving civil war. It is more than a portrait of how fraudulent women can be - which can be more dangerous than men, so the headline title betrays much to Beguidell's statement. At the beginning and the end, the music song by Eastwood is not just a civil war, but a statement against the Vietnam War and possibly indirectly comes across women during this movie. Wonderful story of love and cheating and many memorable scenes - Note: This film is rated for any reason. There is probably no language, some things about sexual matters- but nudity is not really there. Nice movie - 9/10
