The first thing I noticed about this movie is how everything was set up. A quality movie is all round. <br /> <br /> I think you can choose this image just for its action, but I like it more than that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a completely fleshed script than most horror films. I think, at least the US edition has brilliantly ended, and it was great all the time. The story felt honest and cruel. <br /> <br /> The film has a nice, tight script that is running with credible characters in most reliable situations.
