The Italian work watch is a real explosion. This is a truly entertaining movie, which you can watch for its free experience. It is not heavy with dramatic or handicaping, there is no cosmic statement about its life and it is not violent or unclean. It's just a fun movie. The little mini coopers roam the streets of L.A. and show stunning bits with stereototype computer gaiÄ‡-turned-crook (played wildly at Seth Green), I have been so much fun to see this movie. <br /> <br />> Background music in particular They really set a disciplined tone for such a movie, so the fine still keeps you on the edge when needed. Clearly many artists contribute to the music, I think it is the most classified part of the film. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8 out of 10. Not terrible but inspirational but to see the end of a great movie. Lousy day at the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
