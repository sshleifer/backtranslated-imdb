We did not see this movie several times, we were caught pretty nicely on the standardized DVD long ago. "Le Serekal Rouge" is a film that owes a large amount of money to other movies, because it reminds us of "Riffey", "The Effort Jungle", because they take the central stage and capture the movie. This is great detail. Unfortunately, nobody knows that the whole of crime does not understand that the crime does not pay off and these people are involved in it since the beginning. They are destroyed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Melill was the director of several words. He has not filled his pictures with dialogues in many cases here. Nevertheless, due to "no takers", they had their own style of proven with "Le Douls", "Le Samurai" and his best work, "Bob Le Flambeur". Mr. Melville was the style that he comes across everything. In this movie, working with his cineographer Henry Duke, he traveled the streets of Paris, which mainly shows the bright city and silent winter of France. Score is done by Archie Demerson, which emphasizes poker music with most of the action. <br /> <br /> Although Aline Dellon shows Cori in the center of the film, but who is the real hero of the Smart Inspector Menti? Acting by Great Bowruville, he is a man who can be very patient because he has started from the beginning, how to catch Vogel, and in this process he is involved in the investigations of the Jihadite Heist, which he escapes, he is tailing big looms behind it. To show an equal footing to the statue of determination and softness, Borwill gives a very satisfying performance, because it is happening in the same way with three cats. <br /> <br /> Alain Dylan always played an interesting role in her appearance in Malvich's film. Here he is not going to return to Cori, who is leaving prison for the first time and promises himself, but he can not pass a good thing while going forward and participating in robbery. His co-operation with Vogel and Jansen ended in the same way, but they would prove a mistake that they could not solve the loot, because they changed their heart to visit <br /> <br /> Zain Maria Volta and Yevs Montand respectively Jansen is seen as such. They are excellent actors who mix well in film work. Took the role of film and it shows both actors were at their best moments. Mr. Montand has more complex character since we saw a man with many demons inside his head at his first moment in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Melville has received excellent results from him, and the crew, who feels a little too much, still succeeds in displaying his style among the most memorable pictures from the director.
