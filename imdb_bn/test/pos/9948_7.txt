If you like Japanese giant movies, then you love to make this action packed war a foreign invader, the desire to conquer the world, and a "monster robot" with super-surveillance surgery. Alien from the Gargoyle Planet, "Imporior Giltoen", has an army of its holes (of course) "Garhuel gang", as well as an endless supply of unfavorable animals which regularly hide in the earth to destroy the Earth's debris. , Shouting aloud loudly, feared people, etc. A little boy named Johnny Sokko placed giant robots in his giant call, and hit the robot as necessary, to kill and then blast this creature. Johnny joins the "good spy" group called Unicohan and tries to help save the world. <br /> <br /> The curiosity of the Campi nature was funny and the target audience had a child, this film is non-stop action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and only to be uninterrupted to watch. The fight scene is well educated, and frequently, as the story requires. Both good boys and the evil people are sure that they have a formal supply to bomb, laser, ammunition, and attack each other. The film was made from the episode edited on the TV series, yet this plot actually flourishes and reaches a final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Everyone in this film has a positive attitude and appeal (especially kids'), in many forms, the desire to destroy evil. Kids may be the target audience, but it's fun for everyone to smile at silliness; Yet, at the same time, good guys win and "save the world." The acting is the Chess, but it is the elegance: many lines of dialogue dialogues (potentially a translation error or deliberate delusion by filmmakers), and you will find yourself quoting these strange lines later. <br /> <br /> Confession, this film is not high in production quality or budget. However, for what it is, sci-fi campe, it is enjoyable for some smiles. I suggest it with a sense of humor for things like that.
