Most of the other comments I have read, when I was young, I fell in love with this movie. My sister and I had a copy of Beta (before VHS) movie that we had abandoned. It did not help when selling our parents bitmax during the garage sale. Since then we have been trying to find a copy. I, like another commentator, finally find a rental copy of a local video store. No number of requests, bribe, and tape ownership is trying to cry my way, then do not share it with the owner's copy. Good news I purchased a new brand, new published, Midnight Madness VHS copy two weeks ago at Amazon.com for $ 9.99 !!!! Finally, Disney has wizened up. Now, if they only rewrite the song of the south ... if you like the movie then grab it. If you have not seen the movie, then it is worth a check - totally stupid humor but much fun (Stephen First Hottie).
