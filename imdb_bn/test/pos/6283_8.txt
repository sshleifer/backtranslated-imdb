I was cast as beach explorer surfer dude. Almost thrown around as a muscle guy, the real muscle guy was really really late that day. Pauly was my brother and I (the skateboard in front of tattoo place) takes some live stuff from Venice in the stuff, because he's still doing his MTV thing. This movie is really good as well. Is it my top 100 if i did not have it ........?
