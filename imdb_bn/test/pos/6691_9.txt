Due to the very confusing advertising campaign, I saw this movie at the theater at a young age of 10 years. Trailers on TV have portrayed the film as a comedy, and I put my father in the garden until they took me. After watching the movie, I fly. I had no idea what to think about. I'm completely different from what I have seen before, such as leaving a lot of questions for a young mind. Not saying, I liked it. This morning I saw it for the first time in 2-3 years, and I still think that this is one of the greatest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacy and Jeff Bridges are at the top, a mysterious person who may not be of another planet, and psychologists can develop relationships with him while trying to discover his mystery. Supporting Cast as well as near perfect, every resident of the mental institution is incredibly believable in their own way. The open end was handled very well, which provided a lot of evidence in support of what you ultimately believed. This film has failed to get at least one nomination in Oscars. If you have not seen this movie then continue with Wal-Mart. DVD is usually the dargah bint, it chooses! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
