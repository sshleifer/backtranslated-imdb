My wife and kids are a good and funny series that really shows the most worries and problems in good families. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle (Dad) is always a man who is always doing stuff of teenage like his favor, drink, love or love. When they make some mistakes, then they are right there to fix it (as she likes to make a fine penalty) <br /> <br /> Janet JJ Kyle (Mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband . He realizes that his children want to do adolescence and "wrong" things, just like Michael. Michael Kyle Jr. is a fool who believes in another man. At the beginning of the series, he tried to be like a quiet man and his father, but recently, I do not know why he became a very stupid friend and he started to be a problem-stricken man. After the series he fell in love with Vincea and became a father, or would I say, a foolish father who does nothing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has many problems with his parents because he attacks his privacy very much. She has a boyfriend who thinks Tony as a Catholic and is afraid of everything, so we do not understand that she dates him. I can remember one episode that they are ready to be sex, but Michael Kyle feared Tony that the sex is very dangerous and deadly, so he decides to defend himself until he gets married. <br /> <br /> I'm starting again the best series of my life and I still see it every three years, so in most cases I recommend you all.
