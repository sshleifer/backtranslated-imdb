I saw this movie with hope of good laughter, but when I saw it, I could not stop laughing for weeks, they were so bad actors and it made fun of this movie. (BTW Ryan don did not eat car in the car, he raised his ass); Random appearance from parts of the skater and the parts of Vices was superb. Get some grapes vita! No Valo, at your gourmet shop. I will not recommend anyone under 13, to see if they are half of what jokes or what they are saying. I love VLB and after seeing this movie I could not help but buy it or buy Viva La Left Series. What is the deal with this stupid comment thing? What kind of bull is sh1t it will be 10 lines? I should be able to write briefly in this field or as long as I want. I'm just going to type until it tells me that I can actually send it. It's just a waste of time, I was hoping to say what I wanted, it was not much, but I was told that I had to do more and then it would correct my spelling, so if I do not spell anything is okay, you are still me What do you mean This is ridiculously long. <br /> <br /> ~ Those who live with the sword shoot those who do not shoot
