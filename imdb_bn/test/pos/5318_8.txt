This will be the most powerful message I sent the most recent message to be seen, it was absolutely shameless, amazing original and thought provoking. The stories are unusual and original, and the characters make this story very very powerful. It killed a former girlfriend of a disabled goat's brother, and he is sent to a small jail, through a lot of memory flashbacks you get a firmness in a story and you do not let it go to the end. He changed the living conditions for his family and the family of the deceased family, and when you see and realize that each person's own story and its own dark side, you appreciate this movie even more, but it is a total tourist force, because this action is simple Can not be described. His purpose to kill has been explained incomplete, and it makes the audience think. The acting was too shameless, and Cast was very good, it has many familiar faces. If you like movies that seem worrying and you only feel their time (like 'Donny Darko', 'Mulholland Dr.') then 'United States of America' is a nice movie for you, otherwise you have to pass this movie and See when you are in the mood for a serious thought provocative movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10
