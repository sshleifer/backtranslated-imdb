Roy Anderson could write something that denied almost all the conventions of a movie, at the same time a part of both beautiful, fun and passionate art. The end result is a moving, if broken story about humanity in some simple and most honest form. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely to appeal to everyone, but humor is actually fine-tuned that many people are less likely to get their wavelengths. It takes almost absurdly long, awkward silences and consistent medium shots will most definitely be closed even the most willing of the audience. But in this strange story and unusual thinking, Anderson has attracted a world where every character reaches its central point of their own stupid way. Each scene is absorbed by the solitary environment, the letters apparently left in their own curiosity. It is not seen at a solid piece, at least because it requires patience as it has many scenes. But somebody might be overwhelmed over it's artistic throne, others would simply look at the confusion. This is a film that reduces humor with the heart's own brand
