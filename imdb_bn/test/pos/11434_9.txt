Consumed by parallel damage to globalization, the neutral outlook of Europe is mutually interdependent with China. <br /> <br /> The charming but confusing world scene is from the bottom, without the need of learning or applying any opinion. Reality, though strict. Exempted and exploited children, bees-homes, retreating areas, other China we ignore. Castellitto, a steel plant is a technologist, one of us. An attempt to understand his visit to China, from internal to learning, where progress and third world problems live together in an infamous balance.

Liu knew that his motives were modest and kind, from a very cold charity law. Their friendships are beautifully described, it has stepped in step-by-step to step-by-step step-by-step. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to an unexpected edit and a pretty idle start, "La Stella Che non c'ai" is bright and sharp, because the inaccurate truths are in sequence. <br /> <br /> 63th Venice Film Festival competition, so the sex for the Mastroianni prize, dedicated to the rising stars. He certainly deserves that award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
