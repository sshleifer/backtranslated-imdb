I first saw this movie when I saw my uncle 3 and 1/2 years ago in Arizona. The VHS print is a little pale, but I was very scared to see what I saw. Does it all sense? Well, honestly, or it's not. However, this is a film that requires multiple views to understand all its aspects. The beautiful tragedy scared me and the diverse images created an impression. <br /> <br /> Well, when I found that Anchor Bay had expressed this oddity on Deck, I immediately picked it up. Although I was very satisfied by the transfer I felt extra lack. Although the film expresses concern about "O" and Sir Stephen Character, Pauline Rege's original novel, or the 1974 film The Story of O There is really nothing to do with this. However, the film is an artistic detail and a symbol of almost like a deceiver. In 1920, for the sake of Sir Stephen in the violence in Hong Kong, "O" decided to fall. His goal is to prove his love and love for his master with his body and his joy for his master. Naturally, Sir Stephen was delighted to see him during his unpleasant sexual harassment and even found himself a mistress. However, "and" actually gets a kind love with a young man admirer when the table is turned on. Suddenly, Sir Stephen felt the threat ... <br /> <br /> I think deep money behind the film (with tragic score and artistic direction) really makes this movie classic. The observers are not only familiar with the lives of the companions of prostitutes and prostitutes, but the disaster of Hong Kong was discovered in the 1920's. Like political settings, prostitution is looking for their own needs. None of the film is happy, even if they believe that they are. (However, "and" finds a sense of happiness with his young fan). A prostitute tears how her father works like a dog who is drunk, Naturally, an idol is made for her children to act like a dog. Another big prostitute is obsessed with her past as the actress. He can not let that vision go. He co-starred his clients as well as even sworn that he heard a piano in the river. <br /> <br /> For "O", he has a flashback about his dad in a shining period. When he leaves, he feels a sense of abandonment. Of course, the same Flashback Kinski suddenly became his father. I was very upset by this image, too. I really felt for this photo "O". He rarely laughs and why this scene really explains The fear of being abandoned is such a big thing that he sees Sir Stephen as his father and fulfills his evil demand to prove his love. <br /> <br /> Another strange aspect of the film is that the child (the age of the last) sells fate in the box. It's a very random character, but anyway it just adds harm to movies and emptiness. At one stage, the director even uses the cardboard figures to draw the representation of humans. Now, that's not a symbol for you! (Laughter) <br /> <br /> Everyone, I really love this picture. I think it is very deep and somewhat moving experience. It has erotic scenes, but the scene is not really meant to stimulate. Like Characters Life, Sex Work Is Empty They lack speed, but lack of feeling and softness. (Again, the only tender scene between "O" and the young man). "O" believes that he is loving and reducing himself an honor, although, he has finally found out that his choice is to have. He can also be his own person and follow his happiness, however, the circle of his father is also the option of having him. The administrator has kept many inappropriate questions, but some things are not needed. The viewer will work for them to judge. <br /> <br /> I must say that a special edition of this DVD will be released which was a director commentator. I think it will be fascinating to hear its views after the film and its message years. It's a shame that the soundtrack was not released. This film has a truly haunting and heart-brittle score. There is something about my vocal lingering a cool message up my spine. I can truly feel the loneliness of the film by listening to the songs.
