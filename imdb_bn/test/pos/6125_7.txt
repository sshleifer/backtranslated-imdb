Babes Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with his son's cracker, his daughter Cotton and his mother Edie (ed mesacey). He is competing with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marble (Mr. Mark Chor, David Lachrichi), who was living as the most dirty person. The film shows their efforts to overcome each other. <br /> <br /> This image is not too much for everyone. It prevents the banned attack in a bad taste in your mouth. The crackers have sex with a woman with a live chicken among them when her sister watches; Marbles pick up female hitchhikers, impregnate them, keep them covered in the basement and sell the lesbian couple children; There is a party in the Divine and family, which includes cannibalis etc. It's hateful but, in a way, not unreasonable. So it's so uphill and it's so irrational that it's kind of interesting. Director John Waters said that this bad taste did a good job. It's also fun to watch - the acting is so fatal (especially by Messi) that you just see it in disbelief. A friend laughing at how bad a friend Messi (he developed later in the pictures) smiled. <br /> <br /> This is not easily for angry people. Although still 30, it is still astonishing. But if you have an open mind and extreme behavior may take a lot, but it must be seen. What really was very much part of the Divine is at the very end.
