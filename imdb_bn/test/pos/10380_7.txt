NVA featuring prelude-humorous, military comedy and teen movies. Although it is often German-film-like, although it seems like a great and very interesting movie. You will not just laugh at NV, but in the late 1980's, the insurgency of East German Armed Forces and how young recruits, along with professional soldiers, collapsed in the Berlin Wall and German Democratic Republicans. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy NNA, if you like in Schnelenle (another movie by Lauder Hawosman), but if you enjoy Goodbye Lenin it is not too serious and less obviously funny. <br /> <br /> Acting is acceptable. But keep an eye on former boy band singer Kim Frank, who has two facial expressions: Natural and sudden protection eyes!
