A ham actor without a penny. Who can play this character better than Michael Kain? He is completely and completely ridiculous but, as most of Caine's performances, he goes for it for real. The film seems to be a showcase by Dylan Mornon and she is excellent from her double acting with Kainan. This, though, is where the script falters. Moran's impersonations should include a rather more organic way. They makes a job too high and potential feasibility of plots to fly from the windows on themselves. Do not miss anything. If you get it you can get it. It's enough to make a delightful journey.
