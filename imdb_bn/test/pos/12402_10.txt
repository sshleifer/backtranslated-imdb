I just saw the DVD version of Boron BAD, and it is intense, great and in the end, very graphic for the ambiguity of the heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman became fantastic performers. A low budget film, this picture is distributed. Character depth and clever dialogue are two things that are not usually seen in Roger Cromanne. Check it out for DVD!
