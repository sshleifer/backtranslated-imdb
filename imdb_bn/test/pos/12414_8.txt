This is a perfect movie that falls in love with a cold and snowy night. If you want a few smiles with your horror then this is the movie for you. The makings of a real religious classic There is everything you want to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, a hero, a buffoon, a brain track, and of course a family of mutant devil killers. This one is full of blood, guts and gore. I strongly recommend turning it in the morning and watching the words of Monster Trucks, be careful about what you are entertaining, seeing bad fish (but funny) and watching our hero eyes stew. Evil Dead is not as good but a close second. Just remember the alert ... do not eat before watching this picture ...
