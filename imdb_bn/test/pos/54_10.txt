It was a great movie. Black History not as a reminder of human welfare but for the month and this statement that it actually takes a village for a child to take a child. The performance of S. Ipath was outstanding. Moses def and his singer hook was off. When I saw Rossi Perez had to take double there. But cast actors and actresses cast this price observer. They were all different stories were amazing. And how Nanny Junior was secured and literally her presence was that everyone else. I understand that he is tired of the duration of time and is more tired than he helps everyone. Wait for it to come out of the DVD. It will be a welcome addition to any movie library.
