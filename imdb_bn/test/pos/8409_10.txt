After all, it can not be compared with the original film, but they are not trying for Gosh. One person commented on what happened after the star sketched off the night. I thought it was a horror movie and it would add to my GWTW collection. The scene alone wants me to see the movie. Just watch this movie as an original and do not think they are trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark simply and you will enjoy it. They hold the scurrilous selfishness of Scarlett in many scenes, and you can see from the long life of Rath that he is clearly still in love with Sparlet. There is one thing that many actors can recognize, even though some of them are only seen on TV. After the death of Boni Blue, I always wanted their other children and it completely fulfilled my needs. <br /> <br /> Loor 60
