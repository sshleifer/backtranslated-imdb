This picture is one of the best memories from my childhood. I always like Tigers to take me to see it. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely amazing. This is a movie that keeps a lasting impression on you. The picture of the Tigers running through the snow is still on my head for nearly 25 years, many films have not been operated, like other comments, photography is stunning. A must see. I have been looking for some time for some time. :-( Check Amazon now and then do not publish anything, not listed. If anyone knew any source, please contact me or post here.
