Chick flick? Of course .... have been done before? Many times .... predictable? Yes ..... the observer value? You bet! I was delighted with the illustrations of stock chronicles of Sorndon and Portman's familiar story lines. I am a great fan of the story of the mother / daughter. What is the difference between good and weak ones is the performance and character development. Although it's not the best of its genre, I'll buy it and see it again. The characters I felt were believable and the acting was superior.
