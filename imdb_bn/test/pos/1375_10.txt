I like this movie! Yes, it's rather cheaper and I'm sure that lots of reviews will ruin it. But my goodness is a lot of what they pack for cash involved. I was reminded of Sam Raimi's initial work. Yes it is rough, but there are plenty of good strength and fun. The performance is not good in less than a good part of Scott Iranside and Sean Paul Hussar. This is a civilized movie? Well, it grew on me. For the first time I liked it but for the third time I loved it. The film is probably 7 out of 10, but I'm giving it 8 for my cheeks. 8 Grand Them is worth watching anybody that can pull this off. Almost want me to visit Scotland!
