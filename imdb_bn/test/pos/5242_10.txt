There is really nothing to add to me all the other comments, save it: I find that the film gradually looks like a silent movie adapted. I think the textbook printed the story as well. Aside from the path, the actors were allowed to act like theater, congratulations; Marguerite Churchill looks at the beginning of the film as much as the heroine of the early silent film, but eventually it allows fine expressions. Gass, Sweden? I reminded me of the classic characters of Shakespeare's plays, and Donald started looking at me like a duck in the air. <br /> <br /> It was really surprised that it was everywhere outside in the picture, and even though all the wagons, horses and sheep's dust blurred the scene, it was actually for real residents! It was also clear to me that many of them could be real, and I did not recognize any racist look. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! John Wayne became the true Wayne fan through the Cavari Trio, and thought that Stage Coach was Wayne's first star, this film was an unlikely one. The plot is very simple, and reminds me of a silent film, but actually the chit is really real! In 1930, this technique and an extraordinary movie created under that situation.
