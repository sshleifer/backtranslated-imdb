Speaker Alert - and I really mean it !! If you have not published a great plot element, do not read it otherwise. <br /> <br /> Well, I want to say first that I have relatively high tolerance compared to depression films. I will look and be grateful to the horror of real life (such as War and Holocaust) or where death and sadness are important for the plot, but I hate movies like Style Magologues and Conditions, where the film is built near a harmful death. A major character. So, it does not matter how well this movie has been done well, it has been a major strike against it because one of the main characters dies eventually from a disease (although they do not say in the English subtitles version). <BR /> <br /> So you can ask yourself, "If this cyclone hates such a movie then why did he see it in the first place?" I do not really have a blow hard, although I hope you have a nice point to this! Well, when I found it in our local library, I had no idea !!! The film was not specifically for export, because the subtitles were in Korean, English and Japan and the box was printed in Korea. Well, being a fan to try movies of any country (I've seen movies from at least 30-40 different countries), I tried it. <br /> <br /> Along with compulsory death, I loved the film and so hatred the way it ended. Although I generally hate Hollywood-like miracles, I wanted to save some people through some new drugs or experimental surgeries. I really died that he had to die - especially because he had long looked like the worst person in the film. Her smile was contagious and I really wanted to get her to the girl to the end. Oh well, at least I can appreciate the film's message that you must seize this moment. Great acting, music, etc, but just the most satisfying finish for me This movie was enough to encourage me to try some more Korean movies.
