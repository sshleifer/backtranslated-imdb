I will honestly say this movie 7.5, but I've clicked 10 so that I can try to offset 5 duplicates, unreasonable 1-star reviews. This is a funny story, all very well played (even Mrs. Diaz, who completely completes her usual grinning-bimbo roles here, is still not good at it.) The set is perfect and cinematography is aptly appropriately creepy. This is a great morality game and there is no * reason to explain the source of God / Supernatural / alien / "show up" source, so I'm glad that the film does not try. It is irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long but quite compelling and has finally been summarized quite satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> You make misleading dozens of "hate" reviews to a few dozen 1-stars before deciding whether this movie is terrible (or whatever is under 7.5%), before making a decision about the lack of punctuation and lack of capitalism, and Teen Criticism Maybe the trailer was confusing or something - I did not see it - but these critics might have seen Terminator 4 or 5 (a critics really liked this movie, how inappropriate and unrelated!) <Br /> <br /> Seriously, this Most of the reviews have been read-on-your-tube comments - critics say that the film is very confusing, but not very predictable, still enough Not very efficient, still very much, yet too stupid, still can not be explained much ... Oh - and it's apparently a "waist time". Please consider the review quality and the source before accepting their heart. I'm afraid these 1-children have failed to understand the term "altruism coefficient" and hence they were completely incapable of understanding the film's background (despite it claiming how it was confusing it "it" acquires before it!) If you Know what these two words mean is that there will be no problem understanding (and enjoying) your movie. <br /> <br /> I was really a critically acclaimed arrangement here, so I can ignore the rating of everyone giving it a movie 1 star forever. See it for yourself and enjoy an interesting moral "test" and enjoy interesting presentations as you face the results. It's my opinion, a good time.
