Rather than classifying "The Cell" rather than solid films If you read the plot outline, "A psychotic travel journey inside a comotose serial killer in the hope of saving his latest victim", you might think that it is exciting with the touch of a science fiction. But that's really not justice in this movie. Among the sub-conscious minds there is a fantastic view that is in stunning, visible and incredible mind-tripping situations. As an above psychologist (dramatically played by Lopez before being romantic comedy material) the play communicates with his child and witnesses his horrific growth. And due to the deadly act of serial killer's evil personality, there is definitely a terrific aspect. The film tries to work at different levels and deliberately cross the boundaries. I think it has ended due to a rationally malicious experience, I find it to be absolutely impressive. <br /> <br /> Credits from the beginning, wearing a horse horse often wearing white clothing through the Lopez desert you will know that for a visual treatment. Each time the audience exits the reality and follows its sub-conscious depth of "patients", they are sure to have a banquet of visual and comfortable pleasures. Costs are astonishing creation of angles and colors. The camera releases the door regularly and crosses a world where the top and bottom are the same. Characters became the ruler of their own domain and transformation into such amusing creatures. If you do not enjoy anything else about "The Cell", you must be impressed by the work involved in this scene. <br /> <br /> Welding top notch. Jennifer Lopez is mixing her own interesting looks with her material, colorful surroundings, makeup and costume here, using her natural, sympathetic and almost native language sensibilities. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish her to find another role outside her own world outside the Tom Low World so that she is allowed to do further testing. Vince Von is a firm believer as an FBI agent who will do something to save a young girl. However, Vincent D'Anniefio has the biggest impression here without any doubt. This is a very difficult role to express in many viewers. We are hateful in his activities, yet sympathetic to him because of his experience in his life. He sees great power in his kingdom, but in the real world insecure and weak. It's a great performance from an underhand actor. <br /> <br /> Although "The Cell" does not work as well as tried at every level (some of the characters' characters are not trusted), and when it all is based on roughly flimsy scientific reason, it is sometimes frustrating, apparently surprising Multiple trips that trip to the head.
