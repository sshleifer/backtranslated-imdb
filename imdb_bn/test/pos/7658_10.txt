Lacho Dram is a cinematic survey of Gypsy music from several countries. It's touching, sad and joyful. Most of the sections seem completely unwanted, unrecognized. The music from Spanish gypc's sensual flamenco music to the Central European Gypsy is rare. If you love gypsy music, you'll find the Latcho drum absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br />
