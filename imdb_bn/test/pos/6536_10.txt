Wow, I used to say that I really liked the movie and one thing I can tell to lose is that I really think that you will stay in more movies because you rock. I warm up Harron Carter so much and so thank you very much for doing this movie. I really will be able to make many more movies because he is a great dancer, actor and singer. As well as I could sing as I could do so. And I've never had a fan for him like him and I do not ever have to stop loving him. I hired the movie and I found it for two days and literally saw it 10 times. Laughing aloud, you can call me crazy, but it proves that I like it very much. If you want to talk you can kill me at dvlbab300@aol.com, so if you want, please email me. I love you AARON cartridge !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
