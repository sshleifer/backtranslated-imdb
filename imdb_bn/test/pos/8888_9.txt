Black comedy is not always a simple sale. Each now and then you get a black comedy, which is incredibly successful, such as Fargo, for example. But usually they often do not find the big audience. People seem to set their minds for fun or for serious greatness. Both do not seem to be a big market for a good mix. Wax was severely hit by train from the train, yet few people thought of it a lot in this day and age. Danny DeVito came out of the park in 1987. <br /> <br /> The sons of a strange mama named Devito Owen, who wanted to free himself from his painful and unpleasant clay. . Actor in the movie Anne Rams, who died shortly after getting this release, and she is quite playful. He is loud, ugly, rude, and overbearing. Although Owen rarely thinks he can take care of himself, he desperately wants his mother's friend. He imagined it in some real strange scenes, but apparently he could not do it himself. Where Billy Crystal comes. Playing Larry Denner, a creative writer of Owen, at Community College, near Crystal. Larry is an intellectual novelist who stole a novel by a former wife and blocked it by millions. He is currently trying to write a new, but could not even come up with a decent first sentence. "It was night ...." Oven heard his ex-wife died during a blast in the school cafeteria. And borrowing ideas from strange men on the train, Wayne decides to travel to Hawaii and kill Larry's former wife. Once she has done that, she hopes Larry will return to her and kill her mother. The result is often quite funny, even ruthless. It is certainly silent and often not surprising. <br /> <br /> The acting is extraordinary, even if Ramsey was a bit more at the top. Crystal as soon as possible, and Davito has always been underestimated as an actor. Most of the films are physical comedy which usually works, often depending on pain. Some scenes in the film use some really innovative editing techniques, and off-bits tones are really refreshing. I have often been critical of the artistic malaise during the late 1980's and the creation of lazy film right. The train takes the opportunity to throw Momma. How to draw his character as well as his general plot. How much comedy is killing his mother and surrounding the boy? The film is not too long, and it is sunny full chalk. The author is more attractive than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by anyone. 10 stars bigger 9 <br /> <br /> Hound.
