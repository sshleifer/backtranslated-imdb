Maybe or not Anyone who thinks "Broadcast News," good or bad, that "thought" is almost all credit writer-producer-director James L. Brooks In this case, "business" is the news of television - a photographer (in which he was the longest best), it is not easy to brag a whole business - but to laugh, a surprise, an intelligent nod and every step in a way of sunny way. To do everything truly genius, Mr. J. There are plenty of Brooks <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Of course not! And because of Walter's, oh, Mr. Cranket's day, the only thing that is coming to the public. Likewise John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Goes for Smith. Of course, lip service should pay attention to their feelings, only if they please their boss. But they were really concerned about their news. <br /> <br /> Now everything has changed now. For the last 25-30 years of the network news business, the only thing that has really rated ratings, ratings, ratings Bottom line How much will our news department pay for the network? Do not believe Let's consider "Big Three": Tom Brock, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (ur "Stanley Stanning"). In the last three years, three people are working on their own anchor desks (Peter actually got his first shot in the national anchor table in 1960, but was preparing for the job). Among the three, Dan is one of the best field trainers as a reporter. Personally, I think three dirty works are as news news and their positions are worthy. Which has nothing to do with all three of those who are actually working. These three are now in the 60's (Dan 7-0) and three are still very good looking. And if you think that they are still feeling good, imagine how well they looked in their 40s, when three of them were rented for their current work. But do you really believe that any of these three would have been "inserted"? It seems that Fred Guin ("Herman Munster"). Or better - dismissed for heaven - ME !!! Not only that, if Dan was retiring tomorrow, then a young man (than today) Walter Crankight will not be able to get back his old job. Why? Not enough enough. And it was a white that he did not, or once, "America's most credible people." <br /> <br /> This is "Broadcast News". Tom Grunic (William Hart), the next beautiful-boy-news-anchor-to-the-man who has had problems with some minor issues such as thinking, writing articles and being intelligent. Jean Craig (Holly Hunter), news student standards and morally brilliant news producers, all of whom are thrown into the air when they also fall for beautiful children. And Haroon Altonman (Albert Brooks, there is no relation with James L.), the leading newswireer and field reporter who is not optimistic for national jobs because he "flop-sauces" behind the anchor desk. And many other harmful characters you really know exist in the news section of different networks. <br /> <br /> "Network" tragedy is too many. After 11 years, "Broadcast News" carries the torch as an eligible heir. In the new millennium, the network is "the news you used" ... or maybe not.
