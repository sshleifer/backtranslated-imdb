This is actually a very good spiritual mystery film, despite trying to try to sell it as a sci-fi movie. As a woman inspired by a mysterious aspect of the Balkan star and she lost the memory that she is trying to piece together. He spent most of his films trying to understand his outlook. Very atmospheric and effective. It is true that Kiskki does not appear too much in this movie, but the actor is very good at the actor. In the United States only one English dubbed version is available and some of the dubbing may be preferred but the actors do very well. Academy Award winning foundation also makes storaro cinematography interesting. The director of the Bajrangi's past, the Fifth Cord is also excellent, and it is also responsible for the store.
