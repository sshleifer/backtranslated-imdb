Batman Begins is an extraordinary debut film for the director, following a movie about the Human House, which he wrote in the stories, followed by other people to inspire character. He followed a man, he decided to go further and turned more than people to be bitter for him. <br /> <br /> Non-actor and his uncle using a cast, writing production indicators, and otherwise making the film entirely is not with a budget roughly and independently produced, this film is much more than what you expect. <br /> <br /> Anyone likes Memento and complicated twists, turns around, shocks, and frames over time, this is definitely a movie for you.
