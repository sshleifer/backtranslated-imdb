This was Chaplin's first discussed picture, and results were mixed. This movie is a satirical satirical of Hitler and Mussolini, their pregnant and their fanatic life, especially about the persecution of the Jews. It was bold and forward for the 1940s and fooled many people. <br /> <br /> It is relatively pale compared to past chaplin's work. His silent sweet, funny style, in my opinion, is the most famous of his best since his first book. There are lots of nonsensical bits that pull. If it was a silent, it probably did not happen. <br /> <br /> I found one of the funniest moments of musical wasting moments and the most fun moments to be in the world dance. One of the most sensitive moments, perhaps, the end of the speech <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's flawed, but Chaplin's wonderful form.
