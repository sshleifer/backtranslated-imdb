This is a different documentary. There are so many layers and it shows us so much that it is almost impossible to try to analyze it at once. Documentary William Greaves shows the process of filmmaking from our different perspectives. We tried to hang on to the actors, directors, sound crew, and others and make this movie a success. If it is made in a movie it will be common. How the greaves will make it more complicated by the crew movie actors, and then the other crew will portray the film, only the other crew will be in the whole story. Three cameras, each with a different goal. It affects you to a nearly dizzying but exciting at the same time. I organize the crew where the crew is together and discuss what's going on. Even the poor people are trying to do what they are trying to do. See half as a test and the other half sees it as an unwanted and confusing failure. Whatever party you choose, you can not argue you Greaves not involved in this process.
