Great film, a very worthy 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And hope it's lifted. Well, it's temporarily moved away though. See, we (arms, training, and others) arms, training and money to more than 80 people who are fighting the same people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo is always going to get on the political thinking. Those who see it, but it is portrayed in a very beautiful story. However, once the main objective is achieved, that means freeing the communists from Afghanistan, it is seen how quickly the misery of the people has been forgotten. <br /> <br /> This image was good, it's a good 7/10. It describes the story of Afghanistan's communist aggression and the next secret mission in the United States and it is dramatically highlighted. Despite being a good film, I would recommend it to the people, but some people will not enjoy it, especially if it is a serious film about the (US) vs bad (Rashiah) movie!
