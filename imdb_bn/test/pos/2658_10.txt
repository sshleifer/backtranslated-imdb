I am surprised to say, "Jrathastar Spratch Spratch", 2001's famous title track, parallel between anyone (I have never read), film and ethos famous work, "Sprint Zardustrato". The idea of ​​a rebirth of humans in a star child; Forming a child in a continuously more advanced, n's "Zarathustra" is a clear part; There is a prominent passage called "How a lion becomes a lion and a lion becomes child", in which N describes the first incarnation of nobility as a child, which manifests both the monk, worldly direction (camel; always asked to bear weight Done) and barbarous, stupid, human empowerment (lion). The incident may be rare due to the sequence of the star child playing songs. Also, Zarathustrians said that "a rope tied between animals and domination." The framework of the film fits into that description: A brief history like humans, until we become a real person through surgical and achievement, then a long sequence of people (then, as it was), and then a brief summary overman It is unknown how these transitions happened, and the advice given by the external forces is also Nietzsche; In "Zarathustra", he made it clear that there is no way that people will be able to effect these changes and suggest that we have to rely on the external (Zarathustra) how do we "go down" Nearby Bowman's psychedelic sequence can be seen as a picture of "the mysterious" of the 1960s style effort of Kubrick. <br /> <br /> I know these parallels are quite broad and almost certainly have been mentioned elsewhere. Despite the fact that I personally have not seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for some reason the paganity was not considered to be a bad philosopher, then Nitish would have been. Some people condemned at the end of 2001 and in my opinion, clearly and unknowingly, Nietzschean. The case can certainly be confirmed that all of 2001's "Zarathastra" has been updated for the modern era on all the dramatic changes. Nietzsche feel free to disregard everything perfect tune my snobbishness.
