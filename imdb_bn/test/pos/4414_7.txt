In many ways, this film defines the essence of what I love about the movie, to keep those strange moments of irrational truth. In other ways, it is foolishly an amateur, candid result junkies self-deliberately fooling around with a camera. Finally it comes in pure talent and unwatchability somewhere (somewhere much ex-respondents). My part wants to fully reward its full innovation and the moment of pure fertility, but at the same time I can not completely ignore the utter terrible "acting" and excessive bad production values. Initially, the edit appears to be exaggerated and inaccurately misleading (or maybe just wrongly "innovative"), but after some time I used it, which, ultimately, whether a film is successful on its own terms is not a true sign or not. I guess that basically sums up feelings for me around the film. In other words, it does work very well, even though it is unknown errors. And, if there is no other thing, a film like this actually shows how false and compiled error-documentaries, Shaky-cam styling can sometimes be used effectively (eg, in films like the praised Roger Dosajr). Filming here arises from the requirements of the situation, and it is not deliberately used to look "cool".
