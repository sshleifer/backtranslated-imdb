An excellent musical instrument played by Jean Kelly and Rita Heaven. He is a drama owner where he dances. He is not yet a star, but when he was nominated for a cover girl for vanity, he got a big break, whose owner actually loved his grandmother. He sees the similarity, he is directly his choice for a competition running in his Magnagine. Heworth's new adage is surprising, but his star became so fast and tall that his appreciation on him began to be the first for the club's club. It's not the core of the plots, but two spots really work it out. It helps that the screenplay is great. Kelly is not yet her peak, especially her peak as her actor. Her dance, however, wow. Heyworth star, but Kelly claims to be the most memorable moment of the film while passionately dancing with her own reflection. It's probably taking a take off of the shadow dance of Fred Astaire at the swing time, but I think it's one up in Kelly, which is very less credible. In fact, this may be the most amazing dance sequence in the history of the film, perhaps many years later a Parisian American could save the end result. The rest of the songs are excellent, and musical numbers are even better. Very bad Rita could not sing her own (well, she could have some of them, because her voice sounds sometimes different). Her dance is wonderful, as her acting left. It's hard to love something in it. She is really one of the few really beautiful women in the classic era. There are not many plastic like them; No, you can really see that woman's warmth. His smile is so unarmed. Phil has played the role of Kyle's best friend, and he is very funny. Three characters of Kelly-Hewarth-Silver are apparently turned into singles in the rain for three years in the Colonel-Reynolds-O'Connor. Almost one of the biggest musical numbers in the film is "Good morning", almost entirely child. I think good movies like Singin 'Rain, such as cover girls are a bit rough around the edge. This roughness, though, is just adding charm. The defeat of Singh by rain and even an American in Paris has the direction of this picture. For example, central relations involve more emotional. Instead of following the dominant backdrop of a young girl (Leslie Carne and Debbie Reynolds was only thirteen years old), we have very good relationships with two people, who seem to be equal. There is no pursuit around - unfortunately, unfortunately, there is an aspect that makes a lot of good musicals a little harmful, you have to admit. Kelly and Heyworth start from the couple, and when it starts to stand, I really felt it. 9/10
