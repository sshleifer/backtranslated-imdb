This image is very good for the word. His incredibly great and fun and true is true. You have just seen that the person who wrote this must have been jeeped and how his friends felt through this movie. It was at one stage of my life and before I thought of going to sleep, I would come back home to see human traffic. I think you just get to love with letters and their style of life. Of course, this film will not be for people aged 16 to 22 years old. There is no objectionable objection to this movie and it will sustain you in all ways. It does not have a specific story line. The general idea is to get a weekend of adult life in London and how they get up. The places they go, the ones they meet, the drugs they take and their experience. Do not you want to get this movie on DVD, only remember this, you have it !!!
