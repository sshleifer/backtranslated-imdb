I do not understand why it is so undefeated at IMDB. This movie is only perfection. Tarzan's imagination is always good adaptation! As French, I can say that it is a good role of Christopher Lambert, ridiculous in many movies, but here's a wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is great, well said, the story is magnificent, direction, atmosphere, music, everything is perfect! How to believe in this sequence with Elgar Music, just perfect .. <br /> <br /> Greystoke is really an incredible movie, here underrated, I really do not know why, but really appreciated
