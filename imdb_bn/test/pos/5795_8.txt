In the context of Soviet imperialism, family values ​​and a loss of human dignified representation, Vassili Peechul's 1988 film Little Vera is a landmark film of modern Russian film. Peele's brutal drama marks the strong exit from the images of sanitized idealism in the Soviet era (such as the circus of Alexandre), which publicly publishes its time on social spotlight. Contemporary Ukrainian settings make the effect intensify, first by the time the film's instantaneousness, secondly, it does not struggle for identity instead of a Soviet system, but rather uses it as a separate nation from Russian statues. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Her array will reject Andrei, she will start a destructive (and primarily sexual relations) relationship with a college student named Shepheri. Despite lazy Sergei's dislike of her parents, and Sergey is insulting for her parents, she moved to their rotten apartment. Tired of excitement until Verha's father became drunk Sergey Stab. Whether his father is acting in self-defense, he must decide whether to remain loyal to his helpless family by witnessing his father, or continuing to support and defend Sergey forever. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> In almost all the imaginable ways, the helpless, little sparrow has fallen ill with a void in social life after being defective and communicates. Social reality (a significant difference from the socialist reality that Stalin has demanded immediately) was the sex aggression of the film (it was the first movie to show explicit sex), which faced the old conditions of Soviet life. The most interesting, however, was the public reception. Many have written hatred to director and star, though the film was very popular. Here's a double trend of "Film like Social Criticism": The film will make the audience uncomfortable if done properly. Because no easy solution presents itself, but some viewers will hate movies and movie makers to "bring" them. Many movies think a bit more about this: Popular movies like Larry Clark's Kid's, Harmony Korine's Gamo, John Hughes's Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those visitors, whose domestic conflicts and social mood stimulus are more difficult than the two-hour probability. The film is absolutely beautiful, and incredibly challenging. Despite the difficulties of watching movies, some of these moments are deeply beautiful. Of course, the social-historical and cultural significance of the film can not be ignored, and in fact this film acts as a more powerful reason to watch.
