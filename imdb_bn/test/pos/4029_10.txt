Always enjoyed "DOA", 1950, which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very interested in the film. Dennis Quaid (Dexter Colonel), a professor who loved his wife, and finally found that he had a relationship with one of his students. Dexter was involved with Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller), who was in college college and at the same time had a big crash on him and was wounded due to standing one night and in some ways he loved him deeply. Dexter learned that he had a drink which was bad content and that he would have a big deal of health problems! If you love Dennis Quaid and love Meg Ryan, you will enjoy watching this movie, Meg gave an amazing performance and keeping the value of watching this image!
