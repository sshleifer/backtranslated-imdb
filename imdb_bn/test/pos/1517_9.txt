This film brings you two characters, interrogators and captives with only two characters, but most movies take you to a character, but they are well-formed. <br /> <br /> The pain of uninterrupted confusion, terrorism, and Madeleine Stew is pain, which is as painful as Alan Rickman's tragic but charming interrogator. <br /> <br /> This movie is very possible, and by creating a sudden climax, completely impacting the movie, you finally put silence. It'll hunt you for a long time.
