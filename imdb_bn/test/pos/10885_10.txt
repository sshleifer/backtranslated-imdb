I played it for the first time in 1998, one of my favorite video games in Goldeneye. Actually, I recently bought a N64 so that I could own it and play it often! The game is pretty much perfect: the single player mode works superbly to immerse yourself in bond shoes, with different types of goals, strong arms and a great level design. Although artificial intelligence of enemies is quite fundamental by today's standards, it only adds to the appeal of GoldenEye. It was inventive to get cheating (meeting stiff time limits) while publishing the title, and even I still have some of them leaked! <br /> <br /> The game is a multiplayer mode for the wonderful four players, and when it is not developed as a Combat Simulator in "Perfect Dark" in the game sequel, it is still incredibly pleased to push your opponents to the RC-P90 fire brake! ;-)
