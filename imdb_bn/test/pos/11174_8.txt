The great games of Lucasarts have drawn another beauty out of a seemingly perfect bag. If there is any further evidence needed to govern this section of gaming, it is this. Before playing the game, after the first two games, the authors were worried about how to maintain the speed of the gigabytes. Fearing that it was going to wear a little thin. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how fast you can fear. From the early video of the Doodem Boat (!) With Gadbrush, at the end of the fanfire, Jokes is coming. I was a great fan of the first two games and other Lookaserts (The Tentacle, Sam and Max etc) and it failed to provide quality. You do not have to be frustrated. (Well, I was not.)
