I remember seeing this event as a young boy in Australia in the 60's and enjoyed the DVD as a 50 year old dad of young children. Although bad guys are mostly shallow letters and violent elements, my 6- and 8-year-old kids are very happy to see it because the central characters are enlightened through deep, kind and respectful Japanese culture, violence is not glorious, there is no glory in it, and The program is nice to see. It does not disseminate nightmares, but it shows mostly the culture that primarily influences the design of the stereotypical Knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The DVD quality is going to be desired. Video perfectionists will not like this one. It is some of the reminiscent of the 16mm film, and some basements are presented on the front of the wall ... which can be good. The soundtrack is a lack of expected quality from home theaters. However, my children just saw that they were not in color, and I suspect that they just noticed that we were talking lately because often older things are like that. Mount Fuji's beauty B & W is even more clear. Creates some atmospheric parts of the 17th century setting, such as if you meet the past in a few window windows. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This program is better than most things in the air, 8/10 My score took his age to account.
