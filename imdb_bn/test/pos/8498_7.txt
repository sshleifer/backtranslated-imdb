If someone submits me to 'Ray' for about 15 minutes and asked what I thought of Jamie Fox in the title role, it could be an empty spacetime. After all, is this (fabulous) person talking about? That big screen was not up to Jamie Foxx. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances in recent years. Like the soundtrack, the jammy flat-out brilliantly as Ray. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> The movie is not good, its not good about its annoying life.

For those who do not actually sing foxes, for those who (to reduce their performance), take an increase. No mere actor can sing like Mr. Charles anyway. You can not have everything In this picture how talented star is almost as "everything" which we will probably look for a little while.
