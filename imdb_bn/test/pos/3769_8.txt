An extraordinary non-bred comedy that portrays Comedian Mark Blankfield as an abusive doctor committed to Jakeel in his studies. Once he has taken his experimental formula, he has become visible in the hedge, there is no problem for everyone around him. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by this. It has a really insane, madcap approach; It is an indirectly stupid but wholly steam ahead with ridiculous jokes after the other. Funny lines and sight gags are in abundance; Blankfield plays every role for it's price. A highlight has been bursting in the lyrics; "There is nothing to hide from Hyde" is quite striking and even I can still hear it on my head. The last episode, like the hijacking of old B & D films, goes so far. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is also quite encouraging, with Mother Armstrong as the mother tongue, Cristina Ericson as Sparky Ivy, and similarly Thomson is a horribly co-worker, Dr. Noon Lennon. I could have done more with Thomson's character, because I'm a fan of a guy, but I'm glad to see him. <br /> <br /> Previously known familiar face polled. Cameras: Casandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brock, Lease Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensine, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Flour, Lin Shai, and George Chakris, in a camio like himself. <br /> <br /> It is not saying that if you like high school, intelligent comedy, you can avoid it well. But those who enjoy a zany, politically wrong, gleefully runchy good times, this could just make the strategy. <br /> <br /> The best bits are reserved for one end. <br /> 8/10
