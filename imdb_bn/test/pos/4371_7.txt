George Curlin is probably my favorite comedian. I saw many of his specials and even got a chance to see him alive. He always appealed to me that he had a certain cynicism. His last two specials (specially of life and the loss of accusations and allegations) lack a specific spirit and material. George Overweight, appeared old and tired (not to mention rehabilitation came out) "I have not said to consider it"! Anyway. Reducing the value of life was particularly tragic, because he was coming out of excess weightless, dissatisfied, rehabilitation (we go back there ...) and very irrational. If there is a way to express sorrow without stopping him for a curiosity, George Life has achieved this with West Herring. Like New Millennium and Post 9/11 America is ruining George's soul. BSS became very big for managing. <br /> <br /> partially successful to come back! This special transmutation is completed. George is not trying to revive his glorious days. He has fully recognized the ages and is working on risky risks of death. She has been accepted having a crusty old SOB and is relishing it. It's better than its predecessors, far away from New York's Jammin. It's a little sad His observation is not over and the other seems like Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George and George are not. He is not criticizing us yet, but how does the high fortress indicate how and how the discriminatory modern life was. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the previous two specialties, but George still does not recover his old glory (if ever). He has mostly been reduced to personal peeves serious social and political stinging commentary. When he goes to political, he still has to say something. This is achieved in large amounts (especially if you have seen its previous work) but it still works in any way, opposes its random rentals which lack a specific relevance outside the baby's generation. The last 25 minutes is the best one for this special offer. <br /> <br /> Now I will worship the sun and pray Joe Pesky that George can make himself a cut edge. It's a 50/50 chance. Life George and his "art" became more tedious for his life now. This is a step in the correct direction from its previous 2 special aspects, but away from its old self. Where does it go from? He may not be restored but perhaps he can change / refine the routine of old people in this new semester. You are expecting 7 more words that you can not say on TV or at least a ventilation.
