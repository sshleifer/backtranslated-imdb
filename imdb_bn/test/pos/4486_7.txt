I have guessed that I saw this episode, I saw Tavialight enough before it came out of time. This is a strange collection of characters that find themselves under the cylinders. They are fine until a warm soldier shows them among them. This is its main direction to escape and so it provides strength and work to reach the cylinder. There is a lot of discussion about the motives and speculation about their speculation, but no one can remember anything. They represent different jobs: a man in a piper, a ballet, a garment, a pierced hat. Why are they there? It leads to an adventure and is finally resolved, but I had a beautiful idea before it happened.
