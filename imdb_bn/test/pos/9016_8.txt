It will be seen that some previous critics may have set these expectations more than they would go to this movie. I scanned satellite channels for some (not to know what to do) it and found it happened on. I remember the title of the great soft-quality porn flickers that were regularly displayed on the movie channel, but I was happy. Although there were some nudity in front of men (actually, more than your standard soft-core title - the picture goes!), It was not the focus of the film. It was just fun. <br /> <br /> Do not be deceived by my taste: My recent screenings have been included before Knight Fouls and Europa, Europe (both jits, IMHO). But while watching a movie I enjoy total mental shutdown. Virtual sexuality did this for me and it's not a bad thing!
