The brain's Lucio Fulci's cat is a director and a somewhat undisclosed story of modesty in madness. Q & A director Phooli Mane, who is the star of the film. Phalachi has become known as 'Godfather of Gore', known to the horror fans everywhere, and for good reason, since he has given us the greatest and greatest film of all time by the grace of the screen; Films like 'Zombi 2' have died due to the violence of the eyeballs in the 'Binde' chain, to the full path of the Gore Fest known as 'The New York Ripper'; If you want to be grave (and let's face it, who does not), your husband is your husband. However, all of these Gourhound food supplies and I have taken his toll in Phulchi's mental state, and he has entered into a crazy fast, which he casts through the film. Fluchi's problems do not end with his mental condition, as his psychologist, he has gone to see his problem, using flowers from the movie as the blueprint of the murder, has taken himself to kill himself as a hobby! <br /> <br /> I said, this movie's acting is absolutely mischievous. There is a scene in which a hooker is involved and it is only suitable for frustration, it's acting on both sides and it's stupidity. Fulci Film (essentially) took the lead role. He is not an actor and it shows, but his performance is actually the best in the film. This is the only one that's safe, bad for the Italian horror film. Of course, Italian is not afraid of someone hoping to play well, so it is a bit remorseful, but I think that Phukchi could have given some good rent. Bad dubbing is not just help. However, something that helps, is that the terrible act is consistent with a lot of poor, and it's ultimately extreme! People are killed in a shower, a woman is killed in the shower (and unlike SICO, here we really see it), people have to hack, feed the pigs and have lots and the movie's best meli weapons - chainsaw on display, no end to me delighted. The amount of the cow is mostly kept for most of the time, which gives the movie a 'explosion' feeling, but the cat in brain must have a tongue in the cheek film. <br /> <br /> It will not be difficult to create a movie about yourself and will not come across as a big title, and in this movie, Phulchi is getting some big head. Her name is often mentioned, and she is almost on screen all the time; Haughty is not unlike 'new nightmare', but it is obvious that it was a good time to create it, and I made fun of watching one of them, so we can forgive him by making him mad. The end of the movie puts it down - I've seen it coming a mile away, but then it did not seem important that the movie would take that route, but I was wrong; It did, unfortunately, not. Last left me cold, and the film is a good watch if you close it before the final two minutes. However, despite the last and terrible acting of it, the cat in the brain makes so much fun and there is no end to Florian enthusiasts and so it is recommended.
