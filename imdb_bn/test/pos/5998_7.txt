At first I do not like to change the director from the past (the journey of the galway) to the current (the devils of the devils). But this is the best way to write the story, though it is used somewhat. Dansen's title character and Edward Fox makes outstanding outstanding villains. The worst part is Mary Stenbergen Glover's wife. He has sometimes been pretty gorgeous and in this movie they look uninterrupted dowdy for some reasons. If I do not add anything to the story, then I will never understand why a manager makes a woman ugly! Plus puts you to tell him what you want to strangle him for believing the false guy being the treacherous stupid. Even his son can see through the blurry. Still a good show and I rate it B +
