I love a lot about this movie: music, cinematography, acting, stories, and all Mormon clichés. Just because they clichés mean they are not true! It's not perfect, it's a movie after all. Although there were contacts in the well-lit rooms with nice large tables and chairs, it was perfectly suitable for portraying it as dark, cold scenes in this movie. I liked the scenes I was waiting for at the bus stop smoking smoking cigarettes. I thought that was cool I mean, I believe that the angels keep an eye on us. What should be done while waiting? Smoking is a way some people pass time to wait. I loved distressed love because such a deal about smoking. I watched this movie seven times in Salt Lake theater, and cried every time! It blows me away. And I saw it three times in the video now and it's still crying to me. I will jump again to see it on a big screen again. I hope the Salt Lake Tower will return regularly at the Theater General Conference, as a civilian film (for punitive purposes, but not for any offense).
