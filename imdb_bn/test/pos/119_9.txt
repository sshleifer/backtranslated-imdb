Finally I saw the third image of Mehtaar's trilogy: "Fire". To begin with, I used to say that there was inappropriate skill on all levels of "water". Fire comes next to the side of the fire Fire: This film is so much running that I need to see a few more to drink it all. The text is fantastic, scripts created by scripts that begin the entire process of "heat" starting from the beginning when it is actually a leakage in the fire, move into a complete breakdown of the conflict relationship. <br /> <br /> Mehta is a brave lady: She has seen with a clear eye that jaundice, false and repressive about a great society that comes from her. India is rapidly changing this day, but most of it is economic change. After clearing the script, he met with such serious opposition to "Water" that he still has many prohibited subjects that Indians can not face less, examine or discuss. Worse, if someone is afraid to take a mirror of these problems, like someone like Mehta has to face death threats. So, as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, the event is not always the case. Although "Earth" was a historic establishment of civil war only after the Indian independence, fire and water are indicating personal, social and religious matters, which I say is so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialogue is still many years away. I write that this "water" actually appears in India later this year. I'll believe it when I see it. <br /> <br /> I face the same sexual and emotional solidarity as the fire by seeing "the price on fire". It is at risk of marriage arrangements (which may be like Jews in some 150 years ago, or it is like many modern Indians), both men and women, in a bad match; Or, just plain loveless marriage ..... However, this is not the real problem. Mehta is clearly lacking with strict religious attitudes, which puts the widows' grievances (water) or otherwise holds women unhappy marriage (fire). I am not a secular or Hindu law expert regarding divorce. The picture implies that hatred (separation) is just as bad as a sad marriage. In any case Mehtaar's film is a very popular, strong effort of sexual conversation, which has modern Indian relations for verification. These three films have felt as an unexpected attack on their own cultures, such as the sound of a suppressive mood for me. Why Mehta is not pressurizing to strengthen these issues? I admired his work and could not highly recommend his film. Fantastic, annoying, provocative, shattering banned.
