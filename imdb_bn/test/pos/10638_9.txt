If you think the "Pioneer" piano teacher of "Pianeste" piano teacher Isabel Quatut (Isabella Hupert), "El Pioneer", the final degree of panic, distortion and dark features, I got the news for you: Elaine Zellainak's novel piano teacher "LA Pianost" (Depending on which movie was) "hesitant", "boring", "insulted" and even more interesting as double - who have reached the isabele huperta artistic skill level sufficient to translate the word could not be here today on the activity of all other living actress. And could it be played in this role, who could give an actor playing the whole piano with such mental strength? <br /> <br /> There are two major rivalry such as the novel "Heroica" Kohat: his own mother (the wonderful, the ruins, Annie Giridot, originally a part of Jane's Moore) and Austria itself. Mother Zelink, as a country that perceives her native Austria, is seductive and discriminatory for racial / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, encourages sexual and psychological abuse, and it is impossible to keep today without the danger of today, a psychological breakdown impossible impossible. <br /> <br /> "La Pionoste" also works with very powerful and subtle problems: Expressing your intimate fantasy to you (you think) how dangerous it is. We think that our own sexual fantasies should be exciting to them as others, which can be a huge, embarrassing, and sometimes tragic mistake. Here, what does the curriculum teach in Kohat, the most painful and insulting way? <br /> <br /> It must be noted that Elfrede Geneliker is one of the best-known and acclaimed authors of Austria and Europe (well, he has now received the Nobel Prize!) and the autobiographical paragraphs can be estimated in his novel, because he himself One was a pianist and had a difficult relationship with his mother. In the novel, there is a long passage about Kohat's childhood and adolescence so that you understand who he is now. Henke chose to hide this picture, forced us to wonder how he had reached it (we do not know Irica Kohat there?). But he has saved much of his film book fabric: unbearable honesty, where the most secret, "horrible" feelings are raised enthusiastically - jealousy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, suffering, misery, Mokshaism, selfishness, distortion etc. All of them are unknowingly man. <br /> <br /> I thought "La Pianeste" is a deep-moving film, very annoying and worried, with some unforgettable scenery, and I just want movies. It makes me buy and thrilled by the book, discovering an amazing author who I could not read before, and heard again at Schuurbert - so thanks to Hanake, Jellainak and Isabelle! On the other hand, if you are looking for light entertainment, then stay away. My vote: 10 out of 9
