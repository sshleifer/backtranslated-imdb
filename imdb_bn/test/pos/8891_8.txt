Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (Kate Malagrew) has stolen her books, she has a new emerging romance with Beth (Kim Grist), who knows how she can start her book No , And his screen writing class is unfamiliar with most of his students. However, one student (Danny Davito) is extra curious. He lives with his evil wax (Anne Ramsey) and he can not get the courage to kill him. She goes to Larry for help, her life goes from normal crazy, extra crazy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dialogue, the characters, the whole script is near perfect! And Danny Davito has proved to me that he is more than a great actor: he is a great director! Her latest movie, Matilda is one of my favorite family films and is now one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> This is a black trick, mostly about the genre of humor, but it is very interesting! All actors are doing their full potential, whether they are the main characters (Billy Crystal) or just one bit lowercase character (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like the comedy (who not?) you like this! 8/10 stars
