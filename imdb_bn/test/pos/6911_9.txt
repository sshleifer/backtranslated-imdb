Before this TV movie I did not know much about one of my favorite actors. After seeing this, I realized how bad the life of Lucile Ball was. It was a very great moment, but I did not understand how sad it was. This movie was very good and the story of the beloved Lucieil was very good. I highly reccommend it.
