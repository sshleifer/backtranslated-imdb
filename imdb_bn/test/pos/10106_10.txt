This review is long delayed, since I sometimes consider a story of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever. For any other aspect of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, direction or film making, I will keep this film against any film. Is it all perfect in them ?? Wrong "a real masterpiece of a sea of ​​seas." <br /> <br /> This film is easily made in the history of the movie. I can think of another movie where every minute is somewhat important. In most cases, G-Woon Kim has created a movie that taunts visitors to disassociate it in most detail levels. Could a seemingly trivial thing be shown ?? A rock cloth dress, two diaries, a drop of blood produced from a floor crack, a bottle of rose etc.? But to be more active on the impressive inspection ?? A formula that helps in the feeling of a particular scene (or perhaps total film), which appeals to the viewer's intelligence to sit in front until he contributes to the continuous reflection on psychological concepts hiding in the background. Such incidents can happen several times during a movie, but such incidents happen in such a fast, uninterrupted fashion that the audience must be careful to watch the film so that they miss something important. In other words, the content layer of this movie is easily enough to fill a dozen other movies. How can someone of their right mind ask more than a movie than this? This is mostly the easiest, the highest form of the film. [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Provides a final set of intrinsic questions Not because of the disorder that it uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence. He explained a dozen possible explanations to G-woon Kim and kept it like this. In fact, the truth can be nothing. A story of two children provides irrational motivation events that help viewers identify the exact facts of each scene in the movie. If our good friend was concentrating on Jaffad, then he noticed? For example ?? A series of clear flashbacks that provide enough real information for the film's feeling. These flashbacks totally oppose the full submission of the jaffad. The purpose of a story of two sisters is to wish them to see anybody who wants to see them that only seeking a material deficiency can only ask the viewer's patience, who does not want to even appear even slightest effort. See them. Kim Ki-Kim can be blamed for the obscurity of real spectators who do not want to understand his film? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Please remember that I will not insult the intellectuals' intellectuals like Jafad, which can not get a story of two sisters, because it does not really have anything to do with the lack of intelligence. Many as a lack of persistence. The film makes itself so effective that the only possible explanation of confusion is the lack of effort in the audience. Yes, this image requires a significant amount of puzzle-solving rather, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. You only need to put them together. Remember, anyone who has written the picture in Plattele already remembered ?? He easily separates the pieces and put them in full skill to provide a great cerebral exercise ?? When done Provides the final form of satisfaction and fear. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me. Have a movie that starts with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is lazy by design. Perfect example of Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Danny Darko (2001) Two sisters have no story. It is disgusting that Jaffod Darco has demanded to build more efficiently than the story of two other sisters, especially the Darko does not only provide almost any intangible information, but it is an outdated end that can end in the end. No movie ever made to give the final intelligence to the final. I am ashamed to mention two movies in the same sentence, but contrast is an important issue. Although it worries me that Jafad will quote a film that takes a little bit of intellectual effort to criticize such a movie when it becomes visible only through an important application of intellectual effort. He apparently liked his "intelligent" film in the highest sponsor form. It has 17 series of questions in its context when it is evident that it has released the film quite strongly. Read an operamer threads for discussion of only two children of IMDB. The answer is so ruthlessly unacceptable because anyone could read those threads carefully and still stop the intelligent film watching as well as this film may be claimed to be a lack of a purpose solution. <br /> <br /> I would like to say more, but I came to the limit of 1000 words. It is said here that all needs to be told. So say now!
