Fantastic heroes, 24-year-old Dan Harris's extraordinary work is tagged with "people never mind". Perhaps this is wisely selected as a stratagem of marketing; Still, I rented this movie instead of renting it despite the tag-line. And, I'm glad I did. I did not find an insight test in this tragedy. I personally found it to be a movie about dealt with with dreams: especially those who lost. In the case of a son, the need for "damages" was his deep examination, and not in his life. Nevertheless, the central tragedy of the film, while presenting the questions provoked by its will, primarily acts as a retreat, which are set up in various competing style reliefs. I believe the film searches on an important question: how can we deal with our dreams, especially where the hero is imagined?
