What will be Prospero in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why would a man choose to live on an island with his daughter and daughter friend? Because it is difficult for the "civilization" situation to be in good standing and to love. This man (John Cassivis) is a broken heart giant, he can command the storm. He got power, strengh but he man. Deep love of life is the subject of this extraordinary film. Incredible acting, all the geniuses of John Castavets, Gena Rovlandas, Basmai gasman and Shakespeare and Paul Mazarsky certainly Do not miss it. It will be wrong. This picture is the most beautiful one I have ever seen. And I've seen many movies.
