Set against a 1939 implosion in France, a horror, fast-paced comic / drama / farce France. Activated with a straightforward, straight-faced intensity by a talented wrestling and chockablock "Tractions," a festive soundtrack and short but Charles de Gaulle and Marshall Petain, in a fountain of action, satire, social commentary and authentic time, from the slippery brillantined hairdos and marcelled hairdos. Trustworthy impersonation. <br /> <br /> This is just some of the most entertaining ideas currently shown on the undisclosed screen "Messages." If there was movie train (and there is a steam powered train that is a steam locomotive --an expensive prank, there is no doubt that a trip is a creative entertainment) this will be a TGV.
