I have seen this movie countless times, and its similarity never fails to be overwhelmed by simplicity, sincerity and goodness. All customizations, and beautiful little steam trains which play such an important supporting role. I admit that I fell in love with Robert in the 1970s and he still touches me. On New Year's Day on New Zealand TV shows, I had the most beautiful presence.
