Like many children born in the 1980s, I grew up in films of Mel Brooks, which were certainly not like 'Researchers' like Blessing Saddles and World of History 1. (I certainly saw it, though not often), but the "whole family", spacetime and meant for this movie. I still knew that I did not see great art, just a campie, stupid, though it always takes place in the sunny Robin Hood and / or adventure movies. But in the quote it means calling a family movie a) Adults can really enjoy it like kids, not because of a little trick and stupid obscenity, and b) Once a child shows it, then reconsider it, I have a few times, it still But with some things as fresh as it is not understood for the first time. It is a comedy that only refers to the films of Robin Hood and other films, not Jokes (with travel) and Brooks's own films; <br /> <br /> Basic story: Robin Hood (Curry Elvis best of hers) is a filmmaker who returns home from home on a crusade. The danger of King Richard was gone and he was looted to recover his land and, naturally, the rich to give food to the poor. On the way, he met Au (Dave Chapel) with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and Sheriff, the chief guest, and of course still pissed for the maiden's love. It is, of course, normal clothes for Brooks, which allows joke to enter the scene, and sometimes a joke does not work or it gets stuck during the repetition, so it is not difficult to reduce most of it. This is one of the best things in Brookfilm, such as the Godfather Beat (Dome Deluge at its best), Brooks' own Camio Rabbi, Lewis and Chappell, and a continuous line of quotation and a tongue-in-cheek song. It's obvious to some, yes, it takes some right from the page just blazing Saddles, but, is it a good time for the right crowd? Certainly- And for the growing upwardness of 70's for parents, it is a great way to introduce young people to their work (even the proposed sexual jokes and not rated them, they all make fun of everyone).
