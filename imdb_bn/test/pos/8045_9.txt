This film really proves that the world is often an unfair place, especially the world of motion pictures. No attention was given to the release of "Assignment" and surprisingly the flopped to the box office, but when the history is written, the film will get quite a bit of lost appreciation. <br /> <br /> <br /> Thank you. I am surrounded by friends who know best for me. Being a movie buff like himself, a Pal highly recommends "The Assignment", a movie I even heard about. I decided to test Leonard Molin, and surprisingly he did not give ** 1/2. He knows this same grade that he gave classics as "Allian", "The Sexual Suspants" and "Matrix" (I'm not your child), I knew what his meaning meant was. So I went without hesitation and bought it DVD It was about 3 years ago and the film is still one of my pride in my DVD collection, despite a cover design that creates a low budget flick with Cover Van Deean. Directed by "Assignment" skillfully, giving some really intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat across the film, on top of it is a great story that you will know with unexpected twists and turns. It makes Eden Queen the best in his best performance and helps Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley get the best support. <br /> <br /> 40 out of 42 users commented on this opinion, most of them could not appreciate much. So what are you waiting for? If you call yourself a fan of action-thrillers, then you should buy it, rented it, watched it today!
