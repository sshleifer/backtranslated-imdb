I thought this was a beautiful film. This is not my favorite movie - Chongqing Express holds that spot - this is different from anything I do. It is slowly (but not annoying) - it takes time and ponders the characters. The frame has a minimal speed - the camera is excellent. Acting is great. The film seems like a long warm cozy drink.
