This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with a stop and smile but it's right for you. This movie was great because it took serious Robin Hood and created something that would make the whole family enjoy and make it laugh at it. I saw this movie about 10 years old and got it mostly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "<br /> <br />" Do not lie with her liar. <br /> <br /> This movie is valuable
