I watched the movie 13 years ago when Arieli Beach Kul was in Australia. I have found it in a small shop shelf that is not bothered to browse most. <br /> <br /> I found it for my pleasure and saw it for a day's purpose and its owner to collect it in my collection. I still do not have it but one day. <br /> <br /> I liked the idea with poetry and imagination. The semi-street street scenes with a busy Timing city in the remote background added visual effects. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this title from a lot of people in this movie, who enjoy this title, without praise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One from LA, CA can help you when you're viewing this movie. Comments can be negative, but if you see abusive money, I think they are positive.
