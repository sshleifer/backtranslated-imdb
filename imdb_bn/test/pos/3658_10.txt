A word ... magic. And so incredibly real. Bijoya Raja is so incredibly raw, incredibly weak, that you just want to make her characters successful, whatever they do. And he is the son of Om Om in his strange, shy manner with the first kiss from the perfect creator - his perfect perfect "Bollywood eShuttle". He is a truly gifted actor and I will not hesitate to see him because he gave it life to everyone and gave it a spirit. Camille Dot is absolutely fantastic. It took some time for me to be warm - perhaps she played the role of an unconscious but fascinating tourist. Her conversion really became her and she molded her role very well. Benoit's boyfriend, even if you love to hate the person, was not surprised if you did not really like him for the way he played, Jean-Marie Lama has published a perfect cad. Scripts- so real. I repeatedly asked myself to look at my friend all over the world, "What happened in India is right! They do it!" Very real, very raw. Very bittersweet but you certainly leave the feeling of the theater full. Nitin Sohani's music goes totally with the surprising and continuously changing mood. But Vijay Royaj ... I look forward to returning to him - because he has created this movie. He's the hero, the most appealing, unarmed rickshaw driver you'll ever encounter - he's a magician. A lovely, real, sweet, incredibly talented actor I can not wait to play and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere!
