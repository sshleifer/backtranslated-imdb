This short has all the elements in a great movie. Every time I look at friends (in DVR) they love it too. So the dialog, 'real'. Acting fantastic Although the effects / props were not convincecing by themselves, taken with all the other in the shot, they were placed in skill / placement. The song is so harmful, right now this moment is suitable for film. Those who love their beliefs and thoughts, they fall into the main part of what they see in this movie. Most go 'is that?', But eventually they blossom with a new understanding, and leave it with a word in the movie to describe it: <br /> <br /> 'Beautiful' The beauty of the film is also deep in the skin. I agree with any other contradiction, any other voice, and the voice you hear is agreeable to each other. There is no conflict, but at the same time. And last I love it more! Strict reality is sometimes more qualified than any plot device, or twist. <br /> <br /> (Blair Witch project was not Joshua Leonard?) :) A fabulous dead man's movie ... Well!
