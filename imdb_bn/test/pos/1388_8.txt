On-screen caption tells us that it is 'Caribbean Sea, May 1891'. In a small lifeboat ocean, ships from broken jails are in six convicted seas and ship's doctors. Drift with Cloud De Ross (Claudio Casilli) perfectly. It takes a strange, unnamed and uncharted island boat towards the night, a weird current. Some rock hits the boat and is cut off. A prisoner is killed, which seems to be a thin mutant fish-man animal. The next morning, the cloud woke up to wash herself on a beach. He found a pool of water in white bubbles and one of the dead prisoners beside him. The cloud warns that another survivor, Jose (Franco Iveron) will not drink water. They both meet up with other survivors, Peter (Roberto Passe), Francois (Francesco Mazzarie) and concession (Zeusap Castellano). Franky tried to make a lethal effort for himself, he found a big bird and killed it. But instead he was killed by one of the fish men. Clouds, José, Peter and looking for an abandoned island because they had suffered some deadly attacks on François's death. After being dropped, he was crushed with a spike under the hay. Now just Cloud, José and Peter left. They stumble with many empty cemeteries and signs of recent black magic occasions throughout a cemetery. Claude is a snake spot on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the head of the snake bursts. An unexpected woman called Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) appeared as Claude's deliverer. He asked to leave immediately this island owned by Edmund Rakham (Richard Johnson) and he does not like viewers. The clouds, José and Peter have decided to carry on, irrespective of where Rackham's big house has been found, where they are invited to stay. That night Peter Amand goes after him and tries to rape her in a wetland, Peter quickly becomes a food for fishermen. And a voodoo priest named Shakira (Belal Cunningham), who lives with Rakham, runs a black magic ceremony with the throat slit in the graveyard. The next day, Claude and Jose decided that they would leave the island because they felt very uncomfortable about Rakkham and she considered them to be a liar. Jose rides off the horse and is lost. The cloud has been saved from one of the non-fish fish and has been asked to leave. Claude again wants to deal with Rockham. Rackham revealed that his scientist and Amanda's father, Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotton), must be kept alive. Rackham says that long time Ernest will survive his own survival prospects will increase dramatically. Rackham called Claude his plan. Rockham has lost 2000 feet feet in Atlantis city. He is using fish and men as a way to reach Atlantis's lost treasures, and Amanda and his father need to control them. He claims that the descendents of the original inhabitants of the fish-men Atlantis If Rackham divides his wealth into the cloud, he will help him keep Ernest alive. Afterwards, the cloud is considered by Ernest Marvin as a scientist who condemned the organ organs to replace organ organs. Discovering the secret laboratory of Ernest, he discovered that Rackham had lied with him and the fishes were not descendants, in fact, genetically modified people became anxious animals through the extraordinary test of Ernest! Rackham finally had enough amount of cloud and decided to stop him from stopping him in a huge tank, and gradually filled with water, the eruption of the Island Island began and the lava flown everywhere. Want to leave Rackham Island with its treasures and amanda, will Cland runs away from almost sure life to save Amanda and close the island before the volcanic eruption separates it? Directed by Sergio Martino, I really liked this movie which mixes different styles. The script by Sergio Donati is fast paced, attractive and entertaining. The bits are expressed by the plot bit, which kept me interested in seeing all the way through. I would like to say at this point that I have seen the original version and Roger's order is not associated with the scenes paired with America's release. Barbara Bach makes a very attractive leading lady, but I hated the way she presented it through shooting snake heads, I thought it was a little unexpected. Richard Johnson made a great villain and Claudio Cassini as the favorite hero. The camera is too tall on them but looking their cold and when I've seen bad, fish men themselves look a little mesh. The tiny effect is very small, but the overall again I have seen many bad again. There is no real roar, violence or nudity, but it did not bother me. Giancarlo Ferendando's Photography and Massimo Antonio Zellen's production design combined to create a very nice looking movie. Ernest's Lab, like Rackham's house-to-house dress, props and sets, and its old scientific instruments. Lovely green jungle settings also add visual splendor to the display. I really liked this picture and I was entertained across it running time. I'm not sure that with anyone I recommend it as a mix of different styles, I guess someone can feel something that is a bit different and is generally well-made. If you can find a copy to go to it, I'm glad I did.
