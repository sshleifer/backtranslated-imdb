As a Spencer Tracy, here is a true Sudsiese Soap opera, playing the role of an illiterate person at the age of 20. He is married to a woman who teaches him and his ambition and his drive makes him successful. <br /> <br /> The success but not happiness here. A good boy and a faltering marriage occurred in disaster and tragedy. Trasy purchased a railway and was able to be the victim of only one disaster train strike and 406 deaths. <br /> <br /> The movie started incomplete but thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here. <br /> <br /> <br /> Two different suicides here. We know that wealth can not buy happiness, but it is a little too far away. However, Tracy and Colin Moore have our writing performance. Mrs. Winson is also quite effective as the second wife.
