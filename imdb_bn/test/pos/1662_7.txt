You can take a joint out crook, but Crook's collective feels more difficult to take out. We saw this type of character (and afterwards) in such a situation: many times in reference to films like Bob Le Flamboyr, Elvator to the Gloucus, Touchjac Pou Grois, The Anderson Tape etc. What is more significant is that this helps (of course) the heist itself, which plays out in the real time silently, and lead's demeanor. Bogart will think twice before crossing this guy. Irony Finish This story is perfectly suitable (it claims to be around). Around, good films are silent one.
