I achieved this goal perfectly in this film. I saw the showtimes late in the night as a teenager, and again in the college. I thought it was fun. And there are boobs everywhere! In the late 1970s and in the mid-80s, there were loads of such films, such as "Porkis" from Soft-Core "Non Zoo Perar Girl" R Retined Movies; It seems to have fallen by the conductor in terms of popularity. HOTS was great as it was like the previous two films. Like a girl-power version of "Angel House" in Hats, Campus Bedlam is in-house with intuitive and engaging girls. Alongside, the "Hooters" girls' clothing designer must surely see this movie.
