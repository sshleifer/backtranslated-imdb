I saw this movie when I was too young but it captivated me. I love Ore and George's love a lot. I was so silent in Ore and Madeline's love story. I'm a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I like it when I meet him for the first time. I just wish there was more time with her and her baby. So you know in three books that I got so much trouble that she died. I did not really understand that they got a little time together. I just liked this movie Patrick. I bought three books together and I could not stop watching them. My 12 year old boy is stuck He loves war in war. I cry every time. I could meet Patrick and Madeleine personally! It was a wonderful movie and welding!
