I've been away from Istanbul for the last 10 years. At that time I was constantly in London. When I saw the movie, I realized how much I'm Istanbul. I'm not just from Turkey, I'm part of Turkey. The words of Istanbul, the word of Istanbul, is my part. People in Istanbul <br /> <br /> Perhaps believed Akin believed that he had made great musical instruments but I must say more than this. It is about to mix different types of music, culture, methods, politics and groups in a delicious pot ... <br /> <br /> We all know Turkey especially Istanbul, always in the East and goes or the western city. A bi-cultural city in Istanbul as one of the band members. But more is a eastern city because we always try to be a western city. It shows that we were never one. <br /> <br /> This movie will be captured from the very first second. Music is excellent, people are impressive. In particular, Ayanur and Sajjan Axu Singers, band members! A small movie in wood green is all nice to see you all.
