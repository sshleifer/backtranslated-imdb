OSS 117 was fun to start from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to define why a movie does not contact or connect with you, and I will not try to do a perfect comedy analysis, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be devoted to it :) <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> Hobart physically applies, but stupid like hell. From 007 to all, she looks like Shan Connie, but she must be more sympathetic because she ... stupid, always speaks her mind, giggles, and even conceives some homeopathic rumors and rumors about her. In short, as the anti-hero, he is the stone :)! Sometimes he simply raises his eyebrows or frowns, and all that takes you to smile. <br /> <br /> The real queen of the film, Baroness Bazo. Merciful, treacherous but with the norm. On the opposite side, Aure Atika, the type is reduced to a femme fatale. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I agree with Amazon's De Hartley (Seattle, WHA) that it is respectful to the genre. <br /> <br /> Which is your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is "Chicken War" with a masked arch. But when the real perfect person is chatting with him in cocktails, how they all mock at confidence ... this scene just makes the comedy genre suitable.
