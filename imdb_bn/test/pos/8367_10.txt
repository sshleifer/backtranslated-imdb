I could not imagine I would love to love this kind of movie. After seeing Yimu Zhang's 'Hero', I decided to test his other films, probably looking for something like that. I saw the second Yimu Zhang film 'No One Les', after which I realized that I am now a movie. No wonder why I got 'Keep Keep' immediately. It's a simple, sensitive and bright piece of cinema, I respect my director. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that it does not make a film well. It's all about what the director showed and how successful he was doing this. The story is very common, a common extract of a typical daily life, it is very easy to show, impresses the movement of the camera and strengthens the feelings of the film. I gave the top rating in this movie and was looking forward to seeing the movie of another Yimou Zhang more.
