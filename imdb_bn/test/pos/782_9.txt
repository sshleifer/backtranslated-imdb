I've only heard driving lessons through ITV advertising, and to be honest, I do not know if I could not like it. I switched to TV last night and I was completely surprised. Driving lessons are a simple, simple movie that attracts you right from the beginning. Rupert Grint plays brilliantly socially awkward teenage role in Ben. He is definitely the one to find out in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by Fancy Julie Walter. I like the simple plot and the way in which actors portray their characters with great sensitivity. Highlights of the film, for me EV was rather colorful poems. It shows how it can form friendships among the most promising pairs. My opinion is a great way to spend 2 hours watching the lessons of driving. The scenery was also interesting, especially in the countryside. Anyone can call this amazing comedy forgotten, I firmly disagree with it
