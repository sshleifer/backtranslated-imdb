Zachary Scott does his best work, for example, "Dangerous Signs", a 1945 B movie starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DiCamp. Scott plays a writer who killed women after writing. In his last murder, he rented a room in the house owned by the Fentcher's family, Hilda (Emerson) and his mother (Mary Sars). Scott embarrassed himself at Emerson, and he was dazzled. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anna (Freeman) returned home from medical treatment. When he mentioned that he loved Uncle Wade and he had kept his $ 25,000 (big money in accordance with the 1945 standard), Scott lost interest in Helinda and created a game for Anne. Rebecca of Ani Sunnybuk Firm thinks as long as she starts traveling around with a skate - overnight, she becomes very nervous at the age of 10 and her sister. Eventually his tenant got a good message, Hilda considered him psychologist and advised him. <br /> <br /> During all the psychological dramas during World War II and later the psychological drama, and Scott did a wonderful job as a smooth sociopath. This was his fight - he did not show any real presence as a weak-willed Sheriff in "Flamingo Road". Twice, we saw him in "Milledr Pearce", where he proved himself very well. Emerson is an old stenographer with pushing her chest face and her big glasses, but after a few hours, she gives beautiful, and a strong performance. DeCamp was always an underhand actress - here, she plays a soft German accent and is delightful. <br /> <br /> This is a very routine story though a very entertaining film. Acting really elevates it.
