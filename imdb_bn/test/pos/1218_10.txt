My friends and I saw it at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was a lot better. Stormy is a powerful black woman and nan reminds me of my grandmother. <br /> <br /> Rain is OK !!! The price of admission was worth to see him closing his clothes. Can anyone forward me to his contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks Flex is better than two. Although he has been a Flex fan for years he may be a little favorable. The cats were funny and just described them as nuns. LOL. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing this movie again after coming to the theater.
