Following the boldness of the Great Party film, Bill and Tom, on the opposite side of the spectrum of two high school friends. Bill (Eric Stodge) likes to live life, when his friend Tom (Chris Pen) always does not take anything seriously than the party. When Bill goes out of his mother's house, many of his problems arise from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his homeowner. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moved away to open the door, but he was able to make Bill's life upside down. This movie is a non-stop comedy and my private personal favorite from the beginning. The soundtrack features Guitar Puetio Edward Van Halen features throughout the movie, and also features Robbers Lee Wing and Ron Wood's adolescence. 70th episode of pornography legendary cat Naveedad also a look! The classic 80s movie has multiple beauty prices. Everything is going to be the expected DVD release now! If you enjoy this movie, look at "The Last American Virgin" which is like "Wild Life" I highly rate both.
