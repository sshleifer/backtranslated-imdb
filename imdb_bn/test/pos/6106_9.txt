Margaret Colin stars as the main figure of this story; As I saw, I reminded her bit part in Adrian Lins's "Unfithful", a Tony Neighborhood in New York as a neighbor of Diane Lane. <br /> <br /> This movie was surprisingly good, and Dyan Stilman's credentials for the right picture were class, crime, and misdemeanors, which actually happen in upscale neighborhoods (thought ruining !!!). It's not real but dramatic; The audience lived through her accidents, pain happened to it; Denial; And final resolution. <br /> <br /> Colin speaks to her husband "What is a good man?" It's a lot more than a question. .... The character of a person is defined by the single law; And because of their actions should they condemn forever ?? Questions are relevant; Martha Stewart, meaning many movie-related references, is also fun. (Ie patient, boring mother); Colin has called some of his friends "perfect jeans with perfect jeans" .... (gag); And a scene that Colin is confronted by the police; ("Friend" betrays him later). <br /> <br /> American society has been denounced and face-to-face; (Oh, the murder does not happen here; author Dominic Dunne, about the true murder of "Mars Maxley", like "Greenwich, Connecticut" theme); Colin is aware of his crime; But consciously shows himself face to face, eventually he does not break; Rent or buy this movie; She is a role actress who works quite well in this role.
