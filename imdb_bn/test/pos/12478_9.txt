What is the profit, when a French French inspector named Maurice Martineau calls for solving the killings? Well, just a very entertaining, fun film. Despite the romance, jealousy and marriage, 'who did this?' The re-black-white picture "Qui des Arsys" products that seem to reach the truth. <br /> <br /> <br /> The technique by technique, tactics and techniques by inches by inch, etches in truth of this master inspector's patience - but of course, with the help of a bag full of dirty police interrogation tricks. <br /> <br /> <br /> Martinou is the center of this photo. Henry-Georges Clujote's use of the film to make the drama more firm in the grand film Nir's style is a wonderful model in the bold film Nir's style. <br /> <br /> Martini finally resolves the mystery and arrests the perpetrator. Hey, he's good !! But lazy, Martino, you can keep a dark secret in its past. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
