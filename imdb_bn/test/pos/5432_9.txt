This movie reminds me of the great movies which temporarily impress me that the emperor is actually naked. Our election process is dressed and neutral My awareness is increasing and I want to see the world change. A little later I was lulled back to my little tranquility and "bubble life". This work will turn into an edible stew for me in the film's best feeling, and like "network" I want to be guilty, 'I'm as good as I am, and I'm not going to accept such a thing!' But to whom? My strong young idealism was gradually reduced to strong convictions or rather related parents with "faith". "Man of the Year" reveals how honest and sometimes ridiculous I am with our current political situation. "I was inhaled because I thought, 'What a mess, it's burning, it's in my hands, I'll breathe it.'" It was refreshing or when Clinton was the President. Why politicians can not be honest and set the voice for debate? Should we understand the fact that people are being veneered as real? I am already sick of this election process, anyone else? Closing the curtains, setting an agenda for our elected officials and working with citizens' pretense and non-representation, they will have to do (not re-elect) them. This movie can inspire our politicians to raise expectations, which are weird. Great movie!
