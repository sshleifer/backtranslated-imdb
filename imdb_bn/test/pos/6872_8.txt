House Colossus A humorous comedy about a devastating doctor (Walter Matthew), who is now 1978, who does not want to help in the field, but can help him (Glenda Jackson), who is dragged to a patient who refuses to have another groove in his bedpost. Matthu loves women, but she does not really want to commit to the promise, so she agrees for two weeks specifically for a week and then she decides whether to make a decision; However, other complications are difficult for Mattho's decision within two weeks, even though she obviously loves women. Mathau and Jackson are surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and Richard Bjamin, Candice Azzara, Dick O'Neill, and especially Art Carne are given strong support as Staff of Staff Chief of Chief of Staff and Appropriate Chief Mentor. Martha is also a short scene with her real life son Charlie, who is also the son of Jackson. This cute comedy still holds up quite well after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth the rental.
