During this writing (January 25, 2006), I got sad when I heard a passing moment of Chris Pen. In addition to football, The Wild Life is the most memorable of Chris. <br /> <br /> I still feel with Chris Wrestling's character and a little love with colleagues, sitting in their favorite restaurant. In front of them, huge plates of french fries were sinking in full bottles of ketchup. <br /> <br /> However, my comments are for the song title track by Sprani Ram. Even after many years, I still think rumor (Canadian spell-lol) is that Banarama was asked to write the movie track at the very last moment and recorded the song that he wrote in the recorded studio song in the studio and after recording the song, they used to track their title track. Low cost video shoots I have heard that this whole process (from the beginning to the end) took 4 hours! If this is true, they are worthy of being the most successful female band. <br /> <br /> However, on this day I only heard a rumor and still remember a generation. Perhaps this anyone can read and explain. Thank you.
