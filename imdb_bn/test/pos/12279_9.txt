At the end of the sixties, director Sergio made four spaghetti westerns in the Quebec row - Classics the messenger, The Great Silence, The Specialists and Companions. All of these three, especially except for Spaghetti Western ratings, are constantly turning up the top ten list. Until recently, what I saw was some English, some Italian, very poor quality compilation with a vague picture and it was almost impossible. Now, I've seen a beautiful Widescreen version with subtitles (but still in two languages), I can safely include the four classics group specifically. Jonny is very nice as a holiday charismatic hood, a notorious hand with a gun coming back to Blackstone for the investigation of his brother's death, which was looted by the citymen to lose their savings. It is associated with a strong beauty, the owner of the bank, the Mexican bandit leader L. D. Dlou, who once had friends with Hood, a decent Sheriff who had dreamed of a better day and a small band of Hippies - well, it was in the late 60's, And Hippies were even apparently even in our west. It's not a desert west, a shot somewhere in the Alps, and look beautiful. I have little nudity than expected in the west, but that's not a bad thing. Sibbe Fen, Sheba, who can be a hood's nephew or a friend of a dead brother, is as beautiful ... which has never been made clear. This film is worth watching, and again, we apply for a beautiful DVD with all the impressions - I think special experts must be known as one of the other westerners of Karmachian and it's really high praise.
