This is one of the games where you do not like to bite it or hate to hate it. You can also dislike this game even as a hardcore Mario fan. Because it can hate you it's 2 small and somewhat annoying and easy. Or you love because it is amazing graphics (a nintendo fan is not huge excitement) music or game play mix. I know that it's so amazing, and others who think it's the worst Mario. It's actually a type of nintendo fan depending on the type. I personally love this game and I think it is the best wei game, but it should be set for yourself. So I think you can get it perfectly if you have the perfect Nintendo fan. But if you love the classics too much, you might not like it. So try yourself.
