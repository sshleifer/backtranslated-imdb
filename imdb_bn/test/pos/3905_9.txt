I saw Elizabeth Montgomery's movie when I was 5 years old (if it were) and this day I can remember this movie (just bits and pieces). I remember this movie all the time because I was very scared. I think this is the story I think and the house is constantly dark. Elizabeth was most painful to me, the main part was walking around the dark room and then someone else was out in the field. At that time, I thought I was an old magician but my memory is frustrating now, so I can not really remember who it was, but it was definitely one of the hiding areas ... and that part misled me most. I really wish I could see this movie again. If anyone knows to get a copy please email me at valid 908 @ yahoo.com
