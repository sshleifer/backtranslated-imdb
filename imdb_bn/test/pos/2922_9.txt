This is often growing, when a Hollywood movie influences a young man. It not only lasts a lifetime, but is inspired to study ancient cultures as a career. This type of incident happened in the title "Egyptian" with the 1954 film. The audience was terrified of the set, the dress and the great acting of this movie, so many movies soon followed terribly. This is the story of a young Egyptian young man, who was soon after the birth of his parents. It is not difficult to wonder why such a suspicious start will arise, questioning why it will overcome life. Son Sinha (Sin-Oh-Way), which means, 'He is alone' (Edmund Prodom) is increasing towards manhood and asking why he graduated from the School of Life and became a physician. In her constructive years, she earned an undisputed friend named Capta, a living friend (Peter Ustinov), and Horemehib (Victor Mature), who was raised as captain of the Guard from a government official. His life expects the rapidly growing criminals of social status, outstasts, surprising healing and finally hoping for a station of life that he never expected. Michael Willing, Bella Darby, as a fine performer Maine as Gene Simmons, Achanhan, is a memorable burial tragedy, as Neopar, Nefar and John Carradine. Tommy Ratatig plays Egyptian son Thath. In his final years, 'he alone,' he finally discovered the answer to find all the life of his life, which he kept with his son, now in his lifetime, in the care of friendship. Nice movie! ****
