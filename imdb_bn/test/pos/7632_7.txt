Surprisingly, a good filmmaker was introduced to a young man by spirit, which was created in a self-proclaimed church, to live a life like a crucified man and restore life. Christ was both Christ and two thieves, although Christ was sold many times before. If the picture is removed from the cross, the problem begins and it comes to life and inspires the woman. From that point the girls became a war for souls. Awesome, scary, and far better than the movie, because its cast sells perfect adult events. It helps that these real people are faulty, so it is easy to relate to them. I really liked this movie, and for the first time in less than a decade I've been surprised to see how good I am. Since its extraordinary title title is certainly better than any.
