I'm afraid that Mr. I would like to disagree with Radcliffe, although he is right to not be a joke, but he has many qualifications. The plot is a bit crazy, but I believe it all fits nicely together, creates a contented, enjoyable movie. The last scene was rather uncomfortable in comparison to the rest of the film, but the actual ending of the plot was very interesting before some scenes, which showed what would anyone do under pressure situations. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to thrillers and action movie fans, but if you are a fan of gangster movies, you can enjoy it as long as you do not expect anything deep like Goodfellas.
