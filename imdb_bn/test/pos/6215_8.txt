The Great Space Costa Spirit, but a few years ago. <br /> <br /> One of the hottest cyclical kids I've grown up in. Seymour was a big, obscure, green doll, with an emotional smile of huge tooth split around his teeth, I think wearing him a variety of Elton John-type shades. <br /> <br /> He is looking for a "piano" and a dude in a Jesus Tux, sitting beside him. They will discuss a moral and then do a song about it. <br /> <br /> Do not miss anything other than Open Theme, Simu and Hippies <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remember it all. I grew up in jerseys, so if it's produced in Detroit like the previous post, it's not just local. Semu reminded me of many Sherlock the Skierl from the Magazine Garden (shows if other cyclical kids are there.) People always talk about the effects of the LSD of music and the music of the 70's, but it seems that the authors of the child have a dose.
