I've seen this movie as a real review and gave an advance account from the German perspective. Graphic Action and Unique Characters This film allows me to be interested in whole film. StalinGrade was a very fierce battle and the scenes gave the film that kept the reality of this war. I recommend this for anyone interested in military history. This film was my second scene in a few years and it was again influenced by reality. While reading the surgery, uniform and subtitles, it gives much credit for a good military movie to listen to German. Actually, there was a German view of this war, I was engaged to the Germans, even though they were war criminals and the ultimate loss of war.
