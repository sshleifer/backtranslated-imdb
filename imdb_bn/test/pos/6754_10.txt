I still can not believe that this film was brought back in 1934. The animation is just perfect and it's amazing about it, some animation studios that we have with today's advanced technology that make such a little gem. One. It's all about: a great story, beautiful compound (though it's a silent kind of beauty in some areas), special effects ... well, it's definitely not a kids movie, but it must definitely look for someone interested in it. Animation.
