As I said earlier this year, in my review of the voicefish (The author / director / producer of these films was written by Skip Woods) it is a good film. It's a very high place on the Flickr list of my crime in Lock Stock and two Smoking Barrels, Fiction and Snatch. Basically I think this movie was for me a lot of Reservoir Dogs - a classical classic - though I like to compare with Paul Fiction. I think I did not like Terrento's first attempt, but I'm sure that the hell likes it as a pop fiction, because it's just a classic requirement. A great story and good actor. It's okay for budgets such as Godzilla, Mission Mission of Avengers may not be as big, but it is certain that the surviving hell out of those movies (and others) <br /> <br /> This picture is KC (Thomas Jane), a man who settled in Houston with his wife. Unexpectedly an old friend disrupts his life, reveals his secret information, and basically makes his day a living hell (and bloody one). <br /> <br /> This image is very original and quite bloody / sexually explicit. So based on the first and the last quality, I can assure you that if you like this film you will also like swarfish, of course there is a big budget and more famous faces than this, but it's just as good. As bloody and not quite tinted as sex). I saw this photo twice last night and I really enjoyed it (again). I think all the characters and actors are good, although I must have Thomas Jane and Pauline Porrijkova, who was the best actor and have a great deal of credit for the best character in the film. Also I'd like to thank Woods for being fantastic and for the original being. Cruel, sexual, objectionable ??? Maybe, but sure heck is enjoyable and a thrill ride. <br /> <br /> 10 out 8
