Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Junior where this picture is completely shot It is a heart-warming story that believes we can only make a difference if we are careful. I think there was a lot of realistic with the letters. The screenwriters did not add racism to movies in such a way that most of the movies that I thought made more realistic story lines. <br /> <br /> Authors may raise racism incidents in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard. <br /> <br /> There are many such cities where people from different nations live alone. Ed Harris should be nominated for the Academy Award because he was great as a father and coach, he was realistic as a father and showed warm direction during radio help.
