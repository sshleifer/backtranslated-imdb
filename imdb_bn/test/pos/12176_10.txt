I was watching the TV Guide for movies from Germany and I was known as a Bognard, so I saw it and I laughed with myself stupid! I wanted a DVD but it was not found here (I could order from Germany but it did not have subtitles) It was played again, so I pressed it and saw it from time to time. However, I looked for information on it and found its real name Arkan and Stefan, but I know it by Australian title: Bunnyguards. <br /> <br /> Some people I know from Germany do not like Arkan and Stefan because of their pronunciation, but German is not myself, I have not noticed anything. Jokes are good, but some Germans can stop their accents. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is fun and if the DVD has all the subtitles in additional (only 2x version with the subtitles feature will be bad) I'll buy it in a snap! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who is happy for a sunny and beautiful story.
