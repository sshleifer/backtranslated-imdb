"Fame" is a very good example of students living in New York City's High School of the Arts. The film now focuses on a group of students who dream of growing up while perfecting their crafts in the famous school. Director Alan Parker allows every highlighted student to mature on the screen, so that you can feel a connection with each other. Here the music is infectious and fun. Dance is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis for an Emmy winner television series, played by Debbie Allen's actor and other actors from the film. One of the more enjoyable "dance" films of the 1980s. Received the Oscar for music. 8/10
