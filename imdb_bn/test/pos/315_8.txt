'The Apocalypse Now Redux', the battlefield of Francis Ford Coppola, is perhaps the most beautiful battle film I have ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Shane) is a Vietnam soldier who operates a very dangerous and highly classified mission in Cambodia, which 'disappearance' of Columbia's Cartridge Cartage (Marlon Brando) visually completely insane and defective from the army, has established its own little society And Saha is a cult following by the soldiers Yya said. In Cambodia, a number of people from the Navy who are called on the banks of the river and several interesting people (most often, Robert Duval's Kilogo, a few of the screws, a Badus Lieutenant Colonel) and face some horrific situations. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalypse' is less historic war film than a philosophical and psychological research. It is more than 'platoon', 'flower metal jacket' 'Apocalypto' is more than three hours running, but the movie is so nice and interesting that after the film ended, I was amazed at how much time I had spent. Beautiful cinematography is definitely the most for me, however. After watching this picture, I am convinced that one of the masters of lighting and photography in the history of Coppola The 'Godfather' films were tipped with almost all sepia tones and shadows created the feeling of Barkak composition. The natural light has incredible uses with 'Apocalypto' and in particular the shades of Brando and Shane have become almost living characters, they are so extensive and effective. Another fantastic scene was when the CPP Willard and J. Hicks (Frederick Forest) came in search of grapes and tigers in the jungle. The thickness of the surrounding leafy tree (large leaves as the house) created almost lilipiputian characters, but the color of the scene was incredible. Everything else was almost silent gray, the pages were incredibly vibrant green, it was an impression which was particularly interesting. When Duval and company carrying helicopters attacked Wagner when they attacked small villages, there was another really small positive moment in the film. It can be apparently an ultra-dramatic underground soundtrack, but when Coppola turns the song into the real part of this scene, Duval mentions that he likes to play it when he 'fears hell from them'. '. <br /> <br /> The first category of performances at 'Apocalypto'. Brandon's amount of money for the film and the amount of problems he has created has been made in large amounts. Regardless, he turned out to be a strong performance for a relatively small screen time. Shane is absolutely outstanding - this is the first time I saw him publicly in a film ?? And watch as Duvall looney Kilgore is a lot of fun. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that is so abundant in pop culture (most of the films know the desired line, 'I love the smell of the napam in the morning') but I knew enough about it that there was plenty of experience left left. I did not see the original cut of 'Apocalypto Now', so I can not compare it to this new cut, but it's a film that must of course be enjoyed. 8/10 <br /> <br /> - Beautifully
