Sexy murderess Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) is still a former boyfriend, crazy killer Charles 'Chucky' Li Ra wishes for a life of married life. The rebel Good Guy holds his hand in the hands of the doll, which has finally played host of his soul and has taken place to do the repair work, he runs a satirical program that gives life to the toy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately poor Tiff, reanimated dog shows no interest in marriage marriage, and so he trapped him in a cage, with a bride doll for the company. Eventually, rather rather angry (by Brad Dourife voices) escaped from his limitations, Tiffani planted his bath in the bath and punished his soul as his 'bride'. <br /> <br /> They both now have similar accidents, plastic pairs put their differences aside and decided to bow down to New Jersey's Hacksack, where they can keep their hands on magical texts that can transfer their chef to human hosts. Trailer Park hacked the track park park to Hong Kong Jesse (Nick Stablale) and his delicious girlfriend Z (Kathryn Higel) to take them to their destinations, by placing their drunk companions blame, Cyco dolls carried out a killer attack. <br /> <br /> Although the concept of a baby doll was captured by the soul of a mass murderer, it was rather ridiculous, until the fourth movie of the children's play series, the makers completely took the plunder of the premises and liked to choose the plays. Lots of laughter (though we still have lots of it splatter for us) than the sun shines. <br /> <br /> The talented Hong Kong director, Roni Yuu, looks at the proceedings, impressively translates the tongue tongue into a sticky and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride -Check script. Likewise, the excellent Cast Camp component is handled perfectly, Stable and Higgile make a favorite couple, but smoking hot tile, such as gold, buxom, pouting, PVC-mini-skirts stole the show as a tiffany. Kevin Yahyar's fascinating publisher's puppet effects make the film look a long way to succeed. Overall, this film is unlikely to find many fans of 'fierce' horror fans, but those who enjoy strange psychological popcorn entertainment, mixing, black humor, crazy death scenes and excellent flaws should be an explosion. .
