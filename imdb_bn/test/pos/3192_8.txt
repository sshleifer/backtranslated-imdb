I saw Limbo Love on TV for the first five years of TV and since then it is a movie, I will always remember warmly as one of those movies and will be affected forever. <br /> <br /> For Uninitiated, Australian film has a long history of making comedy about off-comedy about a lovable sufferers, and love in Limbo is a sterling example of this. Although Russell Crowe is his only actress (though it needs all the movies in today's day), Cast of Castor was better - although he still stole this shot as a nervous, desperate, virgin loser. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> General accommodation is much like American pie. A group of friends would like to get laid and become men. As much as you expect, the whole movie focuses on it (with Lead's mother and a sub-plot about various other events) and it is filled with fun situations that push the uncertain sweet finishes. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the American pie, do not expect it to be the same - but expect the same conventions to appear. Love is not a romantic comedy in Limbo - but it must be a part of the laugh, a good person will win the pumping moment of fate, and the situation can be related to every Australian or any other situation.
