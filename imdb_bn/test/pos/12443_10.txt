From the golden era of British film, it has voted for my most fun one of all times. Yesterday, in my films, the Society was screened for a vibrant audience, how am I going to comedy (I was in the 1950s!). It has indeed been made of expert time and brutally selected two best actors: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a game of John Dayton, this is directed by Farce Director Frank Lander. Plot easy: A ministry is a girls school billets wrong in a boys' school. When I think of this picture, I will always laugh.
