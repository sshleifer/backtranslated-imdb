When I was growing up, the voice in space was my favorite movie. I remember the time when KTL (Channel 5) ran for the whole week and my and my sisters saw it every single day! I still remember every part of that movie. The giant robot swollen along with the guillotine, and then looking at Johnny Soko, all tears in front of the giant robot. The film should have been a sequel, in which the giant robot survived the blast. :) I still can not believe there are still many other Voyage in Space fans. While coming out of the DVD, I really want to buy movies, but my sister says that now people who are out there are mobile phones and probably bad quality copies. I do not know why they were not released yet, because it has been for 40 years now. I think voices in space came back in 1968. Just now, my second favorite Japanese giant film (The War of Gargaguas) is finally coming to the DVD and is released on 9th September and I can not wait! :) Now if they will only do the same with space Voyage. Giant Robot, Johnny Soko, and Voice in Space will not be forgotten! My eyes and perhaps many others, it will always be my childhood style! :)
