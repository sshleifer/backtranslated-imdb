This first Phuli job director shows a genius more than its most mainstream side as well as reasonable analysis for storytelling and genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an esthete of Gore. It makes me amazed by a commendable method and partly rich narrative which shows its lack of mentality and police inadequacy in small towns, as well as the counter-ideology of the Catholic Church, which ends up spending it. When this film is first released, knees go and probably can give the director some other direction. Gore's comparative lack of film shows his current "mystery" more urgent and emotional requirements for this film, but his used cow and puppet is used well here where apparently the liar is slaughtered in a cemetery lynched by a crowd of men and in a show of vile and old alarms Left for the dead, choreographed the modern tune of a moronic radio off efficiently d. <br /> <br /> Another example was the final scene (which was really awesome), which suddenly fell off a hill and used the doll to be shown in a middle mortgage, which strengthened its giant appearance and obviously ugly. Curiously, considering his subsequent work, Floris also calls for the concept of modernization to modernize the notion of modernity on its spiritual prejudice and ignorance when the concept of black magic is only a diverse concept of that supernatural temple which never ends from the Vuittu doll when its witch is a disturbed woman Nothing more than that. Another thing I like is that he has added a female bourgeoisie to a different character in this characteristic - is that corrupt priest afraid for his ward and probably for his own sake? He lends himself to becoming one of Gio≈Ço Fluchi's personal and original movies, then we can actually get the fair flow of ideas from him.
