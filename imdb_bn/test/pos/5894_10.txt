Blue Ribbon Banner, Taraj and Strip Forever, the ordered general and unconditional surrender from the enemies, which need tons and ton radiation, were the collective elements of the United States victory in World War II !! A national Jinnath recommend Times Square and elsewhere in the US to celebrate !!! America is at the top !! One thing, one annoying and painful thing .. adjusting time !! .. The actual celebration ended at the end of the curse bottle. Now everybody with their life ... they need to have the only problem. . They have to get a new life ... old life has gone forever ... loving and happy smiles face a fragile with the long duration of boiling snow dense !! Every character in the movie is paraded by the initial suspicion and unable to make any kind of dirtyness about how serious it was not, it was not true for general reasons! After World War II, Sergeant, General and his wife, daughters, sons and almost all Americans touched, nightmares of the second world war, nightmares and hostility and how it was edited, also denied, there was no one else! For now, there was a spontaneous interest in social and moral issues ... Frederick March and Mirza Laun started! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married in Virginia Mayo !!! Theresa Wright has become sadly aware that she has become creatively selfish !! Las but at least, the character is going to get married to Homer and he thinks everyone around him has been destroyed due to his injury, in the sense that he does not fail to cope! <br /> This movie is so fabulous because because of a happy ending has been a tough result, once every new person recognizes the new start and overall new world in the United States, the tragedy from WWII is recognized, and things that were mentally broken into pieces , And deal accordingly !! Frederick March and Marina Loy to return to the first chapter of their marriage, Homer said that she would go to marry her bride (that is, half a time, she would feel like a nurse) and Anna Andreas, who is associated with Tharce Wright, meant that partial responsibilities of breaking the marriage of the adult entrance. It's got your driver's license at Indianapolis 500 How can one learn how to drive a car ... The characters of the film are trapped by the unreasonable awakening of the hard change of their lives in the general post of WWII ... Happiness does not carry the luxury of adulation, especially aesthetic ... And out of good win. Bad bad way to bad choice !! World War II did not even happen !! It will affect the living social design of America !!! <br /> <br /> The overall disaster of World War II also reflects the feelings of the lack of personalities of most Americans !! I liked this photo and did the AIIO, probably because of that it was once inadvertently banned !! .. the bottom line, watch this movie !! Nightmares about war, conflicts about marital illness and / or reconsideration, when an injury to your disability is an inefficiency, and only the originality is portrayed in live movies and television, but !! This is 1946 !! Americans are very new .... Remember that !! When film artist William Wyler thinks of the effect of WWII after WWII, the film industry has tied him behind! Take into account and you can probably understand how exciting this movie is !!
