Bothersome Man is a smart, spiritual movie that reinforces what you are doing with your life and how you tick. When you see these people in transit to do everyday events in Jumbo, and understand what we do and what we want in real life really comes closer to home. This is an amazingly effective movie that ultimately asks you questions about your aspects and the movie does not have so much to do. <br /> <br /> <br /> The underdog's main character, whose life is transferred to his new life after getting his life, we get his third life. Initially he is considered to be the most popular man in the city because everyone satisfy him for his work and he invites dinners etc. A good example of this is with his new boss, who offered him a certain amount of envelope. Cash says "Here's a little bit of you to start". Andres also gets a girlfriend in a 20 minute movie, which eventually comes with her. It seems to be an ideal living situation because her girlfriend is an established interior designer, interesting, and she does not bother about anything. But Andrias their relationship with everything else in this world is incomplete. Then he started a relationship with Inzbarg, a colleague, who eventually left Anne and claimed that he was in love. He told how he feels after telling him that he is seeing other colleagues and says that all relations are "beautiful". After seeing Andrés at the train station, he tried to end his grief and did not come to the audience's disappointment. Still searching for the Movement, Andrés Hugo has met who has found a hole in which the music is heard. So they start a mission to go on the other side, would it be good or would it be bad? <br /> <br /> "Annoying man" shows the emotions of our society and its materialistic psychology. By completing home rooms with Ikea products, it makes us an interesting job that characters pick each luncheon. I think he is kidding most of the dust in Scandinavian society and at his high suicide rate. For example, there is a scene in the movie where Andres comes across a guy who came out of a building and went on a speeding trip. Also, Andrés got excited with this world and closed his finger and later jumped in front of the train; This is one of the most weird / humiliating scenes I've seen. This world is made by the Alien where there is no punishment or rewards. After drinking the drink in this world, the manuscript never drunk, the gender was incomplete, and he tried that how many times he tried he could not kill himself. This movie reminds me of "Fight Club" and how both the main characters were syncing with the world around them. Tyler Durden has created a second personality in "Fight Club" which he does not want, and the film is about the equivalent of Andreas Tyler Darden. After awhile he woke up and tried to escape from a happy life, he is now running through a hole in the wall. <br /> <br /> Leanne has done a great job in continuation of this movie, which means when a character has half full cup in hand and they are cut, they come back in the same glass and it is not full and the shot is completed on the second day. That's just showing up. Nowadays the directors are more worried about sound performance and ignore little things, the character that is wearing bracelet as the same year painter? Since I have been taking TV production for three years in high school, it does not show me continuous or voice overlays which drives me nuts. Lien is the small thing he has got great shots in each shot, and why not come in an interesting topic why something in any shot does not surprise you. This film really worked for me because it is not only Scandinavius ​​but also the Western society and what is wrong between it The only real problem was that the person who committed suicide and jumped on an intense voyage. Because you finally discovered that there is no death in this world, but he has firmly placed you to assume death and it never answers my comments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Andrias is the only main character, others come and go and do not do much in his support. Her first girlfriend Anna Britt is an interior designer who seems her perfect for the surface but eventually turns to be dull. This takes her to Ezberg where she begins to fall in love and fall in love. He soon finds out that he was with some other men and what he felt was not real. Andrade eventually meets Hugo with the bathroom, which does not wish any better and he may not get drunk anymore. He followed Hugo home to find out the hole in the wall, filled with children's smile and chips of birds. <br /> <br /> There is not much for Leen's summation but "The Bigrosom Man" jump to a great career but an up and coming director's preview If it gives any possible hint as its genre and story story, Leyen has a bright future and we can only hope that his future films do not take so much time to go abroad for the pleasure of seeing us. So enjoy the seat and enjoy the passenger, because Director Jens Leanen is taking you from the comfort of your house to a dream as "anxious people".
