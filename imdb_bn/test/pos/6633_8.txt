Illustrating the effects of war against the general public, a very credible and uncertain film, Shame gives us a cool understanding about the beliefs of Angmerman Bergman. The absence of color and sound (like a soundtrack) helps in making the movie more realistic. There is no soft or hard light or camera angle variety to give the story a charming or dramatic effect. Everything is very simply illustrated as it will be the reality. Sometimes the story was confusing, but perhaps to understand the nature of the characters' mind ?? They know what is happening or why they are now. The simplicity of the movie makes it somewhat annoying, but I understand how the director is trying to impress stories and points. He illustrates the impact of rigid and uncertain events and war. Characters were initially presented as content with lighter settings and long, pulled out shots. When the fight struck suddenly upon them, they were much bold and quiet with less intimate shots. Bergman presents us with an attack of hunger and a picture that allows him to engage in adequate warfare. Although the story itself was not very impressive, the content of the film was.
