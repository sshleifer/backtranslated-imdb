Farsk - This is a science show that restores the interest of science fiction in me. <br /> <br /> But fresaces are so easy and easily scientific-fi. Comedy, Drama and much more :) Acting is very good. Thankfully, Fars also has been canceled and it is shown with peacekeeping war that it is not dead yet :) I hope there is a future for phosphorus :) In my opinion, some of the main shows are not problematic. Do you look back and do a beauty Farscape that you will see. <br /> <br /> Farscape is a new standard set on television and I think it would be really hard to prove it to be the equivalent of a new show or better than Farscape. I love this show :) <br /> <br />
