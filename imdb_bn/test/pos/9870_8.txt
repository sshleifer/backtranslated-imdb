... this movie dislikes and why everyone will understand. Plots are poor, so played. But in my opinion it's better than Halloween 5, even though it does not even give a lot of wonderful moments. A few views are really well-directed. But in these few moments it is not provided because of renting. I do not despise violence in movies, but H6 highlights strong and bloody scenes that do not fit the tradition of Halloween-movies. The most sucking aspect about H6 is the lack of tension. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " If you want, rent it. But do not expect a great horror experience .... <br /> <br />
