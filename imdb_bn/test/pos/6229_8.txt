A group of young adults are trapped behind the cross, where the only place in the neighborhood is a museum full of peacock dummies, and the only form of help is the local public. Slush (chalk cones). During the fall of the night, the children's record was chosen from time-to-time. <br /> <br /> A bizarre, shocking B movie that adds a bunch of backwood settings to all the biological managers, "body of wax museums" updates), an intense shock festival along with the "Texas Chain So Genocide" line. (It should be astonishing that TCSM industrial director Robert A. Barnes has repetitated this responsibility, and his set of great set decorations always comes easily.) Pinocchio Donaggio's score is uninterrupted; With Nicholas von Sternberg's iconic photography, it spreads the film in an oppressive environment. <br /> <br /> Plot Twist changes to success level; I saw one mile coming away, and that really surprised me, and I was more happy for him. One of the best moments is shared in almost the front of us, because the victims at first touch themselves in a house with flying objects flying from their own volumes. By the end of the hat, a great damn by pipe with blood pieces. <br /> <br /> Star Connors gives us an attractive performance as a good ol 'boy rival, while a small co-star, perhaps, can not perform at the same level, although Jos√©lin Jones is an optimistic and definitely winning woman , Who has made sufficient appeal at the rate of sympathetic daughter-childhood. It's okay to co-star Tania Roberts (a picture of this movie). (If I have a problem with this film, it is only a very young victim.) Again, it is not much different than many horror movies of the 80's.) Future names in the future include future director Ted Nicolov, who was editor here, Ron Andood Who nearly a dozen years later, "Trimmers" with assistant director and fellow makeup artist Vie Neill, who has made many films <br /> <br /> However, due to the lack of nudity and sexual content, some devious fans may be frustrated, but David Schmoller, the director of the Debit distribution, shares it with firm conviction and seriousness. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
