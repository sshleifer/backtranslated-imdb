A good old Western-West-Waven Western, given a twist and a touch gravitas by injection of a little black social history into its plot. Under the leadership of Mario Van Paibles, who is right, Billy Jane's (seemingly unusable) military-run gangs themselves expelled themselves, their courage is still funny and exciting. There are some great Moody Flashback scenes set up in the Hero character and backstory, which protects the city of greedy white landbrushes by our heroes and even Steven Beldwin is not bad at this delightful, quite powerful West.
