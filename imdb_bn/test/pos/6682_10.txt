Always delightful Kevin Spacy makes us some true questions in our lives again. After driving in our faith, he was a little crocodile (only to reveal the true power of the film's deception) in the classic The Yose Soup; At this time, he believes that he is a proto, a favorite alien who feels the form of man while traveling around the world. <br /> <br /> Prote is an amazing newborn who has never seen anywhere in Manhattan's mental institute hospital. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) soon takes an extreme interest in him and even if he thinks himself as the highest one from the Catex-KX planet, or perhaps he is a man forgotten about the psychological problem. It can be seen in the end and discussed in various ways, but it is a complex, enlightened journey that manages the disguise / philosophical questions behind it.
