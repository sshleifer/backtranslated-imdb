I saw on the video that many elementary British sound films are either poor print quality of transfer or poor sound or both. Thankfully, I was able to get a copy of this movie in a great quality video, which enabled me to focus on the story. <br /> <br /> And it's a wonderful story. In the first view, unfortunately the bus passengers looked a pretty annoying lot (always without the beautiful Jessie Matthew). However, on the day before the accident, the film returned to show the story of each passenger, I discovered that in contrast to the acting, initial appearance, the talented group of actors were efficiently managed, so that they could bring genuine personality to their own characteristic. <br /> <br /> Visitors may have different preferences because the two passengers are going to the end of the sad end And none will be left. However, the movie keeps your interest because it guides you. This film deserves a big audience - the original jewel of the first British film.
