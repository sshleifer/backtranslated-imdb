It was very good in the western part of the 1950s, which I have seen in a decade, described in the screen and on TV. There were three major stars in the market: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwick and Edward G. Robinson. This proves that Ford supports the film star and other two star roles. Dr. Dr. Dr. Robinson was a "bad guy" and he was twice as bad as Robinson. He played real heavy in this film and the character that he played was occasionally very consistent. <br /> <br /> Ford played his acting status very slowly, as he did - especially in the West. He played a nice guy who did not want to fight, was a peaceful man ... but if you pushed him ... see! <br /> <br /> A nice mix of the story was action and lulls, neither overdoing. It was a broad western setting that was well-used with the synmoscope widescreen. It featured a realistic setting realistic man. The credentials that were most impressive with characters, especially supporter players. In this film, women have played and played the role of men in character. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - production only negative. These two actresses are never getting older, why are they easy? <br /> <br /> Although it's more than 50 years old, yet this West is fast approaching you to enjoy fast, how old or what you are used to seeing. For fans of classic film, this cast and good story is almost a must. Highly recommended.
