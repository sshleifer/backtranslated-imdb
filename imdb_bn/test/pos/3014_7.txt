Cells fascinate me at first glance. I was surprised about that fact, that the story of the movie is absolutely annoying. If she does not have any stories, then the film will be better. Bunuelas "Yu Chien Andalou" comes to my mind - a movie without stories, but interesting and sometimes annoying images. But cell is the first Hollywood-movie, and only a piece of the second industry. I am very interested in the next project of the tertem. Hamlets can be very attractive to Indians, especially when it is the same as the cell. <br /> <br /> For film music enthusiasts: Howard Shore's The Cell score is absolutely amazing, but the hard listening experience is his very modern style.
