* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when it was reprinted in about 8 years old video. Now I am 17 years old and whenever I get the chance I see it. "The Aristocats" is an interesting heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I like the song, especially the bowl, with the piano. Actually I used to sing a talent with my sister and friend, because I love it a lot. All three kits are so intelligent and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cat I've ever seen. Ali cats had a great voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this photo is when the piano is playing. That part is adorable. I enjoy the home of their journey. It's incredible. It's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen and one of my favorite. Everyone will see it. I give this image 10/10 stars
