This picture was probably the "horror movie" I've seen for several years. Cool can be a more accurate description. The last was unexpected and therefore surprised me. If there is any flaw in it, it will be used extra to the full meaning of life. Since no one really knows this answer, when you incorporate that idea into the film, surely you go into shocking waters. That aside and the movie is quite enjoyable. Curley Pope should appear as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry. The rest of the cast was somewhat frustrating, but since the focus was on Sarah Nawak (Karley Pope), her performance congratulated the film. Occasionally, poor performance of its customers was not a problem because it is not their performance to burn this movie. (Thankfully). Watch this movie you should enjoy it. <br /> <br />
