I needed a movie in this movie: - Women, Skateboarding, Violence, Music, HIM and Tony Hawk !!! Artwork and camera effect in this photo is amazing. I did not hear any other music film in this movie. Each track goes so well with its view. I thought acting was really good that no cricketer had previously scripted films. Although the full idea of ​​the film is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glurin), who is sleeping back in Hellbaya behind, the expected and old story of the age The way they work out is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and gas tanks, Rab himself, Dunn Wawa breaking bottle behind and all Don Vito scenes. This movie will be seen!
