Being a favorite fan of the Italian thriller and director Dario Argante, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Ladoo, I thought Lucio Fuqui as an additional hack. I think I have completely pressed the bundle, I saw New York's Ripper just being dissatisfied and especially did not like The House of the Grave. These three movies made me decide that the flower is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my cruelty won, and I had to see more of her pictures. Living Dead City was an interesting movie that I was very entertaining but did not do a duckling torture is almost a wonderful composition. <br /> <br /> Set up in a small town in the Italian countryside of a repressive religious community where young children are being killed. Especially after being their main suspects, the authorities are unaware of who is behind these crimes. Rather, a small young journalist investigates with an incest girl (who seduce young boys) and finally get it down. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story and a brilliant atmosphere combined with a good cast (not always in the case, with 70 Italian thrillers) do not torture a dalling well-thriller thriller. Plots are well built, easily figured out and the final conclusion is very satisfying. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of suppression and crime in a highly unforgiving and unconscious community and is especially created in a scene where a woman gets some very strong visuals, where some woman gets beaten by local dude. Phulchi's social commentary about religion and innocence is very strong and every direction is handled well. While thinking about his junky flicks and his fierce violent gaolos, how well New York Ripper makes his balance of criticism and creates even more powerful points with violent violence. So far I have not seen any flowering film professionally. <br /> <br /> If there is no traditional gaelo film, most of the docking is a series of trademarks. Fulci is going to show complete control over the format, going overboard with an unconvincing gore momentum only once, but overall he seems to be better off making the mystery than the complete leakage gore epic. Here extreme scenes are more powerful and really pack a punch. <br /> <br /> So far, I have not been complaining about the best film of Phalke. Edgy's social commentary combined with obvious tone of violence and a crackling good mystery for the boot.
