Here is another entertaining Clint Eastwood Action-suspense film. I'm not his special fan, but he has to hand it over to him: He knows how to make amusement movies. This is one more example. It did not hurt John Malkovic as his co-star. Now there's an acute actor! In this story, Malkovich played a murderer and he was interested to see, because of his various inconsistencies and the shocking dialogue he gave him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, at the end. I think he could not stop playing the pictures of "Dirty Harry", but he played them well. <br /> <br /> This picture was somewhat negatively, but in a couple of times the credibility was repeatedly, this was real life, the killer went away with the Eastwood. The weather scene, in particular, had many holes in it. There too many misuses have happened in the name of Lord. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's good, palanquin rental.
