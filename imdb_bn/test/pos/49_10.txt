Lacavana Blues is a very moving movie that depicts the passion and character filled with the eyes of a young man. The film clearly supports "It takes a village to raise a child" and reminds black history and an important time of culture. I achieved an incredible amount of respect for the Messi Gray as the actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; Obviously we all are familiar to Messi's character. come. Ipatha Markarison is absolutely fantastic as a donkey. I did not understand that Eipa was such a great actress. Law and order does not ever show the depth of the power of Ekta's ability to display the Lackawanna blues. I was surprised and amazed! Music and characters remind me of my own childhood ... It was walking under a sweet nostalgic memory lane. I really enjoyed this movie and are looking forward to DVD releases encouraged to join my collection.
