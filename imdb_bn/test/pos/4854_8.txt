The first critics are correct - in this movie we see ourselves, trying to avoid graduating, agreeing, problem with the majority, trying to save our lives, and we can see how easily these human traits are easily, the effectiveness of society, in us a great evil Can lead to engage in <br /> <br /> This story was set during World War II, radio, newspapers, and movies reminded the Jewish attack of Hitler's invasion of the same type of anti-Semitism America. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Larry has lived an uneventful life until the Middle Ages; Yet all of them started pairing for everyone starting for him - everyone - at first glance he was taken to the Jews. I deliberately kept suspicion because the plot progressed me, but the impossibility bothered me throughout the film. (And honestly, I did not understand why his wife was taken to the Jews, because Larry thought that his name was "heart." And later when he married her, I did not know why his neighbors took hold? Was.) In the first part of the film I am wondering if I'm going to be the fantastic element. Larry's unassumingness seems exaggerated, almost surprising point. Why do not the police say to show rape, even if the attacker is a neighbor? And I thought the light seems somewhat uncomfortable - the red in the house seems to be very red, because Gertrude's entrance was deliberately overlaught, usually the colors were almost crayon-like in their intensity. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Really :) It was good to remember that at that time priests were often leading the evil of racism. (Remember, how did Pope refuse to speak against Hitler, only wanted to protect the church? It was the same Pope, just as when the American soldiers of Rome were released, the first soldier did not write the city black, check your history.) I have never heard of this movie before. It's a shame. For everyone interested in American history or racialism, it is very interesting for every thoughtful person. This is a wonderful picture I have ever seen by Bertrand Russell's order, "Do not go with the crowd to do evil."
