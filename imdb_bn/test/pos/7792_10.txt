I saw this movie probably 20 times more. Curiosity is now 10-15 years old but when I see it, it throws me on my chair. Best Actor Salman Khan and Aamir Khan play a major role here. Even if Aamir Khan plays better actor and film with good actor (smart guy) and sometimes plays better just like a fool. All the characters are memorable. This movie is filled with ridiculous one-liners and funny situations (probably too little silly). Do not try to argue in this movie. Let your brain relax for some time. I promise it to be an experience to feel.
