I saw a silence in this movie. Waiting for 42 minutes in the bus stand and a sister started to cut free tickets for the preview of this movie. I expected more of its chance. Promotional movie poster i Subway station walls have found that it does not always give justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a young rocky man who loves to learn and wear heavy metal art. The film is a heavy comedy and a lot of fun. If you dominate music at this age, you are going to love this movie. Jack Black is a wonderful talented comedian and actor, and he has written and played the song in this movie, and he is also a talented musician. <br /> <br /> Tennesses D. Definitely a look!
