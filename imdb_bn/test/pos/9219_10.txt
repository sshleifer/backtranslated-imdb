I have seen this movie as a child and still enjoy watching it for the nostalgia factor. When I was young, I liked the movie because of the entertainment and interesting characters. Today, I still love the characters. In addition, I now see ethics and symbolism because I think the plot with high consent. Rainbow Brite is far from the worst movie ever, and though out date, I'm sure that I will show it to my children in the future, when my child has.
