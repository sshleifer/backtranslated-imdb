<br /> <br /> Very good films of the 1970s about the uprisings in New Jersey. When a "macric" gangster can not play around by the rules around, sooner or later, it is time to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> Joe Pearce is right for her character - smooth and fun. She only gets better with age. His face and current reputation should not have been used in DVD cover to sell this "B" grade film because he was the third build star. <br /> <br /> The 1970's printed wide lapel shirt and low-quality background date music make for a distraction. It was nice to see the big car of 1970. <br /> <br /> But the acting is good. <br /> <br /> Anna Janas did not require nudity for this welfare work. And, he does not appear again in any other film except this as in the database. very bad; He did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral story: Your "Don" does not bother you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then check out this DVD in the middle of the night. It is a special part of a $ 3-movie-free, three-movie-on-one $ 5.88 local discount shop. <br /> <br />
