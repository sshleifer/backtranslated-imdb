This 3 hour epic (seems to be a lot younger) power and victory and its parallel objectives track two parallel life that inspires the enthusiasm: Emperor Quinn, whose intentions to combine Chinese feudal states, on the basis of enthusiastic goals but violent persecution, isolation , And devolves into the ultimate powerlessness; And the killer Jing, a tenant murderer who came to recognize the unfortunate consequences of the killings and found a form of salvation. As with all the great art, this can be understood on many levels. The film is invented for pictures and ideas of Homer, Euripides, Mackayveli, Shakespeare and Fred. <br /> <br /> The story really (I checked it at britannica.com!), so this movie will appeal to history buffs. It is ironic that Quinn spent most of his last year for a unreal search for immortality (not shown on the screen, but consistent with the plot). <br /> <br /> This movie can also be seen as a metaphor for Maoism and Cultural Revolution. Through the film, nobody can understand that in the past 50 years, their example was the history of Chinese history in the previous 3,000 years. <br /> <br /> For fortunately visitors, these complex ideas have developed into a movie that is rich in imagery, action, and the pageant. Price of the admission of war scene alone.
