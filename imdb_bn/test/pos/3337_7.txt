Good writing main script, excellent entrance of RKO cents series with good camera work and transition, good guidance for managing some wrapping of plot, good editing and good performance for keeping the flow constant. George Sander is suave and malicious. Jonathan Hell Simply Inspector Firenac Paul Guilfoyle is a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can not take the pressure. They will return to the series later. The story begins with an ocean fishing boat operated in the United States where St. meets the Wendy can not connect with Barias. He finally succumbs Saint's charms but he breaks his heart at the end. St. Inspector Help Furnak to clear the name from the frame. Some companies fall along the path. Good entertainment and upper average for this type of film. See it
