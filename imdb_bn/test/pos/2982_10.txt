Michelle, Anne Alvina, was so beautiful, and I really fell in love with her. He died a few months ago! Friends? Really my young movie best Elton and his ancestor Paul Buksastar "Reproduction of the Season" song forever on my head ... Please, if you know where I can find VHS of a film, join me !! My husband is 26 years old and I have seen HS Junior. Yes, he was my lover and still continues. I think we both cried out to our eyes. I think we could possibly draw in this movie by Alton John Music, but then I moved away from all the teenage voices. When Paul and Michelle saw our film, our age was very easy to identify !! Shane is very good to hear that he is doing well, I'm a "helper profession" (an RN). I was well and very credible in his performance. "Michelle" came across very sweet, fragile and risky. I think the main theme is that if they do not have to deal with their "real world" they can be happy and can go in love. Many of us just wanted a "Calgon moment". If we have any concerns outside of us and can deal with our "basic needs", then it can be a little easier. I have a 15-year-old daughter and she will not have any problem seeing this movie. In these days, children are getting so bad that it is very bad. For those of you who are trying to detect CDs (a huge Elton John Fan) for them you were able to get 2-CD sets out in 1992. It is called, "Elton John-Rare Master" Polygram Studio. All these friends have songs and many more. As far as we know the only CD with this "Friends" song We had been LP years ago and were happy to find the CD. Good luck I recommend this movie to someone who loves the "young love" theme. I just wish it DVD now !!
