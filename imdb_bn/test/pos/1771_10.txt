I saw this movie at a very young age in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to Jean-Peters in Hollywood, and I told him how much I enjoyed him in this movie. He sent me a signed picture. This film was directed by Jacques Turunu and starring John Peterson. It also includes Louis Jardin, Debra Patgate and Herbert Marshall. It was released in color in 1951 and it is 81 minutes long. Jean Pieters married Hydog Hughes She starred with Marlon Brando in "Viva Japta", Anthony Quinn, who won Oscar for acting as Japa's brother Marpal Brando (1952). And he played "Cassette to Captain" (1947) with Teron Power. Since then, I have been trying to find a place where it is found, but I still do not succeed. Have any suggestions about where I can find and buy this movie? It contains spoilers in this comment, I know about it.
