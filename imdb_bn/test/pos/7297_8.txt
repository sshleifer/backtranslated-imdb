After finishing the book last week, I saw this movie for the first time. What is the problem here? People acknowledge that performance is cool - I mean, lingerie is embellished! - And that image looks beautiful, but it's less than a '6'! I do not get it. Come on! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, the screen together. I have been executing almost all of the novel paring down perfectly. In most of this story it was the amount of dialogue and the story was used only on a part of it, despite it it actually went to the screen. <br /> <br /> ** Book speaker part ** I was, however, leaving Guinea-Tree-to-Mar-Rose subplot is somewhat frustrating. I thought it was one of the more emotional blurred parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to give it away. Avid movies are more avid than movie-goers, I think, the character of pulling antagonistic stuff tend to be less forgiving. It's a good idea to confuse Johnny Launchpail and Joe Sikpack. <br /> <br /> If you like this book, you like the movie. If you hate the book, you probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Patients
