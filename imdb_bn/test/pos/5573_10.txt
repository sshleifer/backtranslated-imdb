J. Michael Strakzinsky has taken a television show from the amazing art of applying a story under the influence of a story on television shows since Babylon 5. The best thing to do at this moment on TV! Characters are desired and one can easily be connected with them and can take care for their well-being. Villians kind of love to hate you and they wonder what they left next. And Brian Hensen's doll works are the most innovative. Koodos to Rockne S. O'Bannon for doing good work!
