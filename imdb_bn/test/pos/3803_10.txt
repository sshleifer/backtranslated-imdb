Although this film has not earned commercial infamy, my experience has reached me with the conclusion that many good works of artistic expressions often do not get mass appeal. The story line stole a little boy from the car, and we started dream adventure at a very low cost according to our perceptions of time and space. Therefore, anyone who tries to see the film from its perspective on the reality will be disappointed; It is not intended for "realistic" purposes. However, it can be transformed into a metaphor with a wide spectrum, to whom excellent attention has been given. In addition, symbolic presentations are open to interpretation, which can be said of many great works. Do not be fooled by the cover (if you want to rent or buy this movie) - The film does not look like a page.
