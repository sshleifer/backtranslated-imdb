It was not fun to see me do not get me wrong. It has a curious looking bug and some nice animations with some beautiful music exceptions. And the standout view was definitely the floor on the floor of Elmer, Bug and Daffy, that was a nice and fun touch. The fact is, the whole cartoon is nice to look at, but not all I say are exceptional like carbarklankara. There are some nice gogs, but I think before they were used, and I did not have that much that would seem too sunny. And is Damie joining Elmer? Since he was a hunter's target, as it looked, it does not seem strange that he will be friends with her. Although I would admit that it was nice to have a Dafa here. The voice was too much acting, but the way I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> All, unexpected but very nice cartoon. 7/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
