"The Dashar" is a small but absolutely amazing movie, starring Albert Finney and Tom Cortenan. This little picture attracted enough attention to the five main academy awards nomination in 1983, it is a mystery to me, but it is good to know that the academy may be guilty of good taste for some time (of course, they give the year's reward "in the condition of sincerity" Finally, they do not want to be accused of too much taste) <br /> <br /> <br /> "King Lear" Production; Tom Cortenne works twice behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the paddle. Both ridiculous and kind, both of which are both ridiculous and kind, solely irrelevant and dismissive of the Courten's character to be attached with attention and affection, even to see the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay work together wondering, and although Finney gets the opportune moment (she will read Shakespeare after all), the heart and soul of the Courtenay film. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
