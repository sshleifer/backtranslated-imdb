This movie is amazing because real people describe themselves and their real life experiences and do so well, as if they were living almost past. Zia Hansheng acting herself as an actor, who struggled with depression without music and drugs and gave up everything to search for the meaning of life, especially those who became angry with them most cared for. At the moment of the movie you can cry because the family, especially the father did well. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people who are frustrated understand the problem of Hong Kong and why they do what they do, for example, they keep themselves in a dark room or go for themselves or walking or cycling. Others might see the movie as boring because it is so real that it's almost like a documentary. Overall, this movie deserves an Oscar for this film, and the Hong Kong film, so did his father too.
