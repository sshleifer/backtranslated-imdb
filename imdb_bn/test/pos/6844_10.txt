Sure, Cannes and Elmore have worked before Leonard, but what is there? You want entertainment, lively and smart - near the "Judas Kiss" perfect. It does not get to get offended by tongue by tongue (talking about your sex and getting out of the way of direct violence - Keeping your investors happy, making it an independent film 101). For making a bundle of brits, I highly doubt it. This glimpse is obviously not a half of salary of a Labor Labor and Budget, probably Mr. Tarantino. Maybe the guys do not like the women. I thought it was pushing. Go Coco!
