I would admit that for the first time I was able to catch Saifaier's "Saifai Prime", but despite this experience I was a huge slider fan, even though ForScope now looks like my four popular ones. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the most modern PsyFi shows (fortunately, two new Star Trek series), this show moves to have fun with MST3K coming across sheets.
