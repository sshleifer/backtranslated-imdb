I first saw this when Junior High was a teenager in my last year. I was riveted it! I like special effects, great space and trials-aspect and storytelling flashback system. After a few years I read the book and it was interesting and I can clearly see what Swift is trying to say, I think it is not as perfect as a social commentator's book, the story is good as the story It can be a long adventure after gifting it after every long journey and earning profit by selling small liliput sheep or whatever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sheep can be made a camio anyway. I was surprised to see Laputa as well. It's seen more like the Jell Kingdom from the Chronio Trigger Video Games (1995) which makes me more like this mini-series. <br /> <br /> I saw it again about 4 years ago and realized that I still enjoy so much. Those who start with really high quality stuff and a nice run of Sweeps Mini series for NBC follow it with the strong Maryland and interesting Alice in Wonderland.
