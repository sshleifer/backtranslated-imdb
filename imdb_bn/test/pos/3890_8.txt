Girlin did a great job. Good idea is well executed, and tightly produced. Came across as a very sincere story. As a fan of "Curb You Yu Anthusius", where Jeff played a very straight-forward role, I was happy with how much depth I had brought to this role in a simple but effective illustration. <br /> <br /> Humor made uninterrupted and subtle and uninterrupted, which I really liked, rather slapstick or more. And there were some nice little surprises and twists. Convenience shop vintets were delighted. <br /> <br /> When I say this is a wonderful "small" film, I do not mean budget or quality. It's simple, intimate and handmade. It tells a very credible everyday story. Calm and go see it. Let it wash on you, and you will feel better to do so.
