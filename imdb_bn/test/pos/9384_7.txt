Among other things, people eat a large bed, possessed by a monster. I'm not making it. <br /> <br /> was fully published in 1977 and was not officially released before coming to DVD in 2003, "Death Bid: The Bid It Eats" is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe. Perhaps thanks to the excellent bit of Paton Oswalt about this, along with Stephen Thunder's essential book "Nightmare USA" While watching it, you are thinking about the following: <br /> <br /> - George Berry, who has done any drug / injection / snot before writing and managing this film? <br /> <br /> A horror comedy? A combination of a horrific flick and an art movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I know, that word is overused, but it can not be truer than here. This real beggar details. This is a horror comedy, as well as art film / horror hybrid. But the whole thing is so real, it must be seen. The score sounds like the electronic candles from the old candlelum album, the act is terrible and isolated from everything, the side is amazingly capable, and the film seems like a movie like Jesus Franco - that is, his film was deliberately funny. Finally, there is no correct way to describe this movie. Lord knows I have tried, but really, some movies are bizgling, strange, unique, or as if this is the mind. See it ... but you have been warned. This is the only movie George Berry never did. He definitely kept his mark on this absorption section, I would say a lot to you.
