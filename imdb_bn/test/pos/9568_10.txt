I've always watched this funny movie. Chritopher Guest is really talented. He has a gift for humor. I almost smiled. Actually, when I saw it in the theater, I thought of walking because the film was so stupid. But it's a good way fool. It's funny-stupid. And it's a really good combination. You laugh at the end from the beginning <br /> <br /> This mechanical style film is followed by an array of competing characters in the Kennel Club dog show. Actor Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levi, Catherine Oahara, John Michael Higgins, Michael McCain, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and more. <br /> <br /> This is a really funny movie that everyone laughs. Anyone born without any personality will laugh at this film. It is presented on a widescreen to give you an image that you see on a real documentary, and perhaps it adds a hillar. Show the best: 5/5
