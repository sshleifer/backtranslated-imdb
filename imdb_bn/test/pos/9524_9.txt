I missed the moment because I did not give proper attention, but I got enough of the story, it was enough to take it firmly that director Lionel Jefferies, who played Chiti Bang Bang's Dada Pots, is a big family film. Originally it starts with a happy upper-middle-class family living in Victorian London. One night the father (Ian chattersson) visited two strangers, and he left them with them and did not come back. They have a cottage in the country, and move children here; Bobby (Jenny Agutter, who I first saw on Child Play 2), Philis (Sally Thampstate) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their souls relative, with their attraction for the next railway. They loyally ride on train passengers, and with courage and caution they avoid accidents and become heroes. Their kindness makes their friends, including those with important people who can help find their missing father's mystery. Also starring Dina Sheridan as Mother / Mrs. Waterbury, Albert Park, Bernard Cribbins, William Marvin as Old Gentleman, Peter Bromillo of Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster Ruth and Gordon Hough as Ruth. It was the number one of the 100 greatest family films in the year 29 and it was the number 24 of the 50 best British films. very good!
