Narma Shire, she is transformed from a fat, Adel-brain house-wife to an alluring potential divorce divorce. In most movies of 1930 they have a scary edge - the camera work is very slow at most times - but we must apologize for their extraordinary joy. As a guest of the wonderful earth-kitty Mary Dresler - ShiÃ«r mixed with a diverse collection of lovers with her long-lost husband. The conversation is fun, often clever and in queue performance. Shearer and Dresler most shine. Shiher even shows his piano skills in a musical intensity.
