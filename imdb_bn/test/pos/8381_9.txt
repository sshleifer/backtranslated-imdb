Since the evidence of death, I feel a little disappointed by Tarantino. But I insist that it was only a little, because I can understand how much the amount of work the person has to pay such respect to stunt the man. The explorer Basterds has definitely driven Tarantino to the top place in my universe. This movie can be summed up in a word (though inadequately): "RAUU". <br /> <br /> There is a deep passion in each scene. The main theme of revenge and justice seems to be that, from the beginning of the film, one sympathizes with the victims of the Nazis and in the historical context of the WW2, it is set in the mythical level of Tarantino. <br /> <br /> The letters are unpredictable, funny, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives I'm sure that my brain is running properly and positive. I will not appreciate every character, but other comments from fellow users enrich the performance of various. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " Tenantino may seem in a conversation that is creating more open references in other films. In fact, many conversations were near viewers in the movie, the setting was partly held in the movie premiere; A reference to a movie is closer to every corner. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see that each language presented (German, French and English) is free and naturally used. I speak both French and English very well, and how often English-language characters work badly in French films and how frustrating French-language characters in English / American films are often frustrating. Wonderfully enough, Tarantino managed to pull a natural and happy performance from his actor to his actor. It helps keep visitors in context in the historical context. In fact; Soldiers, espionage and civilians rarely understand soldiers / spy / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly in the 1940s interview with WWII Europe, Photography / Photography is beautiful. Outfits are perfect, and voiced by the violence / fiercely realistic. No punishment is held back, and Nazi is often seen being tortured. It does not make the movie open to all viewers; Graphic violence can cause more sensitive demographic shocks. <br /> <br /> Volumes can be written about this movie. But the movie is so good, that I had an ank at the premiere of North America's Inglourious Bastes in Montreal at the Fantasia Festival, but had to refuse to miss the single scene. I hope how strongly I feel about this movie and I would like to respect the audience.
