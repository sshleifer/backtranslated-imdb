A straight forward x file that shows that the action always equals intelligence. Rob Bowman's side is sharp and sharp, this episode shows up as fresh as a decade ago. Both David and Jillian have given good performance and both enjoy the lack of luggage - this is an exclusive X file that even the fans can even happen and enjoy. Junior Brown runs with them for their money during their scene; He is so sure that the crew goes somewhere in the middle and they can lose the first door they came to. Brian Cranston is very intense and enthusiastic as Patrick Crum, he admitted in interview that he did not know anything about the X files before this role, it is a fact that makes his hit-the-floor-running performance more incredible. A brilliantly stupid episode.
