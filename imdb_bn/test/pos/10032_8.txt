When I remember the frequent screen timing of screen timing of Iral Flin and Olivia Debrand, "Year Dead With his Boots On" (1941), perhaps the best movie is remembered. It's a wide-ranging singer from General Caste (Flin) - from the time he entered the West Point Military Academy and for his time during the American Civil War, he read for Elizabeth Bacon (dear) and finally Little Big Horn. The director, Raul Walsh, praised the historical epic of his very suspicious reunion of historical books, by screen writers Wali Klein and Anis McKenzie, until the truth and fiction went out of proportion. So, the war against the Chief Cragi Horse (Anthony Quinn) is against warring politicians - California Joe (Charlie Graevin) and a disgraced corporation who wants to recover the land, Castro gave the United Nations to Indians by regular massacre of the nation. The first man <br /> <br /> Flin, who cleverly plays Castor, though he was not much known to have been part of Arnold Schwarzenegger than Albert Schwitzer. He literally oozes the charm and sex appeal from every hole that melt his faithful heroine heart. The resident Warner stock player, Arthur Kennedy and Sydney Greenstone, have given amazing Cayo, which in reality they seem to have more depth and character. Actually, despite the short rendering of history. On behalf of a good romantic twist, "They Have Their Boots On Dead Day" is a darling of the premiere dinner for Saturday or Sunday nights on Saturday. Warner's DVD looks pretty good. Although the film grains are often apparent, the gray scale was rendered very nicely with the deep, solid black and very clean white. Some fade scenes shift time is obvious. The audio is cleaned very well and an adequate hearing level is presented.
