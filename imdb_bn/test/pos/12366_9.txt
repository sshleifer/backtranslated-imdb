This is certainly a story that focuses on morality and it is very good. The message comes as very powerful and effective. Due to the practical guidance from the Swedish film's father, it must be sure. Victor Sjöström. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the novels of other Swedish writers, Selma Leycelef. The story has taken Victor Szstrom by itself, probably taking some more elements to make the story and film flow better. It may take a little longer before the film begins, and the story becomes clear, but when the film takes form and motion it becomes really wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply a great story, it's a good looking one. The movie uses some initial and functional effects and uses a slightly different color filter to create the right mood and indicates what it refers to past, present and future. <br /> <br /> Sjöström only wrote and directed the film, he plays the main character. Of course, the film's performances are sometimes the highest quality, but not as bad as today's standards, but for example, German films were in the first place. And finally, this movie is more than its performance and morality, it's more about acting, so it does not really matter, or does not synthesize. <br /> <br /> is a really cool and functional underlying silent film from classic Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
