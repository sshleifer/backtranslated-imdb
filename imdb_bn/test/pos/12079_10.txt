"Who will love my children" The worst movie I've ever seen. Definite 10/10 Released on TV in 1983. The film was released on VHS. DVD release is a must, soon afterwards instead. Before the mother's death, all her children will have to find the house before her death, because she thinks that her husband and father are not worthy of care after their death. She drives one of the kids to find out, who does not want a baby boy because she is suffering from epilepsy. Very sad when you wanted. For a real good tear jarker, get your hands on this movie. I cried when I saw this guy even in this movie. Can not be missed.
