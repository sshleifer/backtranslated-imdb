Or at least you feel quite high after this movie. This "rolling" word can actually be applied, which is such a movie, although it is completely casual, intelligent, and openly associated with the French language. <br /> <br /> No, Catherine DNew does not spend the entire movie (sorry for a Peurean disappointment with any agenda) .. But the scene I mention involves all members of a wedding party - and it's a musical number ! However, everything fits nicely together, and an unusual, bright, colorful family (Denu's mother is a lesbian, Dennyuv's sister survived) offers alternate entertainment and disturbs us as a real family. But it's a movie that they mostly entertain. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say much about the end, but Daneev ends up marrying a 20-year-old man. It is completely credible for us to see the full development of relations with the whole time, and both are naturally attracted closer and closer together. The last one is a happy one; And the rest of the movie, like the quirky as well as the pitch-perfect as well as the rest of the movie.
