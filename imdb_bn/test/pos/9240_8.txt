I also apologize for some of the biased opinions of this effort to contribute to the soundtrack. Yet I received my copy, returned and enjoyed the rolling cast of the character, who were probably more colorful than the characters they created in the story of Sindhu Shenghai in the movie. For those who think that George Bush thinks "trustworthy Texans", this film is not needed to spread the image of Texas truck driving, one-dimensional radicals full of images. This cast contains the most intelligent, shiny and ridiculous people where you'll find anywhere where they help define each person a sigel, a budget, a guerrilla style (meaning "punk rock style", explores the story of joy, disappointment and despair). ). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary created by emotions and intensity and all the poison has to be split in the other side of any industry. And doublespeak you're dealing with (note writers, painters, musicians and co-workers take filmmakers). Due to the faithfulness of the first wave of American digital music, it is "DYY". The quality was, at a time where the courage, emotions and commitment strategies, the more mattered way to style or valuable calculations. It does not have many tricks or styles ... The documentary is very refreshing. The editing cut provides as many dialogues as this dialogue. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​making a documentary from the tragic death of cast, crew and director's initial intention is brilliant, complete Texas and absolutely punk rock. In the truest sense of the word.
