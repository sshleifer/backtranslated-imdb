Two soldiers are a fine example of making a fine film. The director and producer took a heartwarming story and made it alive with a highly skilled and dedicated cast, extraordinary cinematography, and very creative art. <br /> <br /> The brothers' taste was illustrated with the lifestyle of the woods. With great details, and with the militaristic lifestyle they were intensely reversed that they had shields. The interaction between the virus brought smiles and tears because they lived a difficult and peaceful life in the retreat of North Carolina and even made a difficult life of war. Acting was very good, especially with the big brother (played by Jonathan Fur), new brother (played by Ben Alison) and the strong influence of the colonel (played by Ron Pearlman). Performance was very good throwing. <br /> <br /> Two soldiers were delighted to enjoy the magic, and I sincerely recommend it to the listener of all ages.
