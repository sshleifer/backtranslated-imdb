Love letter is one of my favorite books, so naturally I was skeptical when I was filming. But, I like it. I found myself grinning through the whole movie. I admit that this is not a great movie but certainly a nice hour and a half. I was perfect as Capes and Scott Helen and Johnny. Just as I impressed them. And the city and the scenery were just fine as well. I recommend this photo, but do not expect too much, enjoy it.
