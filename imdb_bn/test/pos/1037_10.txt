I saw this series in PBS in the college in 1980 and still can not find it out of my head, although I have never seen it. I remember every cast member (WAS Perfect, WAS as mentioned in another comment), remember, design, light and of course, enough to keep the story set, which by itself is kept glued. Probably the best TV series I've ever seen on the "root" side.
