I have a green card in Egypt. I am in America since 1991. A common name for me is Arabic. I am married (non-American but non-Egyptian, non-Arab woman) I have children who are born in the US. I have a PhD in cell biology from the USA and I travel for the conference. I earn 6 income and my own home in Washington, DC area. There is no blame on my record outside of my taxes and 1 or 2 parking tickets since I came to this country in 1991. I can see Egypt more than the character of Abraham, but my spoken English is just as good as it is. <br /> <br> A few months ago, I was returning from the conference of the Spanish company / company Mu Munich through Germany, DC (Home). As soon as I got out of Madrid airport, a German officer saved at the Munich airport. She was waiting for me. He began to start asking me until I just told him "There is no business in my country, I'm just going through". He let me go very frustrated. It was nothing compared to what happened in Washington, Dulles Airport (which was not worse than what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie). The Customs Officer asked me a few questions about the length and purpose of my visit. Then he wrote a letter C in my custom declaration form and let me go. I picked up my checked bag and stopped at the last exit point (some Homeland Security pauses). I was sitting there for 3 hours with different people of different nationalities. I have not called the reason for my settlement. I was not allowed to use my phone or any other phone. First of all, I was asked to say the reason or I was allowed to go but suck it and wait. I asked, if I tell my wife that I am going to delay, I did not say it. When I tried to use my phone and my wife said "hello", an officer grabbed the phone from the hand and threatened to seize me. When my family is waiting, I asked about the need to call home, they said, "there is nothing for three hours, we will contact after 5 hours". When I asked to use the bathroom, there was an officer with me. This toilet was fun; I think it's a prison-style toilet that includes all the metal including a toilet seat. Finally, they called my name and gave me my passport / green card and said you can go. I asked what was the problem, they said "nothing" !! I know it was only 3 hours but I was tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids. <br /> <br /> It was great for the movie. Like most movies in Arabic and non-Arab actors who only condemn, this film was 100% correct in Arabic. I think the country is Morocco (North Africa).
