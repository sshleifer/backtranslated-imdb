"Haggard: The Movie" is well written, well guided and well-played. Laughing loudly at most moments and magical features of some great skateboarding scenes West Chester scenes, PA have been shooting nicely and the script is just funny. What I like about the movie is that instead of having another sad love story or other version of "Jacques", it takes a darker look at breakups from a different perspective. Most break-up films feature a silly woman jilted by a cheating man. Then he goes to find the right of Mr. and gets lost to say the former cheat. This movie focuses on the emotional roller-coaster of the gymed people without taking it too seriously. Ryan Dunn has done a great job and is trying to help your best friends with the left margarine and Brandon DeCamilo in this rough time, how can you take something very seriously? It is clear that Margera and Co. behind the camera are front and incredibly talented. I look forward to their future films and efforts.
