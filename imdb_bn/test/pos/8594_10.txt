I'm very fortunate enough to get the chance to watch this movie, but we can learn more about this interesting person and time. Lumumba is an extraordinary illustration, which does not fall into the ordinary Hollywood galaxy, but gives the full idea of ​​the story - yes, he showed up with his wife and children, but the principles of the story are his politics and the emerging independent Congo. The film has been brilliantly created, continuously moving along a compelling motion. I would like to see more of the other rock pickup movies as well as Eric Ibun!
