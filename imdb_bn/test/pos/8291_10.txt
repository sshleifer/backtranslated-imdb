One of my most favorite childhood films. Chipmunk adventure packs incredibly fun packs alike for young and old alike. The animations are animated and colorful and the film itself features animated features that best show any of the best songs. Who can forget the dynamic "Rock N Roll" guys / lover, exciting "Diamond Doll", and hearty "my mother"? <br /> <br /> It should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from Dessert. It's very bad they do not like them anymore. Most animated movies have taken shelter in life, strange humor, or passionate mush, forever ... without Pixar's people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
