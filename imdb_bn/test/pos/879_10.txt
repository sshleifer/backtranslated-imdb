All time an excellent thriller. Vijay excels as director and editor of Excel. The performance of Dev Ananda, Bhawanimal, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar proved to be the property of this film, whose screenplay worked in a brief description. Cinematography is associated with mystery, glamor and other story-related needs. And above all it, the music by Sachin Dev Varman is unforgettable. Kishore Kumar's "Yeh Dil Ne Hata Bachar", Asha Bhosal's "Aki Hai", "Rula Kya Snake Mera" by Lata, Lata and Rafi "Akash Ki Nachi" and "Hathan PIC Butt Main" by Lata again with his own style Revive Varman's grandfather's unique joke as the top pure musician.
