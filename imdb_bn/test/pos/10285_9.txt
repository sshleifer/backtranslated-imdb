In this period and character driven romantic tragi-comedy, we are given intertwining life insights into four Thirtysomething parisians. Venus Castle picture Max at the center A starred Romeo, he falls head on the heels for beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Inspired by his next best friend Lucien (Ã‰coffey, a small but effective performance), he has won his heart and lives happily afterwards ... ie, in the skimming, neurotic, and emotional alice (bohinger in versatile romance). Very involved in life and loves the other three. <br /> <br /> The rich plot is worn by a strange fantasy jumble and the film appears as a visual jigsaw, picture-poster's eye-candy in Paris. It's all at heart Color use, especially in Lysa's spectacular apartment (probably accounting for the title of the film), where red and yellows ignite emotions and blacksmiths. : He is really punished by the irony and circumstances for it to wear his heart and continually in his heart. In a memorable scene, our lucky lovers ('Koreographed' are confused by misunderstandings) miss a small chance to reconsider their opportunities. They are independent of each other, they travel to the same destination: in their metro, to him in taxi, in fact Tight-in-Tait Yet luck seems to have for them, and the audience is teased impressively. <br /> <br /> The performance of this film really is what really stand L'Appartement. I still do not understand why Vincent Castle is not a big star outside of France. He has the presence and diversity of abundance. Monica Bellucci (wife of Castell's real life style while writing) has recently gained fame in the Anglo-Film film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is beautiful in Divine, but then it is a gifted actress who can be seen in the classic 'Leading-Lady' style, which is very British And the American actress fired on all very easy 'subtle' methods. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie, everyone! I doubt you will be disappointed. This is a lesson to create cool, happy, fun, sad, entertaining, and artistic films.
