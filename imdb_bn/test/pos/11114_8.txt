At first glance, though, this film seems to be about the story of your parents' high school life (and many people will tell you that this movie is old) ... and I acknowledge that this was my first impression ... but really, by the heroes / heroine The 'lesson' def is learned. Not old Who does not want to be famous? And who does not want to accept my colleagues? And the gay man is not debating about gay marriage, blah, baha today? Though the film was released in the 80's, it still has highlighted the biggest issues in today's world. Although this movie has too much superstition and nudity for my taste. (Thus rating 8/10)
