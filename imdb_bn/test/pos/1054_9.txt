I just got this movie for Christmas and already added it to my favorite list. A cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie. Who can not love the child Felix or the mouth of all the food they do not have water. Unconditional points go to Sydney Greenstone and play for Alexander Yardley and to Reginald Gardner who played John Sloan, in an impossible boring fiance. Truly a gem will be seen every Christmas.
