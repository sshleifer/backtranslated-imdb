I know that even though most people do not see this movie ... 'The ideal movie from the famous singer ... this is a pink movie, a teenage film, it will be stupid ...' and stuff like ... and yes, it's .. I mean, this is a pink movie ... but, you know what? I love it. Sincerely ... this is a romantic movie ... I think every girl in this world has dreamed something like 'popster' plot ... show her favorite singer, as a person ... and even with her romance ... OK? ^^ I really enjoyed seeing it ... In addition, it's really fun ... <br /> <br /> I think the actor has done a great job ... there are many loving characters ... and, Haroon Carter ( JD) No exception ... to be honest, to see her acting in the first five minutes, I thought 'it will be terrible' ... but then she really makes me happy ... <br /> <br /> I also I would say that the music performance in this movie is superb ! I especially like that part when JD (Harun) can sing without songs (only with a guitar) very nice song ... this guy is really talented ... time will tell ... <br /> <br /> You are advised ? See it ... Do not make a superstition ;-)
