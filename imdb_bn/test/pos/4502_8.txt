I did not read the novel, which has a novel based on "The Kite Runner". My wife and daughter, who thought the movie was far less than the book, and I'm ready to talk about it. But, on yourself, the film is good - not good but good. How does the damage done by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan illustrate properly? How strong is it that the intolerant Taliban followed the regime? I would like to rate it on the first + C and C + II. The human story, the Afghan-American who returned home to save the child of his childhood player, did a good job, but this count was especially told that this book was much more credible than the movie. The most exciting part of the film, however - Kabul's thin contest and later, a mini-competition in California - can not be equal to the book. I want to digest that money.
