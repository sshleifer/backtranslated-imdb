Yes, this is not a great movie credit, but toy soldiers are a fun and entertaining film. The young Caste does a great job with both the dramatic and ridiculous tales of the story and I especially like Shane Fallen as the Derek / "Dogger". I've seen this one many times over the years, and probably it will see much more. Just do not worry too much and you like it - Enjoy!
