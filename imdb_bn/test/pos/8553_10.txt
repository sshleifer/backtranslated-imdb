This movie ... I have seen it 15 years ago and in the last years it can not remember any other name, or something else, was a man from the Roman world, who played Anthony Quinn's superb role. The impression I get from this drama will be infinite. Finally I found the name of the movie, I hope I can buy it. And honestly this movie is worth 10 Oscars. Ten times bravo I was very young when I first saw the movie. If I heard about this story, I asked my friends, but some did not know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Roman farmer. I think a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him that he was a good "seed" but in fact German was cheating on him. If you have bought a movie, you will not be rich for a few steps but if you are rich then
