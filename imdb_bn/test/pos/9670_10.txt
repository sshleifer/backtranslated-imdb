This is the greatest show ever by South Park. I love this show! It's very funny, and Peter's smile is ridiculous. You'll see this show instantly for some people who have never seen this show before. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can, then the next few episodes, such as I dream of Jesus, or try to see some of the third grade story. But I did not like any such episode. The episode is all absolutely sunny. It got a great ridicule as well. You can find many clips in the tube. You can only see if you are in a place near a computer or a TV.
