I like this picture! Fantastically original and diverse! Is there a tougher, intense, hard core and suspenseful movie which is just right (dark?) Smiling touches? You generally, overdone, ridiculous Hollywood bs Be tired. In movies, how big explosions and horror and unrealistic shooting war you can humiliate your intelligence, then this film is for you. Incredibly original and credible, and strong performance by all actors, fantastic characters that are not played in a weak character or film. Avoid Woods' film is a breath of fresh air and I appreciate its originality and effort, the feeling of a cross in the film Quantin Tarantino and Cohen's brother (not always bad mixing in my opinion). This movie captures you with throat and does not let go, there is nothing boring or bubble gum about this movie. The only disappointment is that no one will know about it, I recommend it to everyone and I recommend sharing his opinion. This film is currently a host of options / options welcomed by mainstream trash of canned hooligans made by big stars, big explosions, special effects, and huge budgets. It's a horrific wild, intense, violent, graphic, ridiculous, and raw (I mean it's a good way, there's no dirty Hollywood polish here). Thank you everyone involved in creating this image, you have done an incredible job!
