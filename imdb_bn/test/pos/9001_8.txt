Forever Strong is a kind of movie we've seen a long time ago, only in a variety of ways. However, it is said, that I really thought it was a great movie, Shan Faris is generally seen in such a feasibility that usually stars stars in stars at a big time. Apparently this movie got limited release because I was not aware of it, but I have seen it in the video store and after having enjoyed the performance of the season back in the back-down I decided to take an opportunity with it. I ended up making a great decision, I'm not a fan of ragiba, but the film is not entirely about rugby, it is a very simple plot proposal to stand in your life, challenge yourself and reach your goals. Initially, we see what happens to Rick, we do not think his face is full, and completely arrogant, we think he has sealed his fate as a troublemaker. We began to wander with good people by changing the character of his character, he started to make himself better, we know how negative his father has had in his life, it is just a great voice and the film is being used by <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > I said, watch and beautiful dancers. A great young cast, combined with some experienced experiences, has helped the film very well, it's just a nice job to avoid playing a match with a clever and effective drama. I coach. | Gary Kole | I liked the contradictory contrast between Rick and | Shan Faris | It was created to create a very interesting story, and I saw him at the same time to help in the mental and heartfelt rick. This is a truly hidden jewel which I'm really happy about. I discovered it made me think about my life and many times I want something like that. <br /> <br /> acting Shane Faris like Rick Penning is fantastic. He reminded me of a terrible tragedy of a young Tom Cruz very terrible yet a lot of the so curious and talented. It was going from a tough kidnapper to a good heartfelt young man, but Shane had a solid role to pull it off with pure perfection. He definitely keeps his heart and soul in this film, so much so that in such a great movie, Sano is such a big Kudo. Gary Cole is still excellent as a selective coach who wants to help the kids. I always considered him to be selective, he was always present which he carried in his film. Neil McDonough is pretty much like Rick's selfish nevertheless pressed Dad. For most of the film, the script leads you to believe that he is nothing more than a selfish bitter man who wants to be like Rick, but eventually you come to see him that he is out of him, I am sorry for him. Julie Warner is a good actress and she is well-hearted, yet stupid mother plays well. Penn Badgley is required to play a real flick, and the boy is not that good at that. Many times I wanted to pop her, so I must say this is a great performance. Arielle Kebbel does not have a lot of interest in love, she's okay. Nathan West plays some mysterious character, he's pretty good. Cinema Aastin was billed as the main player for the film, but he did not do anything, he did a good job with what he wanted to do. <br /> <br /> The bottom line-forever stroke is a great movie, it will definitely stop you and think about your life was much better then you thought. Do not let this one slip by you, you will not regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
