This picture is a powerful commentary on the life of North America's family life. The story is so nicely designed, it looks almost on the street, all right! If you are connected with your family and community in any way, this movie will catch you and take you to the trashy house and you will not be allowed to leave until the credit is over. <br /> <br /> Our fantastic hero, innocence in innocent circumstances, often inadvertently, leads us towards the path of sorrow, confusion and isolation. Family of the Trevis, after a terrible tragedy, each of our invitations; Parents, mothers, brothers and sisters, to share their experiences in a dynamic set situation in their own lives, which just do not give up. We enjoy all of the above and finally, in the strong performance by major players and other cast, this movie makes the movie-Gears the ultimate fame. <br /> <br /> It is usually difficult to find something special, but the screenplay of Sigri Waveer was outstanding. I would be surprised if others did not recognize it. <br /> <br /> Clearly 10.
