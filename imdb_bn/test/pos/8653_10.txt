The film is a great scene. I believe this is a movie that will be made in the world created by your favorite catalogs. Scenes are an all-perfect rescheduling of an IKA catalog they even see furniture on their TV. When they are filled in the kitchen, they can see how they look like a catalog, break another perfect image. When he is resurrected or whatever you want to say, he comes back to the harsh reality of life. When he told of his new love, he gave up his companion. It makes fun of commercial fun that you can get it all and when it is nice to get the same thing but there are some things you do not want to share. A film without children makes for a perfect ten per one.
