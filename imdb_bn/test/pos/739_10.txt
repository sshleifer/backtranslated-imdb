Although it is often not mentioned, "Basement the base in the basement" is a very interesting movie and it must be a watch value. After killing a patient in St John's Sanatorium, Stephenson follows the story of a young nurse named Charlotte Biele, a replacement. Many patients started torturing Miss Bel and his boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, does something that he is hiding ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many interesting characters in this movie that you really care about and Sympathy for Climax Time, which does not happen very often in horror films. The musical score is fantastic and the drama of "Dark Shadow", Rosie Holotik, Ria Mcadams, and Bill McGee are fantastic, this story is very playful with the end of a great twist. There is a campiosphere around this movie that has been able to capture a film that I have never seen. Many scary fans have ever seen or even heard of this movie that is really unfortunate because it can be a horrible classic. For all fans of the drive-in films of the 1970s, "The Devon in the Basement" is a must see.
