Western is one of the kind I enjoy when apparently weak, strong and unwilling to answer the challenge, finally decided that there is no other way. The film has a great moment when John Parish (Glen Ford) goes to Salon and decides to stand by gunfighter Wade Matlock. This is the type of scene that admires the audience. My opinion is a great Western fierce male, I will rank it among the best. It is great for great screen use, spectacular views of the hills. Women have an important part. Caroline (May Win) is involved with Perish, but you think she's just using her as a way to move and go east. He wants to sell what he wants to sell. Martha (Barbara Stanwick) is tired of helping her unhappy husband Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but she always does something to get bigger birds and more energy. Meanwhile, he is betraying his brother (Brian Keith). Her daughter Judith (Deeven Foster) sees everything happening but feels helpless to respond because she does not want to harm her father. Parish combines all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to fight against the Ankara farm. He warned Lee, "Do not fight me because you do not like the way of my war".
