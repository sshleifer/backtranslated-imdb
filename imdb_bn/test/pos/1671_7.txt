As far as I am concerned, opposite the silence of the film, there are two completely different things in this film that I see: 1 - Paris, France; There is no dialogue between 2 - 28 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> In fact, an American, Jules Jussen shot this image, so it is not entirely a European movie. Initially, I was disappointed after seeing the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, once that silent segment begins - the actual hust (you already know what it is), the film has been shown a lot and it has been better and better. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the best part is what happened after the hijest to the story. The best aspect of the whole film was cinematography.

Someone described her face as a cross between Humphrey Bougert and Harry Dean Stanton, and it's totally the sum of its A warning for those who expect superstition or nudity in a classic film This is France, not the United States, so here's a little bit of both. I suggest DVD subtitles or a dub version choice, thanks.
