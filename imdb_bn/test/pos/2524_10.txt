This story takes place on the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil where a small boy named Pixot becomes alone without his parents. Bored on the left and in any direction, Pixot takes refuge with a young girl on the street. The terrible thing behind closed doors is between the workers and the child's group. And a last trick that blows the place, the last event decides to stop Pixot and his friends and escape. From there begins the friendship of strong bonds, detachment of friendship, love and hatred, criminal activity and the only beach to talk about things that someone like you and I sometimes do. <br /> <br /> <br /> I think this image is perfect in many ways because it touches you on many levels, as it did with me. The style used to illustrate the pictures of Picosot and its surroundings seems more realistic and the condition of humanity seems more natural in this situation, as the actor, who is really the street children and live the same way. It is also a social comment on child abuse, but I think the film is so big that the story is not under pressure in the political scene. The last scene, which I found the best piece from the film, hit me because I did not see anything that I had seen before. So passionate and yet unsatisfactory, this film makes a real, credible, intolerable, unforgettable story-story. A truly heartfelt masterpiece which is so undervalued! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
