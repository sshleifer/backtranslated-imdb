I'm not sure where I started with this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. After reading the novel, I was aware that being a movie is a difficult story. The film has a number of interesting lines (mainly in Alfred and Ashencheck) but it does not represent the industry's debate in the form of novels. <br /> <br /> For one thing, I was expecting an old Aschenbe and small tadio. In the book, Tadio Fourteen, but he has described it as pure, ideal, innocent, in the movies where he is resuscitating sex and a lively. She is a co-ordinator of Aschenbach, she always looks around her, almost provokingly. In the book, Aschench who stole the boy's attention. As Aschenbach, I imagine something near the Blue Angel (based on the story of Thomas Man's brother Henrique), some of the gray-haired blacks about this forty-year-old man. In all equality, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but someone else should have it that others should, or he should have looked older in the beginning. <br /> <br /> I know that the story of homosexuality is important, but the film reduces the talk of art and duality between Apollonian and Dionysius's inspirations and instead focuses on the emotion of Tajzio in Aschen and it just does not justify it. I used to use Mahelar's song, because in the end he inspired Man to write his stories. I'm not sure that a singer Asencheck was specially made a good step. Or the creation of Alfred which I do not remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing I really did not match with the word and the actors' lip. I thought it was dwarf because I hope it will be Italian. But I think that I saw that every Italian movie has this problem. It only bothers me because this director (Felinita is another person I'm thinking of) imitates perfection in Italian movies and here their characters are smiling without sound, then you hear a word that is not related to their face (when I think of the scene Ashenche almost collapses and starts to laugh. This scene may be strong / it may be annoying L).
