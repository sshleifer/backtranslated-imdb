Stalinager is a horror film, well-played and directed, but rather in the way of various evil aspects of war and its politics, in the world below its view. It is one of the best films "Das Boot" (together with Finnish "Vintrridge" ("Winter War", in English, I believe) together). The war criminals of some German soldiers in this war --- and died - during the Second World War Stalinager was around and almost died. No big time hero, no emotional obscurity, but only on every day of war, fear of death The mood of the movie is similar to "slave boots", and it can give you some instructions on what to expect. So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywood, war movies: rent it, buy it, make sure you see it! Finally, a film by Buffett: For some information from previous critics, I do not want to add only "Stalingrad" which is not run by Wolfgang Petersen (who has created "Dash Boots")!
