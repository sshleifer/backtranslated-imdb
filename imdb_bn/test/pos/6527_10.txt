This year I have seen this first American movie and I think it will feel the greatest one for reasons. As a teenage singer in America, Harun is not as pop-popped, I've met with most Americans that his song was fake and he did not even know how to rap. But attention, everyone, he is a child, how many people can understand him. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is even more difficult. I think this time Aaron (JD) showed us something real. And I think people will learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I like the music very much in the film. Remember that the first song "Saturday Night" was shown in this movie and some of it included Haroon's real live show and the second one is "One Better", so I If you enjoy this picture, think, you will also be a pop fan. Finally, I hope you have a great time ^^ A voice from a Chinese boy.
