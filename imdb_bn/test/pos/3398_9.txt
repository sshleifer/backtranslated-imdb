This comment is related to the "North and South Book I" 1842-1861 period "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> America's 19th century history was mainly civil war (1861-1865). ) Was identified by humans, it was a reasonable opinion because it was the civil war that kept the union under serious test; it was a civil war, which Americans knew how valuable they were to live in peace! Finally, this period that is shameful of slavery The system was finished. <br /> <br /> People were adapted to the screen during the motion of the motion picture. DW Griffith was born a nation born in the early 1900's. However, the most famous film in the North-South Clash is still in my mind Either, The Win Win Wand (1938). Unfortunately, very few people based on John Jackson's novel "North and South" novels say it ever made. The best TV series and it's really worth spending while watching. I taped it in my video from Polish TV many years ago and after that I have come back to joy many times. <br /> <br /> First, the whole story is deeply rooted in the historical reality. Was born South Carolina and Pennsylvania, two families of losses, represent two lives in two different ways of life. Nevertheless, friendships combine them. Nevertheless, what they mean is that all the people who struggle: Friendships Affected by "Truth" of "Political Correction", "Hate of Legal Husbands", "The Power of Social Heroes", Love Affected by Humility. My favorite character is Ory Mine (Patrick Soze) - anyone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of him; Anyone care for friends but political fanatics step on the path and destroy a lot. Finally, he is a person who can see a sad future for his country but he can not do anything about the illogical fate of the South. His friend, George Hazard, is very similar in most cases but sometimes he seems to have a strong character. The array shows that even though there is a tragedy, he will be frustrated and the life will be the most valuable thing from us. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendships can be stronger than any discrimination, politics or conflict. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also specially developed. There are fame like Justin Lamotte or Salim Jones who are really wicked. But the nature of humanity is always impossible. Charles Maine first had a tendency to fight the rebellion, but later he learned to be from the real Southern gentleman, for which the South Pride is not a brave word but the boldest thing to do. Virgilia Hezard attempts to condemn slavery, represents the maximum fanatical aspects of the cleansing movement and the punishment of "black breeding farm" owners. His marriage to Gradia seems to be a symbol of equality but the symbol of "no" in southern politics. Arya's sister, Bret and Ashton - are two interesting characters in the two hobbies that have full opposite blood in the body. Brett, trust in his humility but naiveness, absolute fidelity She married Billie, though she is a descendant, because she really loves him. Brett has made any young woman valuable. Ashton, though, is not a vamp, a tiger, a woman who is hesitant to do the most wicked thing. Their world-wide views have a clear picture about them and their family ... unforgettable moments and how public! Most of the letters are worth their price ... Yet, the war broke and they must be kept far away ... <br /> <br /> Second, the performance ... Someone says that all people do not normally work. I would not say that. I'd rather say that all Castes work very well with guests portrayed by small staffs from their main parts, which are available to guests including Leigh Taylor, Robert Mitchell and others with famous stars. Patrick Swayze does a great job as an array. I consider this role one of her best. Lesley Ann Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. His part, perhaps, suffers much pain but he really drives all such feelings to really reveal. Carlisle Eli is very ruthless and truly memorable as desolation Virgilia Hazard Philip Casnoff considered horrific aspiring Elkanah Bent as well as a giant husband as David Carradine, Justin LaMotte condemned. And, on the contrary, a reference to Gene Simmons must be done that is really nice as Ariy's mother, whose heart hits for the honor of family life and harmony. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the memorable moments of "north and south" leave an unfinished trace in one's mind. Who can forget at the first meeting of Ory and Madeleine - this elegance, this scene is humble! Or can Medelin's father die if he dies? I found it really strong, at this moment there is a real drama, a drama of a woman who truly loves him. I like the crisp sequence and George Hazard is worried about his beloved friend, Ariy's life. Then his meeting with Constance was horrible. Virgilia's lecture in Philadelphia is a great part of performance. And the final part of the first part: Although the north and the south may differ, their friendships will never die. Arri and George symbolically join hands as the train is moving. Just here, there are many beautiful and strong scenes in which it is impossible to mention even half of them. And this fantastic tune and bright landscapes by Bill Conte. The song "north and south" is very sensitive and memorable. <br /> <br /> <br /> What's the last thing to do? The real TV series in the "North and South" DVD is about the victory of all the precious things in us: love, friendship, loyalty, respect, honesty, complete fidelity. 9/10
