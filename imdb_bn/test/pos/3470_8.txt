Wonderfully effective British drama, two different people who find common ground, and especially a "flower" among them. With Duchenes MD, the young man (MacAye) is tying an unprotected, "Spike" in a house for the disabled and quickly shares a young man (Robertson) with a sevral village. Robertson never knows anything outside the house, but there is MacAye and he is firm and determined to return to the real world. Together, they come in on this funny and heartwarming and physical shortcomings. Internal power is often an impressive story that operates to do the job. Two leads are terrible, especially Robertson, who must have spent some time studying inactive to close this clever role of course. He appears in almost every scene, and works an absolute storm. Anyone who does not know, maybe he thinks he really is Cebi. Highly recommended.
