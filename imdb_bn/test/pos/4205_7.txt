Early films of Dead and Kid (all before they were named "Bauwari Boys") were all the entertainment and well-produced films of Warner Brothers. Rather, despite their beginnings, they were still excellent writing, acting and keeping up with time. Despite the presence of Hunt's Hall and Leo Georgi, do not confuse these pictures with the cheap bounty boys movies of the montage film. There were a few numbers below the previous films about these pictures quality. <br /> <br /> Hard people won the Lightweight boxing championship with John Garfield. Unfortunately, soon after that he took drunk seeds and was responsible for a murder that he did not really do. The problem is that he loaded so much that he was not sure that he would not kill the person, so he would go away and live a life. Finally, he joins Memo Robson and Dead and Kids - as well as a woman you know will be given time to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the picture is not surprising, but due to the quality of the film it does not seem to matter. Garfield and Kids are the best of them and it's a movie, sure to please most of the viewers but all of them.
