I do not usually comment on IMDB movies, but in this case I think I should I love the movie, and I want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of making fine movies. <br /> <br /> It is one of the few movies seen on the small screen (originally seen in the air) AMC, I believe, and then I just saw it in the DVD) that I feel in my stomach pole. The little glove sensation that the director would expect you to experience while watching his thriller. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemon's performance is good, and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas follow. I felt so sympathetic to Lemon, whose character Jack Goudle, only wanted to hear his warning. <br /> <br /> But there is a lack of score affecting me most about this movie, and it also makes me look good. In addition to the opening title there is no background music to increase the tension, as it is not needed. And when the credit is run, black in the black, it points point in silence. <br /> <br /> I use the movie as an example that makes the music movie. I think movies should be made in movies and music should only increase that. But China's syndrome is not necessary for the reality of music and the urgency described here. Characters show a much better picture than this song. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, it is my favorite. If you like movies, you will not be disappointed. If you like the movie soundtracks more then you can not go to it.
