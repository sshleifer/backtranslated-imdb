Look ... I have come to expect this level of acting from William Messi ... the guy just kept in awesome performance ... but Matt LOAF? When his decision to leave at least Jim Stimman in his asthma in Steamislavsky's wonderful world, when does his laughs decide? Well what can I say? I am impressed properly. Paraphrase an old habit: "It is not meat, it's emotion" ... and Loaf is quietly delayed buffing up his acting chops. <br /> <br /> Carrying off the look of Laura Dern 40 perfectly here ... Costume and hair work great by category ... David Pemma's typist but right money. Solid camera work across the flick. Plot line commemorates the "Gentlemen's Agreement" (antithetical after World War II). Good for your time ... especially for the growing legions of Bill Messi's aquilites. <br /> <br />
