I love horror films, but they seem to work better if they hide behind the dramatic impact (for example, The Devils Backbone, The Exorcist). This is such a movie, and it is not only strange and awesome that it should be, it's also really nice. A story of two sisters really starts slowly, so if you are quick to see Bhoot in the first 20 minutes, then you will be disappointed. Actually this is not a ghost story? Although there are some. This is something more complicated, and it has been done in such a way that it is disturbed by any sweat from the ring and ring. A story ?? This is more tranquil film than huge cultural hits, because it really thinks for its characters and the side is faultless. Every detail of this movie gives you the opportunity to focus on the details of showing a movie, but if you are such a person, you will be given up breathing. Acting is fantastic, especially from stepmother and main girl. The value of those two ticket prices is valuable. See yourself a benefit and watch this awesome movie.
