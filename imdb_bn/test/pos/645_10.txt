I think this movie was a lot of heart and love for Alan Bergstein was the work of love. Early actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Bels, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart, and Leslie Carn) were very well-elected and their portions performed with superiority. It was a very uploading movie that I was available on tape or DVD. A rare jewel
