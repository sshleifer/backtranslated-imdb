Since the great success of Nick Park and Armman team with Wallace and Groot short animations, we now love plastic characters so much with many (hopefully many) features. The movie DVD has long proved to be the most sustainable and best use of my two children's Christmas gifts. The film's plot is easy, but for me, the beauty of the W & G films is Background Gaga. There are plenty of front gags and slopsticks to enjoy for kids and adults, but the background is a killer for me. Nick Park is already an enthusiastic addition to a great film for Italy and I would recommend fans and new viewers to watch this movie .... often.
