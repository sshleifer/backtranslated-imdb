I enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was landed by sound recording / mixing. For any reason, they have to do a terrible thing called ADR, where the actor replaces the original position with the re-recording it in a sound booth. <br /> <br /> The reasons for this are usually due to location problems or because somebody is lost somewhere in the sound production chain. <br /> <br /> If ADR works well then it will not be so bad, but sometimes it is simply confusing. The problem that this is not just ADR - the word mix simply does not match the performance and quality of the images. <br /> <br /> I wanted to know what went wrong.
