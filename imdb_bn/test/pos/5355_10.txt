I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go with the school and I refused to go with my parents. Looked at the trailer and looked like a fool. My friends one day wanted to take me to the movie and she loved me two, "Hazar's Dukes" or "Wallace and Gromit: The the V-Rebett of Curse". It took 17 minutes to decide. Time was running out. I had to choose. In some of the tickets, it came to the "little" screen. Until the time we had to line up and get our tickets, only we could go in. I just wanted to see Nicholas see it. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and very Moody and frustrated that I went to see this childhood. I went, the only seat in which the movie was found and ready! Of course I'm sitting in the universe! It was wonderful. I do not know what I was complaining about. Clay animation is the best of my life that I have ever seen. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit to crash and crush a carnival planned for nearly 500 years. Originally anti pest control vegetables competing in the competition. Anti Pesto, known as Wallace and Groome, is trying to keep all the rabbits away from carnival. I will not say again. It's just too good to say. I would admit that the whole idea of ​​Vera-Robite is still incredible and non-childhood, but Nick Park adds its substance that it loves every one. I mean, loose 10 pounds will not be a rabbit, and of course, "legs of dogs" will not be broken 8 legs. Then again, Rabbits and Were Wolves are not real animals. But both ways, it works very well. <br /> <br /> Jokes got bigger. Kids will not find anything joke. It goes the way above their heads. There was a lot of British joke. If you love British humor, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I like cast and voices. Everything about the movie is so incredibly good. Direction and pacing was absolutely ... terrible! I recommend to old Wallace and Gramme Shorts fans (and no, I have not seen them yet), and I recommend it to fans who like "Shake" and "Shake 2" and most importantly, I recommend to the people who are kle animation Love Good film cracking!
