Fantastic, expressive, ridiculous! Americans make 'janie', but brites are 'malicious' - and they like to have fun by themselves (eg: unwanted teeth, big lips / nose, 'vendi' general or 'vendi' snibi, 'gahden'). Inside the pair for the old people in the audience, many actions for kiddies Delicate use of devices from other classic movies (see 'Back to the Future', 'Indiana Jones ..', 'Harvey', 'Tremors' and more). Also, a Nifty 'friend' movie (Gromit is a cool, but passionate sidekick). Bonham-Carter and Fiennes add great vocabulary work (it's true? Is this the best performing animation of the day?) - Enjoy! I saw it with Grandkids. Fun time for all. - Canuckteach
