A very interesting documentary - certainly Sideways, much more than an incognito Wino drama - where all the temptation of capitalist conspiracy is revealed. According to the documentary - and confirmed by a recent publication about Parker's biography - only two men indicate the nature of wine worldwide: Robert Parker of Massachusetts and French-based alcohol expert Michael Rowland and also known as a "flying winemaker". The director is quite clever to interview interviews of big artists like Mundu's family, from the Cincinnati to Argentina, to interview the local wine producer in various regions of France and to make Mandaris family world-wide for marketing and marketing. Anyone interested in the direction of the art dark will see. After watching this well-made documentary drinking a good glass, the same political and commercial work will not be done.
