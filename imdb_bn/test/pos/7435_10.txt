I really love this movie !!! I did not play Final Fantasy VII, but I still like the movie, it's really fun and I love voice-over actors. The visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are working very well. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there is a beautiful imagination so I can fill the most gaps present in the movie, and I am suggesting to you to double it because lots of "sudden" sense is created. Also, (this is pretty funny) you should see it with its subtitles because they say and how subscribe is completely different. It really is quite funny but sometimes it helps you understand what you say well. <br /> <br /> See it !!! Love marney
