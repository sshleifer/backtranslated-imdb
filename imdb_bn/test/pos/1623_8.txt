So the first thing is the first .. <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons are much better and very different movies than Da-Vinci codes. <br /> <br /> Recently followed a lot of comic book movies, suspicious resuscitation of remixes and adult franchises. It is refreshing to see a very strong and entertaining movie, which is not like the Shaky Cam filming technique, the lens flare, the excessive GCI and the above verb sequence. In this case, the Angels and Demons are almost old-fashioned, giving a good and controversial debate over the old age of science age, which gives parallel insight into God's beautiful grand house in Rome and the modern science temple. The CERN's Large Harron Clad <br /> <br /> Hans Hans pretends to be a smart person, and Da-Vinci often fits better than its wooden performance. Good support is offered by a rock solid shield, with a special highlight of the stoic cardinal of Armin Mueller-Stahl. But the film's main savings Rahmat it's motion. I was totally mad in the story for the entire running time and the film did not give me time to sit and dropped the logic flaws. <br /> <br /> My only critical criticism is to show some of the best controversial real world authenticity of science. But this is not the fault of the filmmakers, but the old expression of observation that you will never let the truth go on the path of truth story. <br /> <br /> The story of which is a cracker, a race against the combination of courage and good holes of intelligence and an excellent package or two as well as time. <br /> <br /> Overall I am a national Treasure Movie (which is no this definitely mm but with a more serious vibe) and fans of generally ripping adventure stories.
