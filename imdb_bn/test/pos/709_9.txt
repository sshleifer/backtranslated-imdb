A film that deserves release to theater. To produce this, the television movie is a cinematic monster that depicts Michael Man's strategy and consolidates contemporary music into strong visual images. Always with Mr. quality, often influenced by music, if invisible academy-award winning actors are involved in cast, writers, directors and film-makers. <br /> <br /> Definitely my favorite one. Although nothing is perfect, the film is very close. <br /> <br />, with an excellent script, superb direction and Richard Strauss' acting skills, their best-known character is one of the greatest stars: Roger Mosley; Brian Denhey; Ed Looter; Jaffrey Lewis; Richard Mole; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Gilliam; Ji-T≈ç Kumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You can not recognize names, but you can recognize each face. <br /> <br /> If it comes to TV, then sit down with a popcorn, pick a word for an amazing soundtrack and score and ready to riveted for it. 97 minutes of photo I highly recommend recording it, since it is only available to VHS and DVDs from Holland and DVD region 2 is encoded.
