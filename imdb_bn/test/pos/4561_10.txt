The satirical and ridiculous rescue scene helps in one of my favorites in the 14-film series. Wonderful acting, great cast. And there are some notable information about Shane Beyonce's career in this movie. He and Alice Cr√®ge, who had read the horse from the horse, were not script, but it went on later as they both followed the right way to play it later. <br /> <br /> It's a good follow-up to finish the enemy of Sharpe.
