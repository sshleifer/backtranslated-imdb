During the Second World War, I was hesitant to catch a grandmother and to send to Chiang, while showing me the first screen on TV. When my grandfather was in prison, he kept a diary and when he died there his companions bought it and I was lucky enough to read and thought that what Changi was really about, at least some idea of ​​him. <<br> <br /> A fantastic description of what happened to the poor blocks sent to Changi Jail and shows how much trouble and cruelty they have seen to protect their country. It is a horror story of friendship, commitment and the Australian spirit, that attitude will not give up. It is valuable to see if you want to do something with Australian history or World War II. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this minute and gave 10 out of 10.
