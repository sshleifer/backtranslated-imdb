The way many Christian movies are centered around the fear of justice, and consequently it becomes chascie and unwittingly. "Second surveillance" gets it right. It is a near perfect missionary tool; This is why the real reason why so many young people do not want to do anything with Christianity. It assures the viewer that one has to give up their sin - they are not funny - there must be success in the life of a Christian. "Second Surveillance" also acts as a piece of filmmaking. The filmmakers were probably working in a very low budget, but they could write a dynamic script enough to disassociate the audience's attention from this clear truth. This image brought me to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and thanks to thanking Christian Stations everywhere, it must have affected more people than me.
