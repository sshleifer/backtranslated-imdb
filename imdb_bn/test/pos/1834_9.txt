I have many positive reviews that do not require my opinions to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel I need to express my appreciation for this unique movie. Bunny Hunt has proved that he is not only an exceptional actress but also a great director and script writer. This movie has everything and is full of humanity, softness, humorism ... do not miss it, and do not wait. And, do not pay any attention to poor reviews. Some observers forget that such films should be seen by your heart, not just your eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or you get mail, then they are wrong. For me, come back to me a real jewel, an unforgettable film.
