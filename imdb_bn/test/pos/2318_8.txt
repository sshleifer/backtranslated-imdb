I liked this movie very much. I've probably seen it dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old navy, I am still excited by the warm presentation of the anchors! I love the "McHales Navy" pirate atmosphere too. I could work without the female dive officer but I guess I just old fashioned. He was still good to look lol, espially after completing the crew with his laundry. Cooking, Sonaraman, and Electrician made movies. Sweet old engineer and loved his first-class Poeke. And Gramer actually did a commendable job of being a Misfit Officer. When I pass the golf course on the port, I like the "Driving scene." Pure Navy! And I swear that I had an XO that was a little bit like a jazz ... I am very happy that it is very happy about bloody time in the DVD. : 0)
