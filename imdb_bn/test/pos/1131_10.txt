I must say that the show is really ridiculous and stupid in the Greek. As I am part of a sorority, I do not want to see their Greek organizations bad. <br /> <br /> But I think Greek ridiculous. Yes, they have Stroototype and Brotherhood but it is not fun but only cute humor. <br /> <br /> All the characters Rebecca Logan (I just can not stand on her behalf) are less favorable, KC and Rusty have brothers and sisters as well as chemistry. Then there's the capi. Like Capi Haha, she does not love a man, and his character gets so much to mourn. Partner with the Rusty Room, Clark Clark Duke plays Dale, Sunny <br /> <br /> It is very fun to see it so safe in season. 2. I can not wait until I return !!
