I only saw a few episodes of "eleven hours" episode, but I must say that they are enough to affect me. This series is so impressive and interesting ... I'm definitely going to follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that the acting is at the top. Patrick Stewart manages his character - Ian Scientist - Trustworthy and quietly, and he believes in the character of the audience. Other letters like Rheela are also believable, and, although they are sometimes cool - on the way to securing the series - they are interesting <br /> <br /> The stories told by this series are also interesting For example, I saw that one of the episodes was about cloning, and a man who was trying to clone people. How the episode was developed, and how Ian - Stewart - followed the reminder and saving people was amazing. In addition, it also thinks about ethics and how good or bad it can be. <br /> <br /> However, I think this is a good TV show. I just hope it continues to be good - interesting, thought-provoking and good acting. Although it is pictured on a cold route - small lightning, cold photography, many close-ups - it does not stop being interesting. Very recommendable.
