After seeing Angmern Bergman's scamman, I had a lot of feelings, but most notably, I feel unhappy. I have heard so much of this movie, but I have come to find it lacking. Do not make me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but to depth and emotion, I was not so impressed. I found the letters to be disrespectful and unrealistic, which prevented from dramatic effects. In addition, the fact that the war was fake was the realization that emotions were not real. Dramatic war movies, my opinion, if events (if not necessarily the story itself) really happened then more effective. I have found movies that try to show cruelty, as far as possible in the middle.
