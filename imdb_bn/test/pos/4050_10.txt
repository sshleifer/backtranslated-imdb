When I started watching 3 episodes of the series on the Action Channel, I saw all the shows published by ADV that I have shown, it is one of the best shots of all time. I had to see it again, and when I got my chance. I bought the best box set for this series for the best of my 20th birthday. And I could enjoy it and see the episodes that I missed on the Action Channel and the same 3 episodes that I saw. This show is my favorite character: Silvia, Leon, and Nigel. Animation of this series was the best, and hard suits were cool. But there is a great voice cast in the show: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Atten, and Hillary Hagg, and more. So if you like this show on the Action Channel, you have to be the owner of it in DVD. This is the best, and you can see what you understand.
