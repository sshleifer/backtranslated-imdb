Of course not a great show, but at the moment is better than other other sitcoms. It reminds me of a series of marriages for children and Rosanna, because they traditionally move to a place that does not work in sitcoms. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is one of the few shows where the characters soliloquy (Sorry for the bad spell) is actually effective and fun. <br /> <br /> Is it a Family All or Seinfeld type show? Not at all. However, it is better than 'Til Dit' (probably the worst TV show of any type at this moment). <br /> <br /> Oh and mom do not feel very bad and Hilary's character is a little hottie.
