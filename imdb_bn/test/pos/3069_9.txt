This is probably the list of my top 5 list which I have ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thistle, but this movie was very different! It makes Robin Hood fun, and was lovely! I was very happy about how well I was put together, and how good it is! Alongside the house, Mrs. Doughfire and Houseguest, the most interesting step I've ever seen! I especially love the song; "We're Men in Titles!" If you have a good sense of humor you will love this movie!
