Captain and Tennil published a very good 3 DVD package with short edit. Unlike most different shows, these shows have not been hacked. Musical and dance numbers are included with skating, as was the first broadcast time. I suspect that some musical numbers have been edited in DVDs which are not actually shown, but unable to verify the suspicion. I noticed some inconsistencies between DVDs and program information found on the net. I was unable to verify whether the net information was incorrect or if the musical performances were edited in the DVDs on the DVD. Whatever the truth, I am very grateful to the efforts by the production company. I will show the same respect for the different display show formats released. I would guess half the broadcast broadcasts included. I believe that they run into rights issues in programs that are not included. Hopefully those issues can be resolved and in the future a volume 2 may be released sometime. Additional music includes a few different music videos, including a dance rehearsal. I recommend this DVD to any C and T fan.
