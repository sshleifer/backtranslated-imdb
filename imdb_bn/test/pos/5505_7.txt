A sick person carries a tin chat line like Carlton Hendrix (De Snyder), Captain Howyi. She poses as a teenager boy and invited him to the other party in his home party. He instead knocks them out, paints them, sews them off and their torture (mostly with the needles). He captured the copie daughter of Mike Gaze (Kevin Gaze). He found her, arrested her and made her institutionalized. Four years later he was released ... complete healing. But a lynch mop (led, amusingly, by Robert Englund) attacked him and leaked him. He did not die but he is back to snap and Captain Howdy ... <br /> <br /> is a very sick, boring, rolled horror film. Captain Howdy suffers pain and torture and is trying to show the children how to enjoy it. The torture scene is not clear (you hear more than you are), but what you see is very sick. There is no comedy there and the shouting of its victims (silently) is very real. I was mostly cringing away from the TV during the scene. <br /> <br /> The acting is different. Kevin Gaze is not as good as the police - he is not terrible but he could have been better. D Schneider is very scary like Captain Howy - his attack scene is not nice. <br /> <br /> Not everyone, your ideal horror pictures. I probably will not see it again (this film really gets under your skin) but I recommend it to all the awesome fans - with at least strong stomas. I give it a 7.
