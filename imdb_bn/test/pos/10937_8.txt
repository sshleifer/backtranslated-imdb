This splicing of SEARCHERS is one of the weird films I've ever seen, pictured by a weird, unfamiliar Mexico, a Briton. It can often be said that the best films about America are made by foreigners, who may be familiar with an outsider's eye. But this crackpot film is anything else. Although civil war is set in America, it is not an American that is recognized from myths, movies, TVs etc. The film is often in an airy fantasy wind, when it deals with western myths. <br /> <br /> Director Harvey uses the title horse as a focus for interconnection stories, related to the traditional Western conflicts of all primitive and civilization. Looks like the former has the upper hand. Scrub wide of the landscape of the film and seasoned, breaking for the perception of the mind in the desert. The only short site of civilization is a pillar of missionaries and landowners, and their Hassidas, which both civilized civilization have become civilized. <br /> <br /> The original story consists of three stories. One, a vain frustrating, Pike, lost his trading partner, due to his grace and speed, the so-called Eagle Wing, steals a miraculous horse. Secondly, the owner of this horse, an Indian, White Bull, a stagecake pedestrian, and one of his female residents kidnapped. Third, the Spanish men sent him to ignore this quest for a murderer, plunder spine. <br /> <br /> Though the revisionist is Western, Indians have medical problems. Contrary to the pike, its character is never explained, always unknown, without denying a voice, without a great impersonation of the song. When he is no other strange, he is a symbol, whose role is not fully functioned - at one stage a barbaric barbarian, on the other, he expresses nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But Pike thinks that primitivism before the film civilization will exist at the time. In many ways, this film is a space odesi like 2001, especially its opening sequence. The power of the film is located in the connection between three different characters, which forces us to see mythological struggles and searches in different discussions. Indian culture and Catholicism are associated with superstitions, ceremonies, greed and murder. Pike and White Bull are both musical and alcoholic. Both the White Bull have demolished Pike and the abducted as 'Bastard', unexpectedly unnecessarily publishing the strategy of the illegals used by the colonies of the fathers, which are becoming themselves 'necessary' fathers. <br /> <br /> Concerned about a traditional western, history, civilization and progress, this image is a double detective story, past, track, and finally interrogation. <br /> <br /> What does this extraordinary uniqueness of the film think, though, despite the fact that apart from Maltin, apartheid, her British is British. The climatic stand-off is more like that of Earthy. The film is boldly spreading dialogue in most cases, creating visual and ureter tapestry misses Malick in Thailand's Red Line and some Hualien Director dares. Existing double and queen motifs are more European myths than Americans (similar to other British Harley-Kettle films, the Deliistists). <br /> <br /> Use the most wonderful nature. Most Western countries use landscape as an amazing inspirational backdrop: there is little idea that the West has a living reality. In many ways, igela wing like a movie presabargara Powell and nature living in his own right, dangerous, hostile, beautiful, strong, authoritarian character. একটি ক্যানটারবারি ট্যালির স্মরণীয় দৃশ্যটি দেখা যায়, যখন গাছগুলিতে হোয়াইট বুল দ্বারা ফাঁদ হিসাবে রাখা গহনা হঠাৎ বাতাসে উড়ে যায়: একটি হান্টিং, টিংলিং, জাদুকরী, রোমাঞ্চকর প্রভাব একটি ঘোড়ার চেয়ে আরব রাতের বেশি স্মরণীয় প্রভাব রয়েছে অপেরা। Heartstopping
