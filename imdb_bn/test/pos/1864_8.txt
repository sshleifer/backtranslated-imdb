How nice! Fantastic film in my opinion, I did not expect it to be good! I became Captain from the beginning to the end - it was a very well made and educational film that really gave an interesting insight into our judgment, Darwin had to write his own life in order to reveal his ideas to the world. Species "; so to fight both personal demons and as well as the unconscious society, he strives harder with his mind, body and soul because personal matters are cut off and even his family seems to move away ... though the rest of the world stands against him Because he knows that his results are in fact his foundation, life, culture and meaning of existence. (This is not an exaggerated extravaganza by any traditional Hollywood method, it has created a BBC British film) but gratefully meaningfully very strong and it's amazingly well-preserved scenes as well as Betani.Connelly works as a light supporting role but I enjoy it in She always expected as well, her loyalty as well as her husband N was strong and respectful, you could feel the husband in connection, and their real life / wife bond definitely shines through their performances. But the ceremony star certainly beetani and he has done a wonderful job, a very tactful performance - I have his own disappointments and his crazed As with "madness" coming to try to understand it, both of them are burdened and sympathetic Law was. What it really means and what it means is contrary to its meaning and its thoughts are contrary to its feelings and try to defeat it with its wife, which is certainly a firm believer in religion and a strict Christian when he was in the state of science, the world which can not be seen with eyes , So their relationship was risky too. However - really very good, well-played mental drama and I'm brave that, I had a tear torn during a sad episode which was really impressive and also beautifully moving and moving. The film is symbolic and very intelligent artistic as well, I can not really wait to see it again because there was so much of what I missed for the first time. One of the best movies I've easily seen this year is one.
