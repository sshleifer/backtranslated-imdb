Like the very oldest films, this "film" is very small, very short - lasting one minute! So, due to her graduation, it is not really possible to compare it to more modern movies. But, for that time it's actually an extraordinary movie. Most of it was printed by hands - making an anabella red and other colors, it's like its amazing dancing. I actually saw two different versions - one where he changed the color across the red and the other where he was around. I think the red in red described in the DVD "The Great Train Robbery and Other Elementary Work" is among the best among them. The dance itself is very mesmerizing and amazing performance like a piece of art. And, in contrast to one minute (or less) of the day, I can see this one more often - it's just that funny and weird. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch it online, a 36 second version of Google Video (type "snake dance").
