Like the first Lumiar films, it was made the same year, it was even more dramatic than the brothers trying to do until next year's 'Niagara'. The surviving print is very rough, but it only connects Turner's with visual violence, because it's a huge expansion of water dashes and cameras, ready to decorate the viewer against a strong hay. <br /> <br /> If you see this first shorts in the sequential order, and try to enter the mentality of the time, there is one more shock, in contrast to Lumiare's single frame set-up, this movie has an edit which is a rate for me, Slashing as razor blade of 'Un Chien Andolu'). <br /> <br /> Unlike the mind-bent of the Lumierers films, Paul has liberated viewers from many perspectives, the power of nature, Lumieres could not eluding his perception of a way. The second shot has the same characteristics as Niagara, but it is less dangerous, because we are in danger of performing. In the film 'El Orosur Auros' or 'Replus du Bebe', nature has been overwhelming and powerful by the camera. Basic film grammar ended his greatest achievement.
