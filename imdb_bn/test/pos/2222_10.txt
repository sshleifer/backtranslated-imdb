In the early 1970's, one of the fun movies I've ever seen in the theater, and sadly, it's only on TV several times. This movie should be released in the video. It is best as vendors to administer its sleaziest, slimiest hospital. Great cast, great movie. If anyone has a good VHS copy, I love to buy it.
