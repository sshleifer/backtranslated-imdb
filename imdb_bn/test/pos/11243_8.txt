Of course, there seems to be only 17 minutes of actual content in each episode but it's fun to watch. You can cringe on your chair because the friend takes his stick on his feet and shoots him, or shines and moves his head while some ridiculous lines actually work. The host panel is less well-suited, friendly (I'm brave about Canadians) than the cutlot US reality program. I think those who complain about this show do not get jokes. The show is taking more importance than taking itself. Vip Keys are a great compliment to the reality show, sports TV culture and club scene. I hope they will make another season, and I would like to see if a US version appears. It's a fun, original premises.
