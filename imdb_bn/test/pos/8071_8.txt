Some would argue that the practice of la antenna achanna discrimination of Argentine director Eestaben sapi is practiced. That is, when silent films were offered to Sapir, they were on the cutting edge of the film when they were made, they are unpredictable today, la antenna has exceeded a meaningless curiosity. <br /> <br /> I will disagree. Fervently La Antenna compiled the silent film conventions with the technology of 21st Century, making it the ultimate practice to create modern films. The movie "Cityless Voices", the so-called citizens comment on Mr Television, painted her hair, called a dictator / media mogul foolish. This image was probably known as Semitic Metropolis (1927) of Fritz Lang, perhaps 100 years ago. It has all the evolutionary galaxies, TV aerials and animated billboards. <br /> <br /> The citizens of the city are the only person with the gift of speech, La Vaz (The Voice). Her face is covered with a hood forever (even when she is naked), La Vaz is forced to sing the TV Television Network. But when Mr. When the TV plans to steal the written word, La Vaz and his miraculous son join forces with a rebel family in an attempt to bring freedom to the public. <br /> <br /> La Antena is nothing but pure movie. Confused by the silent photo conferencing, Safir needs to rely on his story to tell his story. There are sounds, most notably Leo Suzushkiv almost constantly scores. It introduces the best of uninterrupted movie songs, as well as works itself in the film's Disease, such as car horn seeds, or gunwoman's Rothic Ra-tat-That-Thaat. And, a familiar winding in the whole movie, as if it was shown to an ancient projector. There is also a fair dialogue with <br /> <br />. But instead of using the intertitles, the letters of the capitals are in the frame. They are large or small, depending on what is being said, filling in the screen or moving in the air humblely. Remember the more fantastic version of the subtitles at Night Watch (2004). <br /> <br /> Thank you, words are not confused with images. Really very fortunate, because La Antenna has captured several creative and original images, which we have seen for a long time, captured by the green and black photography of the crested quetta. There are evocative cityscapes. Hooded singer and his blind boy. There is a deserted aircraft in the city, which seems like a fertile residue of some spider spider. And that terrible doctor. Y, whose face is displayed on a television screen connected to his face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But again, I would disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of the brain-controlling machine is like a sophisticated shape, or the child of the darkness seems to crucify David Starr, in another place, only a well-ordered elf <br /> <br /> But the lack of thresholds (two Previous examples) works for the film. It allows us to create our own minds: to determine whether the fascination of fascism, the dangers of capitalist dictatorship, and the financial impact of the media is that La Antenna has to be judged; Or take the movie towards value as a stunning adventure through a completely unique and familiar world. <br /> <br /> A clear picture festival may seem like a compromise. But, actually, when a movie looks good, it is hard to take care of it. Each frame of La Antenna has more imagination and artwork than Hollywood, and it can shake a derivative stick. About 100 years old filmmakers can be in vain, but in this way, we can show that what is lacking today's movies. He tells us that it is time for another artistic revolution. And he could be right.
