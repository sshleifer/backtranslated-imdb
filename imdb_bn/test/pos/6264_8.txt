A beautiful movie about China's first silent film. Shadow Magic combines a love story with the drama of cultural clashes between China's ancient heritage and modern western culture as a movie. Chinese director Anne Hu is an amazing first film. If you correctly understood Mrs. Hu's comments at the 2000 Sandans festival, the film was made as an American film by the Chinese government and shot in China. Shadow Magic reminds me of films such as IEL Postini and Paradiso - not necessarily in the theme or plot, but it also has similar feelings.
