In France, Javier (Romain Duriis), twenty years old and a young economist of young year, is trying to get a job in the government department through a friend of his father. He is suggested to have a special position in the Spanish economy and language to get a good position. He decided to apply in a European exchange program named "Erasmus" and moved to Barcelona to improve his knowledge in Spanish culture and language. He gave up his girlfriend Martin (Audrey Toru), promised to keep close contact with him, and once he was temporarily Frenchman Jean-Michael (Javier de Gilebone) in Barcelona and his young man and his wife, Un-Sophie (Dr. Judith Godreche) at the airport. Went. Later, he went to an apartment with international students: English Wandi (Kelly Raleigh), Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brando), Italian Alandro (Federico d'Ana), Danish Lars (Christian Pag) and German Tobias (Bernabeu) Metschurat). Then Belgian Isabelle (Sicil de France) and Wondi's brother William (Kevin Bishop) joined this team and learned the Spanish language of Xavier and found friendship and love with his experience living abroad. "L'O uberge Espagnole" is one movie that is sad when visitors end it. The story is a delightful and fun story in a worldwide world and in a unified Europe, friendship and love. This very impressive movie made me feel good and happy, even though I did not get the experience of living in a republic student. Newcomer William encourages him with his big face and small brain in the most fun situations of the story. In addition, it is very good to meet different American fraternity and their stereotypes in American films with a new approach to students. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Albert ESPNHOL" (Spanish Auburg ")
