Someone reviewed this movie as "time consuming" because it was looking forward to "the beautiful view of Brazil and Portugal", but then everything seemed "washed" or depressed, or something of that effect. I believe this person missed the whole part of the film. It is the reality. The point of this movie is to show that life is not ideal, and to show how people go to their life for family, love, and survival. A young man leaves his slum at Sao Paulo, Brazil to go to Portugal to go to his mother's house after his death. He discovered that everything is not free, and the Brazilians are looking at the native population of Portugal. He finally finds a life, a love, but the story does not end as expected and it is not a "fairy tale" story. The part I enjoyed the most was the last song, "Jecca Biolero (honey baby)" by Gal Costa. It is so well-matched with the movie; Especially the end.
