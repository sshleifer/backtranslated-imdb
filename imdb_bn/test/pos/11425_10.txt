For the first time I saw this movie when I did not believe in my own eyes. I was in front of the parrody of Valentino - a great and good job ... Stan Laurel Bulfight look like a nice actress to see! It's a very good parody, rich in ideas, a cute and charming stan ... old and like whiskey. (Or after that the bottle up)
