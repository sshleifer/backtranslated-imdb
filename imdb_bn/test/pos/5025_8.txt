I found the movie is very light and enjoyable. Someone knows that the story is not a real life, even though the story is not a real life, yet the picture is not real life, yet the picture is not real life; <br /> <br /> The songs are really good and John Travolta is in his usual style. I like the scene where he left an angel dog to bring his life back to life.
