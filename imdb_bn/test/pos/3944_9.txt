The story is about the story of the Chinese Tale Story religious monk Tripitak, who, along with his guardian, Sandy and Piggy traveled west to recover ancient sources, finally, they reached the final leg of their journey to the Shache City, but it does not seem that the evil tree is attacked by wicked people. . The apes tried to help the warrior to fight them but he was very scared, his master was in grave danger, he used his trusted golden workers to push Tripti to safety. <br /> <br /> <br /> When he got up, he found himself in search of a bright body near a young young man, after many verbal misunderstandings, Mayan was convinced that Tripitak loves him, So when the beggar decides that he needs to save the monkey and others, he is accompanied by violence. So sweet pair pairs started their adventure together. Okay, so this is another journey to West Movie, which is not a bad thing to me, because I love the story and the characters related to it. , So I was a bit excited to get my hands on DVD. So I think I will start my review with the story, which was everywhere, first it was your emotional fantasy film, then it became a ridiculous comedy, then suddenly suddenly became a full-fledged scientist, if the director Jeff Lawo was experimenting with the mix style then She did a fantastic scalology work with this movie. I think it is one of the story centers of another character, especially the infamous monkey king, especially Tripitak as the character of peace and then put it in the main love story. So overall, I like it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> Rather ugly. Supporting cast has been nicely integrated, it has all the usual EEG's main issues so that Boy's and Isabella Long appear, I want to act like an actor Wilson Chen, who played the monkey king, he did well to think he has given limited ingredients Either, he played a version of the monkey king, who still defeated the arrogant, I thought he was Twin Effect in two regions Fortunately, it is not where it would like to restart. I hope he plays a central role with that, because the film itself is open for a signal. Okay, so let's go back to the guide, which is again full throughout the whole place, Lau Stephen Chau-Esquiera Nonsense gives a lot of time in the comedy, in which a trippack dresses as Spider-Man to touch itself, Which I think leads to a lot of head shaking. Since this movie will be set in ancient China. He has created some really nice and flexible moments in two leads and has gone into the unfortunate region, but this critic is enjoying some of the occasion, so it does not bother me at the slightest time. <br /> <br /> Right now, to CGI, which is quite good enough, there are many moments that many other opinions related to PS2 have said, but some quiet moments, especially the scene where the monkeys fight with flying losses. Do it. Most CGGs are supplied as golden workers, which become a range of things, starting from a match suite outside the Matrix Revolution directly from the giant fly sweater. So yeah, it seems crazy but I think you have to believe it. Okay, so a Chinese tackle story is not a film except its flaws, but it is good enough to be able to stay together with its long entertainment and generally able to be a full-featured movie. If all of the above do not let you see it, how do I keep it this way, it's even better after Twin Effect II.
