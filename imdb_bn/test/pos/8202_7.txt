It was a movie that few thought. Some parts are a little sugar, some parts are quite good. The plot has increased more frequently and when you thought that Angela (Sandra) betrayed a friend with a friend or was dead. I should all say Dennis Miller has been in the whole movie. Her character was the best, after all the crap Angella went through too refreshing. She will raise me and Angella through the dumps.
