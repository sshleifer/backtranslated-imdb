Since 1940, I had no idea what was the experience of watching this old movie. However, I always like to see Larry Day, (KT Latimer) who played the role of younger sister to Jean Muir (Helen Latimar) and her mother. Billy Chey, (Mrs. Julia Latema). I thought I would get annoyed with the stories of two sisters and a mother, who are protecting her daughters until they meet with Robert Simmons (Readley Crane), who have the reputation of becoming a millionaire player, who have a lot of cheeks and a heavy drink Time. One night, Helen Latimy went on a date with Redlie and she came out of her mind and did not just drive her car. At this moment in the movie it became a drama and changes the whole direction of this movie which will surely draw your attention to the end of the film.
