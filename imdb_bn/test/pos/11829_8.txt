Contemporary treatments for varied stories and racial discrimination, sons of God are much longer and have some acting performances, but the whole thing is an impressive film. <br /> <br /> A story about a Chinese story (Rachel Barthememses), Brethehals College finally starts after being humiliated after the insults of the co-versions of the brain. He started a world tour to discover himself and finished as the British playwright (Cloud King) secretary. In Monte Carlo, he met beautiful Alan Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fell in love. But when he discovered that he was Chinese, he became nude in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Angry by crime and love, Allana becomes a mental spiral and tries to communicate with Barthelems. After the death of his father, he accepted business (banking) and donned a Chinese garment as a symbol of his hatred towards white clothes. After San Francisco's detective told him the truth about his birth, Barthelmese decided to honor his Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I agree that there is no critic of the movie here. Before telling about his recent discovery, he announced his love for Alana Sam. And that makes all the differences in this film. <br /> <br /> Both Barthelems and Bennet have chewed each scene where they scream, but the whole it is a difficult and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is just as good as a college palette, firmly as Cloud King playwright Bathurst, a view of Oklahoma Indian as base flower, and E. Allen Warren is China's father, Dorothy Matthews is a fake Alice. Antar Randolph is not as good as Benit's father and Mildred Van Door is not as good as Ailean. Also at the roulette table Barthelmess right spanking blonde notes. What was that stunner he was!
