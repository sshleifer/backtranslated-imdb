At the end of the program, I became the fan of the TV series `Homidas: Life on the Street ', but soon became a fan. It was another vague exhibit: apparently different from the use of hand-held cameras, everywhere in the audience, with its versatile and neighboring cast and their changed and attractive personality, and it is in all good and bad police departments, corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /> <br /> Homeside: The Movie, Reviewing the reunion of the series, making movies for television production as well. Leigh Giardelo (Youtet Koto), who is now the mayor of Baltimore, was shot, the series' Cast members helped find the killers. Also, cast members who were killed and those who died were also kept in the film. The series returns marked intensity and fire, and the series bristles the scripts with the same fire identifying the series. All, an awesome TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
