* Small spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know, it has reached a stage where Walt Disney TV animation along with Walt Disney Sequel Animation can be called. These sequels range from awesome ("Jaffar's return") to awesome ("Beauty and the Beast: Enchanted Christmas" and the gorgeous "Lion King II: Simba's Pride"). (Of course, my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings our latest signals. "The adventure of the scamp," and even if it's flawed, it's still entertaining. <br /> <br /> Animation quality is not equal to the Disney feature animation; Still, animators do a good job of bringing life letters. Lady and Trump are not more than one day old since 1955. The faithful still speaks of his smell and "ol" is reliable, and Jock still expressed regret about it. There is a great fight between the huge dogs of trump and dog pounds, and again we have treated Romantic Leads with Spaghetti Dinner (although it is very doubtful that it will become a classic scene like its predecessor.) <Br> <br /> I really like most of the songs Do not care (though Roger Bart and Susan Egan - scamp and Angel's vocal voices - their parts are very nicely The child). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Jimble did much better in the past. Danny Troob's score is okay, but nothing memorable. And the Junkard gang looks like some extra luggage; That is, they really do not do much. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, voice work is quite good. Although I do not like Jeff Bennett as a cocktail, he is just as good as a tram. Leader of the Chazz Palminateur Jurierdig gang works as a booster, and how Alisa Milano can give her best performance like Angel. Then there's the scamp (his father's spitting figure). He is voiced from PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf scamps have wild leaks and excellent display of its soft side. <br /> <br /> Finally, the "Adventure of Scamp" is faulty, but it still creates a sense of entertainment. But in my hope, Walt Disney TV animation will focus on more main elements for their future publication. <br /> <br />
