"Crossfire" is a 1947 Notice that is a murder mystery with a strong message. It is firmly managed by Robert Young, Robert Mitchell, Robert Ryan, Sam Leven and Gloria Berkmer's star and Edward Demittrick. We have witnessed murder in the shadows in the beginning, and for the rest of the film, youth, intelligence, finale, in charge of this case, responsible for the death of three soldiers, and as important as why. Hunting, Joseph Samuels (Sam Leven) is a soldier who visits Barr; <br /> <br /> I do not know about 1947, but I have seen "crossfire" today, nobody knows who it is and why we look at the minute suspects. I do not think it was so clear that these actors are just starting. Still, the film packs a big punch with its strong performance, good looks, violence and helpless anti-Semit language. <br /> <br /> Characters differ with the Gloria planet in a small role. The woman meets (George Cooper), one of the suspected soldiers, who meets a bar and can supply him with aloeb. The film's big performance is under Robert Ryan, but everyone is nice. Robert Young is especially effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchell is a very favorite soldier who is trying to help Mitchell, his confused friend, if a lone person is still feeling for his wife, it is uncertain. <br /> <br /> is really nice, and must be seen.
