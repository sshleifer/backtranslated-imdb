This picture tells the story of couple couples dealing with post-WWIDi life. Through a lot of ongoing accounts, the audience says that the war has changed people, when their human spirit has won. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where a young man, who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms to the elbows), sure he would not do good to his sweetheart, who still wants to marry him. His daughter only said that she would help her with what she could not do, but they would be good together. Movement by showing this truth of love, people tears her fianc√©e embraces. <br /> <br /> A highlight of the scene where a bank bank asked for loan. Initially when he was rejected as "high risk", the officer of the higher ranking bank said, "You have fought for our country and kept us safe - it is enough for me. "The Best Years of a Live" Oscar won 6 Oscars, including special images for the actor who showed all our lives and is also valued even with a serious disadvantage. A pleasure to watch this film again and again. A true classic! Highly recommended!
