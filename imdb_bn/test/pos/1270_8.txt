Christopher Nolan's first film, 'Budget', is a baker writer, who started following strangers, about black and white films, which again lead to robbery and violence. This is very good. <br /> <br /> She does not present the story even though she next liked her next movie 'Mimto'. Instead it makes a bit closer to jump so that you end up trying to piece together it really end up and seemingly, apparently random, take the shot as film progresses. This style also means twists more effective. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to be definitely valuable (especially if you like his next work and / or movie silent)
