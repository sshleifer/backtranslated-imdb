Hollywood's two children's big stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Mikey Rooney) have been together for all-time family classics. The story of a 12-year-old girl, whose homage to horses, does not allow her to move away from her goal to win British citizens. Mickey Rooney is trying to bind herself to the new orphan drift, until she follows her dream.

Brilliant technicolor, rich music score, and those beautiful faces, all told a little story story. Here's a good reason to say old: They do not like it anymore!
