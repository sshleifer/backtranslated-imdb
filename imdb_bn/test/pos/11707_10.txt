This is true: Judith Lucy, if not for Mick Mollie's work. He brought his normal classified style to the role of lazy foul-muth and stole the show. <br /> <br /> IMHO: I'm not an autograph hunter, but I've collected 3. The first Samuel El. Jackson has two other films: Tony Martin and Mick Mollie. Altho Martin creates only a cameo appearance, not only Mollah but co-authors and co-produced by this flicker. I've been a fan of them for years now (obviously I was laughable during the peak of the first episode of Mick Mollay's show), so I went with it with high expectations. I'm glad I was not disappointed. Mick does a lot of work on this item and there are plenty of trademarks in it. Like words "blow your ass" and "these bowls **** house" are everywhere, as winnie blues is being sued in large amounts. It's a stupid, real story you can expect from someone like you. It's like a diverse, American, comedy comedy where they make baseball teams from prisoners or something. But instead of trying to create striking American sports such as baseball or gridy, this film usually focuses on a sport that goes to the gray army: Lawn Bolles. But the main difference between these and other types of sports comedy is that it's really fun. Even better, the fact that this film is about the old people playing a young lot, even it is not humiliating to the elderly, and it never gets sick. It's a good laugh at the real price of 1972. I saw him like Jackie Lucy and others Cast that Mick was fantastic in the first acting role, but then most of them have practiced ... this is the best Australian comedy I. Have seen a long time See it and learn the joy of Lawn Bols! <br /> <br /> This is a bit preferred: Major League <br /> <br /> SCORE: 8/10
