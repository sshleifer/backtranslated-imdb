Many believe that this movie is the baseball movie. These people are frustrated because it is about baseball player, but the movie is not about baseball. <br /> <br /> Some feel that this movie was a romantic comedy and disappointed because the relationship was not really improved. This movie is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is about culture. A proud American major Ligauer and a rigid traditional Japanese baseball manager will not succeed because they will not understand each other. After managing to break through the cultural barriers that they have succeeded. The ballplayer became more Japanese in his team's mentality and the manager became more American to achieve personal success, and they got together in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and romance are under criticism of two cultures. Many people do not know anything about Japanese thought and believe that it is a movie of baseball or romance and sees the collision of culture as a light comedy relief. It is not --- the culture of the movie, the culture of the movie. Based on my own experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think the film was good enough that it did not romanticize Japanese culture and made more of its screenplay. <br /> <br /> Overall, I believe it is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if it really understands.
