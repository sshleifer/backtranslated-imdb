'Oldby' director Park Chun-Wyk will go back with him and spread together in the history of the most serious vampire movie. <br /> <br /> Believe in the latest Hollywood fad, vampires are supposed to be these days, but instead of the inferior, unprecedented, love-filled Shivalars, instead of sexual immorality, human beings are man-animated. You want to watch this movie if you want to remember past sticky thrills ... well, at least the second half. <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of little different stories. The vampire transition of the priest is sometimes romantic and isolated by the story, which creates something weird to watch. But the last 40 minutes or so surprisingly fantastic. Well, if you're a 'sibber' and 'I'm a cyberz it's okay', but it's probably not surprising, but I think that the 'thirsty' pre-parked films hit you in front of the violence. <br /> <br /> Alert everyone that it is not artistic and is not a big flick. It can be very annoying for many and very tame for some. 'Thirst' is a little less weird than the original, entertaining, and thankfully the previous attempt of Park Chun-Uek.
