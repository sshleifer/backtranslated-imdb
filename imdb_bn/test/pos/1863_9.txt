This is certainly a great expression of the sensitive film and the personal struggle of Charles Darwin. The film is not only about his struggle to reveal his book "The Source of the Stories", but also his relationship with his oldest daughter. Her daughter started applying her opinion to the only person in her family, which also had to pay for her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, it is a difficult thing to do in my opinion. Of course the way the character is treated by the Church is not stupid, in fact the opposite. If you want to use big words to spread the light of this film; It will be liked by the atheists and atheists alike, but goes away from Islam. The film is talking about the evolution, and it's about it. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was unbelievable. Of course, we all can remember Darwin as the old man with fun beard, but this movie was around the people in the late 30's of the 30's. Jennifer Connelie (Emma Darwin) is always great, but the actor who influenced me was Marth West Annie Darwin, daughter of Darwin. Definitely the best child actor of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and it has been played nicely. <br /> <br /> In a while, the production of this movie is quite faultless. Darwin saw some scenes that nature is wonderful and it is often taken from a high production national geographical documentary. <br /> <br /> I must admit, I am not sure why they chose "creation". As the title. I suspect it's a joke, the movie is very respectful for that. Well, I'm sure it has the money, do not let it get you away. <br /> <br /> I am giving this picture 9/10. This is really a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and please give it a chance.
