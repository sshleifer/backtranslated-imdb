I must say I do not expect much about this movie, but it can not be bad. Of course, the most interesting was the performance of Eden Quinn. I would not expect to see these exquisite actors as acting actors. The great thing about it is that he really created his character (Annibal). I want to say it was not like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis, he was sensitive and humble. For example, he was really upset when he killed someone. I noticed that some clich√©s were avoided. When Annebble gets his training, you can easily rebel him and hope to work like the average American American in such a situation, ask him what is going on and refuses to cooperate. But Annabelal is a professional marine officer, he does not give up and he does not try to lose courage, in which he has achieved a great success, without a brief break on Christmas day before Christmas, which I think is very realistic. I'm glad that Aiden Quinn has had an opportunity to show his other side (actually two, because he has played Wilhelm as well), although the film was not successful.
