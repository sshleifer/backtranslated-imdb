Haggard is the most fun movie of all time. It has cast features and a great soundtrack from CKY (movies). If you have seen any CCY or Viva La left, you will notice that everyone (from these two) has it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, He is cheating about Glurain (Jennifer Rival), and he is trying to return to her. He did this by vandalizing his house in Valo (left) and Falcone (Dicamillo). There are many different characters with different stories. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack has great music. Hem and Heer, CKY, Ganar khil, Daniel Lienei band. Iggy and Stooges pop, and new orders. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Viva La Bam or CCY (film) I would like you to like it. You do not want that stuff ... this movie is great.
