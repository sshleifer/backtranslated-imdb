I absolutely love this picture and it has been seen many times I was shown it in Channel 4 in 1987, but my tape is now strictly worn and I like a new copy of it. I sent the film to four e-mails so that they could show it again because it was never found in the video and as far as I know it has not been repeated since 80's. I did not have any answers and it was still not repeated. Performance fantastic The film has everything. Her funny, sad, annoying, exciting and completely takes you back to school day. It's extremely well-paced and grips to you from the beginning. The scene in the shower room is especially awesome. I can not hear the badge song by cream and do not think of this movie. This image is fantastic as it is worth seeing by a broader audience. Channel four again seen or released video or DVD.
