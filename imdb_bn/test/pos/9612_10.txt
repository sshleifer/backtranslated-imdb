This picture is the best kungfu film ever Although there is no wire-work and special effects used in the Crowking Tiger, this film uses impressive and creative camera-work to create memorable war moments and well-known dance shows and drawings of war scenes. This film has a lot of action in the view of several great wars, but the story is very good and very good on twists and turns. Characters are good round and they have deep depth, because the motivations of their actions and personality are much more detailed than the Kung Fu films. As soon as my favorite shot shows her reaction from Hero, as soon as my favorite shot starts, there is some great camera-work in the film, then it comes back quickly to reveal the scene in front of her due to her appearance. Basically, I bought the movie to watch some great war scenes, but I learned about how many performances and stories were wonderful on multiple philosophies. Overall, a great film.
