As a Canadian, I did not know much about the dismemberment of Whitley. I read the Wikipedia page about that incident, but it was about it. Earlier this year, when Canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (it is embarrassing to us, thankfully) that could be the reason for our Governor General's intervention, but Press Released on Whitley's dismissal. To try out more, I ordered this mini series DVD via eBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by how interesting I was to the account. As dramatic as the event, it can be a very annoying political drama. However, it was a fantastic mysterious mini series. I was also impressed with how much I realized with regard to the lack of Australian politics I lacked. Everyone who was there, and did not take long to determine what their role was. <br /> <br /> It is said that it is not a completely neutral account. Malcolm Fraser is certainly depicted as a Macvivelian figure, who can not find any person or thing to be Prime Minister. Gough Whitlam is a more noble, almost convincing, light-eyed. However, the actor has acted in such a manner to congratulate Whitman Channel. I thought Sir John Career was portrayed in a sympathetic way. <br /> <br /> I must be careful that the DVD is very bad quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 80's, but it would appear that no effort was made to recover the quality or quality of the photo. It was too frustrating that no additional was added. A documentary, or even some interviews on historical statistics, improved the experience, but there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I recommend this mini series to anyone interested in real life events.
