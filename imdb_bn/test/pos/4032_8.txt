The dialogue is valuable for all those who believe the dialogue, and those who appreciate it efficiently enough to accept it for you, this movie will be astonishing. It is not 'Hoodunit' for those who can not follow the oral exchange of our hero, Professor Duktter Colonel (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Colonel teaches Southern California, pits nearby tar pits. In four years he has not published a novel, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a little more and has cursed or cursed with a kostic intelligence, which he distributes to free students. He recommended a friend for progress, and a bright young student submitted a manuscript to him as an independent project. The colonel does not even want to read it, so it gives an "A", and push it next to it. After looking at his drink with a drink in his office, he pulled out the window and saw, when a bright young student falls beside his window on the way to a pedestrian on the road facing an explosion. <br /> <br /> Now talk, and they chat, get some more. The colonel realized that he had now read the manuscript. When he goes home, his wife is waiting for divorce papers. He got more. He leaves, and he goes to a faculty case, only to find her there. She even got even more And when his wife knows that the student is dead, he is torn, and he learns that he had a relationship with the student. This course asks him to drink more serious. The next morning, he woke up to find himself in his student's dorm room, a new man named Sid (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> She feels worse than Hugover, goes to the doctor and learns that she has been poisoned, it is unstable, and she can live 24 -48 hours. He does not have much time to kill him, and each run has sub-plots, motives, relationships and surprises, although everything eventually understands. All his discoveries and exchanges are equipped with restrictions, dry wit and public observations. Let's just say that this movie will give new meaning to the expression "expression or destruction". <br /> <br /> There is no poor performance in this movie. There are repeat images, and symbolism used in direct time intervals. See the distorted image for cut glass, and glass. Some camera shots are revolutionary for 1988, and some violent acts are carefully and skillfully dancers. Music is disobedient and fit, though sometimes it makes its own statement in song songs. <br /> <br /> If there is a failure, it can be moved slowly at the beginning of 20 minutes and almost goes to sleep. But pacing takes quick action, with just the right amount exposition in the action segments. <br /> <br /> There is no sexuality, though there are violence and some bad language. <br /> <br /> This is a writer's film, and those who have a sense of humor about their best success or failure are best appreciated. I think if you take it seriously, you are already having major problems.
