The problem of film is quite simple, Conrad's prose can not be strongly worded and adapted to a movie. In the novel you attract yourself to the first sentence of Marlow's description, and only "see" what Conrad has written. In the movie, it's different, you see visual, but the details and reflection that really creates the novel, is not terribly absent. But as far as an unexpected book is received, it's good quality. There are exactly similar scenes, which are quite curiously identified, but they do not have the same effect as the novel. The plot of the movie has been improved, and it works very well to make it more interesting. The references of ancient Egypt were insinuously inserted. Read my tip, book, and so on, there are better movies.
