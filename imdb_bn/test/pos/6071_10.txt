I have heard a lot about the English patient and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what Balihu was all about. What I found out is a cinematic joy and, should I 'open' always meet with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral zealer, I am afraid that this is not a movie for you, because you will fail to see the beauty of the best art of this movie, because you keep an eye on the moral contradictions of this film. Before I look at this movie, I remember correctly, I read the reviews on this site and were completely hateful with the opinion of the person that I quoted that 'the characters deserve whatever they deserve'. I agree with him on morality but this glorious film is not a way to comment. <br /> <br /> I rarely acknowledge that I have seen such wonderful imagery. I keep hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost, it is a love story and yes it is a wedding event (be cautious of morals) but it should not be paid attention. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. This is a mix of Flashback and current. It sets in the Second World War and tells us stories of survivors of one of the crash crashes (Count Almaty played amazingly by Ralph Fiennes), under whose supervision the army nurses (Juliet Binoch) started with the end (axis strength defeat) just before the war in Italy. He had a lot of pain in the patient who suffered pain when he was very annoyed with an English lady Catherine (Christian Scott Thomas), shown in the flashback set in Africa's former Africa. The past and the present story is stuck so strange that you are sent to the story and get the feel of the first hand viewer. The desert and local people in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am not romantic and ashamed to tell my tears after finishing. See it with someone you really love. The film starts with the same shot in the desert and ends where the sand is sinking and turning like a woman's body and it was exciting. The feeling of loss and sorrow was so embarrassing by the actors that it makes me wonder why! Why do we have war that destroys beauty and the most inelegant, innocent destruction? However, it won a bunch of Oscars and I will go looking for other works of director Anthony Minghala. These films bring romanticism to the movie of David Lin It was almost 'Arab Lawrence' which was located in the desert. People are happy to see.
