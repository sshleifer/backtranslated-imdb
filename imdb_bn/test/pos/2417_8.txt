The fourth movie of this Karate Kid series. However, it does not have anything to do with the previous one. 3. The only letter is Mr. Mayaigi Mr. Time around Maggie was a disappointing teenager Julie Pierce (before becoming famous), there is a problem with a person in a pseudo-military club in the campus, including rape in school. Naturally he is trained on how to fight. Nevertheless, Julie learned through the Maya, and became a good person spiritually and learned how to respect herself and finally got her respect. I am a unique concept of competing women and a man as his enemy. I also got some war scenes that are very good, very low and minimum violence. War graphic The last is also good and some surprising. It is predictable but it is not usually the end of the movie. This film is mainly based on spiritual perspectives and original reflections of lessons learned. 1st movie as well, and certainly not as good as 2nd. But it's a giant jump ahead of the third-degree entrance. This is a very entertaining thing under a dog movie that is suitable for the whole family. 8/10
