This show is absolutely fantastic It provides all the small plays and thrilling shows like The OC and Dawson, but it's a complete fun. It is a show with morality and values, which is not all about hatred or fate in our Australia except sugar coated and saturated (Al 7th heaven). And our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how accurate Greek life is. But I'm careful! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who loves me a racist, Homophob Confederate flag-division Bible Bush must be of course meritorious. <br /> <br /> and Capi are my new passes. Sorry Josh Jackson, you've been convicted!
