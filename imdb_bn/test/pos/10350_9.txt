I came to the picture last month after the BBC! It blew my mind, so intestinal wrenching and real. David Tennant This is absolutely fabulous, although its character is not always easy to identify or identify with. <br /> <br /> I made this image in the middle of the Dr. Hu series and it makes more sense. A credit for me I just said Who has loved and yet has seen this personality screenplay in Mr. Tenants, who knows that he has changed and struggled to create some new identity and life. <br /> <br /> Great little intense drama!
