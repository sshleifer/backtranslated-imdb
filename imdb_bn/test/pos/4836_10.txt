I first saw this movie three years ago. I was amazed at how FBI was stupid to prevent such tragedy. It can easily be prevented. This movie was simply incredible. <br /> <br /> Now I saw it after 11 September, I was surprised and can say that it can be easily prevented that most people want to know. <br /> <br /> This picture is 100% true. In the final scene of the movie, when the first attack was taken by the mastermind helicopter and flew over the tower, he made cool spinal comments, when He laughed it. "Next time we'll bring them both down." This Ramzi Youssef really told him after his arrest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This threatens the truth about how the first attack was conducted under the noses of the FBI and NYPD. It shows how the first and fourth amendments are partly responsible for the attack. <br /> <br /> I now see this movie and know that both attacks can be prevented.
