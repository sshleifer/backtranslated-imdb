I do not really have a strong thesis here, so I'm just going to have to do some observation. <br /> <br /> First, the film is absolutely fantastic. It is shot in high contrast to black and white and some scenes are so well-formed that they are almost confusing. <br /> <br /> There is a sequence before some intense protests and some shots were surprising. Three people are launching tears in protesters, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Ideology was lost and shifted somewhat differently. Accepting this shift is really interesting - I think that there are strong points and weak points at both political level as well as artistic and more spontaneous levels. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I think romance works very well. Finally, I genuinely hated the end. . It was very melodramatic way. You can even say that before the end of the film that was ineligible.
