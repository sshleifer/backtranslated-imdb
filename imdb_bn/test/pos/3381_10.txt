After hooking up in the mini series, "north and south", I could not wait continuously to answer, "north and south" continuously. Then after a year, as well as the third of the book "Heaven and Hell - the third in the north and south-book." In the end, the last castle came for the ongoing character of Maine and Hazard families. I was inspired so much through this series that I sprayed each part of the TV and then I was driven to submerge family and friends and I saw it again, every time new people wanted to see them. My tape is old and I want to test this DVD. If you missed Book III, you could not get full satisfaction and you did not know how it became all. Claim yourself a favor and set this DVD!
