Pasha's mother is a Finnish film. But there are various things that copies abroad. Some of the details of the story are Amoros Perez, Jackie Brown and Elephants. The scene is shot again from different angles. Paa Ma is a good movie, but it is not so good that Hype said: "Realistic movies, no happy ending, and no commercial admission." Some actors did great work. Sulevi Peltola was so good as a vacuum cleaner peddler. Jasper Pääkkönen also shows his skills. But the Michael Leipelampi was so tall. He has played so many actors, he is handsome and nice, but not the best actress in Finland. But if you like a Finnish movie, but it is worth looking at the legs.
