I have seen a long version and can not take my eyes on the screen. It's been 219 minutes and it's still an hour's gone. The characters were very credible and entertaining, and photography was excellent. The story dragged me and held my attention. I will definitely see this again and again. This true story tells it the best ... Hollywood's usual cheap thrill and skin is not deep-glitzy. I saw most reviews on this movie. Most are asked to pan or obscure the image. Basically, this is a great film that has got unreasonably reviewed reviews. View it for yourself with open mind. If you like western, historical pieces, but historically incorrect, you will enjoy the movie. Pretty !!! 10/10
