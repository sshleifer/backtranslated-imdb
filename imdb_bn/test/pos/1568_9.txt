This is a very amazing movie! The characters were so realistic to me, it was hard to believe that they were not real people. From the south, I think Judith Eves's character is particularly realistic, and as everyone else mentions, she plays an outstanding performance. Characters are not nice and do not see anything like the average Hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem to be more natural and real. One critic noted that Elise's main character was not a good reason to escape from Alice's house, which was true - there was no moral or justifiable cause for her escape, such as child abuse abuse etc. I thought that he was disturbed by the dead-end job in a working class and wanted to escape from Florida where his friend and friend of a college student in Miami had a living and privileged life. Actress Alice's determination and ambition to control her life with the fascinating nature of confusion, uncertainty and questioning. The film also shows that Alice has been leaked to any option, which means she has to panic, take action and reach for help. <br /> <br /> At first, the great filming style dropped me out and thought that it was a very low budget or homemade movie, but in reality it was very well done. Home movie quality is really a part of their RV trip across the country, with the characters that you think you have. This is definitely a movie, though, as heart-warming about the description of the age, I did not fully understand all its details. Even if it is rather indecent and annoying, it is not completely sad until it is finally finished.
