Following the line of the classic formula at one point to take another leap from the element, Thing remix becomes one of the best remixes of its time. There is a fairly vague screenplay on some of John Carpenter's (which is probably the most well known narrator), with Rob Bartin coming with Sten Winston (incredibly incredible with Stan Winston), brilliant dolls and animatronices. This effect helps set up tone against harsh, isolated environments, with the carpenter set up with its characters. The film takes the story of a group located in a research bunker in an Arctic climate, which imposes the size of others, against the brutal forces. The choice of carbenor tones, and surprisingly it gave life. For Howard Hawkes's footprint, there is much more faith and talent to implement the object rather than giving the filmmaker the chance to have any other event with the old film. <br /> <br /> Works in the entire army, which probably follows the BeckDraft which burns the maximum fireworks (it can be too much, but it fits within a short time later) - Actors can pull a fine shoe. Contrary to the prepaid squad, most are coming from regular workman, Curt Russell's MacCrady (a very good introduction to his style, really nice). The roles of supporting roles for Wilford Brythley and Keith David's choices are not out of the mark. And refreshing to see how it's going on, the holes against the monotonous time with all kinds of how it's going on in the film (which starts with alien dogs and then turns back to the other, demand transformation form). I sometimes like long silence, Anneo Mikeron's wonderful, strange music in the background (and the lightning line itself merits). <br /> <br /> If it does not otherwise have it, it will try its style / rituals to viewers. It remains the best one of the presenter; A rare species of horror movies where the scene is clearly and precisely the story about the timing position with the camera, the dialog, and the scenes. Not to say that the film is not involved with violence, it's really fun several times. But it goes back to what looks like a sunny era, stagnant, animals / makeup along with good math scripts, is done entirely without CGI. It's hateful, but it's real, and a T-atmospheric.
