Every review I have read so far seems to have missed an important point. Shakespeare wrote for pronunciation and pronunciation just as he did for the sake of other plays. The Scottish pronunciation changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects what is said and deeply influenced. So, listen again and note the difference. The drama is well done and the words are much better than those found in Lamma, which are available, gentle, orderly English. Reminds me during a teacher at a school in Leicester, unknowingly, I was asked to read the 14-year-old Walter Skate piece, which was written in the border. It makes all the difference when I read from the border and read it as it should be read.
