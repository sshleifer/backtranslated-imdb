"Pixot" is one of the most powerful, frustrating and moving motion pictures from Brazil. It is about the life of street children in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro streets, and it centers around a 10 year old boy. The camera often follows the documentary style; From the children's detention center (where most workers are corrupt as police) and return to the street, and it does not go away from the city's horror. Prostitution, drug use / dealing, corruption and murder are all seen by these youth; Yet it is something they are painfully used to use. Director Hector Babbanko used to be the real street children's actors, the movies were cast in cruel reality. Although not for everyone, a film I highly recommend. A mentally devastating movie. <br /> <br />
