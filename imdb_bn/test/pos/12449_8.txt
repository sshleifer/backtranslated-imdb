This is one of the most enjoyable teen movies I've ever seen (and I want the video to be released). Team Matteson was released the same year as "Animal House" (which was probably overlooked). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this film is definitely a soundtrack, which can be a formal label release and it could be. The soundtrack is a feature of 70 highlights of high-altitude elements, whose song "We're the Fawar" plays a marquee role in the movie prem movie scene. I think the group's album "Steppin Out" is mainly due to the appearance of girls and not for their musical influences. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> I want to know the name of the group so that I can find it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like "Over the Edge" and "Rich Kids", then I think this will be your side as well.
