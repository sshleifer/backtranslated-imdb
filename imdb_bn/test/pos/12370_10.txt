Unfortunately, this is a short-known movie ... I say "unfortunately" because it's a "silly" American silk screen! <br /> <br /> This is a legend "Phantom Roth" which spreads around the world, raising their souls who have died. Legend says that the last person who died on the eve of New Year's Day was condemned to run chariots for the next year. <br /> <br /> It is known that "coming in the future of the future" section. Dicken's famous "Christmas carol" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But you must see it; <br /> <br /> Soft face Â© <br /> <br /> Soft Old Movie Heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
