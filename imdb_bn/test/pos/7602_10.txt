I thought the movie was not only due to the story, but it was widely portrayed by the excellent cast. I read that Drill Barrymore was not as exceptional as Jose Geller because he was beautiful. Yes he might but the movie he played out of it, in which he found a girl who was in the world. The story is sweet and definitely frustrating for the romantic, I'm sure. David Arquette is as crazy as his brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is as fantastic as Sam Coulson. Lley Shobski did a great job as her partner, Aldis, who is not afraid of herself. I think this movie will get more credits instead of being branded as "Tanny Boppi" on Flickr
