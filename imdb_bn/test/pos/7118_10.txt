I do not play video games in addition to my kids. <br /> <br /> I got this one big kick. Want to see more of this type of movie. My little say "very cool" <br /> <br /> The interesting characters and the overall story line were interesting. As I said I do not play video games but I think my kids will enjoy it. It was not full of bad language and that's a beautiful change. These visual concepts had a variety of my eyes caught. The plus sound track was pretty good. I can try some of the games that my boys can play in this movie. Who knows maybe I can be a gamma.
