I saw this short film on HBO another day and absolutely loved it. Eight different characters, eight different perspectives. At first I was confused on the way the story was running, but then I realized that it was showing only a scene, just to show different perspectives of letters. <br /> <br /> At first, you think Clark is shouting for theft in a teenage age. They speak their own language, which I do not understand (and played by Chris Kishore, Alanio Hendricks firmly). Clarke's perspective dispels that view I could not understand how wonderful the little scenes actually are. <br /> <br /> Excellent small film. Hopefully, director James Cox can become a feature length movie with the same little film, or we can win over a whole new movie. <br /> <br />
