Although "they have died with their boots" it is not entirely historically correct, it is a very entertaining western. Just Flin is not the perfect Custer, the character actor is fantastic. Along with the scenes of Flin and Bathwiland's love scenery, it is very sensitive and trustworthy. (Flin and Bathville were very favorable to each other in real life). Flin is not always given importance, because if he knew that there were only a few actors, who could play the characters and play them well!
