The two main character Arkan and Stephan Munich's Comedy Act. I wonder if this is one of the standard snapstick films where the story is not important or just does not exist. But when I saw this movie I was very happy that there is a cool story and the original characters really fit it. <br /> <br /> Not all are very funny and common German movies.
