Definitely this shadow of doubt proves how he preached Patricia Arquitana: an actress! This is undoubtedly his best moments of acting and he certainly deserves credit for his work. In a film other than the possible exception of the holy marriage, he was not entirely credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Palt: A young woman finds himself in Southeast Asia and suddenly witnessed massacre and consensus witness and escapes in the rural areas of political violence. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you will see or you have not seen all of Hollywood's best. I got 58 places in the top 100 of all time films. <br /> <br /> Thank you Bob
