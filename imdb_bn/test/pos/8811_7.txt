Cardiff, Wales A group of 5 people in this town are deeply indifferent. There is a zipper shop that works in the shop. Coop, a simple DJ. Nina, her best friend Lulu and an integral part of the muff. The week is hell for them and they wait only one thing: at the end of the week. At this time, they come to the sound of the nightclub and tech music, they enjoy various drugs, especially happy. Then, they usually continue with a friend's group. At the end of this really good time on Sunday, the following are the feelings: fatigue, sadness, memory of just one crazy night ... <br /> <br /> Surfing "Trainings" (1996), the first and only written and directed by Justin Curgain The film makes new variations about the idea of ​​the rally. This means: To make fun as much as possible to let you know about the end of your short period. In fact, I wrote for the movie's five main characters, the week is hell and the only time on weekends they can liberate themselves and get wild time without single pressures. Positive aspects of shooting yourself: You undoubtedly feel no pressure, you are on Earth as an orbit astronaut. The curious guide style of Kargin reveals 5 very dramatic festivities and carelessness. Stay alive for the benefit of the weekend as late as the weekend. Then, encouraging her movie encourages her festival a bit more, Kyrgyz is not afraid to include her dream sequence or embarrassment like a dream-like sequence. Then, "Human Traffic" (1999) is also served by a special enthusiast soundtrack. Amount? A perfect symbiosis between sound and music. In the end, this week's last euphoria has done a lot of new pictures of some popular social class, the British film, British movie much research. However, when a movie (honestly or not) utilizes the reputation of another famous person, it rarely matches the brightness of its predecessor. This situation is "human traffic". There is little innovation at the stage of introduction of narrative formation and character and anyone can mention some vain discouragement (Zip, who goes to the nightclub manager's office and tells him a cock-and-ball story), enable the mufi to enter the club but it is not a reason Next comes without problems). Karygun can also be held responsible for ignoring the dramatic aspects that the story may contain. Her movie can read from Euphoria to Paranoia, and dramatic words are not often explored in this second pole. It's a shame! It can publish the following message: Even on a happy moments, some terrible preparations that can flow them. This comment can also be called when Kopa's jealousy has become the norm because Nina pushes a man. <br /> <br /> It is billed on DVD cover but it can not be the best film in the late 90's, but "human traffic" will be taken as a good and harmful small film that describes the ending style and fashion of the twentieth century. Have fun without intentional purpose and trouble. An ideal movie before starting a team or going to a club.
