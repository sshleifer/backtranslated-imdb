You think you are a fan of horror movies, but you've watched the ring and dark water of Hyde Knox. They are fantastic, and the ring makes its way into Hollywood easily (maybe Dark Water will be adapted soon?). Although the rings are nearly 100% pure heart pounding and the nerve is broken, the story of the two sisters is both nerve breaks and mind wrapping. <br /> <br /> elsewhere I think this Korean is a bright and smart ending horror movie. The only error in this movie is that some consider its slow 20 minutes rather slow. It is actually an ideal with Korean and Japanese movies. I slowly thought rather carefully planned, it seems to be "a quiet moment before the storm". Through a thorough introduction of the characters, Emo Viewer will be more involved with the character, a strong point between Korean and Japanese movies. <br /> <br /> Like the ring, the story of two sisters does not look terrible. Rather they let our mind do terrible things. That way it's scarrier and scary enthusiast at the same time. I would not be surprised if Hollywood recreated this film to bring ring and gross / jou-on (this is not good as it is, I lost it 5.5). Do not miss it!
