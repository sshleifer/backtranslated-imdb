Different different black comedy, it can be seen in a movie, but remember who does that. This movie creates its own universe and it is interesting in all ways. What about it Estrangement, I believe. Probably to the viewer, but I have seen that this film is trying to say something about all the designer furniture and perfect facades and cool down the facades. I do not know exactly that. But this movie really got to me. See it. I really hope the team behind this movie creates more movies and they will continue to do it themselves, a bit weird style. And I forgot: Casting here is fantastic, as being rude fawn Aurv√•g bothersome people being role perfect, he does not understand where he is, what he is doing and why. The recognition of the purpose of life (city) does not understand, which makes him annoying. Be happy as others have said. In 2006, this movie was a good and ridiculous comment.
