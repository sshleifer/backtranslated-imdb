Reviews for RENDITION are not generally optimistic, so I waited until it was moved to the local discount theater to see it. The story tells of the story of American-Egyptian scientist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, who was separated from his international flight and was detained for interrogation after a strange negotiation, linked to recent terrorist attacks in an unwanted North African country. I'm not afraid that as bad, it's an interesting and thought-provoking entry of the "Rip-off-the-Headlines" thriller genre. <br /> <br /> The film asks tough questions about premier US methods. Information from the political prisoners: What is our country doing beyond the pre-border border before being tortured (openly) on suspected terrorists? Does it get useful information that helps save lives? If so, how much does it cost? What kind of monsters do we create when innocent people are captured and tortured? By the use of torture, we are giant like any country? It is always frustrating when a film with such provocative material with some details about making good movies is unclear. For example, I want to convey my condolences to Anwar's wife, who spends the whole film trying to track down her, but the feature of her only identifiable personality is an advanced condition of pregnancy. It appears to be contrary that Arab women are facing problems only without getting married to their fathers, and one of the main characters in the movie is a weakly scrapbook which is very easy to explain to everyone in detail. The information of his love interest may be an urgent need at that particular moment. <br /> <br /> This picture shows a strong central performance of Jacques Gilillahal and strong (but very short) attendees of Hollywood veterans Marily Strip and Alan Orkin, as well as acting like Omar Atwali, like Anwar El-Ibrahimi, along with actors Moaya Khaus, Genevou Ukak and The influential changes by Iglal Nour, all of which I enjoy watching in future movies Who has nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. If filmmakers do not enter a slightly effective but dominant turn, five or more stories are sung together, unless the terrorists go to the final round of the final attack of the violent attack.
