A very curious, psychical, confidential, (and I've experienced the strange?) Experience. <br /> <br /> But at least one stage - it was OK to fix it. It broke the gap between the silly, created, and Hollywood characters of Monique TV shows and young pop statues like adult, musical instruments growing and developing, and still a little stupid 'Monks of 70' and more. The most important line in the film is Mike Neath Meth, "If they think we're still in plastic, wait until they see how they are." Monkees was tired of all negative comments about their images and is a matter of recording their work. They said over the interview over. They need to rebuild their own way and how to make better ways and how to make their machine lightly lamps. And at the same time, they commented on our entire society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why should we choose - these things are not created at one point or another?" These are the Orwellian "Prouls" (the "Almighty" repressed on their silicists in the Munque TV series), dragging the "Big Brother" pants and kicking him on his very perfect butt. <br /> <br /> Concept, like music, like effects, like movies! But then Peter Tork said in the film, "But why do I speak, because I do not know anything?" :)
