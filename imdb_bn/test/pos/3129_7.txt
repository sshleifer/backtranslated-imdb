Although I like this western, I must say, this is not one of my favorite John Ford Western. For me, it's only a certain lack that most of her films (which I have seen still) are there. Net sure that's what This is not realistic. The story is about a Mormon Wagon train which is used as a secret band from the footing. Ford did many of his regular work here. Some interesting characters, some beautiful scenery, some steps and excitement It adds all of this to a handy experience. This is certainly not boring. Do not object to the normal John Ford Standard. For me, the wagon master is a 7/10
