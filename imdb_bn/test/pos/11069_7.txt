This movie is quite good, it's actually like a good wine, it gets better. Speed ​​is quite slow for such a high octane issue, but cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a cool blue-colored pull that's the whole "movie" of the movie. Gabriel Casseus' performance of the character of "Midget" has a great performance. He is awesome Why does this guy do more work? The film got better support, perhaps she has.
