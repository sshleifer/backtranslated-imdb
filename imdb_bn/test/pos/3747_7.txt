I recently saw this picture in the 3-D film festival of Hollywood. It was not 3-D (gray and blue gray specs), it was so fun to see the film with the audience, the print was excellent and the 3D was perfect. The performance was top and added to that fun, wonderful ending (we were not supposed to share with fellow movie buyers, according to movie trailers and posters) Humorous people were sunny. According to today's standards, it is probably more comedy than the horrific, but the addition of 3-D acceleration (complete with cobbles and bands dropped from the screen) was a recreational romp in the horror of the 50's.
