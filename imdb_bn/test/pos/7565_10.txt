Back to nostalgic music, we see a young boy get off a train. He is coming to meet his father from Yugoslavia, which he has not seen in a decade. We can meet people at the train station. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can ask why I started my review. Well, that video box describes the film. You might think that this boy will be the story of this boy's meeting with this unhealthy person and eventually he will tear his cover and expose generosity. <br /> <br /> If you bought that, I have a bridge I want to sell you. You see, that Hollywood will do the film. The pen has always been an exotic and generally resorted to the story called cliched. He is always telling interesting stories about people ("Boni and Clyde", "The Chase", "Alice Restaurant", and the underlying "Mickey One") and "four friends" are not exceptional in their credits. <br /> <br /> A simple Hollywood movie named Danilo will focus on the boy. But Steve Tesich's script paid attention to it for about 4 minutes and then released him. We meet Craig Washner (who you can identify from "Nightmare on Elm Street 3" and "Nightmares on Elm Street 3") and meet with his friends, Tom, David, and the adult Danilo, who is acting by George Georgia. The film covers hundreds of us Now in a small film, get the attention of the event. But these happenings occur in "four friends", but Pan and Tesich are more concerned about character research than plot and I think the film looks better. We know the facts; We will not sit on them again <br /> <br /> I do not know much about the plot, but I do not know if you can describe four friends. This is not one of the "high ideas" movies that can be described in one sentence. This is a movie of many moods and textures. This is a real emotional experience. The final twenty minutes of this photo took me to tears. I'm not ashamed to accept it. Seldom a picture contains energy that can reduce me in tears. Acting first rate, especially Craig Wasan, who is working as the most silly actor today. It's a tough, emotional performance and Wasson pulls it off. She should have received an Oscar for this. Another great performance is Jodie Th√©lene, who plays a much stronger role than Washan. However, he operates very well and most of the Hollywood actresses do not give a specific status to Georgia (they'll be too scared to try too hard; they will be more concerned with the film rather than giving a great performance; it is not about acting). She deserves an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "four friends" did not get much shock in 1981. Maybe people did not have the mental ability to manage it. And the foolish executives could not push it as another "American graffiti" (it lacked the wall of "four friends"). So they let it die. Too bad, this is one of the best movies of the 1980s, where a decade more slash trash was created, and such a great industry was out of the house. I asked you to give this image a chance. <br /> <br /> **** 4 they are out
