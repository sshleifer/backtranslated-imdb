It's a wonderful little movie that was really creative and fun - you rarely see anything in movies. The film started in Russia after the collapse of the Communist government. As a result, society seems to be in chaos and the old rule has gone away that life has improved now. Dirty cities, crime and lack of housing still plague poor residents in St. Petersburg. <br /> <br /> This scene comes from an idealist music teacher in this obscurity and uncertainty. He is in the house without them, and he has finally received a letter from the government that tells him that he has a small apartment near the flat. When he came, the place is a mess, but people seem quite friendly so that they all have beautiful parties. In the middle of the night, they were walking from huge physical clothing in an old lady's house (I was expecting half of Lucy and other children from Lion, Witch and Warrow, but they 'T). They shocked to do something very early but decided to investigate soon. Instead of just having a clothes closet, clothing opens in Paris! How really the responders responded to this magical gateway response Some, like music teachers, scared and scared. Most of the others are more practical and related to looting everything from Paris before the gateway closes simultaneously. This Russian thief is terrible man - greedy, fat and weird but deep down --- very DEEP - gold hearts. I am now a metaphor for the nation at the edge of capitalism. First of all, they hold everything that Amlock can do, and only after they reveal some depth - but most of them work as a guest at Jerry Springs show! The film has many twists and turns and is fun and fun both. Due to some strict language only negative and a nude scene (though, a very funny one), this is not a movie for kids. This is a real shame, with some small editing, it can be a great family film.
