Samuel Fuller knows the war, and is the only director in American film history who can accurately portray the perfect experience of a form like the movie. His neutrality and idealism, if it seems somewhat weird to mix together, works as a story center for him, and at the same time he is always out of the truth, but it can get brutal (or inserted into melodramatic structures). Warboten, related to post-war experience, as we have only reached the first open scenes at the point in point - brave at one point. The opening shot is a big surprise that seems to be running in the rest of the scene: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera torn, we see another soldier shot in a war-torn country. Easy, straight language Then Fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting: the title song both as satirical and sincerity, and then played as Beethoven Music on American and Nazi out-of-a-trick credit songs. Sgt David Brent (James Best) is shot, the war continues, and then his infection is being treated to him for his wounds. It can be a credible fact that this will be a somewhat conventional WW2 flick (in some cases, generally Bitove can not be found, and after some, Wagner covers these pictures), but this is not the case. Instead, Fuller makes it an 'coming home' type movie, though this soldier is not injured at home and thus does a lot more. In fact, instead of going home, Brent is in Germany, because he wants to work with Helga (Susan Cummins, very good to stop German accent), and a small capability of the military, because he can help him marry her. He does not realize that a) he is asking for more money so that he can get food for himself and brother, but it becomes emotionally complex with a little infinite but heartbreaking Brent, and b) an underground Hitler youth community is known as Wevelol, Finally, the right to choose the right-the government to join the German despite the logic in the group is now Moved attacks on him, as Brent has described, "a blood pressure." Plus the footage of the New Yorkberg trials and (as I thought, Fuller himself said) the history of snatching Nazi war chords is rapid, in a society we have more than one aspect In an awful post-war environment in the terrible straits. Rosellini guided his own way with Zero in Germany, faced it with Fuller Layers: The first is the story of love, or a tragic downfall of a person that does not seem reasonable to a person, as long as he or she does not leave his wife and children, In that verse, it is partially misguided. With the help of Healda Day, Helda Dey works unemployed and comedians, distraught brothers, emotionally in detail; This is not a very easy B-movie part, although they could do it. Then another layer is a political, social struggle to win and to ensure that a mentality is synthesized, by Fuller, about making things in the gray area of ​​Nazi: they are evil, especially when they are associated with their end Canceled <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a style layer that weirdly absorbs. This is probably one of Fuller's 'tokest' movies, which is not a bad thing considering one of his best written scripts, because the characters do not speak with just or many platitudes (an exception in a small scene where two characters speak of Hitler's youth, according to Fuller's autobiography, Probably, theoretically, another level of consideration in the theorem and 50-second movies). And Fuller makes an impression about it in a real European style, when he is not going to fight for war or war, because the editing is not very fast and sometimes it will not happen for a full minute or more time. There is an intriguing tension in it, especially when something called something that gets another wild-eyed or suspicious; Fuller can easily go for big close-up, but without a simple over-shoulder contract, there are worse, cooler quality for both of them not to move away from the conversation. But when it is needed, like the big rebellion outside the American military office, or the Nuremurg footage is split into the francs memorials of Wevelvs, Fuler may sometimes be a stunning stylist. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult, but if you are a fan of a director or a WW2 film - or even a fan of a history-buff-weightbenton, it is very valuable! An intellectual experience and a strong emotional one, better than expected from a B-movie, and 'every other aspect' which seems equally devastating and anxiety.
