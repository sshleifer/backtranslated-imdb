A while ago, I bought the North Star Fish Sugar Box Box, which is a fist of North Star, a fist of the North Star, a new fist of North Star, and the fist of The North Star film. There are American versions and several European versions, but they ended up halfway through the fist of the North Star, which went away. <br /> <br /> This series is known as Kansiro, an artisan known as an ancient martial heir, Hakutto Shin Ke (Fist of North Star), or Kane for Kane. Every generation has one heir. It is a post-apocalyptic future where the most powerful weapons of martial arts are performed. As my version, it is the two most powerful artists of Shuk Kahin and Nantu Divine K. Nantos are really many styles but they are the same, because they allow a person to cut into pieces. There are six nanto masters and each has their own star. Holo is an art that lets someone hurt / kill or heal someone by striking a point on his body. Each industry has their own stars. Hakuto - Big gap, nanto - mm. Kansiro is going to protect evil from the world because of following his two brothers and three Nantos masters and their army. Each army captain has a way to fight itself, which separates each episode and makes the number of soldiers bloody. Also, Kansiro is looking for his girlfriend Uriah who stole Nanto Master Shin. Along with the journey, Kansiro brother brother Toki rescues himself from his brother Raou, who calls himself Kenny or boxing King. He joined two Nantos Master Rio, who is looking for his sister, Kenyan brother Jaggi and Shu. Die them both along the way and Tokyo way. Who joins the other characters Rin and Batto two kids who do not do many things. It is as much as I can tell from the story so long and full for the story. The series is divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show deadly? Keane usually goes against a group that they feel difficult and then dies with one blow. Which is fun and badass, but makes for quick fights. Another great part is the comedy / wickedness. Nobody hits, and they think of him nothing. Why do they think they are already dead. Then they died. When the other parts hit them and tell them they have a few seconds of having them. Then there will be a counter pop-up. Or when he tells them that they do not know his name. Yet when he kicks in a quick fire or pauses and goes to y da da da da da etc. Finally you can do it with yourself. There was a bad part when a bad guy thought he knew Hukuo. He went to Cain and hit him. Why did he say he died a few seconds? The bad guy killed then count off. It is not limited only, everyone else is killed quickly. Cain has never been a character as awesome and probably will never have them. <br /> <br /> There are some problems though. One repetitive nature Some flashbacks have played too much to take Yuriya, and there are several recurring episodes in four parts of the series. In fact, the last part is a repeat of the whole thing. Another problem ends. The final battle with Rao was not that impressive. Anyone and Rao then spoke, etc., until Rao came to realize something and killed himself instead of killing someone. But it is better than the US and the European version which is just half of it. <br /> <br /> Whom do I recommend for? These adult teens and adults like to act like that. Since styles can burst or break into people, violence is very graphic and contains a lot of it, but they do not show much blood because they usually make death a silhouette that still looks like a person. Less colorful This is most likely done to avoid censorship. You do not want to hire American version actions. Although if you like the action, then I ask for import after seeing all of this series, but it is not the best English translation after the Chinese have their title. Note: My import has come up with what I said at the beginning, there are not some imported versions, but you still have to get an import to see all series and fist in the answer series. If you do not believe that you can manage the subtitles for any reason go to the American version. Another Note: I did not receive any subtitles for the last disc on the latest Star of the latest Star Mine; Although, starting with a new fist of North Star is not very good. <br /> <br /> I present this event for a great deal of 8/10, for the good story and the amazingness of Keynesiro. << br /> <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toe Animation is an English subtitle version released. You can download episodes from the IGN Direct 2 Drive as well as the Slok No 2 or see it on the Foundation site free of charge.
