The film was true in the real life story, which was based on it. It was difficult for me to find newspaper articles about real events, but when I found them, I could see the truth, in this case, there was no stranger to fiction. Judith Lite was terribly bad in her role as the mother in this movie, so much so that she could be separated from the role, which I distinguished from the idea of ​​an extraordinary performance. Rick Schroder could be tough at some situations how to be in some circumstances to take the actions of a guardian for a child, for example, who was competing against him in his court as his son, as well as possible, no criminal could be hard at how they might be. Someone is finding fault with the movie, but it is not based on the treatment of the reality.
