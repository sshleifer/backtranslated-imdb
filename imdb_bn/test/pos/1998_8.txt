Okul is his first type in the Turkish movie, and it is better than my expectations. Those who do not say it's not horrible, have a point, it's not really that great at all. But it must be remembered that everyone involved in the film is rather amateur, so it is basically a first journey. And compared to one of Sinan Cinem's films such as the first-class garbage "Prerangar", the film is quite good. <br /> <br /> One thing that must be said is: It is very practical to relate to the lives of higher education students. That's exactly how it goes! Fear is meant to be scary that scenes are somewhat cheaper, and Hollywood Most of them even if not all. But the view of that religion reads me laughing and the best performance of this flicker as a queen religious teacher. <br /> <br /> It's not your time to waste, go and see! If Turkish youths know enough about Turkey's school life, you will find it rather interesting.
