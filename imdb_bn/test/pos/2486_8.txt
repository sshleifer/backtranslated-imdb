Some aspects of the punctuality park are less than perfect, especially some of the acting. But I think this is probably the most important film of the "war on terror" era. I grew up in hate hippies and in some cases I still do. I did not start watching the world with their eyes until the United States started the path of unnecessary and fraudulent war in Iraq. I can feel what they can feel. Although the movie is somewhat date-wise, seeing this, our current situation brings the uncomfortable emotions to the right side of the page. It is clear in the first phase of the film that the disciplinary park is designed as a density and death camp for all "autocratic" elements of American society. This is certainly the most spectacular and extreme scene of our spinal society, but it is trustworthy. Occasionally I believe that the United States can easily fall into fascism. As I have seen this movie, almost every day the political spectrum can hear similar opinions from people on both sides. This movie merges in a raw, frequent mismatch of America's former political scene. I was both impressed and depressed that this relevant (and yes, correct) some 30 years ago was further illustrated. If you take a more neutral view of the movie and want to believe that it can not happen here, see our "enemy fighters" some Guantanamo Bay, see more closely, secret spying CIA secret prisons and similar events in 1979 (this film is made in Greensboro, NC After 8 years)
