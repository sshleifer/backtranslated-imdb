Yes, I noticed that there are 347 other comments, I think it is a good sign for a movie, even if someone is negative. I saw this movie 25 times a day. I will worship it and see it again. It's smart, but I understand why some people will hate it. They do not get an appeal to it. Yes, my movies contain a weird taste, but it's a great movie. Some of the lines are very fast, like the whole scene of Chinese restaurants. I started to laugh That was when he talked in conjunction with the assembly line. The Jude law was wonderful, although it was ridiculous, he tried to cover his wonderful accent. However, I do not consider myself a film goddess as some critics of this movie, and if you do not have anything better than writing disguised film-based films of your hate-hate movies, I am sorry for you. Why do not you write about movies like me? I just love that everything is related together, it guides you, even if you guess wrong. The last was interesting, and not overdone. It was purely tricky. I think people will get wrong ideas then because I do not compare it to matrices. I went to this movie and hoped nothing except Jude Law and a scientific fixture. I was flying away. I have no idea about any other Croatian movie, but I love it. Another cute thing was foreshadowing with dogs. See this movie clearly.
