Hillary was great as Julie, and Pat again m Miyagi was superb, but the other three films should have been mentioned more! Come on, come on! First off, where is Daniel ?? Miyagi mentions about him very briefly and this is about it. Daniel was his best friend and at least made a look in the film. Julie could help in Manga train! Next to the flip, though the movie was true with the film Pann-Fluthuth, with some instruments for Fretless Baass! If you do not hear the pan-flute, it does not look like a karate kid movie! Thanks jumphi! Overall, though a decent movie! We miss you Noriyuki!
