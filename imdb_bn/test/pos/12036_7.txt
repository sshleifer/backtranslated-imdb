All right, when the plot comes, this movie is trustworthy and a bit stupid. Yet despite many of its deficits, the film is managed - if you close your brain and enjoy its lively self. If you can not, you probably will not like this movie too much. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery starred a man residing near Arctic Circle in one of the weird plots of 1930. Wireless Station It is uncertain how accurate he is in this remote outing, but such a very unique and isolated existence comes to an endless string of guests - even though he had been there for years, yet he saw anyone without Eskimos. <br /> <br /> At first, when their plane crashed, Reginald Owaee and Mirna reached the rhythm. They are supposed to be on the way to Montreal - they have faith outside of that course! Reginald is really worried about Montgomery, who is really concerned about Montgomery, because Robert has not seen a woman for a long time, and Oven think Montgomery is going to steal the fame for himself. As Montgomery, that's exactly what his plan is! For a long time, you can not really understand why the loane was involved with the oven - as he became attractive like sogi bread. <br /> <br /> Soon, Loy and Montgomery fall in love but all of these things are gone, outside the blue, the old drunkard of Montgomar announces to marry her! For more than two years, he never wrote and refused to follow him, Montgomery seems to have naturally ended the relationship - but suddenly enough of the chips and boring drunk is enough to destroy the fate and Montgomery plans. <br /> <br /> All of these are resolved which you can only see for yourself. For the film, the plot that is very stupid and transformed - I can not protect it. But, this is quite funny and charming and I see this picture as a comedy which is just one step or two below the contemporary movies like the linking up baby. Silent, little but very charming It is valuable especially despite not being reliable.
