I graduated from college after my first 20 years of age, when I appeared in the film. It looks like the high quality of the film (as proof of its many awards), but it was very influential because of its position in the historical context of 1959. Since then, due to social progress, it is almost impossible that in 1953, only college students started to get started (carefully screened). A mainstream, almost entirely black-cast with high-budget excellence was an independent novel in 1959. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Almost all the black entertainers that we were white people were the knowledge of the movie. Gershwin's music, performed well, and the story's intense universal humanity was going on suddenly. <br /> <br /> I recently was able to get a faded copy of the film's two hours of cutting, and my opinion confirmed the repetition. It was astonishing at what seemed to be the steamy sexual scene in 1959, but the quality of the musical instruments did not diminish. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are skilled in their screenplays. Today's young black artists are not able to see the actor at the top of their staff, any crime!
