Often with the best of three stog shapes, short of 'Bride's Gum' is one of the best shorts in the trinity, just like any of the curls. Lots of memorable Stooge moments The best example of Shape Howard's best example is open-ended with Professor Shape open, unreasonable and unexpected, Miss Dunkelmeier (D. Greene), singing his horror and voicing his voice against his progress. Many people consider him the most usual fun of Stughes. Later, when Ma and Larry tried to help find his wife (and claimed $ 500,000), Shempe thinks that he has cut his head while chasing his mirror. Fixing the mirror, she cried with relief, "I was there ?? and beautiful as a picture!" "Yes," the ladder quickly responded, "An APE!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). Misunderstanding him for a long time lost "cousin Bailil", he did not allow him to embrace and kiss him (creating a cheerful point between Hole and Larry), explaining his true identity. Suddenly, the original cousin Basil phoned and said, he is becoming poor, repeatedly killing him and blaming him, "poor, helpless ?? disabled people?" When that final line socks him in the jaw (According to Shamp and crew members, with a real fist), he was fully executed by the door and Holly. "What happened, baby?" Md asked. "Can I help if I'm not a cousin?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The great Emil Citka distributes his classic line (pictured on his tomb), "Hold hands, love birds," his apartment has been trashed. <br /> <br /> When I think of the Bride's Groom as the medicine for any person, the year left the glory of Stooges when Quila left. True, there was no big shorts like Chelsea's group with Chem's group, but it was due to the growing lack of support for Colombia and his (and others) advances. When the shape was healthy and given suitable material to work with the three, they were at the top of their play.
