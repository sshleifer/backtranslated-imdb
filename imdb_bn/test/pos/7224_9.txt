Tromeo and Juliet are probably the best Shakespeare modernization I've ever seen, have many competitions, but anyway ... <br /> <br /> All of them, Tromeo and Juliet are certainly one of Troma's best movies, one poodle is a large hip hidden little pearls. It's a fun, action-packed, Gary that takes the world's greatest love story, but still follows the real story behind such a movie. Well, outside of completion, where Tromso and Juliet kill Juliet's offending father, and live together with children who are comfortable with their children in the happy suburbs for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> This movie should show high school literary classes instead of reading hundreds of poor students and hundreds of Shakespeare scripts. Thumbs up!
