I think there was too much system till the end? Do not you think? Romance, adventure which told me to say 9 in this movie, but the workplace was too long. I like a bit of writ. I did not understand why he would die. I thought one of the girls would die but lucky! I do not like any other! What about you What do you like? I actually saw the movie twice. And after that I bought that too. It was worth it! Do you like the best (person)? The book was really really really cool. And actresses and actors too. Everything was perfect ....... What was the name of the song till the end? Anyone will answer my question ... please, please?
