OK I identified this spoiler so I do not mind when wrapping this. Now I went to the movie to expect to see a very expected movie. And I was right, almost since I almost never saw that every horror flick was predictable but not as bad as it was. What helped the story, I did not want to be "why" for Kane's madness. But during the fog and you still got the idea and understand the madness Now of course if you like something that scares you for the night, it's not your movie. But if you do not see any foundation or any other movie that claims their reputation, thanks to the tragic content it is a movie. Now where I really throw in a spoiler for a second warning. I can give this movie 9 because I'm probably a fan of WWE and a fan of Kane, but it does not like a star when it loves someone. But if this movie could score 10 for me then . . (spoiler) ----> At the end of the film, when he saw the dead by buying this scene. The dog behind the dog was "the cottage", why it could be classic with the class / classic and quickly turn around. A perfect 10 will be rewarded if that happened. This was a perfect opportunity, but WWE did not have any idea or the future signal would start in that sequence. Here's the end. (9)
