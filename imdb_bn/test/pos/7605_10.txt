'Cover Bain Kidad' is a true movie. If you have not seen it yet, then rent it. When I release it when I release it I'm going to buy it. Drew Barrymore again looks nice, he took his part well. I think I can join this film because the days in school I was right. I thought the plot was well written, comedy and romance which I liked in movies. I love the end because you know what's going to happen, even though it's still sitting on the edge of your seat - waiting !!
