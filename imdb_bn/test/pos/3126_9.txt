Wagon Master (1950) Deer: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: ARROGO PHOTOS / RADIO PHOTOS <br /> <br /> John John Ford to create a Western film in the Utah Desert in the Utah Desert Came. Out with this classic classic. No John Wayne, no contradictory hero, no psychic exploration, no fireworks, a picture of a jewel. <br /> <br /> This accessory is generally called Ben Johnson (as Trevies) and Harry Carey Junior (Sandy) The horse traders who come to the city to do some business, just as a group of Mormons is headed out under the leadership of Word Bond. This group is going to begin their journey towards their settlement, but they know that discrimination and hard terrain are against them. So they hire Travis and Sandy as the Wagon Master for their trip. How they travel and take away their presence as the "daughter" in Darling Clementine and Joan Drut, with traveler drug salesman and his two female joint forces (Alan Morrrez took over as a doctor). Tension is added when the killer Clegg arrives at Gang Wagon Train. And there is a Holiday (Hollywood) meeting with Navajo. <br /> <br /> Most stories and comedies are driven by ideological / cultural clashes; Among the first of the tragedies and sandy and mormons, in ward bonds (he was trying to impose his curse for continuous curse and became a reformed person), between doctors and women and mormones, between the wagon trains and the exterior and finally, everyone and the Navajo. There is also a classic Ford scene of a scary dance that reveals one of the signs of civilization coming to the border. <br /> <br /> Again, there is no Duke, but I have found Ben Johnson, especially young, has a compelling screen presence on his own, cocksure Ben Johnson. He came with his own back, with that drill and when you saw him that he was making himself a cavalier. He demonstrated his first achievement here is great here. Harry Carey Jr., although he wandered for a few years by this time, is still quite raw at times, but he is liked. Word Bond is its usual surprising, dust soul. I found Joanne Drru to be a drag to see him whatever he is, but here he is merciful unreasonable. Other familiar faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford, and Hank Warden, playing 'fools', as they do after a few years as inventors. It's not any more engaging here. <br /> <br /> Ford collaborator Bert Glennon often sees some spectacular B & O photography. Landscape and horizons are not only visible to the general masterclass, but also in some scenes with shadows and sunlight. Soundtrack legend Country Music Group, The Sons of the Pioneers. Can not get more than one cowboy. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ out 4
