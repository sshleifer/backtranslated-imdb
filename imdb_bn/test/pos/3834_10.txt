It will be one of my favorite episodes from the original TV series. <br /> <br /> This is a romantic war with the Roman commander and Kirk and the battle against Marc's action. Afterwards, Lennard, playing on TV's episodes and movies, spoke to the father of the speaker. This is an event where around the talent level pink around, and the Shatna, the dime and the whole cast provide an exceptional performance of this episode. <br /> <br /> I love writing and plots as well, and I love the direct method used to show our characters, and the feelings and thoughts of those characters, and how the actors express themselves independently. <br /> <br /> This very entertaining episode 10 out of 10!
