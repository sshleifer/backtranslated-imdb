Here is a movie that is about the best performance, and a strong turn from the three major major performances of Huffman and Hughman from Julia Roberts, which spell me in the first few seconds, it is the performance that produces the stars to lift, and for the duration Keep it <br /> <br /> In addition to one or two very few problematic problems with scripts, the only thing to reduce this movie is technical direction, many bad ones (empty continuity) and many cameras "cheats" that do not work. It's wonderful for a comedy movie and it's a little annoying to see, but it does not destroy the otherwise well-crafted film.
