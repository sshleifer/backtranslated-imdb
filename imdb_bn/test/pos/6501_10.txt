Just saw this film at resfest and was float. I have never been a big fan of scratching, but this film has bound me from the gateway. It is listed as a documentary, but does not really feel like one. (I can not remember the last thing when I had fun watching a documentary). It's a style and a power that refreshes, insightful, and not very promotional. Production quality was up too much. (Film shot with cool cut and an amazing soundtrack). Overall a smart, entertaining, and illuminated piece.
