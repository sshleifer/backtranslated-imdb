Ali G. Characters works wildly in the range of a comedy show, but as a movie, it does not work the same way. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong - it's a very interesting movie, full of diverse, diverse conversations, that the modern British charm of the characters is pretty good, giving viewers a ridiculous, if unrealistic story. <br /> <br /> One problem with this movie is that the script and the content are fantastic, or it's embarrassing to see. When I feel embarrassed, I do not think any la office or extra mockery is fun, rather you want it to be included in the final cut. An example of this is, after the end of the music video, "we do this." Whenever I see the movie, it ends up stopping the DVD, and release it. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Inhahos is a good movie, which is worth watching for several times. The script is an enjoyable, and there is no problem in the way it is played. However, modification here is the original word. <br /> <br /> Ali Ji is a good television program. Borat is a good movie.
