When I read a summary of "Messiah" in the Television Directive, I was not ready for the shop. The story follows the DCI Metcalel, trying to solve the deadly murder case across London. He can soon understand a pattern, loose is a serial killer, 12 apostles and their assassins are similar to those who are sent to join them in the killing of people with the same name and work. The two parts series kept me at the edge of my seat, closely following the metalkol, followed the killer, but he was always missing in a few seconds and discovered the terrible world behind his unfortunate prey. "Messiah" can certainly cause many debates, but it is the BBC's longest-ever play.
