This flick was even better, 'wait for Gaffman'. The great power of these two films is a guest and the bright character starring Levi's second second-second city troop. If anyone finds this movie annoying or vain, then Allah helps, they did not get it. It's a mockumentary, which has a talent for guests and levy. At the end of the movie, the dog lover of the guest's house tells us that he went to Israel to relax after the ceremony to work in the 'caboose', or when he told us that ventrilucism is an ancient art and we can see a hieroglyphic <br /> <br / > There was a small ancient Egyptian in the hands of an ancient Egyptian, I realized that it was such a moment To live the life. Thanks Mr. Mr. Gust and Mr. Levi, and God bless you.
