A man comes to a strange, beautiful, wild city where no one feels emotional and emotional rather than an interior design. The essential equality of his day 'GroundGay Day' is memorable; Curious paragraphs of this world and reminded the word of 'Being John Malkovich'. But in fact, it is a Scandinavian film, a part of the scandal which is also in Scandinavian style: The tone is unstable, and even the most spectacular scenes are played directly, dare to laugh at irrationality. I think, the combination is not completely successful: there is not enough real laugh to compensate for the problem of taking piece as a pure play. It is of course original; Perhaps I do not accept that my problem is scoffing the earth. I probably have to go to Scandinavia!
