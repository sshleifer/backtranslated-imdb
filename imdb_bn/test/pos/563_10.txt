Very good film Very good documentary <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br />> I tip my lid to Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent man in 911 commission or inquiry? Our game of integrity, patience, intelligence, transparency and self-confidence need to fight against world politics and big business. <br /> <br /> All the night comes out on the streets - Horace, Scank Pussie, Bagger, Rhinos, Parli, Dopers, Junkies, Sick, Venal. One day the real rain will come and wash all these dirt in the street. Pat McGunessness will be the first drops of that real rain. People controlling this world are animals They will drown. <br /> <br /> I'm just shock. Walking at night is a terrific business. Inhuman sunny and cackling is a detective in Murder on Sunday morning. Pat McGuinness' brilliant spotlight, they get scared terribly, horribly guilty, and ready for the sinking right and terrible. <br /> <br /> This is a world where panchers run a scandalous game, it is extremely satisfying. See the justice and see the people of the cruel people who are drowned like fat. <br /> <br /> How do you think it's railroad, hateful, graduate law? How does it feel your rigged prosecution, your rigged confession, your rigged detective job is not found for what it really is? How does it feel? <br /> <br /> I hope it is a knife knife that you are sad, one sight.
