Can I remember the college professor how this movie disturbed, it reflects the apathy of the teenager (it was before Generation "X"). [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Consumer culture; The kids in this high school spend time, thinking about the body being raised and left behind the river. <br /> <br /> What will they do today? Things will be different? Some very important questions. There are some nice scenes with Keanu Reeves and he lives with the helpless family; His 11-year-old brother is going to be lost! Mom does not know - spend time with her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This picture was a little earlier than its time, it solves the problem of American society of lower class; These kids had no outlet; Is this dirty water available for them in the city? . All the interesting social commentary is presented, and there is no solution. 9/10
