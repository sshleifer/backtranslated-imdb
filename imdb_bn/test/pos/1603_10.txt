Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: please. There is no attempt to 'capture' this image. Nothing (definitely) happens where I love the movie. Harjog's 'Aguiraye, Dar Jaran Gottes' got similar discomfort, though the film was less credible, because the mountains were at the beginning of the story, so it was to focus on the nature vs. kisski. Monte is a Venezuela completely different, although he has several measurements, counter, etc. In fact, when the luggage is lost, the point reaches its grand finale (starting with its final crop), while in the moment of travel, he imagines the Polish family to cherish Tadjivo's hair. <br /> <br /> If you want, find some real signal / symbol from here, from the moment he arrives, watching TDGio at the end, the whole movie's content and form are completely in sync), but there is no reason to do this No: It will not make the movie even better or worse, since its forces lie in the whole storyline, which is never made clear. We know this as a ton of history, the loss of Europe, the end of the 'romantic era', which has been proven since its inception (personal emotion and expression is now more important than ever). But wait, now I'm starting to develop a small (small) error of my film: 'Let's talk about the industry.' Now do not have to do one thing. I believe I can express myself in other ways. Moreover, I believe that it has become very clear in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not like clear films. I can read books, so I do not want a storyline that talks only with my rationality. I like words that you can not explain in words, but only in movies (Lynch's Lost Highway, Hanging Rock and Wing Man Who Hugh Ho Who Ho Hei Weir Picnic), then, and then there is only one reason why not only as a book As film and existing. So what about Thomas Manna's novel? I did not read it, but forgot it! The film gives a different point of view: It is something that you can never say in a book. Using film and art to experience it through pictures and music, the same thing that you think uses text. Equally bright, but in a different world.
