I have seen this movie quite regularly in most life and it is not old. All sniper comments and humiliation (mostly from David Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a giant heart. And this movie has been fun for all these years. <br /> <br /> Life is attacked by Big Tom Kalhan (Brian Denheehi), son of master car parts salesman, and everything on Tommy Kalahan (Chris Farley). But after his death, on his wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt and that it will buy Roy Jalinski (Dan Acroids), a car's car partner. So to save the company, Tomy has to go to the street to sell the company's new breakpad. Alongside the journey, although not as usual, Richard Hayden (David Spade) is Tommy's former classmate who was the right hand of Big Tom. <br /> <br /> This film is based on two SNL stars, Chris Fary and David Spade, who is about chemistry (and best friends in real life). They have enough comic power to power both of them. It's big, smart guy versus smart little guy. It works, and some of their views are unforgettably fun. Farley and Spade as well as well-known dramatic actors. Though the film is primarily a comedy, but it has dramatic fate, but it is also good to have a splash and especially for the Perry viewers. <br /> <br /> Forgive me, but I have Chris Farrell to talk a little more. I've read about his biography ("Chris Fary Show: A Biography in Three Witches", who is caring), and this movie made me more especially to understand who Chris was in real life. Chris Farley is a really good person who fought, and eventually failed to conquer his addiction. Although this was the first movie she had a big role, it was her best film. It really showed who he was, and how talent he was. To add to the story of Chris, another layer has been added to this movie, although it does not make it less fun. <br /> <br /> matches a good cast on the fairy and spade screen. Rob Loew is quite thin as Tommy's "new brother", and Bo Derek is strong as his step-mother. Brian Dennehy as Big Tom is great. It is believed in Danhe that they are the father's father. Big Tom is crazy just like his son, though he is more skilled and more mature. Dan Akroyd gives her one of her best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy Hard Truth behind the advertisement. Julie Warner also liked Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the cool comedy managers. He keeps speed and energetic speed, but most importantly, he knows how to make fun of the comedy. He does not fool the jokes, and he realizes what funny actors are doing and he can do it. But Segal is one step ahead. He is friendly to "Tommy Boy", almost nostalgic tone, which makes both heartfelt (really) fun and makes fun. <br /> <br /> The critics did not like Tommy Boy. Shouting for them. No film would be funny to be very sophisticated or confusing intellectual (God forbidden Farrell and Spade was forced to make the silent comedy "La" office). This is a great movie and my best favorite of all time.
