I was not expecting much from this story of children, whose period has been stolen by a movie script. Then he travels to Holivides .. but .. Hey ... it's still a funny picture. Frankie Muniche of "Malcolm In Middle" is quite popular as her baby and her friend is very good as a friend. Yes, this image works as an advertisement for Universal Studios Theme Park and is really a silly children's film .. But I've enjoyed it in any way. Grade: B-
