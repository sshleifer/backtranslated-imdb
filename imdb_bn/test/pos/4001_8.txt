Chi-Hawa-Singh (pictured fire) describes the life of Korean painter Jang Seong-ub in the late 19th century through the changed political landscape of Korea. <br /> <br /> However, the themes of this movie center are artistic creation by the desire of the artist and the fire of expectations and demands of their audience and society. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jang Singh-ub played skillfully as a skilled character who changed the youth's innocent tension. Strong alcoholic abused soul This character portrays a young emerging artist who makes it more difficult to call the soul of artistic creation in itself without putting creative fire through water, creator, and desire. <br /> <br /> While the development revenue of this character is gradually reduced through film, Jang's mental complexity is still continuously disrespectful towards the end of the film. Interestingly, the film's montage is transmitted from one time and place to another, without any conventional 'signal' to the viewers in parallel to this continuously variable and seemingly wild emotion or artistic fire. For example, mediocre interaction in some other place and location will seemingly change many scenes. The picturesque scenery of the picture is nicely presented and black and white scenes (and probably silent) are more colorful and living environments that parallel the white paper's white black color or jungle images with color. Colored children enter the film as if the artist is reflected in nature and especially after the women's paintings. <br /> <br /> The theme of the personal wish of an artist is created to maintain the expectations of the artist and the needs of the society. Movies through different points, including differences in film, government authority over artists, acceptable rules of artistic aristocracy and original desires of the general public. Rather than making his own original work, Jang saw himself restoring the best artists of other artists in East Asia. <br /> <br /> I want to know that I was more familiar with the political events of this time, how strongly it relates to the story - but without any comparisons than the present. I can not comment on the Korean government's role in artistic expression and / or censorship. <br /> <br /> Overall, a well-liked movie and movie image is often exciting. Seeing on a great film and then thinking over.
