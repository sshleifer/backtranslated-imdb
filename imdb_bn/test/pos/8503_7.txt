So Dark the Knight has become a difficult challenge: it is very difficult for people who do not see it at the expense of writing it for free. Since it remains quite unclear, it is only included in everyone. Director of the film Joseph H. Who is familiar with Luis, is the well known title of Silent Chakra? Crazy Crazy, The Big Combo, Even My Name Julia Ross, which is similar to her childhood ?? As a strange choice. <br /> <br /> For beginners, it works as a game of playful French countryside. Steven Gary, a middle-aged detective in Paris's Surrey, went out to spend the holiday in Ste. Margot (or perhaps Margaux). Most unexpectedly, he thinks he is in love with the dog (Michalhay Chyal), even though he hates the local farmer. But it is difficult to resist the Syrian song in Paris, so despite her age discrimination, she agreed to marry him, which inevitably became the city's name. <br /> <br /> <br /> But on the night of their colleague party, he failed to get away. Soon, find her body by a hunchback river. His jealous, rational suspect of the jilted lover, but he is found very dead. Then come to pass anonymously note which threatens more death. For the first time in his career, Greree crushes himself .... <br /> <br /> A particularly weak script, but the movie does everything; It has crossed the murder of Roger Acrood like the bad Colonel Olurich. But Luis is proud of this proud car. She takes her time to start, but then the story ?? And telling the story ?? Get momentum (lazy, while script is breaking the letter). Bernat Guffei's photo has been enlightened and photographed, outside of Pierrering's an attractive Lettmottie and barrels in Windows; Hugo Friedhofer also has an effective score, which provided a great deal of danger to many enemies. The talent at The Night The Night is a good deal, but in the end it boils not more than a hostage ?? And that's not a very good hostage. This is a strategy of a movie. <br /> <br />
