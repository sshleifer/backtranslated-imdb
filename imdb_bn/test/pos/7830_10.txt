It's one of the fun movies ever made. And if you do not get it, it's supposed to be fun. So often comedy thinks so deliberately funny that it misses it, but eventually a movie that succeeds in the most fine way to be sunny. Even "spoofs" lack the fundamentality and natural feelings of this film. This is a comedic classic which will definitely be appreciated at other times when the studio is regularly performing this type of thing. A trick to the makers, and a ridiculous fine cast of actors with Isaac Wade, whose performance is top-genuine. In fact, a truly break-out star performance by a real underrated stage actor. This guy will be great to see to get his deserve.
