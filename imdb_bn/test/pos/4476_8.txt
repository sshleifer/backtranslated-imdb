A nice story by the filmmaker. Interaction between man and leopard raised many questions to the mind of the viewers, who were just human. Animals are alive only animals kill for no reason. At the end of the film you think that the movie's real "hero" was. Tell a good story. The human actor did a great job but the leopard stole it every view.
