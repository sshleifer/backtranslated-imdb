Not a bad movie, but a 10-year-old boy in an early scenario might be working without full nudity. This movie has excellent dialogs; Which is of course general in foreign movies. Foreign actors still know that those CGIs, stunts and special effects that oppose American actors do all the work for them. This film is just good old fashion acting. Gerarde DePardieux has always done an excellent job as well. Dresses and scenery are accurate with time. My only complaint is that instead of using subtitles, the French should have dubbed the words; This could be because I just hate reading subtitles.
