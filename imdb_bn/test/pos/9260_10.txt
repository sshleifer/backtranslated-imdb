Following NBC's nearly 7-year rocket road, it decided to make one last super installment. The series has been thanked several times that it is not a number that qualifies as a block-blast on the TV. It was always a big, hard core of the followers of Hard Corps. <br /> <br /> It was like the series "Mr. In-Between", with a full headline of "Series: Life on the Stretch" (1993-99). It was too big to cancel, but a case of 'Robid Rating Raving' is too small to get. <br /> <br /> During the uncertain term on Friday evening, they presented some of the best and bold artisticist's overly dramas. There, I said it is artistic, artistic !! But please remember, we think that articulation is not just a fool, a friendly, a pedantic, and a politically correct publicity. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was sure that it was the end of the line of "threat". ; This super episode was made for TV movie this 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Looking at the events of all past seasons and parallel to the regular characters, the production team comes out and gives us proof of a super. <br /> <br /> Our story? ????? We join the story, we see that Baltimore Homicide unit commanding officer Lie. Al Giardelo has "pulled the pin", retired from his job. But 'G' is not really ready to retire. So, instead of a rock chair and a fishing rod, we have seen that Al-Ultimate City is going to the mayor. <br /> <br /> While some outside the city stopped some campaigns and lectured, a former detective Lieutenant takes the bullet of a murderer. Living, but in a Comatose state, was taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news is spread quickly and officially called, we discover all the detectives in Baltimore's unit seeing our service and the shot shown to provide assistance. All these former and current incursions follow a pitch and the possibility of each lead and a lead chance at a large meeting. <br /> <br /> The producers found ways to deal with those who died earlier. Story is their memory. They are directed to answer some long standing questions and even present something here to the illiterates. The whole story series is one of the most satisfying and original ways to wind up. But at least now, we will leave it as "classified". <br /> <br /> Everything is clean, inserted into small packages, this TV movie must be our approval. Grading is a "threat movie", we have to give it an A or A +, too. But, here's not a matter of grade, it does not score as high as a normal weekly episode.
