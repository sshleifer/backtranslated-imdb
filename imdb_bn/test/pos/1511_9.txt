A series of very violent sequences involving a plot that describes the most notorious year of filmmaker Lucio FÃ¼ller in the film "Cat in the Brain". The film can also be seen as a dark comedy, a violent movie that effectively affects various demands due to violence in real life. Phulasi goes even more than that, she carries herself as a star, the central image of the film thus shows the audience that the people behind the cinematic Gore "Bit In The Brain" is a clear story presentation and it is not followed. Instead of making fun of some of the cliches that surrounded this horrible stream for several years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beginning to reach Gradually, steak and meat began to hate him, his colleagues asserted to Phukchi that there was something left for his needs. But it does not help and soon the extraordinary ideas for his movies begin to frustrate his daily thoughts. Trying to find a remedy for the emotional state of his dangerous psychological condition, Lucio is going to the local psychologist. Unfortunately, it makes mistakes even better and Fuchichi is dumped into even bigger worlds, such as a psychotherapist becomes a psychopath, who imitates murder in real life from Fulchi. <br /> <br /> This picture holds everyone the Italian splatter movie trademark, good or bad they all are here. So no comment about acting or technical aspects and budget restrictions is quite irrelevant as the film quality. This is a visual experience, there is no doubt about it. The violence in an incredible amount of Fulci easily passes most of the things he's made. Chainsmanship, Cancerism, Child Mortality, Distorted by Depression, Some Exciting Works That Appeared "Cats In Cats" Some of them are clearly recycled from movies on low-profile profiles, but they can not stand out of context and actually feel quite at home here. Before filming, rather than a serious piece, I have just mentioned it as a continuous mockery. Some of the violence helps establish the idea that something is presented. These scenes are rejected after climax according to the reality of the movie, due to being actually visible in scenes inside the film that indicates the flower character. "Film-in-film" presentation Some of these types of Gore's effects are less. But by no means makes it easy to watch movies. Oh no, this is a lot more than the level of Gore found in the horrors of mainstream and above and the Gorehounds will doubtless be satisfied with this fact. <br /> <br /> <br /> People hate her work or love it. "Cat in the brain" will not satisfy any of the opponents of the opposite, but it is an interesting part of his film. One that fans should really check out.
