Charlotte Bell is a full time nurse in an isolated country psychiatric hospital. He is a motley group of crazies and is faced with a seemingly crazier supervisor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, acting is excellent, my favorite acting by Betty Chandler as Alison Enmophomenic. Just jump right off the screen. You probably do not say "it's just a movie, it's just a movie", it's not terrible, but it should appeal to any horrible fan who respected the low-budget version. Making a vague film in low budget and succeeding in some successful ones is very difficult. AX is looking at another cheap film that's looked at. Perhaps the major budgets of recent films are so damaged by people that there is no good effect on a film and / or there is no chance for a movie viewer to be considered as a classic. But I think after watching this movie, they will see how low the cost of the budget is important and this film is a classic among any junkies.
