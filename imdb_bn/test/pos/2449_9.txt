I feel privileged to have seen this movie accidentally. I actually ran across this movie by accident. I taped another movie in Shotayem one night, overnight and this movie came later. So I sat and saw the boy fly. Acting is absolutely fantastic Kathy Betts ... After Missy and Fried Green Tomatoes, congratulations to my favorite actress, who is trying hard to keep her old school values ​​(religion, family) at risk of isolating her family. Martin Shane is "tough" as gorgeous as the father, who does not really control some of his life or family. What I really like about this movie is how it is said when the heroes come home. It shows the true damage to our soldiers after fighting in vain battles for political and financial gain. This movie has thrown me away and I watched this movie abusively and saw it. It must be seen for someone who wants a real drama, it is not very mutual and promotional, but your heartfelt is not like any other
