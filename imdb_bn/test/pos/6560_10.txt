I'm a horror movie scary, and this has to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks I've ever seen. The platinum is completely original (which one recognizes a city whose death and dementia are completely obscure with a certain symbol?), Special effects are amazing, and the film image can not be better. Some may find it annoying, but this does not mean it's a bad movie. It makes a good point. The spiral symbol is kinda omnipresent. Spiral notebooks, spiral seashells, spirals on cakes One of the best choices they could use (squares, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle) was one of the best choices. If you can find this movie, you will definitely see it. It is certainly unique, and quite unforgettable.
