Realistic master-piece Thirty years later, the pictures may look a little old, but in fact, the effect of 'a little mouth' on the impact of the movie is right. I have never seen such a movie in my whole life. For the first time I saw it, I do not know whether it was a fiction ... and could not see it ... that movie is a wonderful composition that every person in the world will see. This is the best critics movie of all time. The final movie shows that the system is down. And the system has not changed much in thirty years. I will watch this movie as an education piece.
