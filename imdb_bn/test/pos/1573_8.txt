Writer-director Dean Bell offers a number of wonderful and engaging moments in this cool but compelling road movie. His conversation was sparkling, and his use of very small flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure. <br /> <br /> The heart of the film is Elise's character, who is running away from his new England to get a great effort to get Florida. Alongside the road, he travels with a pair of discreet, bills and sandra, who incredibly tries to dismiss Alice as a money-earning prostitute on a truck stop. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is exciting as a new Alice playing her first screen. The choice of his character is not a false note. But the film is the most valuable for the impressive yet sensitive character of the movie, as created by Jadith Ivy. Ivy On-Camera Which Virtually Has A Specially Sly Subtext At Every Moment As an observer, I stopped myself tapping, hit the round, and tried to understand psychological subtleties for reviewing its scenes. <br /> <br /> The image raises the following questions about the character: Bill and Sandra are good Samaritan, or are they preferring to young Alice an evil pair of Dickensian hunters? One of the strengths of the film is that it never fully answers the question. Alice is more confident about her experience with Bill and Sandra. But is he really good man? <br /> <br /> Part Comedy, Part Street Pictures, and Part Plays, This carefully created movie has succeeded in connecting us with many levels.
