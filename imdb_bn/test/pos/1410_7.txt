At the same time John Russell Wrench is trying to liberate his good brother Claude Akins from Sheriff John Wayne in Bravo, he was playing the Rananch owner Nathan Bardet. He is working on the other side of television law. This year, probably the high point of Russell's career, his most famous screen role and the role of his most famous television is Larsman's Lion's Marshall Dan Troop. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James Orans did it in Dodge City on the Gunsmoke. Unlike Gansouk, Laramie never created such a small letter that gives you the feeling of Dodge City. Instead, Russell takes care of his business and his desired young deputy Peter Brown focuses on learning the business of law. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mr. Troop. He was quite easy with a shooting iron, but was prone to be impulsive. The good thing was that Marshall was around the trump. <br /> <br /> Another series was the regular Russell of Laramie, played by legacy Peggy Castle. This is where Lawman corresponds to most Gunsmoke. Russell and Castle had a vague understanding that even the smallest children could not even miss. When the law enforcers were the first child I was not young. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Peggy Castle created the problem of substance misuse after the law and order. I think that it has exceeded its smallest memorial in the first half of the seventeenth century. She was a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was the best one.
