Perhaps the real life story of the greatest football coach of all time. Nougat Rakne "Football Age" leads to the game of football, such as advanced pass and offensive formation counter. But he is probably known for his motivational locker room lecture. On the way, he brought fame and greatness from a small, little, unknown Catholic school in Indiana. His role in Pat O'Brien Rocken is impossible. Ronald Reagan's superb starring role, like the first of the dirty demo, the real superhero George Zip. <br /> <br /> For football football, this is the greatest football movie of all time. Benefit yourself and hire black and white versions. (For some reason the scenes have been deleted for some editions) If you have got a good version, then see the Jim Cameron's short cam, because he is telling the ball with his head stick in the locker room and his team has a few minutes left to start the second half.
