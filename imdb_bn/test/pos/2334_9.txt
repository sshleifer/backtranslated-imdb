I finally glad they released it in DVD. I bought the video tape several years ago and at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its formula is not original, but it is very interesting. I am very surprised that it was not higher on ratings. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite comedy. It's just a funny little flick that makes you feel better. And sometimes, that's all meant to be a movie.
