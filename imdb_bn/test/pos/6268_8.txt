God blesses Joe Di'Amata ... I love Italian horror, cheese (movie-based;), science-feeds etc. <br /> <br /> This confession was a bit difficult to see, but <br/> <br /> <br /> I said, "I usually enjoy bad movies I do, "but I like bad movie for bad guys. This is one of my top bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keef was a poor Canaanite, but hey, what fun Who can not have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hangglider and a cheesy rubber monster? It's good to hate this movie, if you just like Hollywood Drain like "Titanic" or "Beautiful woman", but if you really really love bad movies, check it out. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that makes fun of paying for beer beer or when you have some friends around you and are looking for some fun. <br /> <br /> My rating is 8/10.
