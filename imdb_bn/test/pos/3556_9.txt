I almost did not see 'hi-d-hi'! I think it has been the title that made me stop. In those days, the Welsh language versions of 'The Radio Times' were used to print headlines for specific shows without providing a scrap of information about what they were actually about. 'Hi-de-salutations!' I was advised about a bad quiz show directed by Leslie Crohrer or a more harmful change in the United States. But I could catch the next episode, and Jimmy Perry and David Kraft wrote it astonishing to see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " In the 60's, cheap air travel came along, these camps went along on the British coast, the labor class provided entertainment for the family and earned millions for their owners. <br /> <br /> (As a matter of fact, I've worked like a campfire like '80's - Barry Island, South Wales - known to everyone and known as 'Shag Land', because I'm not going!) <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> 50, it served as the entertainment manager of Maplein with the university's academic Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell), who was ill to manage. His staff resident comic Ted Boobie (Paul Shane), his Sidekick Spike (Jeffrey Holland), Sad Punch and Judy Man Paradise (Leslie Duier), Shanbee's Bollywood Dancer Barry (Barry Howard) and Yevgen Stewart-Hargreaves) Deeville Holland, and the unforgettable Gladys Pag (Ruth Doc), who wished after every opportunity for Fairbrother. Bubilee Po Pollard stole the show though cleaner Peggy Oleirshash, whose driving ambition was 'YellowCot' (all important staff members worn them). Several sexy girls have also grabbed these quotes, especially Nikki Kelly's' Silvia 'and the statue' Ricky Howard's' Betty '. We've never seen Joe Maplin, the owner. He contacted his staff as an undemocratic missile, which forced the poor Jeffrey to read aloud. "Hi-D-salutations!" The campers were well-wishers, usually 'Han-de-ho'! <br /> <br /> One fan was late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Kraft that he recognized most characters from real life. <br /> <br /> I always consider Bowiece as the most believable, as well as the most tragic, like Archie Rice, he is Comedian, whose big break never came, drunk the night to reduce the fork to the audience drunk. He took advantage of his position to pursue a few differences and cried out in a memorable episode of Fairbrother's patience: "False, Ted, all lies!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / Croft series, Cast was excellent, especially Cadell and Shane. Ruth's drug prize 'Gladys' in my nerves (An Anna Robinson hates Welsh!), But Leslie Dyer's incomparable 'Mr Parriys' and Felix Bonasese's jockey 'Fred Coolie' are more than compensated. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a visual gag. Looking at a real horse pantomime horse along the coast of Parartys. Seeing a whiskey bottle in his hand, he decides to hold a stick with him and instead of eating bananas! <br /> <br /> With its radioactive mix of 'Nostalgia' and 'Suvie Gag' of 50, 'hi-dehi' was a big hit for the BBC-1 in the 80's, resulting in a huge increase in booking for Botlin and Pontins Although Cadell abandoned to return to the theater and went away I have never accepted Clive Demister (David Griffin), the squadron leader. Bad, Leslie Dwyer looted a show of her best characters. Kenneth Conor came to replace him as 'Uncle Sammy'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes problems arise during this period; In one episode, Sylwia and Batte had to drown in the pool to rescue Peggy, because of which she was dressed as a shark. The tidiness they wore was wrong for the time. So why did they even look great among them? On the other hand, 'Dellilah' hit Ted Jones campers. It was not written until 1968 (by Les Reed and Barry Mason). <br /> <br /> Mapleins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was in the camp alone Peggy (now an Ielocot), blurred in the air and screaming (and what?) 'Hi-D-Hi!' <br /> <br /> I do not rate high rates like Perry and Croft's other shows, but its popularity is unreliable. It was probably one of the last British Citicos to create an extraordinary public affection, mainly featuring the preferred characters in an accredited setting. Good night camp!
