This movie is a very subtle argument and if you are searching something that you think of here, then you are right. Tim Robbins has done a great job and the result is a doc-drama that should be displayed in school (for the treatment of powerful themes). What about the actor? Well, they're simply great; Susan Sarandon is really 'love face' and almost always incredible as San Pen Absolutely must see!
