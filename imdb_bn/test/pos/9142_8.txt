I already gave my comment on this movie about Brucevi 3. Now I want to add something under Brucevi 13! Now after many days I saw so many so-called heroic bloody titles! But many people did not come in the action shown in John Woo! So after all these years, I think weird that "China White" is not getting its due credits! No version what you saw! The action is top notch! The city of amsterdam is very unique in China. You get a big district impression. But while in Amsterdam, I know that it is a small part of the red light district, which is a lot of Chinese shops and restaurants! But as a way to shoot the film, it looks like a big and important area where people do not know how to mess with the trades (Chinese mafia)! In addition to the action "China White" plays a compulsory gangster with some good acting! For this I will give Russell Wang credit! Very bad we do not see him too much, since he has many possibilities! To see the movie!
