This is the Australian TV series. This is a classic. The stories and actors are excellent. Who can attack a picker and his gramophone or cheetah? This TV culture Australian actors of the series were the best of their day and there was immortality among outsiders. I can tell what is timeless adventure. Music and songs are just superb. Clearing credits start by closing the wheel, then the sleeper sleeps asleep and then the longer shots are not much better. All 13 episodes are equally strong in the illustration of Australian mythology and I think there is a key in this series. It does not matter that the two main characters have come from abroad, I think the series is key and why it is so good.
