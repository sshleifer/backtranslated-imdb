Lackawanna blues and excellent movies. Welding was perfect. Each actor and actress they were perfectly suited for role role. Their chemistry together was amazing. Acting was fantastic. As I felt I knew the characters. I could almost 'feel' them. They remind me of the man that I knew as a child growing up in the 50's and 60's. Oh, memories !! My personal belief is that this film will have to be on the big screen to see everyone. I have seen this movie many times, since the characters have told them so I can read lines almost. I can not even even list my favorite section, because I have many favorite parts. Thank you for bringing back a piece of my youth that I never see in this day and age ... and black people love each other, respect each other, respect each other, take care of each other and we help each other You can Let's go now I will go watch it again
