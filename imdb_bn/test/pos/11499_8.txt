Some people continue to walk through life, not moving one thing or one person to another; Others, for some reason, depend on any other person or policy, and are irrational, whatever is committed for whatever - and metaphorically or literally they give their word and stand by it. But we are completely different, 'make different soils' because the film keeps a letter that makes life so attractive. Some people are simply crazy, though - and probably you want to stay in the public. Who knows? Who knows what it creates - life - work? Writer / director Lisa Kruger takes a shot from Hitra Graham as a little girl and herself as a 'committed' and how she became 'grateful', through a light mechanism to test a thin line in it. Strangely, committed, emotional and maybe a little crazy, too much. His name is Jolien, and this is his story. <br /> <br /> Of course, Jolain was always a promising person; Work, relationships, common life He does not matter to a woman who sticks it by her word. And when he marries Karl (Luke Liss Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to say Carl - and 597 days in the marriage, he has gone; Find yourself 'Close' and all the images in it. Jolin realizes that she is not coming back, she refuses to leave her or her marriage. Maybe it's because of the 'clay' it's made. Nevertheless, he left his home in New York City and set him to find out, which he did - in El Paso, Texas. But once he knows where he keeps his distance, gives him his 'space' and even does not tell him that he is there. He considers Carl as a 'spiritual coma', and it works to take spiritual care of him until his spiritual arrival. And when he sees and waits, his life is soft somewhere, a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velajouk), encounters a waiter with a local food; Carmen's 'Grammy,' (Alfonso Arau), who is a mysterious thing; T. Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver carl related; And Neil (Goran Bezigik) is an artist who creates and plays Pints. For Jolienne, it is a journey of discovery, during which he learn a lot about Karl, but learn more about himself. <br /> <br /> There are humor, romance touch and some insights into human nature. More about the character and character than this quirky film plot. And Kruger renders it all very well, a film that provides engaging and entertaining. His characters are very real people, all the needs, needs and imperfections that create human condition; A rich and eclectic bunch through which he tells his story. We see this from Jolien's point of view, because Kruger makes us aware of Jolien's thoughts and therefore his motivations, which he has given a specific perspective on the events of publication. Along with the deliberate motion, he can consolidate the atmosphere and the environment you create, creating a very effective part of the story. This subject has intrinsic affair, but Krudger likes to avoid heavy or very deep things, and focuses on the situation facing Jolien and the normal humor arising from human conditions. And as a result, we have lived a good textured, influential and vivid approach. <br /> <br /> Hilmar Graham made Jolienn his own character to keep this role from the first frame of the film. Creation He submits himself to the part and is convinced and trustworthy, which adds personal personalities and innovations, which make all the difference between a painting, which represents a person's mere representation and genuinely representation. And for this film to work, Jolline was bound to be effective and credible - and Graham succeeded on all the stages. The appearance of her screen was not more lucrative, and its vibrant personality or even the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you completely. It is a part of its created character; Jolin has an appeal that she faces her whole face, she has been inside and out. He is a lover, agreeable person, and you shared his intimate thoughts, because you know who he is. Graham took him so vividly from the best work around, from the way the character was written. <br /> <br /> Like Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is also fully involved. Her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she effectively uses her innate to create her character. He has a charismatic appearance, but less than the dazzling, and it gives him an attitude that gives interestingly down-to-earth. He is refreshingly open and forward; You think that Carmen is not one to hold a bit, but is completely honest in all words, and that too is part of his appeal. And, like Jolienne, this character is well written, and Veljuzze strongly believes in his life. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film's heart and soul has a significant number of performances. Luke Wilson, KC Aflex (like Jolien's brother Jayer), Garna Vinjic, Alfonso Aru, and especially Mark Raflow T-Bo, who rarely could make a memorable character with screen time. Supporting Cast: Kim Dickens (Jenny), Claude du Bel (mm), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexxis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Biker (Carl's Editor), and Mary Kay Place. (Psychiatry) included. A picture that says something about the value of going back to the map - big picture - who we are, where we are going and reflects what we need - 'commuted' is an enjoyable experience; Of course, a price is worth accepting. 8/10.
