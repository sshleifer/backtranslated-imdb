It's hard for me to explain this show to my enthusiastic friends There is a bunch of Spanish Daisy in my back that I lovingly called my "Chocolate Patch". My friends smile at me and look at me as my two heads. This series of DVDs is for us who are tenderly remembered with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really was a chocolate patch! Where children's TVs are violent cartoons, witchcraft or a sponge living in pineapple beneath the ocean, which makes the fun garden really teach us good values, it is implemented. <br /> <br /> I'll keep the darling memories of Carol and Palla and chocolate patch.
