Battleship Potemkin is the oldest film I've ever seen and the first silent film I've seen I've heard many good things in this movie so I got the tapes at home and I saw it. When it ended I just had it a classic masterpiece. The story is based on real life Russian ceasefire Potemkin. You do not feel like it but it was some sad and annoying. Sadness is that the mother dies and the pramars roam under the stairs and they continue to eat drunk meat with maggots. <br /> <br /> Today it is still considered one of the best silent and Russian movies. Never made I think everyone can see it (if they can find it.) You will be surprised at how well it is now. This is a classic to see. 5/5
