Looks like it's a Czech version of Pearl Harbor. This is the same story, both boys are in love with the same woman. And add to the wrap, the woman is actually married, whose husband is absent for a year. I do not think the story line is too strong. The little guy is quite naughty, that's tricky. It keeps watching me emotionally, and after another one of the lovely scenes. It affects some strong visual specials. Above all, love stories are combined together with stories. <br /> <br /> I think that if it is in English it will be such a big shot across the state. It is very bad that many people are open for foreign films.
