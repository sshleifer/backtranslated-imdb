"Life Force" is a truly amazing adaptation of Colin Wilson's novel "The Space Vympires", which is written by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jacobs. A collective American-British Space Exploration team discovers a mind-fool: A foreign spacecraft is resting inside Halley's Combat, out of which there are three bodies that look like human, one of them is beauty (Oh-so-greedy Mathilda May ). <<br /> <br /> They take these discoveries again with their own spacecraft. Big mistake <br /> <br /> This proves that people of these animals remove life from humans and American colonel Carlson (an intense, wide, and committed Steve RailSack) and British S. come. come. Colonel Caine (a solid Peter Firth) horror watch, an infestation of Washington overtakes London, balance with the fate of Earth. <br /> <br /> This picture certainly does not lack imagination. It sometimes comes a little slowly but provides many strange and fantastic ideas and eye-popping visual visions which can not be difficult. Director Tov Hooper's first film, Canon Films, has contracted three films (he rebuilt "Texas Chess Genocide II" and "Attackers from Mars"), he has created something truly unique. Including elements of science fai, vampire movies, zombie films and endless world sagas, this is something I have seen before. <br /> <br /> British actors like Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Abar Morris, and John Hall, supported by railroad and fats are so powerful. Mithila May is so scary, scary as memorable as Villains; It certainly does not hurt that its scene takes place in a great deal of naked. Music score is also valuable to none other than "Pink Panther" musician Henry Manzini. <br /> <br /> It's frustrating, but I think it's also fun. It's superb and soul entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
