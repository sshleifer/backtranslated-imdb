In 1940, in 1940, Robert Cummins, Lorraine Day and Jean-Muir's "One One Whose Sundari" star in 1940. Within one hour and 15 minutes, it seems to have been a B-movie. Cummings is a playboy, Redley Crane, with whom many women desire, two sisters, Kathryn and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Kathryn is making two more perfect people who like to fix cars, and blonde social butterflies with Helen's beautiful gowns. Ridley returned to the city and believed he would not go to a party, Helen decided to appear. As the party is offered by a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine into a pink dress. There are redlines, and two connections. But Ridley shows more inexperiencedness, and when he sees Helen at the dinner party, both of them go to Bachhen and a club. He became very drunk, and Helen refused to move to the first car because he did not give up his drive. After walking for a while and breaking the heel of the shoe, when he drives, he gets in the redlie car. He goes out, and he takes the wheel, accidentally hits it and kills a bike driver. <br /> <br /> Reddy does not remember anything, so Helen blames him for death. A woman's shoes are found in the heel's car, and Catherine sees her sister buried her shoes - plus, Hellen's methods can understand that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley is convicted and imprisoned, and Helen is married to a man he does not love and leave for South America. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, though at the time it was not list list. Cummings is playing a part playing Robert Taylor (it's an MGM film) - he's handsome and very durable, even if he does not look like someone like Taylor. Lorraine Day is my dear actress, MGM is constantly taking loans because of knowing what to do with somebody else. Why, I was surprised - an extraordinary actress and a very good face and voice, she portrayed a lot of pictures. This one is different. Her cathrine is determined, sympathetic and completely lovely. <br /> <br /> What was a beautiful actress? We all know if MGM is not. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended little gem.
