Prior to this clip, music videos were meant to show only one artist. Michael Jackson's "The Thriller" has created a whole new section of music songs that can be truly called mini-movies. Following a couple of "thriller" when they travel to a girl's room from a movie. The way they face the zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is where the zombie blows on the couple and the girl sees that Michael has turned into them. Then, they do not dance a little. The most awesome thing about "Thriller" is more fun and enjoyable than many movies it's made. Twenty years later it was a premiere music video. <br /> <br /> PSS. My Music Video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Gun N 'Roses "Sweet Baby" 3 - Nine Inches Nails "Close" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
