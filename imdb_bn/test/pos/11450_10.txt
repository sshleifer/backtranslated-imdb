I ignored this picture while going to movie store, but then the curiosity came to me and I decided to test it. I love it !!! The film begins with the headline of a Halloween party in Judy and Jean's abandoned funeral Pallar Hall House. Then we meet a few more characters, Angela and Suzanne (host), French, Max, Roger, Sal and Helen. Then of course they start the party and when they are in fact mood, they awaken a demon that awakens a demon. The monster Angela possesses and she begins her terrible slaughtering. Do they live on the giants night? <br /> <br /> The movie was great overall. Gourmet was fine, but nudity provided by Linna Quigley (trick from ROTLD) screwed it again. I would have had her a fan and not.
