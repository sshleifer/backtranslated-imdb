The era that was created in this era, and the obvious exploitation aspect is still one of the best B comedy of that time. <br /> <br /> You will see inspiration for most of this movie. "Retribution of the Nader", and in the same sequence of other films. The acting is mostly awesome, and Way Way to the Top, but I hope this is just like a movie. It lacks the ability to act in the way, it makes up with its camp value and is completely neglected for some of merit. <br /> <br /> Wonderful thing about this movie, it was probably some money that it went.

I do not dare to find at least in this movie that they feel funny, if not sunny.
