I saw a different version than the first person in the user comment section. <br /> <br /> It's really good ... Steve Jhan and Carl City are great together. The character of Wall Kilmer was similar to that of the novel, although emphasis was given to gasses and calls and classes. We call and get to see what happened with Newt's mother. I will not loot it, but it gives much insight into the call's character. <br /> <br /> All actors have done really credible work. Steve Jhan was the biggest challenge, I think, follow Robert Duval! There are a lot of action, humor, tragedy It has something for everyone. I can not wait till the wind, my family is all jealous!
