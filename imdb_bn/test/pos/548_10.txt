Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about our mother, Adel (Susan Sarandon) who hates them. This is how the movie starts. Adele decided that her and her daughter were leaving her husband without asking any questions without asking anyone. The story is about the relationship between mother and daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the great actress of the actress. Natalie was nominated for a Golden Globe for that role. One of the most gifted actress I've ever seen, and so is Sarandon. They really look like mother girl. The soundtrack is also great. The movie is incredible. 10 * 10 *
