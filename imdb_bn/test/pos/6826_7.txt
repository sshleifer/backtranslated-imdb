I do not understand the need to jump back and forth in the scene set, and need to pad out the plot. Before anyone using it is being shown a skill right, I believe, our intelligence is insulting. It started to feel a little narrow, and they were created to be so unclear for the first three series. This episode is a little frustrating. <br /> <br /> Also, using previous quicks, like if you want to know about the power of the lock at the end of the storm, it is inhuman ... by the side of the lock. <br /> <br /> This episode was everywhere.
