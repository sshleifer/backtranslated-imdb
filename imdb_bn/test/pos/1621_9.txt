I recently got the movie and I can say it's a good movie. There are famous Roman monuments and historic locations. This is the same author and director of The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks, along with Ian McGregor and Ilyt Jury, star. The movie begins with Sweden's space and time tests until it stole the most elusive enemy of the church. The plot is difficult to discuss without spoiled anything. It is a race in Rome following the Illumination Trill to make a secret meeting of the Illumination. Finding the path of Illuminati time to time racing. I've seen this three-pointing movie on all of it, and I still like it so buy it at the end. This is much better than 2010. And the last one is a great plot twist.
