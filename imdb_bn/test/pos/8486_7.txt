I saw judgment when it came first. Why? Partially, because of the promotion of advertising, secondly because I like the music of Ray Charles in the hack out. But when his music and the biggest thing in his life were not around, I wanted to know more about the life of man. And in this film, I did. His addiction to medicine was something I did not know, and the film could tell us. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, though it was a perfect autobiographical movie ... I can not say it's a "great" film. I saw "Malcolm X" and flew away. "What's with love And "Bird." Every performance of the film was outstanding. I was not only drawn to the main characters of those films - who did incredible things - what <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And the film was too long, and the film had dropped several "other" important details of Ray Charles Life, which streamed the film better, and the film got "sticky" in some parts. Lum. And the film started to end with a jolt, not part of it - with my last part, my opinion with the cable network of "Lifetime" cable. I hope more outta movie <br /> So, where does my conflict come? With the performance of Jamie Fox Overall, he did-- OK. Denzel is seen by Tony Turner of Malcolm X or Angela Bassett of Washington, but ... all right. Sorry friends, but there were several points in the movie where I saw Ray Charles' interpretation of Jamie Fox, and among others - thanks to the wonderful camera angle and light - he looked like "Ray Charles". But I paid attention ... acting. An actor has forced you to believe that he is playing the character he plays. Character is not a caricature. Am I raving on Jamie Fox? Sometimes yes - never <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is eligible for the Golden Globe? You betcha Is he eligible for Oscar? She relies on up against. He has some major contenders there, and he can just be their edge. But then again, maybe not. If Jamie Fox wins, I will not stand and say "he is looted". I especially feel that he was. <br /> <br /> This was a decent film with a nice movie and a decent story. A "great" autobiographical picture of late Ray Charles? No Out there somewhere, I think there is a great movie waiting for Ray Charles to be made up and an actor who will completely blow you up like this.
