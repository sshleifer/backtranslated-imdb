The "acting adult" concept is great to see a movie starring children who are not sexually explicit. Instead, these kids take responsibility to see a problem in their community and help solve it. A film clearly seen in families looking for a hottie movie. Production quality is good, especially Montana and Florida shot shots. Soundtrack is a perfect fit by Jimmy Buffet. Young actors are encouraging and refreshing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Having owls work together to protect the empire from the hands of empire makers. Many movies seem to be unforgivable, it is nice to see a movie that children work hard to make a difference. And even though parents are missing or temporarily confused, the children found that they wanted to follow the footsteps of their parents and tried for the right injustice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The line about children filled with movies, give a shot hoot. Then take the time to care for others with your children and take care of the world they live in. Positive message from positive film.
