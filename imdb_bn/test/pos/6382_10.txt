I saw this week at Chattsworth on a screening screen, and I went through a bunch of girls. We all really like it a lot. James Franco is amazing and so hot, I would just see it for him !!!!!!! But Siena Miller is really good and she plays a South Girl who loves her so she does not let her go. David Caradine was a cowboy at the Bill Bill and he was fit for him. The story is strange, but if you believe in love and magical things you will love it !!! It's really original, and it's funny and everyone laughed but eventually it got more serious and we all ended up crying. As soon as it comes out I'm going to see with my friends again, it's really good !!!!!!!
