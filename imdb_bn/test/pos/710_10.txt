I love seeing Jericho miles. I would like to say that Peter Strauss is watching the run, watching the Bolt Sprint in the 100 meters mile. I think Peter Strauss should be a wonderful actor and another running movie. He has great power in the lightning fast and can run a mile in 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. No man can find the living rain. I mean, the man runs 80 miles a week, but nobody does it. I have seen Jericho Mile 100 times and will look at 100 more. Great movies are not more than movies. I thank you for saving a few years to thank the filmmaker. They are great people and I bless them all. Thank you for thanking me. Thank you all.
