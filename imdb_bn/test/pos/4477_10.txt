This movie is beautiful in all ways. It's apparently stunning, and it's a good thing because the conversation will only take a page or two paper. Acting is fantastic; It's fine, sensual and intense. Ben Daniels makes an excellent job of combining that wild nature with a man's fantastic passion and respect, turning himself into an animal. There is no error, one wrong or wrong moment can not be found anywhere. It's perfect, but you just understand what you're going to understand. This is not a movie that seeks generality.
