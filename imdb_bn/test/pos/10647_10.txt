Based on the actual events of 1905, the silent film The Battleship Potemkin is concerned about an Imperial Russian ship, on which there is a rebellion against the despicable situation. Surprised by the situation of the ship, the port city of Odessa rallied in support of the rebels - and as a result, they found themselves in the mercy of imperialist forces, who attacked civilians with the barbaric forces. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a movie where individual characters are much less important than groups and crowds of people and it has gained incredible power by showing clash of groups and crowds in a series of extraordinary fantasy and edited sequences. Curiously, each of these sequences operates on the previous and this film actually comes to power because it moves towards the massacre of citizens from the rebellion in Odessa, the most popular of which are all in film history. The real event really happened in which real events occurred, Director Eisenstein's view was extraordinary, as he created - not only from sequence to sequence, from moment to moment in every moment - the most memorable image ever committed to the film. <br /> <br /> It's a bit different to describe Potemkin as a great movie. This is a completely essential, absolutely critical for any person interested in the form of the art, completely visible film at its most brighter time, often imitating, rarely equal, is never the best. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
