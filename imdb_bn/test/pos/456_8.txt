Yule Brenner is Major Surov, singing, dancing, Russian officer of Vodka-drinking, Anatol litavak in 1956, during the Hungarian Revolution, near the Austrian-Hungary border. Although the video was not released on video or DVD, it is one of Brenner's most compelling performances. Due to political unrest, a group of travelers can not fly from Budapest but kept in Vienna's bus. Before reaching the border, their passports were taken and they were arrested for interrogation by the Russians led by Major Surve. <br /> <br /> Major suspected that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter who is smuggling out of the country, the group! Indeed, Lady Ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger, Paul Flaming (Jason Roberts, Jr.) who pretends to be from America but does not fool anyone. He is helping Fleming pay off his debts for his debt due to his past cooperation. Among the other passengers are British journalist Robert Morley, who is EG Marshal, his wife, Anne Jackson, and their two children, one of which is the screening of a little Ron Howard. <br /> <br /> Major Survor Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kehr), and romantic interest in romance have developed in them. Although he suspects that his heart may still strike down, but we provide him with insult and rigid upper lip. Cold War conspiracies and strong acting stories, but romance is never reliable. But it is one of my favorite Yule Brenner movies and is only able to see its enthusiastic performance.
