To get to go, you can not look away, and you do not want to. "Huh suzumiera melankoli" (sujumiya harihuhi ne utusu) I have seen the most submissive animations for a long time. If you look away from mad and sometimes annoying, humorous, it's easy to find a brilliantly executed and executable job executable with efficiency. <br /> <br /> The brightness part comes from the fact that these episodes are a functional order, so you can not understand what you are talking about first, but as a progress in the series you will say "Ah, so what they meant!" Although some may confuse people, after watching the show, you will be given a severe pressure to file a case against telling this fashion story. <br /> <br /> <br /> title character, Harjod Shujumiya, is one of the most wonderful heroines of any animi. His open lecture in his class, where he declared that he is not interested in "normal people" and "espers, aliens and time travelers", is absolutely wicked, but how he is loving. <br /> <br /> Then the Qune, the "normal" guy who dragged Sujumiya-san out of the madness. He is the narrator, and his quick wit always makes the scene that much more entertaining. He was caught in the middle of different groups, everyone was tried to influence Huhuz Sujumiya, and the other three letters represented the representative of this group. Surprisingly, they are searching for Huyhud, but they can not express themselves to themselves. <br /> <br /> The first is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl, who is the only member of the School Literary Club. , And a representative of the Integration Thought Unit; She is basically an alien, although her best description is a computer program in a human body. Her completely embarrassed reaction makes her ridiculous measure and always thinks you have more than the eye. Then there is Miku esahina, time traveler, who is incredibly intelligent, a major digit and his club, SOS Brigade is advertising the advertising advertisement of Suzumia to the world. The end result is that Suzumia is the bargain of her sexual accessories which makes her dress uniform in uniform. The final character is Qujumi Ituki, a terrible and perpetual optimistic philosopher, being the "Aspera" of Harahi, although he can only use his power at certain points. <br /> <br /> The end result of all these characters is unlike any other, which is both crude and deep, and always bright. Do not believe me See the first episode, their "student film." What do you mean?
