One of the best films I have seen ... good script, the real plot of a man afraid of killing JF to protect him on the cold November day in 1963. 30 years later another social-social craze wants the current president to be killed. The secret service agent loses his companion on the way to a gunman, who pays the lies, and lies in the way of those who stand in his way. <br /> <br /> The film is a great memorable score and collected with a restful but meaningful romance between Rousseau and Eastwood ... which shows how difficult a romantic life is in such work. Malchovich is great, sure that the other candidate he could play the role of acting, but how could this glossy, and the movie work with the intellect that he displayed? No need to say <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great movie ... it would be on television every time I see it ... and I own the DVD! I am a big Eastwood fan, it only boosted his already incredible career, and Malchovich dates the best role! <br /> <br /> <br />
