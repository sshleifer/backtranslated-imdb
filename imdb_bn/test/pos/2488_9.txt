There are spoilers <br /> <br /> This is a Peter Watkins film. If anyone has seen his BBC masterpieces "Kulodeen" and "The War Game", then the style (and his voice) will be recognized within a few seconds at the beginning. In 1971 it was set in the near future, when the Vietnam War increased even more and now it seems that China is being included. Nixon is still fiercely used by the president and civil disobedience and protests using the Dramahed Tribunal (externally using civilians as judges' citizens with 'civilians'). Because "Prison can not be built", an alternative has been launched: Punishment Park. Delinquents can choose between serious prison sentences and a man's hunting in an unfavorable environment, in this case, 85 Kilometers trip through the desert of California in 100 degrees Fahrenheit. If they reach the American flag until they are caught by the National Guard or the riot police, they will be freed, or they will have to serve their sentences (or we will see them as dead). This film has been created with a full documentary style with three European teams which are covered in the tribunal and the two parties have already been sentenced. Jump into the tribunal's tribunal tent, hunter soldiers and victimized. The blanket closure statement gives us raw background information (time, temperature etc.). Tribunal Scenes Displays a Kangaroo Court on one hand and shows a wide spectrum of personalities from 'unwanted' to genuine terrorists (such as a total pacifist, who can not even hurt the fishy) from the 'unwanted'. Defense lawyer (who took his work seriously) has been abused on both sides. These scenes make especially similar to the eerie details rhetoric of today's administration. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make clear that 'playing rules' are not really implemented. The question remains open, despite being frightened by the army, it becomes frustrating and leads to the results (I doubt that, both of them). Finally, after returning, we are going to the "Penance Park" with the next group. This description can refer to a widely preferential (or even demographic) campaign film, but it would be confusing. Behavior (all participants were non-professional as usual with Walkins) and thinks real (tribunal scenes may even have text elements in contemporary contemporary experiments). I would say that without this problem, it can be sold as 'real thing'. Watkins's "Furojan Faces" response was "We can not send it or anyone will believe in our real Newsroom (because it is not unique from the original thing)". With "park of punishment" it will be the same. As far as I know it has been effectively banned in the United States, it certainly does not lose its power or its relevance (especially today).
