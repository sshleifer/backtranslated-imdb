Not talking many things. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. It is not a color-like color, like today's movies, but rather a special mono-colored use (with shadding) that depicts money, mood, senses and time. It should be seen in color, it becomes a completely different film. The story of Nobel laureate Selma Lerloff is presented effectively. One has a clear, clear sense of memory or phantom. The change in Swedish society at the time is subtly layered. Maximum recommendation. Rent it or try to find it online. I saw it in the Swedish film class and I would like to add it to my movie library.
