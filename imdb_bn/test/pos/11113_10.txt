"Fame" was my favorite movie for years! This is not only "a high school 80 musical movie" in NYC, it is legally - people do not refer to High School of Performing Arts but "Fem School"! The real, they are not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows them on four years of school, ending with a strong solidarity with a student in Audition and a spectacular graduation show. <br/> <br /> <br /> Somebody apparently looks good at Broadway, but in my opinion, you can see this movie anyway and then see your own scene. For anyone who enjoys watching movies and wants to "clash" it must be one of them. This is an example of those films which were really cool, with the actors we liked for 2 hours and never saw them again ... they are classical "fame students" <br /> <br /> Fame lived forever.
