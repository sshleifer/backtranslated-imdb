I watched the film on its North American premiere at the Phantasia Festival (July 14, 2004). I was a little disappointed because I was waiting for Musa the Warrior as well as another epic, Aslamalu Alaikum. Instead, the movie only focused on a small number of letters. Still, the film was firm, thoughtful and visually confusing. A little fuzzy voice was confused with the confused loyalty, conspiracy and the impressive thoughtful and realistic voice of blood, light, more exciting, martial arts sequence. It takes almost even though the filmmakers have not been able to create their mind about whether the martial art is supposed to be "flick" or historical epics. This phenomenon touches the need for loyalty with the need to firmly adapt to new conditions. Is it time for your life and your friends who really can be loyal to their master or at some time to submit changes in the air? Perhaps there is more courage in the old way for newcomers? How does one decide? This question is raised in this movie, and surprisingly, the suggestion that the proposal could be really wrong!
