'Ana Cristie' was the 14th film of Garbo and the first radio voice was heard in her radio. He is the main character, Anna, who has been abandoned by his father, Chris (owner of a drunk badge driven by George F. Marian) and fought with him to keep water from his head due to the misfortune of life. br /> <br /> Meeting Irish Matter (Charles Bakerford) can point to his point ... Or? Garbo is superb in this play and sounds, though it continues slowly and slowly, even after about 80 years, it shows the interest of the audience and associated with the audience. Marie Dresler has influenced this role, which gives her a second flush of film success in mini and bills, dinners at et al. Marion and bakerford are more than adequate. <br /> <br /> Movie is an interesting part of history. In the following years, Garbo will say good things, but while talking on the screen, 'Anna Christie' will be remembered for the first time.
