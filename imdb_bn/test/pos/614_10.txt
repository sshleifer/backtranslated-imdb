I hope it will be good, I've seen the other fantastic ozone moments and can read a lot about it ... but this movie is superb - cute, very bright (emotional and visually impaired), perfect at all moments. Each movement has a reason, everything so closely and primordially fits true and honest. Movies about this beauty and innocence; About simplicity about it.
