Many Americans are lazy, and it has even released our DVD-Observations. Many of us do not like to take the time to read subtitles for one and a half hour (or more), so we do not like to see many foreign movies. Your movie is a movie completely valuable, but the subtitle you remember is not a prayer, but "Green Butcher". It's the best foreign film I've ever seen, and I've seen mostly as well as the top of many American films. This is a complex situation that has been told in an extraordinary simple and fun conversation. Character depth obtained in this photo is amazing. Svend and Eigel Wish (those who are misinterpreted miserable) Feed the opposite people on the other side of the spectacle! The actor was well cast, and I was considering a signal that is very expected ... It needs very little to Bjorne and his face ... just give me some sort of swaying and Sewing ride with Eigel and more amazing dialogue! This fine screen writer, I say: Write more! The story itself is changed, but you will find yourself rooting for the bad guys ... with no remorse. Check out this movie!
