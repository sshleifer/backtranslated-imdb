I love it I love Pauly Shore. It seems that some people do not agree. It's humorous, and he does not like everyone else. The movie is great. I love story lines and movies most people. It's fun to see him at school for the first time. I like the man who brought him back home. I do not want to end that Tiffani Thesin is a bad girl. All are given out secret. The only people you want to see are the last left. (You do not like Polly Shore like you.) If you do not like her, you have a fun part and her family is tortured by most movies. She has gone wild in the country and the girls will listen. He finally makes it. It's just love and romance got the right amount. I give it a 10 out of 10.
