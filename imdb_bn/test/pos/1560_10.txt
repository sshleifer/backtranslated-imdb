This is probably not likely to see the best pictures. It presents a culture in a real unhollywoodized way. These are for those who like Indie and who can not see them. I think this movie will draw more in indie film. Acting was the top notch! Elise's character was so good. With perfect akwardness. This movie will be brought to mainstream! I think it will happen! Alice is one of the most elemental elements in our culture that we saw from ASK Alice. Hollywood is a look of the obsolete by hand. This type of film shows young people that these things are not funny but they are real and compulsory. If you like April Pick, you'll love it!
