Deep Blood ... is one of the movies here and you will not call another Italian jaw rippof! Well, deep blood is far from that. This is a cheap because the movie can be made and on the other hand it is creative as well. We all saw in Jaws and all other shark films that they all used fake sharks, which are good in Joe Di Amato's film, using all the stock footage for his shark scenes, he has taken a new approach. It's one of the many reasons to choose Deep Blood because it does not use stock footage. <br /> <br /> In Deep Valley, an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a vampire shark, Joe D'Amato shark classic Deep Blood. It seems that a Native American elder once warned about this great evil of a group of youth, and after a few years friends were forced to face them. Fear when a series of attacks along their coast is killing them by a shark. Now it is up to some others to confirm that this monster has been killed, even if it means going on the way to the sea. <br /> <br /> Filmyme directed by Joe Di Amato and created the film under his company. Released in 1989 and later in Bruno Matari's Cruel House: Jaws 5, along with many other shark films. Joe Di'Amato's shark entry is a great movie and shark movie viewers should try it any da d'amato fan.
