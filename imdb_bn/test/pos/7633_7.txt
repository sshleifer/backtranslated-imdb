"El Osessa" (One of the best Italian rip-offs of "The Exorcist") was published in English under many titles and the most perfect of them is "The Middle Midnight Scare"). You really should have a sense of humor in this film grateful. "L'Ossessa" at the same time sleazy (but naive), kind and sometimes moving. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Danila (Stella Kernasina), an artist student, looks at her statue near the old church and is restoring. It is a wooden statue of Christ, a demon of Christ, perhaps already overcome by evil, or fighting against it, or perhaps planning a dark plan. The face shows unlimited pain. Statue 15th century date Impressed by the skill shown by the statue is influenced by the Danila - the statue seems almost alive! She lives with her parents. His mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) lives in an incomplete life and does not care too much for keeping up the presence. His father Mario (Chris Ashram) watched everything with uninterrupted eyes. <br /> <br /> Wooden statue will soon form human (Ivan Rashimov) and will get Daniel in spiritual knowledge and spiritual sense. A wonderful view! The poor Danila will endure the torment of hell from now on. <br /> <br /> Danila (lovely Stella Karnasina) was destroyed, violated, caught by Satan and now following her order, she will try to seduce others. Does not she imitate her lovely mother Luisa (Lukasya Love), when her lover whips her with a bunch of roses? A spectacular and moving scene is so ridiculous, when Stella Kernasina is frustrated in a narrow street in her small Italian town (stuck by the devil, remember?). Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. Its performance, as usual, is intense. Exorcism scenes (especially the final war) are very, very amateur, but this really fun (and / or emotion?) If you really have a sense of humor will have developed. <br /> <br /> Stella Carnacina looks beautiful and fresh and innocent, and in a way that adds to your joy when she is nude, but I think that this movie can explore its natural beauty. Lucretia love is a very good sleaze companion (her nude scene with roses ... good. :) <br /> <br /> Another Italian exorcist I want to recommend for you: <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> "The Evil Eye" (Malokiyo) - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Evil Eye", but other films, for example, "for example," Rosemary's baby "also b Ecana should be. "Evil Eye" is completely above. That's not sleazy but with lots of fantastic Italian and Spanish actresses. You will be drooling across the whole film. The film is ridiculous, the story does not give any idea, but if you see it in the right mood, you might think! - A diabolical community, possession, murder, frustration, love, investigation and beautiful women around. A wild ride! <br /> <br /> If you like "Evil Eye" then see "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This film can be found in the alternative market. IMDB Search this title. There are good reviews about it. <br /> <br /> PS - "El Ossa" has many different faces. It is exploitative, but it can be serious and moving. It's cheap, delicious ... but not too many (it's not that many) sleazy and it has an underlying "moral" message. These peculiar brews can sometimes be very fun. We all already know that "el osessa" is an "outburst" squeezed, so why can not we see it on its terms? Yes, Mario Garrioza was trying to earn fast, but he was able to get the most out of a shoe budget. The story is well-said, the film is atmospheric and the role of the actor as a whole. See the film with an open mind and you can discover two or three new things.
