Spoilers: This movie has problems, but eventually gets the message across it. I like it because it really ends up doing things. The nice guy tries and tries, his heart breaks several times, but ultimately no ideal Hollywood is over. It eliminates things that are always ending, or at least always have the experience of my own and my friends. Anyone who concludes that this is not exactly how it happened, the first opinion is that the girl will come around, realizing that she is dating a donkey who behaves badly because she does not care about him. Is either silent or live in a more perfect world than I I think it is 7/10, additional points simply because it is not afraid to end a note below, give no real resolution, only the main characters are impressive, left to distracted and countless generations have already been many people.
