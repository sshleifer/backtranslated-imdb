And what is its nature? Backstage stories unfolded; Those Broadway (and others) who really are in dramatic life are like behind the screen. It must compete with the competition: Singin 'between rain and I both (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers (name of the year you are); Dames of 1934; The dirty off of (1992) from a distance and this star was born sadly in the 1930s and the second half of the 50's: To not mention Summer Stock in 1950: The list keeps Rollin along. So does this movie make so much special? And why are so few comments about this stunning great movie? So many people actually seen this? How wonderful to see Frank Langley Pre-Dracula and Pre-Frost-Nixon at the age of 30! Amazing how wonderful to look at the fresh and talented Tom Hulce! And yet another superb stylizer! A wonderful line up of their very gifted people from so long ago! And such a script! Who was this David Shabar? So realistic feeling and feeling-realistic insulating and full of stones than good comedy! Especially with hikes like Star-Is-Bourne, where the heroine achieves Broadway, and Langley's character still makes her consistent with other provincial tournaments. <br /> <br /> Langley's next violent and star-based intense tension - she has shown her anger and frustration by hurting Latin teacher and her granddaughter, and is one of the many fantastic and psychological real moments in the film. (His boyfriend's relationship with Latin teacher and backstage life, of course, was summed up by Marlene Dietrich of 1929 and his motivated professor.) Kevin McCarthy was one of the kind of tenant and cold hearted agent, who was at the sweetmeat before Bert Lancaster's success in the smell (1957) and in film history Clubland (2001) was a success by Allen Alda. Hulus character's sex freedoms, O 'Nell's comedy comedy, remembers similar events in Wilderness. <br /> <br /> And long before the invisible amateurs were respected: Victor Herbert's red mile; Wugaband King of Rouge Marie and Rudolph Fremail; Sigmund Romberg desert song etc. Bit Warm Insertion of Great Dances like Romeo and Juliet Contribute to the theater itself as elaborated by star Langley. The prosperity and depth of this movie is simply endless. And be saddled by such a title! Is this great movie coming from such ridiculous and absurd title? But on the other hand, in such a great drama someone can apply a title that can be appealing to her, mental content? <br /> <br /> I saw (2009) Frank Langela is his last seen star: Frost-Nixon as Richard Nixon. How 30 years later this great actor simply won from victory!
