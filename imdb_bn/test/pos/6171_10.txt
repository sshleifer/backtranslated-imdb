This is a well-crafted film, small human stories are fine-tuned (both before and after 1945) and arbitrary war of war. Extra-out uses of the Battle of Britain (a film that was not pictured in the 1940s) increased instead of completely redressing. A deeply impressive job, I've been in my memory for two years, and I've just bought it to make it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie (cinema). Like "As Ese High", it changes comfortably (or scary) in the series of air warfare, where visitors may face actual losses of character for care, but there may be unpredictable interactions on the grounds where skilled writers and real-life experiences are involved and Notify moving events. It also mentions that in 1945 there was a clash for many people but no one else started and even today we still do not accept the loss, courage and sacrifice of many unnamed heroes even worse, Worship them from their distances without the permission of humans to make them human beings with their mental weaknesses - make their sacrifice even more brave. <br /> <br /> This movie is an experience which will take you from the height of friendship to the depth of jealousy, and the love that even tolerates even after death is returned. If all the war pictures are like this, then we will never have to fight. <br /> <br /> Did I mention it valuable? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
