If you think the movie is valuable, you will not be disappointed. If you think Murray would like to win an Oscar for his performance, the film you are hoping for is not bothered. I was funny seeing this in 1979 and lost his joke. Good fun for the kids and older people stupid entertainment. The story line is simple and easy to follow. Murray did the best, but this is his first picture. The film reminds me of a time when we do not need blood and do not have to go for entertainment. Morty head is dunce and plays the perfect part. Other consultants are usually revved teens looking to have fun in the summer. This is a nice thing about movies, it has a message.
