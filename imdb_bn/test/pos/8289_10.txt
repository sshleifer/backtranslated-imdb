Today, I did not see a movie more than Chipmun's adventure, nor did any movie give me more happiness. This is not the greatest movie or even the greatest animated film, but in 1988, it was one of the greatest, fun, most exciting films of 8 year old daughter! I still feel equally influenced by musical numbers, with the exceptionally dramatic lyrics in the 80s epic tradition of Pill (Helium's Pat Bennetra thinks only playful), each one standout song. <br /> <br /> The debate over the blatamatic indicative tone of "Gettin 'Lucky With You" was aroused by the chipat song, which seemed pretty innocent to me. However, looking at it as a reasonable adult, I can understand the concerns completely; You've got three young girls, Skimpi Harrim, forcing the parties to "be lucky, what's all about it". Chippets' is ten times more explicit for this movie. <br /> <br /> But this controversial problem is not one of the most beautiful features of Chipmunos, the length animated does not lean towards courage, I encourage parents and infirm adults to check the same way out of this movie. Especially if you were an eighty / ninety-year-old child like me. :-)
