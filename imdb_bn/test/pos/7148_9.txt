This is a wonderful movie ... it's funny, dark, tragic, anxious, innocent naughty and usually almost all entertainment I do not know that as I have seen before ... "The Rapture," or Tod's Salandy's black-night "comedy" or even the latest movie "Teeth" may seem like ... but those bitter, ugly little gems "Franklin's," despite the darkness around the edge, leads to a completely sincere and pure heart. <br /> <br /> This story is similar to John Waters's "Low Down Wattle Shame", this film is different from this, it's actually a story and something like "Sex is not snicker, nudge-nudge" than the Waters teenager. A conservative, repressed family goes through a fierce change due to a car accident and suddenly is not so conservative ... In fact, they are finally really happy, perhaps the only person in their town (or perhaps the whole world)) who Talk about why this movie will be destroyed in this case; Easily, everyone should see this, although of course only those who have encouraged the movie have been sold, hopeful philosophies will sometimes be. <br /> <br /> Acting is great - just getting this effect done is very heavy ... Teresa Willis gives specially memorable and courageous performance, like the appearance of butterflies in her release. He and Robertson Dean both qualify for their immediate acting (not to mention frequent and wide nudity and sex scenes); They could be what would be an amusing joke involving a "deviant sexual practice" at a sensitive, credible and respectful moment. As a girl, Avita is a standout and someone, her daughter is full of capturing a girl attitude, angst and speech patterns. Vince Pavia "Hibbo" is a good face and performance with the secret to the brother's secret, but its storyline and how everyone's reactions are more rewarding than their actual acting. Marie Blackwell is also astonishingly cold, confused and even in a role as one of the best friend conflicts with Mac Franklin, who can go the most. <br /> <br /> The technically good film, all the bright colors and wide open showing open locks ... it looks like it has been shot in the def ... If so, the line has become very thin, it is much like the film Showing. There has been a lot of talk and it is a lot of philosophers, which becomes somewhat promoter (Moroso, I want to imagine a viewer who disagrees with the film's politics), but this picture says that many things have to be said. If only people are not afraid to hear and think. The arguments that occur are smart and well-thought-out, denying the first and foremost religious or non-religious parties demonizing. <br /> <br /> The end is a vague aspect that I have found a bit of frustration ... I think it worked better with the author (such as Jay Floyd as he created, wrote and ordered) more effective dinants, some The solution, but again, is probably one while pitting people of different faiths against each other. All the same, this is a moving, memorable final image that kept me off - a success. Meanwhile, I am very happy that Mr. Floyd has created this movie and is looking forward to sharing it as soon as possible. See it
