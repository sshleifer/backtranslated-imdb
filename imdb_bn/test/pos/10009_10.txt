I love this movie from the beginning to the end. I'm a musician and I come in some ways using the drug (my skewboarding, drawing) but my friends were always there for me. Music was like my rehabilitation, life support, and my drug. It has changed my life. I can fully relate to this movie and I would like to say that I could say. This movie embarrassed me to be honest. I saw it on the IFC channel. I usually hate having satellites but having this satellite was a perk. The IFC Channel shows some really great movies and without it I have not found this movie. I'm not a big fan of international film, because I don 't work very well in translation lines. I mean that the obvious language barrier just lets you to believe what you said, but it's not a big deal that I guess. I often did not see this Amazing movie. Instead of going to bed, the best thing is to stay in bed. Than usual lol. I hope you all enjoy this movie's hell, and love this movie as much as I did. I hope I can type these caps, but then again I seem to scream at these rules, but it will really show tension for my movie. I'm giving three Thomps Way! <<br /> <br /> This movie farewell to me!
