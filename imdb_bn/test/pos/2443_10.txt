Yes great civilized tv series. Great atmosphere, top scripts and good performance make it a candidate for a class of DVD releases. It is a basic tour de Australian TV history and it is impossible to zoom out long camera as your 70th cathode ray box has 70 Australian Australians who have soundtracks of the incredible Groovy timing piece with Jack Parkinson's jackfruit and Flemish voice All his antipodean glory reveals religion open road. This is not one of the many and very remote era memorials, and since its inception in all its raw freedom and great glory, low land has proud stamps. <br /> <br /> ABC! Get the program and enjoy all this, if you are lucky enough to dream at that time, then enjoy it again.
