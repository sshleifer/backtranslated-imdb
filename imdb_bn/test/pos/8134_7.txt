Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for the Ruby studio. However, since there was a real thirst for public "conversations", this group was rebuilt just a few years after some small changes were made. Sunny Gary was basically the same plot that Stan and Olly were trying to hide an intelligent puppy from their drunken landlord - like the goat like the love of the Anggo. This whole kid is the worst part of the movie. Even though you want to keep an intelligent little dog to understand the boys (after all, it is snowy outside), why are they just brought to a goat home just concreved and screwed? According to the plot, the goats followed them, and so they cooled down and tired of tiredness. Huh?! It just does not make any sense - if it is a giraffe or cows, but do they do the same thing?! In addition to a vague plot, the film itself is well-known and has a familiar role for Hardy, a familiar plot and comedians. This picture has featured several smiles, but unfortunately, not one of their best films to wrap their silent careers. This attitude of their careers seems to have ended with just a whale.
