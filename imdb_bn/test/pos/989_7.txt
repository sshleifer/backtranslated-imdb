This can not be done very well, because I can not say that I liked it. But this story has bothered me, or the perception of the film. Acting, direction, atmosphere, music were all good. It's right, you're doing something that you really can not really relate to, when the movie is over. It is educational in such a way that it shows the horrors of the war as the views from the home and the way feelings do not need to be done in a sense and still can be strong, but it is about it. <br /> <br /> The story was passed for several years under the cover of Dylan Thomas Ex-girlfriend girlfriend. He is married, his wife and the child, and the former (knightly) married to someone else. But there are tensions, Dylan came back from PTSD with a confident blurring and a little case of new husband wars. Add some nice memorial letters and your hands are full. <br /> <br /> The following line: You have to be "moody" to choose this movie. The hard part is defined in this mood. I still do not think I have it yet. Ever. So it is probably strange curious human behavior and perhaps the curiosity about Dylan Thomas is best viewed by adults.
