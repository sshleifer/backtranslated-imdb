The only other movie that I can think of in the same way as the theme and clichés, with wild and addictive mix is ​​the French film Billy Jake Kick - but it is a more spiritual and playful approach. <br /> <br /> This image will not be surreal or quirky. Humor is a lot of time, obviously, gently in your face - and often beyond the increasing outline. For example: Post-quote chit-chat with prostitution, our hero Max Mueller calls him "Shise Los!" Encouraged to publish who is responsible for the recent murder using the words. Literally, this phrase means "shoot!" In Germany, and that's exactly what a hidden killer response is. In other words - this beautiful lady was sacrificed in order to punish her. <br /> <br /> <br /> Larry's romance is "I Will Will Meher" (I'm More I want to be with the song - when the song completely reduces the function, the meaning of its words changes several times, and indicates Larry's end to the inability to provide any additional services. The original love scene for Max Mueller and Betinaina Kant is lacking in such a situation - it is a jo-dropping stuff, especially when Betina's music runs on the rhythm of songs, of course all the songs are in the rhythm. <br /> <br />, unless you're easily offended.
