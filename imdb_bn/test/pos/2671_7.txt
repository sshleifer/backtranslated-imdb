Sometimes it is difficult to see such a self-imposed "message movies", without a definite degree, in a previous, seemingly-easy era. Racism and religious tolerance have entered into us in the early era, and as we have grown, teachers and authorities have found less disproportionate but equally effective ways to get this message. 'House I Live In In' (1945) 'Messaging Films' is unreasonable, and Frank Sinatra seems to be behaving like a child to his audience ?? In fact, it was probably because this was a little suspicious, primarily for influencing the young filmmaker. Even when I thought of myself as a Sinitra American, then you were curiously influenced by the sincere patriotic speech? And I'm not even an American! After just two months of WWII, the released director Marvin Leroy greeted the tired audience of the war over tolerance, consolidation message and everything else. The song is not bad, <br /> <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra? Already a star, but still he is not superstar ?? Booming out "If you have a dream but" with a full orchestral partner, open the film in a recording studio. When, among the songs, Frank moved out of Smokoro, he raped a young Jewish boy and saw a large group of kids, their taunts were completely excited by their different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes Quickly puts a stop for this child's behavior, knowingly "bully breaking down" the words and suppressing their illogical bias. He then gave a lecture to a slightly fascinating group of sincere and beautifully ethnic and religious inequalities and assures them that every American culture, even though it is different from us, is still American? If not, of course, you are a bloody "Japs." While presenting a nation as a racial enemy, there is a hint of hypocrisy to apply for racial tolerance, although in 1945 you could not blame Hollywood less than enthusiastic about the plight of the Japanese. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Enter a house with a wonderful heartwarming presentation of "The House is Lie In In", which was written by Abel Miropole in 1943. When the song writer heard the song in the first movie, he was angry that filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses, which he thought was very important for the message. These mistakes were probably due to periods of restraint, but Mayeropol did not understand that they were very graciously taken, and it was probably exposed from the movie. It was first released, 'The House I Live In' was considered an important small film that won a Golden Globe for the "Best Picture of International Good Will Promotion" and the respected Oscars for all involved. In 2007, it was considered "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" and was added to the National Film Registration Library of Congress, which I found it to be. After 60 years, his technique might seem a little hockey, but this film thanked a young falcon named Frank Sinatra.
