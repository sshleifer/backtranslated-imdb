Finally! Third time lucky. I always thought of this picture, but I forgot my first watch and only caught the second half of the film. Then just a few months later I had a second chance to see it, so I decided that I would record it. Only my timer walked off late and again discovered that I missed the first half of the flick. I'm not going to allow it to happen again. So, when it comes to TV again, I thought I would wait until it was done, then I would record it. And it was a good choice. I just used to watch the movie, but they always kept it midnight on weekends. After finding a hole in their mobilized cell, 9 prisoners escaped from their captivity to find the key to the universe, which told a prisoner known as fraud that he was hiding. They think that this may be an opening for the secret loot of fake bills. On this journey, they can see it as an opportunity to choose their life naturally before losing weight. Although the criminals plan to go to delinquent most of the criminals, they do not start the way they intend. <br /> <br /> "9 Souls" is an extravagant spiritual journey from Japanese director Toshiqi Twada, which spreads its viewers into two completely separate films. The first half of the story is like mental humor with criminal bonds and they have played a lot more to think of their own selling point, but it creates a morality and consequence drama-packed second half path, where the real problem begins. Goofball tone replacement is somewhat nasty And the bloody moment it started off. Although, the first half is quite fun with the road, scullle doodling and offbeat banners. But this is truly the next half of the hunting event, which has its amazing changes that make you so much hurt by such amazing touches that make you truly sympathetic to these human characters. Although they are not really innocent of their crime, you have shifted the first half with these meat-out characters that when you see the spiral in their fall, you know that it is an effective drama, when you dramatically change the shell-shock. Nine characters get enough screen time to really understand their personal stories and will bring them down enough vulnerabilities. The way the plot works, it is the main character and we see it mostly from their perspective. Escapism Story is a clear and concise character that is clear in its goals and you have to leave the society from many questions and life to choose the way you choose and keep yourself free from this control. <br /> <br /> However, the symbolic story is completely transparently described. The visual element is not known by strangers, because only a dreamy and trans-like vibe that channels are in a unique environment. What that factor contributed immensely and gave the film a lift sweepingly, Moody's instrumental rock soundtrack. Gentle atmospheric gel was able to create it in many scenes, but instead I was able to energize left breathless with eternal passion. The only beautiful and cruel strong control in front of that. We are just all wrapped up because such a long film (2 hours) seems to take place fast winding and quick execution. The hypnotic photography is crisp in details. Cast performances as a peculiar group of criminals, each providing high quality personalities and features to separate themselves. <br /> <br /> I found "9 Souls" a delightful and quite amazing spiritual movie that pushes emotions and then changes it when it smacks you with an all-powerful wall. Highly recommended.
