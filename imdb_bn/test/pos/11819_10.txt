One of the pilot pilots I worked in 1996, one of them gave me a copy of this picture. He told me that it would make me cry. I did not trust him and we even made bits. After watching the movie .... I called a bucket! Even after watching the movie, I saw myself crying in the bathroom. It was actually the most sensitive film I ever seen. I like the part where Duster's mother was facing Eric's soil, the line became something like this ... "Your son's best friend is dead today ... and it will not be easy ... if you put your hand again on him ... I'll kill you! " The last part of Dexter Eric's shoes is a scene that has not left my mind to this day. Verily, just thinking about it makes my eyes teary. A story about what true friendship is about My girlfriend liked it too ... She hated me to see me film. I cried a bucket, he cried a river.
