As a fan of Robocop, I always like this movie. I saw it when it first came out, and finally I bought it from DVD to Brazil, it is not released in DVD us. I like this picture, but like all other things in this world, everyone has their opinion, love or hate. Whatever the movie does, no one will always say, "Why do not they do it anyway?" In other words you will not be able to please everyone. If you love Robocop, you would love this picture. To me, it's so unique that it's not flexible, or stupid like low-budget movies These pictures always keep me interested. I see some scenes here that Robocop borrowed from here, but tell me what movies do not? Many movies use other ideas from other movies, and sometimes they almost change around them. Fun film!
