The movie is really cool, I thought. It looks good in the original game, and the war scenes that are depicted in the high story, are incredible. I think I could have been a little better if I could give a little bit more information about the ending of the movie, but what the movie is trying to determine what is going on. <br /> <br /> CG is beautiful, I do not think they can work according to a better working graphics. Each little detail, the way they are moving, the way of their sword way, everything is perfect. The way they show the characters is often like a real man. <br /> <br /> The song was great and I was happy to hear how much it was remixed from the original game. New instruments and effects. <br /> <br /> All and all, I would recommend this film to someone who enjoys fast movements and good stories. Although I want to watch the movie beforehand, play will definitely play.
