Radio was a very good movie, and to be honest, I never used to cry in movies. But it was very tears to me. When Radio's mother dies, she gets really close to me and she will not be out of her house. If you feel really sad about how you got mentally disturbed, you would not understand the death actually. I really liked the movie, and it must see a must.
