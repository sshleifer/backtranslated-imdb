We really like this movie. It was not trying to be violent, controversial, clever or deep. It was just entertaining and in the box it said a charming romantic comedy. All other Brit film makers seem to want to change the world, look beautiful on the elegant style to focus on saying that yarn is one of the beautiful ones.
