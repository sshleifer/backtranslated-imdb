Sham represents a high point of a master carrier. Ingmar Bergman sharpened, tackled with the survival of a long war, a couple existed in the island of Gotland to study. Live Olman and Max Van Saido have painstakingly provided detailed performance in this extraordinary play. The intensity of the film is that of Burmman's minutes, the intimate relationships of our two characters - both music composers - have been stuck in a landscape that they do not understand. We complicate the external pressure of the war and weaken their relationship. Both characters are forced to betray the sentiments of their ethics by the circumstances of the war. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman emphasized on us to reflect Ulemaan's character in a movie, reflecting the medium-sized power of the film, which has been re-edited and distorted for political influence on one side of the conflict, and using it as well as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene on the other side. <br /> <br />
