This mystery / psychological-thriller seems to be the best one I've ever seen. All actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin, like Jamie Harris, who initially changed from the nervous statlet, which is part of the coolest stars. You learn a lot about the real passion of people in this movie and many movies business. The film is fascinating with the introduction of "acting trainers" and playing through movie situations. Also the music by Mark Snow is probably the best score I've ever heard. You do not forget this movie!
