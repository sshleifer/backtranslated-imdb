My family and I enjoy this event and it finds a fair thumb nail sketch through people. <br /> <br /> "F" Force on Thailand-Burma Railway. As far as POW's receiving treatment is concerned, I would say that my dad was 6 feet 1 inches and 196 lbs when Singapore fell, after the war he was 5 feet 11 inches long and 91 lbs. <BR> <br /> <br /> No program could really reveal how POW went through, but it came closer. <br /> <br /> Like former POW, "If you do not have a partner, you have not survived."
