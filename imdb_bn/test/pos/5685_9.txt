I live here in the Krok Territory and inspire this movie and remember the real facts. Each crate of our crutches we hear every time we hear the attack. Black water, quite simply, is the best choke movie I've ever seen. Last year I loved all the effects and splashy scenes in the rug, but the local audience captured our viewers. We laugh at anything higher ROGUE Black water, though really you are alone in mangrove (you say that they are called dumps or air - but they are young), then you can become worried that you feel fear and fear. Every tourists will see this movie before going to Northern Territory. The ending was a isolation after the rest of the film, but when it is available I will add it to my DVD collection.
