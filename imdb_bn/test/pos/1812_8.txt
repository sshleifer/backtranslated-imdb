In most cases, the romance movie was never my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few romance movies I just could not sit, but I really enjoyed it. Nicholas Cage is superb in his first role and Doboara Foreman is clever out of faith. There are some side stories that fade, but this film is not enough to reduce.
