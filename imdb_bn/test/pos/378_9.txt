In a trophy book interview with Hughcch, it is clear that Big Al's fear of police has come back from his childhood. His father sent him a note and sent it to the police station. The note said: "He has become naughty, he has sent him to jail for an hour." Since the Hitcoo was compulsory police, and there was a deep fear of police being accused by mistake and by police. <br /> <br /> "Unknown Train unknown" is perhaps his "faulty" seratum in the series. . The film is based on the Patricia High School novel. The same author who wrote the Ripley series. He was always fascinated by smart criminals. <br /> <br /> The opening of Hitcoak is very strong and takes you to drama immediately: a famous tennis player Guy Henes, and Bruno Anthony, aspiring criminals. The two share a chemistry, the day and the age is probably more than the chewing chest. Bruno tries to convince Guy that he can kill perfect (without any formula), if they are harmed. Bruno will kill Gaia's wife, who will not divorce him, and will kill Bruno's father. Objectives are love and money respectively. <br /> <br /> The performance of bruno is seductive and is meant to be homeostatic. Something that is not done by this accident. In fact, Hitako has edited two versions of the film: one in the US In the US version, the amount of Bruno's temptation turned quite a bit below. <br /> <br /> "A train of strangers" is a very deep movie, but more importantly it is another excellent hitcore thriller. An excellent example of a thrilling scene is when Girl Bruno's father was stepping into the room. Hitco is justified that the audience's attention needs to be confused at this time so that they do not understand what they will find in the house. Hit treats us with the leading lethal dog on top of the missile suppliers. <br /> <br /> The most popular shot in this movie takes place during a tennis match. Bruno is constantly pushing the guy so that Guy can finish his contract (killing his father). Gaia looked at the audience, all the heads are swiveling behind. All except one - Bruno's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A worker could get control so she is crawling under it. When we finally stopped this journey and the movie ended, the Guy proved her innocence, we were tired and nails (those of us still biting our nails!). <br /> <br /> "Strangers of a Train" is easily one of Hitkow's best "wrongly charged" movies. Some good villains (Bruno) credit him as well After all, the film may be somewhat date-wise, but it is a lesson for master thriller creation. I will not bring Leonardo back if he came to teach me Renaissance painting, so you should not. <br /> <br /> << Posted in FilmDailies.com >>
