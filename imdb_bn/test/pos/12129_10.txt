"I ask you another question" Ha! What a great soon .. This movie was brilliantly fantastic, there was great script. No one would agree with me because of the low budget that the only reason was that it was a culture like "Donny Brasco", that a young man Joe P.C.C is again seen as a gangster, the film compiled with them. Some of his sophons and some Goodfellas got his idea for Chase Sprpranss when he saw it and Scorsese found Joe Pacey while watching it, does it prove that it must be big or I'm wrong? I acknowledge that they have shown a brilliant scene where they are throwing peanuts in the piano piano player "Stop with peanut peanuts".
