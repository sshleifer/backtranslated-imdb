I saw this cartoon as a child, father, and now a grandfather. This is my favorite cartoon I love to draw characters, great little tunes, and very well. I love the main song which comes across the entire cartoon. I think it's a pretty little cartoon. I have shown it to love it simply by everyone. It's a very bad day to open on a very bad day (Pearl Harbor bombings). It was a great success if it was not for bad times. I hope I can find a DVD of this because all VHS tape does not judge. <br /> <br /> I think that if someone shows it to their child, they will bring the same result. They just love it. <br /> <br />
