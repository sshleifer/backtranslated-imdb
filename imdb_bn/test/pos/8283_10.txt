It is one of the best movies you can find as a child. I lived with the 4-year-old 8-year-old chipmunk adventure. The story of this film was: Dave continues to tour Europe, and is killing boys with Miss Miller. While playing around the world in the 80-day video game, two villain Clues and Claudia (brothers and sisters), chimmunes and chips are an adventure around which kids are walking their way through the hot-air balloons all over the world. Do they not know that "the game" is really a diamond-runner ring. And if you get from villains at the airport, a chase ensues! And Claus and Claudia Prison and safe with Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Janette, and Alanor Dave and Miss Miller. But I'm warning you now, it's a musical instrument and it's a very good one. Most people hate the musical instrument, but I am not one of those people, I do not like Rocky Horse, Greece, Songs, Cats, and just framing music about anything (except my Fair Lady). If you see it, share it with your kids (if you have one)!
