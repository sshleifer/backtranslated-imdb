So I think that Bud and Lou just liked the mess with the classic story (though they had some interesting results). In this case, they are sitting in a bad boy's child, and Lou tried to read "Jack and Beanstalk" to him but fell asleep and dreamed that he was the jack of the jacks and Bud, and they rescue the princess and princess from the beanstalk climbing monster (body Baer) . <br /> <br /> I was trying to make an omelet long when Lou was my favorite scene, and ... well, I would show you what happened. It was as an Abbott and Costello film, they had some unnecessary songs, but it was also more interesting than that. For other interpretations of the classic story, both episodes of "Behavioride" and "Gilgon's Island" represent episodes.
