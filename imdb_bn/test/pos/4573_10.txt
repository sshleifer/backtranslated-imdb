The drug judge thinks in my mind and thinks it in the society and keeps them in film. Actually, the movie is a social commentary. It almost seems like a documentary. Leak Wilson has done a great job, which is an annoying average Joe (mostly in most movies). <br /> <br /> Course Idiresis was the ultimate extreme of the present society. But that makes an extreme, most fun funny, in any circumstance. Fiction is not actually a reality, it's much different than that. <br /> <br /> Contemplating the materialist hip-hop culture of the kids and proud of being unconscious. When people feel useless in life, they breed. Give them a purpose world. And it seems only the most reproducible of bad people. I understand how others do not like it. It does not help most jokes to make second-class bathroom humor. Kevin is not much different than Smith's film. <br /> <br /> Odyssey is the reason, because any intelligence (good reason) is dropped. <br /> <br /> The return of Mike Judges was frustrating.
