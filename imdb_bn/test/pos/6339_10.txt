An extraordinary episode, showing Dean is not just a good taste by picking her girlfriend, but it shows that she has a heart and loves only one woman and she is not just a person who loves and leaves M! Aweso e Episode This one applaud them. I hope that in the next few months, they will go back to the relationship with Casey (if next season ??) then I would like to see him return to his "supernatural" life, especially Dean. I also chose a African-American woman as a special woman in her life that has gone anyway. I hope they do not screw it up and do not end it in the end. The girl who played Cassie was really a perspective and it was good to see that the WBO in our daily lives was so good-an interconnected pair that became normal (finally!)
