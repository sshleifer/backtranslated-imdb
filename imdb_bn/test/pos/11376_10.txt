It was the best movie of 1998 and the best of 90's. Yes, it's a rip off of Goodfellas. But not saying, good poets borrow, great poets steal. And PTA has stolen brilliantly from some of the best, plus adding some of her own talents touching. I gave these ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason I am commenting on this (because I could only have stayed all night) who have seen VHS psychological problem ... Do you think? This deserve full screen experience. Shot looking at the beginning! I saw it five times in the movie and did not get annoyed to see it in the video. <br /> <br />!
