The final installment, Aaquawa and Ricky Takuchi (its opposite overcote seems cooler than ever!) Seems to have attacked this time in the future for one last war against each other. The plot gives Blade Runner a lot, but Tashshi Mike's low budget, progressive, comic style. I think it was the weakest of three DAO films, and although the last was still abusive, it lacked the previous two shock levels. Compared to Achi the Killer and Visitor Print, DOA: There is nowhere to be the final final, but it is faithful for the other two films of the triangle. That said, fans of the first two (and Mike's fans) will get much more from this because it is related to three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two characters.
