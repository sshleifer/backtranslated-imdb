I learned a thing: If you do not want to be frustrated, you will have to take this movie as a fun time comedy. The image is enjoyable because it is a delicious comedy. I think over-hip damaged it: too much magnificent Monica Bellucci is displayed in a few scenes and is not so good they wanted to trust you. He was irrelevant, lying: The best actress in the movie, Sabrina Impexito, who talks with the perfect Tuscan accent, and burned with Massimo Ciccharini. Elo germany is very, very good: in my opinion the most promising young Italian actors. Danielle looks like Otolle Napoleon, but I like other actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Costume and production designs are ok: Sure, American timed movies are the most important reason for this big budget, but the reward for the lack of Italian skills is rewarded. Money A nice time comedy, in a nutshell, the first-rate casting (except for the Baluchi and the Otules).
