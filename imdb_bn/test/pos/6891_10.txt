Although it was closed for 6 years, the promised land was one of those generations that came once or twice in a generation. Good cast, supporting cast (among them, Richard Thomas and OC Davis) and crew. Plot is believable that MacRoney packs his family, and after being hit by Vietnam many years ago, after being frustrated and experiencing events, "hell to all". I think many veterans of Vietnam-era, I included myself, could actually have been related to McRani's thinking, which finally decided to make his move. Many of us fought the same war in real war, after returning from war and finding that America was not the same place. The program gives a glimpse of what happened in a veteran's life, not just values. In those two cases alone, I think this is one of the most harmful TV series of our time. Why this program ran for only 3 years for me to exceed me.
