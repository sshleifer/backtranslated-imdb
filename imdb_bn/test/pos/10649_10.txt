Eisenstien's "Potempkin", (Bronenosets Potyomkin), created and perhaps in the silent era's best-known best film. Eisenstien has influenced the film since its use of film-making and montage editing in the form of these days. Odessa step massacre footage is strong today today as it was seen 70 years ago. Do not miss this picture!
