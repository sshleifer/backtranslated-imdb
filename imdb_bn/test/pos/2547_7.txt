Some reviewers have compared the Chop Shops to the theatrical release and Pixot of the City of God. I both saw the chop shop as well and in many cases, I think the comparison is not comparable. God's city and Pixot must have had a lot of budget. A low-budget independent film about hopelessness and hopes of running chops, frustration and ongoing life. One of the scenes was charged during the United States Open Time and the filmmakers had an incredible connection or the scene was filmed at other times and the US Open Footage was added. I say that I live in the area where this film was portrayed and tennis matches are underway when security is insane. It is notable that the actual name of the actors was the name of their character in the movie. Return to the movie. It's an enjoyable story about survival However, because it got a 7 ... because actors at times played extremely well. At other times, they just appeared to read their lines. If the actor is less eligible (for example, he was in the low budget "The Big Dis") I wanted more forgiveness. But in each of these scenes, each of these actors gave performance for example. At other times, they appear bored. The director can be fault here I had problems with the end. This is a movie that "just ends" Maybe be a part 2? Of course, DVDs are worthy. I will not bother the story briefly because this information is already available in IMDB.
