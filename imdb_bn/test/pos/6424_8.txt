"Footprints (on the moon") almost certainly made the weird, most slowly and most unknown galaxies. This may come as a substitute for some sub-series fans, but this film is regularly regulated by GAYYA trademarks such as bloody knife killings (especially by a masked killer wearing black gloves), many industrious decorative looks and unpredictable red herrings. However, compensation for all this ?? And much more ?? "Footprint" I benefit from the most unintended mysterious and non-stop compulsive environment I've ever experienced in this type of film. The level of mystery of this movie is so high and intolerable it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and fearful. Woman playwright Alice Sappi likes himself, what is happening or why you do not have any idea, and this feeling of total powerlessness must be the core firm position of the film. As an observer, you are interested in helping to understand the downside of this poor woman, but you can not do just that. Alice has been successful career as an interpreter, but her waking up in the morning wages her peaceful and peaceful life brutally and gradually understands that she has no complete memories of the previous three days. He decided to go out to find a broken individual photo of a hotel located on holiday Island Gama and investigate what happened. Some people, including only a little girl on the island, may recognize Elise, she used only the nickel's fake name, a red-haired wig, and she came to the island to hide from unknown dangers. Meanwhile, even the poor girls were unstable in the night because they were revising the dreams of astronauts traveling around the moon and Dr. Blackman is a strange scientist. The plot of "Footprints" is really bizarre and slowly boring, and especially the cosmic sub-plot is really hard to link to everyone else. Alice thinks she is a picture of a Saif-fi movie that she has seen long ago, which sounds reasonable enough to explain, but you feel a deeper meaning and real connection to all other events. Supporters of exciting and stylish Italian movies really can not miss this movie. This is the director's Luigi Bazzoni's Mental Tour-D-Force, with excellent music changing and changing minds. The lack of violence (or perhaps due to this), the film is actually boring and emotional pain Elise truly influences the audience emotionally. It often happens sadly in the case of Gayi-Cinema, but the sudden suddenly comes suddenly, and the painful events you saw for around six and half did not give waterproof explanation. However, the subject of "Footprints" has long been thought of after the film's completion and its dominant effect will only increase. Florida receives excellent feedback from leading supporters including youngsters like Nickellet Elm as leading female leading to Balkan fireplace. The prominent Euro-Slam star Claus Kiskski has received top-billing, but his role is only an extended cameo. This film is also much more praised by director Badgeoni (and more easily available) than Giallo's "Fifth Cord", so here "Footprints" will soon get a dvd-DVD release.
