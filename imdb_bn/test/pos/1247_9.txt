This is one of the most downward films of Bruce in my opinion, this is a great story and a great hearty movie with Bruce Willis's extraordinary performance! All the characters are great, and I thought that Vilis and Spencer were bracing together in Bracely, plus Bruce Willis this simply amazing! This is definitely one of Bruce's best comedic performances. (Waa'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa) and I thought it was very well written and well-made, especially the plus! It's good nature and it was great that you can see Russell's character (Willis) all over the world! Plus end was quite good. I think it should be more than 6.0 and it's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen! Plus there are many wonderful moments across it. All the characters are highly customizable, and it was also an intriguing love story concoction as well as both Bruce and Spencer Breslin both had some really funny lines (holy smoke!). This is one of the most downward films of Bruce, in my opinion, this is a great story and a wonderful performance with Bruce Willis and I would definitely like to see it! Directions are great! John TurtleTub has done a great job here and has kept the film at a very fast pace working very good cameras here. Nice acting! Bruce Willis is always amazing and surprisingly, he gave one of his best comedic performances, with cheerful Spencer Brasilin and Emily Montemar was chemistry, had some fun lines and died throughout the movie, he was one of the main reasons I loved this movie! (Willis Rules !!!!!!!) Spencer was fantastic as a small version of Brasilen Russell, he was very funny and once I did not get to my nerves, he was one of the best child actors out there! Emily Martyema Amy was as good and really cute as I loved her Bruce was very good chemistry. Funny as lily tameline genetic I liked him quite a bit. Jane Smart was better with what she had to do, which was not much. The rest of the cast is not fine. Overall a must see! **** PF 5 out
