This image sets the standard for all rock biology follow. It is through leadership energetic performance, cameras-work stability ('Rock-Video' clich√©s that were originally invented for Beatles in their first two films), Strict edits and as a non-ray presentation, as a symbol of the star or God (or giant) . Yes, there are minor holes in the plot and there is a little unreasonable incident, and there will be debates among the families specifically related to the individual. But here's the more recent "I Walk the Line" or the same carpenter's car as Lvs Biopic of the same era, the meaning of the life of the actor, its time and place, as the catalyst for the ideals of fans and gratitude, performance is manifested, and this is clearly evident in the case here. We did not come away from this film, why the body became a Hollywood star, but why? I can not see what else the film wants.
