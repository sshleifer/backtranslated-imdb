At least for me And rather unexpected - this topic A movie that asks you questions about your faith, your life, everything. That helps you see the world, we live through a lens - or a crowd of lens ... an ongoing, wonderful and hunting movie. <br /> <br /> and any of these best performance benefits from Kevin Spacy. Very good second by Jeff Bridges. This tango is not a false note. This is a perfect dance. Perfect 'end up <br /> <br /> <br /> What's up? Well ... what you want ... <br /> <br /> A movie wants to see again. Maybe not right Maybe a few days later Month Year But something to go to it - or come - back.
