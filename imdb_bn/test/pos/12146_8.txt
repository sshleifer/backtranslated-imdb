"Classroom Ricecus" is one of the best "Gangster" movies in France. Gangstars Films is not a producer of Noise France Perfect Cast: Lino Ventura, a young gene-pool, Belmondo (who created "Goddess Suefel", Goda, the same year); Marcel Dalyo and great supporting actor; Jos√© Giovanni's brilliant script, who wrote masterpieces of "Le Tru" Baker in the same year! How many years for him! Wonderful black and white cinematography of Ghislain Clock. And the Turtle Action, the cloud suite instructions that cross first-class Jad-Pierre Melville. Films in the second half are boxing companies with institutional trends, which sometimes last for more than two hours, Cloud Sutton refers to the people of blood and blood, and Melville was never able to generate extraordinary moments in the presence of two children. And sweet deviation, too much tenderness: Ventura's last time he saw his children, after coming to the subway (subway), it turned into emotional emotion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He thinks he can rely on his former acquaintances, but they are all humorous - we are far more than friendly friendships from Jacks Baker ("Techzage Pass at Grysby"), which was a continuation of Melville's life in the middle of the middle of the middle (sometimes silent) misguyny par excellence), a harmful minor resident, who is ready to report - we're gearing up at Gerard's "tears" Berg's behavior is far from simple. Clock works wonders with the picture: When the two children see their mother on the beach night, when the two children see their mother, they have to die after the customs officers are shot out. <br /> <br /> There is a good use of voice over, which uses swat only when necessary; In this way, when the last scene is visible we get stronger. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> Make good use.
