I saw it on TV in 1989 and it is not sorry to tapping it. I was very impressive and suspenseful. As the shows are unfolding, it is amazing and the person's past is caught up with him. <br /> <br /> Acting first rate and the story is exactly what the title demands ... "False fate" ... but this guy could not escape from life at the beginning of the movie.
