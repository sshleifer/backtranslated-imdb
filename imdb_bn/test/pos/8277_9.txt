Feature length is the release of the CGI movie this year, but it will provide a lot of entertainment to the children, because Alvin's Olivan Fantics and Followers have grown up with cartoon show versions 60 and 80, Chipmook Adventure is probably the best album and Chipmunce-based animated film. <br /> <br /> At the outset, the animation is so awesome, the designs of the character should be in cartoons - just like motion picture movies, it's just fun to watch. There is no Celeb voice, no CGI generated effect, just pure quality 2-D, hands-drawn animations and colors are superb - bright, bold and beautiful. Comedy and humor is usually the Chipmunk standard and the description is spot-on. Actually, Chipmun Adventure is a live action movie that should have been, but not so. Alvin, Simon and Theodor compete with Chippets, Eleanor, Janet and Britney in a hot air balloon competition, as well as face all kinds of problems and conflicts of the kids who have to solve them in their own way. And no chipmun film is complete without the strange representations of classic rock and pop music. <br /> <br /> Chipmun Adventure is similar to kids and adults- one of the benefits of CGI movies - such as 2007 edition will get a few new testimonials, 1987 film will apply to young and old chimp fans. Bagdarasian and Carmen gave the voice of the three Helium voices of this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie shows the cartoon fans must be of course - you will not be disappointed. If you have seen live action version, you feel that this movie is a lot better effort. If not, you must look at it and forget it or even forget Jason Lee's movie and this should be the alternative.
