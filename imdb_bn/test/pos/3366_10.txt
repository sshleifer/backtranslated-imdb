There is nothing left about this Perry and Croft Masterpiece, which is as good as the best festivals, thanks. But finally, James Beck was impressed with his sadness before being involved in it. It has been shown from the beginning that the platoon is formed from the national emergency, boys like Captain Mainring (Arthur Loay) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier) are seen in the series. <br /> <br /> Along with the way, he has a general interest to show up to the mining authorities, but the chops can not help, but each bark will bark bark and suspect the attack. While capturing the Nazi air hostess of Church Church hostage, they have a chance in filming to free themselves. <br /> <br /> It was a nice ending, especially to the Mainwaring General who was able to prove himself. , Given the last chance of shape. A great movie, lots of good lines and smiles, it's another for DVD lighting - I'm glad that the BBC is repeating it - and these days were entitled to 2.8.08 'Father's Army Night'. Can not be missed!
