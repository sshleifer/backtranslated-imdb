In today's world advertising and teenage horror and sensational thinking, it is very rare to see a movie and nothing about it. Movies like Sequo and Blair Witch, when Suspense (both with both big build ups), we are spoiled that we know about the best scenes and least plot before we see them. With a silent witness, a rare behavior, I stumbled in this movie and in the middle of the night it was scared of fools. I was frightened by the annoying Russian environment, the 'snaf' theme and silent clutrophobic misery and the fact that the characters (ridiculous, which can always be duplicate) may end up in a second. As it is a low budget and rare film, so we see it without any expectations. This is a rare movie role, Fie Ripley, ready to be watch and excited, completely unexpectedly scared and thrilled.
