Make sure you enjoy this fun comedy part of your holiday season! If you appreciate Dennis Morgan or Stanwick repeatedly, this movie is a fun to watch. They work really well together as you will see this movie. The whole throw was very entertaining. Since I was a fan of Dennis Morgan, this film was the real act! But ... everyone can enjoy it! Recommended!
