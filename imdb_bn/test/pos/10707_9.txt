The story of one-day hope was highlighted by our young man's sad reality. Fawlia Rising attracts a horrible, unsafe and unfair world and shows through beautiful colors and how music and its dedicated friends do not accept that world, and prefer to change it through action and art. A beautiful, picturesque, beautiful, beautiful and beautiful picture. I have shown this film to many high school students as well as those who live in poverty and gun violence and they were fascinated with Anderson, the playwright. I recommend this movie to all children over the age of 13 (due to some subtitles and some pictures of death).
