Knight hunter is a sold B-style action movie. Get a life and people grow up. Don "Dragon" Wilson is not a kick boxer, (fame) and actor. If you are looking for Oscar, brothers are not here. Looking at the kick-ass action movie with the low budget below, this is it. Plot line can be a bit thin, but B is not what the movie is. I'm all a critic and understand how a man junks another man's treasure. Get real people, an Oscar contestant to judge each other, just fool Horror fighting scenes, mixed with a new twist on the vampire moves. If your fans see it, if your frustration fares to something else.
