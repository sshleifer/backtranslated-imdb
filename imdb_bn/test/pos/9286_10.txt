If I have permission to watch a show in my whole life, I must choose "Chassar war in everything". I think "Chess" is the most fun of all the satirical shows in Australian television. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By purchasing some water up to tourism advertising or coke factory, bathing with $ 2.40 makes it nude. Chess boys go there <br /> <br /> "Changer's War on Overing" with the above (and / or below) comments is more popular than their previous program "CNNNN". But CNNNN was just funny. Some unforgettable moments from the show ... Clear Cambodia !!! Classic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm going to stop me from the ringtones, I recommend that at least a chance for chessers You have to give, maybe you'll be more than happy !!!!
