When I was eight years old in 1959, I saw this movie on TV first. I did not know anything in the West but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie "Mighty Joe Young". "Wagon Master" is attracted to me by "Children of Pianors" songs. Murrien C. Cooper, who made the film, performed the original music commission to fit the mood of a particular scene, and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper is the highest stain rental to create a mood for his classic creation King Kong. After Steiner won the Oscar for the theme "went with the wind". Cooper was also the producer of "Mighty Joe Young". If you think that the music was important for the Big App, Stephen Foster's "beautiful dreamer" would only respond. In 1947, Cooper was a partner with John John Ford, who had instructed "Wagon Master." Among all the famous Ford West, it is my favorite favorite, which shows his brother Francis and Sullivan Janes Arnes.
