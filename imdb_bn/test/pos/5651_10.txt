This picture is a knockout, a happy memorial for the fires in the notable plain, a memorable memento for the time being, he feels his mind for a long time and at the end of this ruthless film, as a man dies thirsty, he believes that he is at home and He left all of this last confusion. Billy Wilder's Big Carnival (which comes to mind) is the only film that comes as bright as the short essay of Con Ichica. When I think the whole picture is bright, it seems that two scenes seem like when Japanese soldiers are trying to escape (Americans have been there) Americans and genocide, True Heroes and American soldiers and a beautiful Philippine Girlfriend, the soldier was getting cigarette on the street, He smiled and laughed, then his face shouted, the two Japanese soldiers surrendered. To try, he took a gun and killed the joy, the American soldier tried to stop him, but there's no chance, to me, the Philippines, the Japanese talking about torture, it's great movie if you have the stomach, but it's all great.
