A respected royal golf event <br /> <br /> 1. Edge Wis Shawn Michaels <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 is a very powerful opener ... The performance of the Hill was similar to the amazing event. The whole id edges night .... <br /> <br /> 2. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Many people hate this challenge, although I like it, I thought that Headenrich really played his role. The tension was not surprising until the match was related to Kenny and Snitch. It gets better. <br /> <br /> 3 Cart Angle Voss Big Show VS JBL (WDIA CHAMP) WWE Title Match <br /> <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 surprisingly good match, because it was really exciting in the roaming alone. Of course .... each good title match .. good speed .. even though the end of a forecast. But not all royal rump title matches are predictable. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (World Title) vs Randy Orton World Title Match <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhat an anti climax. <br /> <br /> 5. Royal Rumble Event ... In other matches, BTW was a few segments ... two were really cool ... Christian and Guerrero steals 30 entry tickets. The event was good 7/10 if the army could win but 9 But unfortunately, my biggest enemy Batista won (why I got it) .. It comes down and drops and keeps the whole laughing laugh.
