With documentary film, the question of realityism always crop up. How real is the film and the filmmaker uses? Need to fly to Little Dieter, Harzg was much more exploited to tell a person's story to tell his own story. From the beginning, Herzog's role as a storyteller is obvious. Fortunately, he is a major storyteller. The little DIETER I've ever seen, the most interesting, the most compelling documentary. Ditcher's story is frustrating, and hezza's attempt to reunite, which puts the diatri to stabilize his story during filming, it's very useful. The story that Deutter is true is true, but the discourse is always present, the separatist commentary from realism. This film must be seen for a student of Documentary Film and / or Warren Herzegz.
