It must be said that The Cell's director, Tarsem Singh, has established his first feature, which has gained place as one of the most spectacular movies of contemporary movies. More of a glue experience than a film. As a thriller, it's able to perform and a cool score effectively above the top of most of his colleagues, with a seemingly suspenseful atmosphere. However, in the end, it's broad and annoying set design and the ability to carry out the picture of forced terrorism in the picture. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the most recent films that have made negative comments about the cell; I will discuss some of these films in the film's defense report. The plot seems to be a major concern and it is not revolutionary and takes a lot of credit from Lamb's silence, it can never be the most important aspect of the film; Plot itself through a car through which the eyes of Tarsem are presented - scary and surprising - at once, presented to the audience, similarly Lambs's Silence Plot is a fascinating study of his two main characters, Intermediate, Lecter and Sterling. Although chin kisses are obviously superior films, it is unreasonable to condemn cell plot, and to appreciate the same breath-breathing kiss. <br /> <br /> My final concern is to mention the "MTV Style" instruction. It hurts me to see the condemnation of managers using innovative cameras and cinematic techniques. A camera can be more than just a device that can record events; Connection, pan, color combination, and more, all are used in the cell to create the feeling of a dream-like state, which it can not achieve otherwise. This is essential for cinematography, because the whole edge behind it is the concept of a serial killer's undercurrent. If you just want a series of static shots, stay with stage plays and leave the movie completely. <br /> <br /> It says that the cell is both pleasant, awesome and exciting, both of its pacing and design. Anyone can see the past - perhaps unclear, yet not dust - Screenplay will be one of the best movies of 2000 years.
