It gets really right when this image gets right. And when it goes wrong ... I would say that the film's full 3/4 is a great one. I can even detach the bad bits. It's everything that has to do with romance What you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes, but it goes in about 30 minutes. If you can do this, I would recommend removing that category. It is nothing but interpretation of its deportation. It should have kept aside a minor plot point faster. Fortunately, it's nice to have 0-30 and 1: 00-2: 19 (the end). <br /> <br /> This movie has many great performances and is equally terrible. The other thing in this movie is acting just like perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov is as slimy one eye as slave Kaptah perfect. It is one of its best performances with his role in Spartacus. Mature Victor as ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of his best roles is the one. Jean Simmons was lost as Merit, the perfect girl of love with our hero John Carradine gave excellent support as a robber of philosophical graves; And Michael Wilding was an extraordinary, idealist Pharaoh, who tried to bring Egypt peace and monotheism, tried to make one another fall only because of the unwillingness of the war. Now for the worse. Edmond Pradam as the ship is sadly mischievous. It's unfortunate because it's the main character. The whole picture revolves around it. She is actually rather good as daring exile and wise elderly people. This is due to its sorely limited range. He does not seem able to put any emotion in his word. Especially apparent during the time of those love scenes beyond this peculiar. He spent the last half of the film as an old man, whose performance he is just enough. She has perfect voice for characters. Sapphire, treacherous Babylonian women, as well as Bela Darvi said less about me. <br /> <br /> costuming and set magnificent This is the only film I tried to know about attempts to depict life in Egypt as is not scattered by Jews or Romans. The picture was held in the 14th century BC. Which even before the Exodus. The only monotheist is the Pharaoh Aakhenaten and his followers. Most epics contain the same strong elements of religious initiatives, but it is done differently and it is displayed at the very end. An interesting note: Following Akhenaten as Hurham's Firah, this film completely goes over the most famous Pharaoh: Tutankhamen. While using this name something strange seems to increase the awareness of the film. <br /> <br /> Be careful: it is a 1950 epic film. If you do not like these things, do not expect it to be different. It is different, but it is still an epic. I appreciate this movie, and I am thankful and tried to do it. This is a film that should be remembered better than this.
