The movie has flaws, but it is a light in the light of the problems of living in a country that does not have democracy in any country. It gives you compassion for the people under this government and you want to know more about their life, their struggle and potential leader Aung San Suu Kyi. This makes it a wonder why our government will interfere in a place that we do not want, even though those who ignore those who seek help.
