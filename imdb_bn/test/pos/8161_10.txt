Without a doubt I saw the most fascinating recent Gay-based film. CJ J Cox hit nail head with this one. She believes, the way in which the affairs of the family and sexuality are conducted in the subject is very good. Welding was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a great job to drag the character of Christian and Steve Sandhaus will stop your socks from Haroon's role. Both roles bring an incredible amount of reality and this issue has an impact on young gay men. The identity of a homosexual man who grew up in a very religious environment (though not Mormon) was characteristic of Harun's character. Strongly recommend this film to anyone, trustworthy or not, who is interested in dealing with many gay gay families and friends of immoral world during adolescence. However, the music of this movie is moon! Another great job by CJJ Cox.
