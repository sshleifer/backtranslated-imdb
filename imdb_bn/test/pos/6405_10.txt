This wonderful bright spot on the small screen was so talented that writers and actors were such a spectacular scene which was the most inhibited state for the people of the world, the most inclination for the sun deprived state. Most actors go bigger ... Another indicator that the sad thing is lost. I used to live in Columbus, Ohio, with my (now ex-husband) very big family 'no no !!' Each time it will be taken again by the baseball game broadcast. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wrote here was against 'Rozan' ... all my former and I noticed that it was always continuing by the Bible !!!! Yes, Fox is really something that has ruined something wonderful and nothing will never equal! Thank you for the memories.
