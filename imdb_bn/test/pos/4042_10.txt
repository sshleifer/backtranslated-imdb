First of all, I can remember that this story is being told about 6 or 7 years ago in this story of primary school, so I got acquainted with the story. Many of them have been changed but many fans and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) will not realize the hard fans died in the film. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie. I first saw it in about two years ago (the first part) at Christmas, then it was probably the last time in Christmas that the whole thing was caught again in the same channel. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it may be a bit too long and too long, but a compelling story, a moderate acting (especially from Snowy Founta and Hobbs) and a nice touch of beautiful scenery, costume and magic. Really makes a special movie - which really reminds me of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Despite the differences in the book, I think the film presents the whole char character across the picture once I painted new themes and ideas (including autumn, season with winter season etc.). <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for the DVD for a long time I live in the UK, and thankfully I saw an advertisement which shows a series of free DVD deliveries in Daily Mail. Usually do not get, so I got Yesterdays problem and finally there is my DVD. If you miss it and want this rare DVD for region 2, then I suggest you to collect tokens from the Daily Mail and think your DVD will be distributed through Christmas. <br /> <br /> To escape for a little this year, in the Christmas season, set your fire, soften and look like you and the kids will probably enjoy this great movie. If you do not have it, then it will probably be repeated on this Christmas channel 4, so record it!
