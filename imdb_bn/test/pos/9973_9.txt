Michael Radford did an excellent job of bringing this tough game to the screen. He took a game with a reputation for anti-communism, and showed us that Shakespeare knew very well about the humanity of the Jews. Radford said after screening, and I agree that Shylak is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be brought back by a driving, forced revenge mandatory. He has more accurately mentioned that a man who was a Semitic, could not write Shylock's statement "If you spit me, am I not a blood?" Radford is the Jewish descent itself and he has been picking good and bad all the characters with delicacy and honesty. No character is free from errors; No character is evil Radford has established this game in the 16th century, which gives a great background to the prototype of Shakespeare's words in discrimination and despair. <br /> <br /> If you get to have a chance to talk about the film to Radford, then I highly recommend you take it, because in 16th Century he gave details about Venice's life which he enlightened many choices and gave him a lot of depth to watch. I hope the DVD will come out with a comprehensive commentary. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jeremy has an excellent screenplay from Ernius Antonio, who resigned himself to show himself past misunderstandings. Lin Collins, a relative unknown, gives us a completely flawless, stunning, and detailed work as Portia. Not only is Mrs. Collins beautiful - she rarely sees PORTIA level intelligence and humor in the trial scene in a generation of this game. Other Castes also do a great job, a remarkable performance like Criss Marshall Gratiano and playing a silk foil, Alan Korduner's Tubal does a nice fine job. Finally, Al Pasino demonstrates the performance of his usual firm (and loud), while his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he does not say any words, but you see the emotions and madness that flows in and out of it. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
