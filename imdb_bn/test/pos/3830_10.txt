Finally, I did not understand how much this episode was taken from The Demi, until finally I saw the movie (it has been a flash of my pale war since then). As well as Run Silent Run had several elements raised from the deep. There is nothing wrong with stolen the iPhone until you do anything cool with them. The boy makes Rodenberi a little cooler with the company. <br /> <br /> The story begins when Romulans violate the 100-year old agreement and cross the neutral zone and destroy a series of federation outposts along the zone. , Apparently to test their upper surgeries and invisible screen (the next shift in the balance of power between the Romans and the Federation, in their viewpoint) as the beginning of an all-round attack. Kirk must decide whether to fight the Rouollan ship to try and stop the war, or indeed the attacker is at risk of being more at risk after the destruction of 4 army forces. Kirk wisely likes the next one. <br /> <br /> This federation, the Romulans, is an enemy of a warfare, our first appearance, distant relatives from those who are still respected in their own way. However, in contrast to their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not leave their emotions and violent and imperial ways, even if they were technically advanced. <br /> <br /> There is no mention of Mr. Styles, the ship fleet and the enterprise of the main enterprise board of this episode (Romulan Commander's Gong-Ho Junior Officer has its own problems). The important thing to him is that he hates romance and speech. At last the speaks his life (naturally). It is strongly opposed to Captain Kirk and Romulan Commander, in which there is no personal illness to anyone else. Both men are simply doing their duty. Actually there is a mutual respect. This is the first Trek episode to deal with the challenge directly, and it is so extreme (Seven 3 is not so subtle that "Let your last battlefield be there"). <br /> <br /> Like the enemies, we have a classic chess match between the two ship commanders who are actually quite similar. You can see directly that this captain is both good ... every good. If you were going to war, you would ask this leader as your leader. Both honorable and modest men are bound to duty. Even though the Roman captain is bound by the responsibility of his home country, he still thinks he wants to destroy itself instead of starting another countrywide war. Yet he still does everything he can to make him a house, just as Kirk could stop him. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best of the track is 5. It includes everything: Most actions, mysteries, great dialogue, fine acting (I still played the best track role of Romulan commander Mark Lonard), and it managed to maintain his social commentary without too much advertising. For the last time Rendenbari forgot when he did the TNG. See this episode, then see The Demon.
