"Sir" played Lever 200 times, but tonight he can not remember his opening line. Sitting at the mirror, her eyes reflected the king's madness. Face the word of his dracher and asks him slowly. This is the frustration wind of both men. This powerful actor is forgetting about his abilities, his valent surrogate wife, including consort with major Domo - is aware of the decline of his boss in the madman and knowing he is more powerful than facilitating his forgiveness. "The Drescher" is really the story of love between two people. Over the years, they have become mutually dependent on each other and can not even think of each other in the future. Second World War is set up, secondly, there is an equal number of "emperors" associated with the Shakespeare Company's fortune, with a similar number of hash and winbase, a dramatic drama known as "old school". The part that he plays is impressive on the central level and on football, he is raped by his listeners. But, somewhere deep inside the ham, he ate most of the food during the deepest time, where he is still sometimes shining, the glory of his former glory. Hope it fervently for its audience that it caught a glimpse. Mr. Effini focuses on very glamorous ham, often at the point of joke, and when you are ready to dismiss his performance only as a hyperbolic and blaster, he will create a moment of fine subtlety and weakness that can convince you that the great actor is playing a great actor. Mr. T. The same for the colon. His picture is easy to write. <br /> <br /> As Norman practice. Here instead of swimming in the way of our camp, there are middle-aged fungi, enjoying the company "The Girl" and the love of Gost's love in the theater of "Theater". There was - and I'm very doubtful - there are many people in the profession like Norman. For more about this, actors are more dramatized than ever, and they walk around with knowledge and affection for eternity and patience. I believe most of them will be laughing with a smile on the portrait of Mr. Curitien. "The Drescher" was seen on the stage of London, against imaginative knowledge, much more was drawn than Mr. Kurten's "Norman" movie. "Sir" played great Mr. Freddie Jones to give much praise to the audience. A memorable performance that impressed Mr. Courtney, was also reduced to a "acting-operative" - ​​opposed to a luxury actor. "Sir" and "Norman" can be almost incomplete without each other. Windows "Norman" was reduced to being his doll, which I am not sure is Ronald Harwood intended, but made for the exciting theater. Messrs Finney and Courtenay corrected the balance between the movie, relating the relationship equality. The British have come a long way from their initial appearances in "New Wave" pictures, when they were vaguely darling of the left-wing, "middle class and its shameful" movement. When the British movie was virtually committed to Hari-kiran, in the 1970s, they quietly shifted from the outside of the house to the wrestling, instead of playing some roles in the theater. The revival of more important movies, they are reappeared, shining bright curiosity. <br /> <br /> "Drescher" has identified their return, still fighting with power and talent, "we are still here" screaming to the world that this is not a big movie, but it's definitely a great movie.
