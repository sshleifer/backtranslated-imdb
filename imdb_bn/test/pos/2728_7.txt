Everyone knows now, 15 Park Avenue is a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister's story. <br /> <br /> Disclosure of schizophrenia is still seen as a sickness, which if people ignore it if they disappear. There are also those who, after appearing in the film, think that it appears that the illness expresses itself due to some supernatural effects. I think Mrs. Sen has greatly praised for "15 Park Avenue". He is not only for the general public but also those who work with schizophrenics ... their relatives, social workers, psychologists This picture actually helps to overcome many stories and misconceptions about the true nature of this mental disorder. I said that this film is basically based on his own personal experience with one of his closest people, who suffers from this mental pain. With that effect, I'm sure no one has been shown, out of proportion to the contrasts ... On the contrary, it is the true presentation of the truth. <br /> <br /> The performance can be better, as expected. Kankona Sen Sharma, Shabana Ajmi and of course Rahul Bose, very good. They appear as very "real" characters ... enough to be able to be able to identify with them at one time. People may think of me very annoying, but I think there is a moment when anyone can identify with Mithi! I think we all have "madness" traps ... probably some more than others. These people are singled out. After all, do we all have our concealed imagination and dreams? Impossible, occasionally? Would people dubbed us as "off our rocket" if we could focus in this area of ​​our minds? Is the low surrendered person considered to be schizophrenic because he / she removes his company ... instead of living in his own world, because the concept of security is the only place? <Br /> <br /> Kankana as a feline outstanding !! His performance is so easy ... he lives his part. He has shown the ability to reduce the audience and forgot the division between acting! Bdnews24.com told bdnews24.com that he was depressed in the scene shown on TV on the Saddam Hussein's arrest. His reaction seems so intense and intense ... that he really broke his heart during this sad time! Indian English is its brand, so spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> But at least some actors can not say the same thing. Both Kanwaljit and Waheeda Rehman, both excellent actors, feel easily ill during their conversation in English. Their statements are less than perfect ... humble and influenced, that they are making a maximum effort, became more clear from. Their conversations continued to break the smooth flow of delivery jerking and the story's release. <br /> <br /> The brutal rape of fenugreek (kankana) seems somewhat unnecessary. Any other event was just as good enough, I think. Here are some of the tricks to point out the worst publisher of the point sick. Psychological explains that no one can say with conviction or certainty, that the incident of rape brought the blocked trend forward to schizophrenia. So why are we in Mitithi's blood and unconscious position? Mrs Sen is trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the people is silent by some people taking the violence to stay in power ?? If so, the scene of rape is important but not strictly about the main body of the movie. <br /> <br /> The last bit of a surprise seems to be. Is the audience expected to find a solution? Where does the fox disappear? Mrs. Sen wants us to think what psychiatrists is saying, whose reality is more real and therefore credible, true? In other words, he is trying to say that we are not impartial when we judge those who are next to this fine line in the proximity and madness? I'm not very sure. <br /> <br /> The whole thought-provoking movie and good value. However, if you are a person who likes to be balanced and disciplined ... everything is cut and dry, which brings water-compressed solutions to every problem ... This film is not for you!
