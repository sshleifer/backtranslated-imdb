I thought it was a beautiful movie - very brave. Like beautiful imagery and I like to use broken glasses w / applause. Also how the best friend repeated the ".. and more than a year old" line of mine .. showed that their friendships were born again and increased, but there are some contests left ... I feel the elephant footage fabric. The dance concert was beautiful. At the beginning, slowly, it seemed that it took a while to feel for the character-the husband could have been more abusive - he seemed absent, when other characters talked about him-it was not really fit. It's a bit of a bit. Remember the best friend and husband .. Doctors' meeting indicates that there was no time left (to survive). So when the unfaithfulness was released, I did not feel much sympathy for the character - much more! The end was so great - the line btwn Her husband, and the scene where she is drawn is bright!
