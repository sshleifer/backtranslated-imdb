This event defines an era of wrestling entertainment, that I believe, is not equal today. Color characters - their stereotyptical garb - gives a specific charm to the show which is then raped by society and by rape. Wrestling was then a bit of an innocence. The baby can see a baby with an episode of Jerry Springer. <br /> <br /> I look back now (I was 5), although I love both Warrior and Hogan, I think Warrior enjoyed more. Strong power. Hogan was a branded hero who weilded an impressive public image. On the other hand, Ultimate Warrior, was a masked man with few words - an extraordinary hero for a different audience. <br /> <br /> This challenge was so exciting as such a child duking it for every fighter in my dilemma. I had a place for both of them. Since this long, heavy battle was bleeding, the stains were high - at least for me as a baby. In the same note, because of Hogan's defeat, it made him more people - I feel sorry for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a great time to witness in this game.
