_Wild Life_ is a distinct similarity with the Fast Times at the Rigmemont Hi_, and _Wild Life_ is short. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some other stan wrote the above comments. Of course there is no Ridgemont in the wild life. Ridgemont is impressive 80s flica. However, wild life is a fun movie if you are stupid movies of stupid movies (especially when it is known that it is not considered as a movie of mind) is not as important. The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he is directly disrespectful ("I got a visa ... MasterGrade Charlates !!") The colonel also made a look ("Legislative Assembly ..."). RIP colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is not worse than the other styles, BTU. This is not worse than 7 for other 80 teenage comedians. It has a lot of feelings for a Cameron Cro film. Only the stanley gave it a 5.
