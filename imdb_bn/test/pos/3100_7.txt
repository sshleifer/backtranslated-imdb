Mother and leg were very popular and controversial characters. Their brooge films have made its way for television sitcoms and tried to follow its winning source. An obvious reference to 'Beverly Hillsbys', where the new house was bought with oil money, did not win any competition. Seatikum 'Nehart' in the 1980's, even you can break the background of rural background in this series. Still, I wonder if Washington-based author Bat McDonald, who made this character, does not do much damage than good. The pictures of the mountain cats are mostly spoofed by their hypocrisy and laziness. (The real life family who successfully sued McDonald's Katus ... claimed that they ridiculed and humiliated the sub-director's reference). Of course, this comedy and the situation brings us a lot of sunny and funny moments ... and political holiness as we know today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think McDonald still wrote these characters more sensibly and Universal International could show his author on screen with more dignity. (There are things like good taste). More realistic moments when the oldest son Tom is ashamed of his rural heritage, but he learns to accept his parents and siblings. For them, Kennels must understand that they are not suitable in a modern world. It's not a joke ... it's a cool fact.
