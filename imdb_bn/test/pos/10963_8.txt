After reading the credit 'managed by John Casavets' at the end of "Shadows", some white letters may appear on the screen: "The picture you saw is now refurbished". Since the filmmakers started using them, the words in the film are very important because I always follow because basically, there is no film other than a screenplay. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes followed the same goal, and he believed in the word of freedom; "Shadow" is the perfect example. It is a film without any main character, no main plot line; Most of the time people talk about it. Yes, connected in some situations but the casavats always use a fast moving strategy to reach the conversation, when the letters are going somewhere or someone is running away and not speaking. <br /> <br /> Look this movie everything. For example, jazz effects have a great score and many extraordinary singles and have a character that says they played a jazz musician and trumpet (Ben, all letter names are the same as the names of the actors). However, we did not see him playing the trumpet or jam with the band; She does not even talk about the music and just wanders with her friends across the city. They talk, many, and about their mind that something; Each of them is heading towards the ridiculous analysis of an intelligent sculpture. <br /> <br /> "Shadow" is interesting in its intellectual references, it is like the upper part, because these friends are not civilized. The only important character (Lelia) of the film, however, wants to be an intellectual. But again, he has made a very interesting conversation with an elderly person at an age, about the book he is trying to write and how to deal with reality; But intellectuals are nothing to do. At that same party, a woman actually creates an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks a man beside her: "Do you agree?" "Yes", he says, but you can say he does not know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, a singer (Hugh), speaks of his glorious day at the ceremony and we see him only once; But there is no mention of musical art. Cassavetes focuses on discussing the singer's relationship with his manager (Rupert), which is most often talked about trivial things and involves discussing real 'musical'. So, in the "Shadow" trumpet player is an important deal he spent with his friends; Is the intellectual wannabe girl managing ways to manage her romantic relationship (the strongest point of a movie) the way of managing and bonding with the singer's manager ?? Presence <br /> <br /> Why performance is not important in this movie is easy. Cassavetes who could not master the improvisation, except for the matter which was not really good. I believe none of them, but they must know how to improve a scene and you can see how good it is. "Shadow" is not about the actor; It is based on the conversation magic, about a way of making movies; And there you could say that performance means something. <br/> <br /> <br /> In each conversation, the camera is like Sturecare, in the eyes of every character, constantly looking for expressions that come with natural speech. There is a scene where trumpet player and his friends are trying to pick some girls. They are three, so they sit next to each girl on three different tables (three of the girls). They all talk at the same time and shoot the camera through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other, what they say they say? It's normal.
