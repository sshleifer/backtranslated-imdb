Although I hope that I want more of this, it was certainly an impressive film. All had great performance by Lead, and the story, though I did not want to call Chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this movie was the look of the film, because it was always cold and damp and it looked really good. I thought that the low budget is making the film suitable, because I do not think there is a sticky picture and clear sound in the film. Everything is considered, it has only diminished my expectations, but I am surprised that at last I am sitting to watch this movie.
