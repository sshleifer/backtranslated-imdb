Chipmount adventent <br /> <br /> There are some movies that I could see throughout my life and never be tired, and this is a nostalgic favorite. Chipmun Avenure tried to bring the old favorites of 1987 back to the front of the animation, this time on the big screen. When Disney influenced the film industry in the field of animation quality and box office, the Chipmun Avenver was one of the best animated movies not produced in the 80's. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and primitive, with Alvin, Simon and Theodore competing around the world with chippets (Gentle, Allan, and Britney). However, as soon as the chimpanzees face external threats, they do not know that they are the main heroes of diamonds. <br /> <br /> Chipmun's avventure was never and never will be a movie that thanks the impressive plot. And those who do not love it as kids, the film will probably not be more of an enjoyable, yet forgotten, animated movie. But for me, it will always be a small familiar masterpiece. Some of the things about the movie by clicking on a few pictures for me. <br /> <br /> Every song is fun, excited, and ruthless. Recent highlights include a slightly risqu√© Arab dance chip cool snake. There is a very sweet song that can sing songs about the world of Chimmuns, and we can see them in major landmarks around the world. One aspect of chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying voices, song authors would always be able to write lyrics which were never interesting to consume them. This picture is no exception ... if you ask me it is one of the best animated film soundtracks of the 80s. This is <br /> <br /> Each joke is beautiful, hearty and funny. Bits between bad guys and a joke puppy are very funny. And Chippets are often seen to be forced to marry by a child emperor. Comedy drives kids to play continuously so that they do not miss anything, but everything is suitable for adults, with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained. <br /> <br /> It is a really fun trip which completely bent its ambition. The purpose of Chipmukt never aims to do more than that, it is a humble fun. I'll be the first party to be a prejudiced review because I have so much love for Chipmun's aviation that I will never be able to give it a bad review ... yet it meets me with child's satisfaction. When watching it Everyone knows that everyone has their random favorite from childhood, and for me it is this movie. And 5, 12, 23 or older, I can keep an eye on any movie that is a great film in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ... A- ...
