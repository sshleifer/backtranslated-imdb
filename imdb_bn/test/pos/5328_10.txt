I was seeing external reviews (Ebert, etc.) for this movie and they were all quite negative. However, after reading a lot of them, I noticed that they all made the same point. Critics were frustrated that the film was as stupid as the stupid kill of the autistic child. Of course, it's a boring image. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story that causes killings and blames the culprits for being guilty. They want to blame and solve the problem. Well, the status-quo theme is parading what kind of movie. Like society, critics wanted a resolution very quickly so that they could move to their next tragic opera. Perhaps there is no easy question to answer here? Then what has happened there is much more that is on the page. The film does not try to make it rational, but rather understand why. Steam me so much about this intrinsic review that they look at Spicey and Chadle's performance, both of which are great (and usually). But here's the other two of the halls here, except the icon. Gosling really gives an incredible performance that can deliver its ultimate talent. Somehow, Gosling is able to make an autistic child sympathetic killer. This irritates many, I'm sure. However, if anyone sees this film, they see what the Leland motivation is, it is wrong, but it is not bad. Still another confused young character as Malone topped her game. Basically, the child's assassination in this film is not the main issue of the movie. The main theme is the life itself and how it can be used to deal with it, height and downward and how sometimes they help others to live (which does not seem to work very well). There is a lot of good and bad in this world and how we have a direct impact on how good and bad we perform, and sometimes a delusional effort to do good, which can make the whole bunch worse. I think this is the end of one of the more memorable movies in one time and the end of the movie is something like history. I firmly believe that people should see this film with this open mind.
