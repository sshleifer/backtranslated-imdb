The latest entry of long series of films with French agents, OSS 117 (French answer of James Bond). This series started in the early 1950's and produced at least eight films (none of which was released in the United States). 'Oss.17: Cairo, Nest of Spy' is a boring little comedy that should not be ... not repeated, it will be taken very seriously. To find a long-lost friend, our hero has found himself in Egypt with a spying (standing on behalf of Moroccan Egypt). As follows: Standard James Bond / Inspector Clouseau Antics. Although our people are an extra genome, sexist, homophobe, although it is considered as pure Farce (I do not take it very seriously). Although roughly in rough language and cartoon violence, it is basically okay for older kids (12 years and above). As previously mentioned in the subject line, just sit back, pass the popcorn and just enjoy it.
