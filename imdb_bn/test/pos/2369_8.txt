I taped it at Sundance and had no idea that it was not a Miike film. I thought it was just another Kung Fu movie. <br /> <br /> I saw things like Dance Sax Player <br /> <br /> sounds like Oriental Gateto Barbara, and I knew that it should be Mike. <br /> <br /> I started the credit at the beginning and I had to wait until the end of the end to see Mike's credit. <br /> <br /> She has not disappointed me yet. Audition, the Lost Souls City, the Achi the Killer, and the happiness of Katakuri were all good flicks, and now I have found that this is the third of a triangle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
