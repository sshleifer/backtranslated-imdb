I have got free tickets for pre-screening of my roommate and you will call it at Atlantic, GA at Atlantic Station. I was hoping for some controversial, provocative, unnecessary overdone, walking .. But the film is much more than that. It is a story of two people helping each other. It is not overdone, and the film is done in the balance of caution as you care about or it does not say unnecessary. <br /> <br /> It is really well organized and not very important to yourself. It's beauty beauty. If it tries to take it seriously, it would have been unfortunately failed, but instead it plays humorous (some uncertain) and some uniquely ricks. Although Timberlake failed unfortunately in his role, the film is good enough to keep you next. <br /> <br /> I must definitely recommend this movie, if the experience is not something different for any other reason.
