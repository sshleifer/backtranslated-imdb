From one scene to the other, from one scene to another, from one word to another, walking like a walk like a windy wind, like the wind from the trees, how different is the sound? Like traveling, people will meet and tell their stories and then forever, who knows? And when these places roam through the lost hopes of other times, the 'thickness' of the earth's people breathes. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie with my friends, not all they liked it, perhaps they are scene-based and created stories, I do not know. So this movie is for those who are stupid looking on the ocean in the sun, moving around the hills or small villages, listening to the growing grass, which tells the story under six feet below, in the hot summer summer.
