I find new comedy fans who call it, are superb, able to get their views but there's still a new series, it's there. It's certainly good. <br /> <br /> Good thing at first. About 20 years since the last episode of Doctor Who "Beatlefield" was published, special effects are obviously good. <br /> <br /> The only BBC has always liked Doctor (when he tried to cancel the 70's and 80's). However, the expectation and the pressure were great, but I think the new series has done well, it's still not good because it has errors. Some stories were very poor in "Blake". I think it was written in a few minutes, which would never be bothered to rebuild Dalek's character or be irritated to see the old series. <br /> <br /> "Alien in London" Probably probably the best episode so far, it has started a new story about Alliance, which is going on in several episodes, including "Bouton". <br /> <br /> Now another bad thing, companion, Rose, Billy Piper, is not so great. He is really quite annoying but Dr. Dr. Who had finally to choose a young distressed Bappar and got that part. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eicleston is very respectful, she started to catch her around. When he tried to play the character, it was always funny that the right fifth was always absent but it made it even more serious and it shows. <br /> <br /> There are still some things that are not well resolved, Paul McGan was a doctor earlier, but he did not return. Besides the series, the series is quite good, I'm missing an episode and it's not annoying, so I recommend that a doctor who checks it out and wants to see the new doctor series.
