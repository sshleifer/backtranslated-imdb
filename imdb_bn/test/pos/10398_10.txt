There is another Antonio, which it comes out of tapes or DVDs again. A few months ago when it ran for the first time (even in the capital city of LA,) I saw it a few months ago and then disappeared (Art House viewers chose their own special areas, where there are old favorites like Antonioni. <br /> <br /> I was frustrated at first, it seemed impossible to be annoying, and the person who missed the opportunity (for years Antonion It was difficult to find financing) to add another masterpiece to his canon at an advanced age, but what was he to know about Antonio, and for the first time how did I respond to Blow-up and Passenger, I refused to give judgment until I saw the movie again. I went back to the day and I was not surprised that the film kept me, my stock About 40 years ago in El L'Aventurra, to create an environment of fine mood that is quite different (and quite playful) in a characteristic and fascinating way, which is enough for me to think and lose my lifelong, contemporary setting, Was not there. The scene of Malkovic was sitting on the swing of festive ocean in the ventilation sea beach, the weather was so beautifully sloppy and the only ano / U2 track in my shadow was my favorite; It was still, but now the whole picture was so great! What is a strange phenomenon, seems to be able to take the eyes alone and interact with Antonioi which is complicated simplicity or invisible complex. The strange thing is that although it looks at the first glance like a soft-looking porn and it features great sexuality and addictive gorgeous Sophie Maresau and other international stars, but this film is mainly Ant√≥nio's original, but you can not understand how deep it feels, Have seen and used it in a few times. For example, this is a comedy movie, which I initially focused on is a very interesting movie, but it was launched by another critic and was very happy about more philosophies (4 to pull it first and 'I'm going back for more). If this movie is promoted properly and directed to how it can be communicated, I am doubtful that it will be successful in the Art House Circuit, as most of the 60 films of Antonioni But more than 60's, and the film will have to find the audience on a small screen, in which a letterboxed DVD version (even when it is released) and even half the beauty will be lost. I think all the movies in the nuts are common or confidential, to see 'outside the clouds' and add a part of the tragic magic.
