One of my favorite films. Great Cast, Jonathan Silverman, and Bleth Danner lead. Serious dramatic situations with bright comedic punches. An accurate mix of character and story. Real people with real problems, and everyone has a different connection with family members. Sensitively move from little to sad to sunny-funny. Read quote. This is the best adaptation of a neil simon game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more of Eugene, Bilxy Blues (Matthie Broderick, who played the two-stage version) is OK, a little darker in the direction. Get ready to get away from the TV Broadway Dam.
