How do you feel if you have a few weeks left to live? This image helps you get to know the person who is facing this situation. It is said without sympathy and without too much emotion. Some may think of it slowly - but I think that adds to the reality of this film. Someone might see it as a love story, but I think his last day with his eyes is to see the seconds. The love of his life is the last part of his life and it gives more effect. Low keys and gentle, film life rolls out as many stories. Setting up against a backdrop without clich√©s and getting unexpected events. If you like your films are emotionally realistic, it might be for you.
