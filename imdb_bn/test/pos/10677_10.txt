At the age of 70, when I saw this movie at the age of 10. It was old on TV, and I saw, I was drawing so much into two astronauts full concepts of going on a mission to another invisible planet, I asked my mom if I could get the cassette recorder. She gave me So I covered Mike's cord around the channel knot, so Mike was hanging in front of the speaker. I have given enough attention to this movie at the beginning - and taking enough care to record. (Only audio - at that time there was no VCR). This plot will hang on you every word. Every minute of this movie .. End your mind. After seeing the journey to the sun's distance .. you have a flash-back in your mind for a long time. I've been repeating the audio recording for many years ... and I saw "ok" in my mind. Then - maybe 15 years later .. when VCR was normal, and they sold tape in the store .. I was always looking for it but never found it. But one day when I came to the Internet, I found it and bought it in a second. So .. this is the first time I've seen it for 30 years - I got to see it again. WOW! ~ It was spectacular! Just for reference .. I saw it 50 times.
