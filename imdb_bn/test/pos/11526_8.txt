I love it I was just sitting in "The Glass House" halfway (it turned off ... God is predictive plot and dirty of bad acting) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was awesome. Cameron Diaz and Jordan Brewster both loved it. I was avoiding the whole setting of travel around Europe in 60 percent - but they could make it more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things. Even if it held my attention fully, I think that part was incredible.
