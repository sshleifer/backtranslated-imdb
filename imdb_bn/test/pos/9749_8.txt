My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. "They're the flash gordon serials of laserdiscus," he says. "I have some giant coasters," I'm saying. But not so. This is the serial stone. (But I was almost crying and weeping for almost everyone I knew how to find laserdisk players for M.). <br /> <br /> There really is everything in this serial: lion, man, shark-man, earthman, and I guess you'll call me mango-men. Set and costume combinations, there are armor like Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian and even English knights. Wonderful costume. And some of it was a riot. Those terrific tights are exaggerated with shorts on the em dressed by Zarkov. And the sons seem to be wearing boxers in the furnace scene. <br /> <br /> It is named octocus octocus, from Arangutan to armpoid and tiger like a tiger. Even a dragon (a Godzilla-like creature, who threatens flash on some occasions before they die) <br /> <br /> Do you like invisible people? This is what you got covered. Do you fight the sword, wrestling (both animals and men), fist fight? Lots for any taste. We have a water city, a sky town, a city on a hill, and tons of hidden passages and caves. <br /> <br /> The impact of hockey? Extensive quantities. Sky City is supported by the stoked Radium reactor like the old time steamships. Rockets are "powered" by firewalls and continuous backfires and / or humming words. Cables are vastly visible (the flash is invisible and certainly like the time of rocketships). There are clouds in the sky, but when there is seen from Mongo there is no one around the Earth. Short show in "demon" camouflage. Sea Animals Invaded Flash & Including Threats Shark-men water by the way of the city. Dr. "Gadgets" in Zarkov's Lab Cracked Me. And they seem to be the same as a lab (he worked in Ming's lab and Bhutan). <br /> <br /> And yes, we have romance. Everybody wants Dell; Ming, Bhutan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Rajkumar Ara (Prince Baron), not the person he liked. In fact, it seems like the enthusiasm of many sub-plot concerns in the part of Princess Aura to try to win the flash. <br /> <br /> People think characters are awesome. That fat, horse-smile, king was delightful. He was the authentic artist who managed to wings. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? She was perfect. They should have been for the Emperor of the Stars. Ming got this serial to be my favorite character. Princess Aura was very small letters. And he pulled off nicely. I think by a long shot Dale is better actress than Ardine. Even the clever high priests had a distinctive role. Zarkov was good, but not a strong character --- and he always stood in the background while holding the Dell during the war scene. Now we can get the flash: Of course, flash, strong points, leader, hero --- and he did it well. A good actor in Crab and this role perfectly fits him. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I think where George Lucas has found the main idea of ​​Storker. Look at this, you can see what you mean. <br /> <br /> If you ever see an old serial (or any serial serial) it should be your first choice. The only reason I'm not this is 10, because the holes of some stories can be easily corrected, where only the strange ways were detected, and some weak characters (the king of lions and men of shark-men).
