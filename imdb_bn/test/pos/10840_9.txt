So far only the first episode has been shown, and there has been a great discussion about lesbian sex scenes. But for those who want to look in the past, they will find the story of incredibly beautiful love and in this episode anyone will end up with an annoying climax / cliffan. I got this story so powerful that I was inspired to read novels based on this great series.
