There are only a few films that can be called 'Must Watch' and Shepherd is one of these films. In many ways it was before its time (and you can tell it a source of inspiration for many well-known films) Copy by many, none equals, it's really a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story shows itself as a complex but intense but often ridiculous thriller and is highly provocative incentive for the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world after living in geological and disorderly forces. C. Thomas Howell is a 'Shepherd' who protects the population of various religious leaders by killing an inappropriate member of society. The whole idea forced me to think about our society. It's really a brighter social commentary, which is more than I'd like to say for some recent scientist / action blockbuster. Matrix Reloaded and Revolution None of the people think that any real innovation has happened, only the effects of video-games are very low. But Shepherd scores score on the scoring scale ... <br /> <br /> This movie does not allow viewers to breathe them. Peter Hammmann proves himself to be a gifted action director. We're talking 100%, high grade, fighting down home Kung Fu! It was nice. Really good effect, shoot out, bleak-futuristic cyber-punk look style ?? The film has its own elements. <br /> <br /> While talking about Shepherd, it is impossible to mention how many styles. The sights of this city are really stunning. It remembers the memorable view of Tim Burton of Gotham of Butman. And these spectacular photographs have been photographed with a degree in Graeme Mears, which shame Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall. Even special effects proved amazing. Apparently where the scenery occurred, the limitation of filmmaking. This movie is a ballet of extraordinary visual exhibition. <br /> <br /> Still, it has an interesting story through a strong cast. The acting (especially the Rowdy Piper) and the plot are both excellent, and excellently managed. Contrary to loads of future films loaded with strong artificial flavor, letters are trustworthy and conversations are natural and intelligent. I'm always proud to see a great movie like Shepherd. It's a shameful shame that it did not get better and did nothing at the box office. There is a barbarity of searching for it. This movie will affect you and you will find it cool 10 times!
