I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was young and I still do. I like Batman forever, but the real difference is that I do not have the date when the movie is big. I have noticed some scenes from this movie which did not understand in any sense: 'Hmm ... the people are angry. Hey! Where do they get the tomatoes? Then I thought, who care? This movie is not 100% serious! <br /> <br /> The original Tim Burton Batman was also good but in some parts it was a little chessy and I did not like all the actors. This film is not a wonderful cast, often associated with Gothic style and Prince. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, many people of Christopher Nolan have disliked Burton, saying that Nalan films are more serious and therefore more loyal to comics. I do not think it is a complete fact: - Sometimes Batman did not have the adaptation of the original concept, which was the culprit of a counter-crime with guns. -Batman has taken many forms over the years peeking 60 years (and somewhat with Batman and Robin) peeking his silliness. If a director is not good at this, then how long will he be able to portray Batman? <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman must not be serious. It's a rubber suit with a ear ear about a guy. Burton is impressive and able to create a perfect balance between the darkness surrounding the whole idea. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Nolan films and I love them too (especially The Dark Knight). This movie is just something which is more of my interest. Nolan's goal was to give more depth to the character and thus he wanted to explain almost every aspect of Batman. This is a bit more for me, I'm a big fan of Batman's more abstract version. Burton movies are more centralized around the theater and the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My stats are that you do not compare Notean with button movies. They are just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like. My respect is for both directors.
