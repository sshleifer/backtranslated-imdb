My ex-wife and I saw and were excited by the film's trailer. We waited to come out but when it was not very long lasting in the theater. After several years I bought it in VHS and I am moving to DVD so I can save it. <br /> <br /> I got this very movement. It's about real events in a real country. Burma has earned so much bad reputation for political violence that she changed her name. <br /> <br /> I am very sexy and can find women with little makeup. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDermand and Spalding Gray are only short. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After finding her little boy, her husband was brutally murdered by the fear of Laura (Arketa). A bad feature for a doctor. Her sister (McDormand) tells her to go to a holiday in Burma. There he witnessed a peaceful protest and stole his passport. In a bold (or stupid) step he asked a tourist guide to show off some of the tourism tracks. His guidance soldiers were injured and he spent the rest of the movie trying to get his own security. <br /> <br /> Every time I see it, it reminds me that we forgot a farmer in the United States. Living under military rule, socialism, eating at least is virtually guaranteed, looks pretty good in yarn.
