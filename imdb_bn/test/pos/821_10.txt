Van Damma has made some great films for years and it has hit a big ten in my books. This movie was amazing, in a five-star battle scene from Mexico. This image is about border patrol officers who protect the border of Mexico border. Former United States Navy Seals of the United States of America (United States of America), Van Dam and Scott Atkins, drug smuggling from Mexico is a great act like police and police. Although the film was not as good as it was until the death, it still played, acted and showed the film five stars. I'm always looking forward to these B-grade action films and they're getting better. Come on their van dame. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you enjoy movies - until death, hard core and second command.
