One night jumping the channel I just caught this movie started and hooked me from the beginning. This is the story of an adopted child Adam, whose mother had left him after birth. The film brings us from our childhood and discovers the very annoying information from Adam's past. I will not publish more, but it is a deepest movie and certainly will plot you. This was one of the best roles in my opinion Jimmy Smits.
