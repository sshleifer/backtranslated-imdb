I think all critics really hold this picture well. I have seen this many times, but I still feel the feeling of warmth and warmth for the first time. This film does not seem to fade my emotional reaction. The final scene certainly brings me tears, but on her birthday, the scene also takes place between Perce and the Children. And for the gentle gentleman. Something that's going on with the character Generous provider and problem solver. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. Run a perfect father and make us feel safe. I do not know how the film works, but it touches some of the English very deeply, which has gone far beyond our daily experience, but we still all want to recognize and revive.
