Where do I start? Walt Disney's happy motion picture "Lady and the Tramp" is my favorite of Disney Animation's Dramatic Canon, if not. However, this series ... is very low, enjoyable. I enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie. It was, (flame-shield!) Adorable! The Broadway style of song and film works, and I used to do hamming the rest of the night. If you can ask me, then I can sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the movie was (really) good for me, it was bad in many other places. Animation was scary from time to time. There was a shot during every encounter, I do not know ... it seems scary to me. Also, where was the lady? He gets two lines of dialogue and a dog hug scape at the end. He gets 0% interaction with the plot and his only son! <br /> <br /> But everyone, I like it. Keep it in the original than it is? No The songs are not good (although still interesting), the plot was very involved, it had nothing to do with the lady and it is not as clear as the first one. However, if you go with an open mind, you'll get fun, and probably 'gasp!' Like it
