I'm not going to ramble it but I'm just going to shorten it. Indeed, those who do not know how death actually happened .......... First, Hit Piper and Pru with the help of a force of flying around the wall around the demon killer. When the third sister comes down the stairs to the stairs, the spell that transmits him away but not defeated. (Three power needed) Leo comes to heal both of them and heals. They can be opened along the lines and the only way to turn the time back for a giant named tempus. The only way he can do that is to squirt underworld. She agrees, tempus turns back on time. Now at 7:30 in the morning. The piper with the giant force force comes in and the provoked hit. They fly again through the wall. But at the moment, the foyer says that there is no spelling to close the monsters. Kill the giant doctor. Doctors fly through the window. He is dead The giant has a great influence bye way which is a whirl wing type thing and the glass doors are isolated and there and the sound of the wind. Where it ends. Now .......... If the whole episode does not know what the whole world does not pay attention to the next episode. Although what I'm saying is not shown, it depends on my belief ............... Because there was no Facebook to call for Leo at this time, this time he came later . The rash survives because its injury is not as deadly as Pru and Leo Prue is well before her, so Pru has already died. Solve the mystery there. Calling for Pru ​​with a spell should work !!! And he should make an amazing look in the last episode. Ok I'm on the ramble
