For the first time I saw the poster, I was hung by its tranquility and beauty. Since then the city of Istanbul has been hunting in my mind. <br /> <br /> Not many conversations, not much music, the whole picture was shot beautifully and aesthetically like sculpture. It's a landscape itself. There is actually a lot going on in the film, but the director deliberately left our imagination, leaving the most dramatic part, thus creating a truly flat life. ** (light spoiler) One Mahmut's daughter can see the crying in the toilet and then go out without a word but do not fight them; A Mahmut may meet his mother in the hospital, but due to illness, his struggle is not. The most dramatic scene of this film is that Yusuf laughs loudly for a toy solder bought for his nephew, ** and thus when my heart breaks down to spread this annoying, lonely life. <BR> <br /> <br /> The story with all its insignificance of the cosmos shows the pure spiritual world of all our letters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, pardon ... and as soon as the story is published, their emotions, if I finally do not interfere with any outside things There was not really any way, which is absolutely neutral for an unlawful artisan artist like Mahmut, who tried every lonaar. <br /> <br /> I've finished the second observer Last night, I wandered on my shoulder, there was some vodka beside my bed and the entire picture went to the fright. I felt two real life, one outside the screen, one inside the screen. I feel free from all their loneliness and anxiety 'because people are feeling it inside. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I still did not find the way to survive in Mahmut. So he went out of his house to try to find out the answer from the outside world, cold and cross.
