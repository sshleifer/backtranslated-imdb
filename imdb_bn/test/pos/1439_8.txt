A dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction, Sinatra is wonderful in this film. At the end of the film is enough to think twice about trying to scream and scream and destructive anger just watching heroin in his scary writhing; Maybe they have to show this intelligent drill to kids of health class children. Our years are forced to endure for years. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a person who is trying to create a new, clean life after being imprisoned, to free himself from his drug habit and to work for dealing in illegal gambling operations, who returned to the flesh through human evil Came. He is being taken advantage by his employer, drug dealer, and even his mysterious, ruthless yet-fooled wife. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not like the movie, it's only valuable for soundtracks. It's all swing jazz with heavy, drum and brass sections. It helps to set the mood, with its glove, a little harmful sound, profits, snack medicines and card vendors, who always feel like a hawper like gloves near the Frankie machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend that anyone - especially if you like silent film, zoot suit, Fedoras, or jazz.
