Sam Firstberg's "Ninja 3: The Dominion" mixs martial arts with "The Exorcist" as a terrible break. The horror elements thrown on the screen are just ridiculous, but the film acts as a stupid action / martial arts flick. War scenes are good dancers and exciting, and the film is not boring. So stupid conversations, hairdressing and boring soundtracks-hold some beers and check out this one! Highly recommended!
