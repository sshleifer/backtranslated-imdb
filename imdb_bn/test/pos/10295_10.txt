In the last three years, I have seen this picture almost three years later and it was wonderful as before ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The quarterly and all their specials. This picture is one of them. From romantic and monika respect to true beauty with such a great thing with two beautiful women in Hitcoi Although Monica is very nice, Roman is a very sexy lady and she stole most of the scenes of her life. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why the man does not seem to have slowed down this film, and this film only acts as a reflection of its own unique journey of flowing characters, and you rarely realize that 116 The beauty and mystery of the minute has seen that it has seen and disturbed. <br /> <br /> This story, like most French and European films, will never translate across the Atlantic because the studio can not take the magic without any magic, as Hollywood's isolation is common in most of the movies lost in translation. Americans create brilliant movies, but not such ... probably if they work like a young Polanski, they probably will not be able to completely save the English version ... <br /> <br /> Those who do not see subtitles for them You will be able to enjoy the lifetime of unknown happiness. For those who can read, you will wake up to miss these types of movies ... <br /> <br /> I will describe it as Neo-Franco-Nir, but critics of this film will have to say only the cheese. I think I saw him adding four to forty five. He thinks Roman Boehngar is a kind of French meonis ... it's a sort of rendition fiction, it's aarti ... but more galactic Sawyer Fire ... <br /> 10 out of 10 are seen .. And got the phone number of roman ... that's the perfect French salad dress ...
