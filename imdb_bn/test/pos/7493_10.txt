This film is hard to harden. It follows the rules of PL fiction, but it is more successful by stamping its own unique style. Cast is nice, the script is great - and seamless (PL fiction-SQL) things are done brilliantly in time-series. I particularly liked how the image given back to the flash depends on what the story is dramatically telling. When it is one of the condemned criminals, everything is flashy and cool, but when it is remembered heroes, everything is frustrating and disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie - and so I find it extremely annoying I can not buy it anywhere!
