<br /> <br /> Diana Rig, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes to mention a few <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've spent more time in the hospital and I've been thinking more than a doctor for years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Has gone through crisis, and he became enamored with the possibility of getting involved with Miss Drumand (Rig). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can guess but it has become more fun <br /> <br /> This is not surprising, for sure, and if you are open to them, "Dark Moments" is a fun thing. <<br /> <br /> I love every minute, and I'm happy to see the DVD.
