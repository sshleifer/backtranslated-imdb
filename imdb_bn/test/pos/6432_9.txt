At the 2005 Sarsota Film Festival, I recently got the picture from the American premiere of this film. We got to meet Havar. He was not quite kind enough to sign a copy of the Blood Runner, before taking a time to answer some questions about the movie before screening the room for a packed theater. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed by this picture that I used to do this church, through which I compare the movies I saw in festivals. It was strong and moving, yet fine and short. The film describes how the story of a young man (old version of Roger) enters an undisclosed building near a street by a simple common room. Walking, he notice a single window, always open, from which can hear a hunting melody. Each day, he spends beside the house, sometimes standing outside for hours, hoping to get a glimpse of its residents, watching it through the silken rope that blows in the light breeze. At the end of the film, we found how important this house is and how it dragged our hero. <br /> <br /> The image was cut nicely. During screen time, a second unintentional shot is not wasted. Any single frame from the film can be alone in the art gallery. Rutger is amazing. He is mysterious, still approachable. His conversation included a series of such things that it is going for good or bad. His words conjure familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience. I was particularly moved to a scene where he saw some old pictures, remembered his favorite dog, his favorite horse and his first love. You have got the feeling that you are in his presence, because he has given you permission to see precious memories near his or her life around the world. <br /> <br /> I like this picture and recommend it to anyone. Looking for something fresh, intelligent and moving. All filmmakers will need to look for.
