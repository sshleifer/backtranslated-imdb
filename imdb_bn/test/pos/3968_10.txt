When I watched this movie I hope to be as cheesy as a Chess American film with the expectant actors. I was surprised that I was really completely wrong. Films centered around Burtley or B, who were rejected from all colleges - the actor is very normal to play B, and his character seems to be real - and decided to create a dramatic school so that his parents stopped harassing him. Does it. But load people see their fake website and join. Their feelings of grief can not be far removed from their best partner's dissatisfaction. College is the ideal place to teach you what you want or nothing to do. The school conflicts with the right college, which closes it. The film is a high end and I recommend you suggest it. It has flaws, but it's a good colorful movie with some predictable twists.
