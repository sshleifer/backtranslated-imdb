This is a very visual film. Through this, I want to say that the dialog is clear, often to the point of a silent film, it starts with a shot from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Silences are broken by a stunning word that is incompatible, StackToToets bite the hunting of Halloween and have fun with sound words that track voices.

Balzacian sense: Warmness of life and what it will be. The decision was made to leave his wife ten years ago and stay in the hotel. He touches occasionally, and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown up) and says his voice's sorrow volume.
