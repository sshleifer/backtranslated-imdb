Stan Laurel, it has been mentioned that, in the first 1920s, popular features appeared in short parodies of the film and made a real name for themselves. He must have played himself as a "mud and sand" (a parody of Rudolph Valentino's "Blood and Sand"). But I think a movie like this does not really work because Laurel was a great rebel, but because it could jump into the comedy with the audience and the scenes scene. After that, Laurel can loose with his inspired gag without making it in the background. I saw this day as "blood and sand" itself; <br /> <br /> The role of Lorel (if Robert Vasselin believes in the title card, or Roubabar Vasselino, if you believe how his name is written, it must have improved the experience.) Chawk Board, his mother was unaware of money By the way, my strategy for two is fun because it's a great joke, but it's an extra fun thing if the audience is aware of how it's blowing the air. Valentino's extraordinary and composer commitment promises to give her mother any luxury. <br /> <br /> I saw this is the best Stan Alone alone work. This is simply fun - if you have the chance to see the source material, even more.
