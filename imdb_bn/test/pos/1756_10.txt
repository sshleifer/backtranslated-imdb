Hello again, I have been thinking about my whole life about all these movies. I saw this in the year 1942 in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 5. A wonderful story of being good to each other, kindness, and charity. Forget about bugs related to each other. Just as they were people. I love this movie and so my adult child. This beautiful color of this movie. I will see this movie again. There is a story about a movie freak, which I just can not remember "why". <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
