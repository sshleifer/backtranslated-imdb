Forget about all those who tell you that the book is not good. So what? It's a film after all. It's a perfect joy to watch, fully made in Cephalonia, as well as fantastic photography but dark, annoying moments. I have only the problem with clear miscasting of Nicholas Cage as Captain Corelli. Still the film was amazingly amazing.
