This movie finally put me on the line to register IMDB so that I can vote (and comment). I've recently come to appreciate the well-produced "war" movie, and it's the most thoughtful one I've seen. <br /> <br /> When you think of the "stunning" sound it seems like this viewing experience. My husband and I saw this picture for the first time. It's running smoothly, at the same time exciting (no conflict). In Hollywood's hands, this story can only become another reminder, action-packed, top song time-waiter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Krystof Hadek seems to be without suprise or truth that to be exploited is a very "beautiful" boy. Headquarter's acting ability and appearance, my husband said (tongue-cheek), "Well, he's a Tom Cruise." I said thank you to Allah! You see this one, acting beautiful and understated.
