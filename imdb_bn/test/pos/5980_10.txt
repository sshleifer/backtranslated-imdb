Larsisa Sheppitko's Assentant (1976) An outstanding, serious account of the fight against the Nazis in German Occupied Belorussian, The Assent Great reflects Russian emotion with the horrors of patriotic warfare, but unusually both are bound to religious symbolism and are ready to accept the existence of great Russian collaborators. True war is not with the Nazis, who are not compatible with the Western Nazi investigator and Chattnikov, who can not find the power of self-defense in search of the self-confident forces of the prisoners. With many references to crucifixion, this story brings a heroic proportion by glorifying the martyr's martyrdom and its impact on the future generation. An extraordinary piece of work.
