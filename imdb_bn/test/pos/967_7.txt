Big fat lies a beautiful funny movie. But I was watching it, I thought about anything. Some facts in this movie are incredible. So really, the film is a big fat lie type. There is no way that he got away from all this. Here's all the incredible things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he imposed his father on the flesh and as he worked, his father Jason (Frankie Munz) could not have acquired gaining with that. Well, thankfully for us, he's not. So it could not stop him, deadly. <br /> <br /> Even if the grandmother was blind, she would still have realized that she was not a grandson. <br /> <br /> 3. They could not get on the plane, they entered the LA, they were like a quote salesman, they had torn into the studio, and then ... and, some pictures are a bit unbelievable. But it does not hurt to tell a little white lie. Trust me, I do it all the time. <br /> <br /> Big fat lies, though, at some incredible time, fun. It's so funny. But before I continue this review I say just one thing. If Paul Giamutty did not live in this film, then it would really suck. It will be awesome. Big fat liars are quite funny, though occasionally corny. I give it a thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Big fat liar: *** / ****
