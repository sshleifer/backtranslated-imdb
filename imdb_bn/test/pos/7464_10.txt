My friends and I hired this movie to satisfy only a friend who was very low in renting it. We all think it will be like "Canadian American Pie", but we saw it, we were surprised, we were silent all over the movie and like it! It was nothing like American Pie, and there was a plot that teenage girls would definitely want to worship (it seems that the man has finally pulled out the ants from him), that night it did not become my favorite movie, but its plot but actor And great writing. There was not a moment where I thought it was incredible. Everything related to someone living in a small town with very realistic and little prospects. I absolutely enjoy this movie and will advise you to take this opportunity next time, it's valuable.
