I feel that Lisa Kruger is easy to ignore. I personally saw his first film, Manny and Low of 1996, study a surprisingly eloquent character, and the performances were absolutely amazing (with Mary Kay Place's special credit). The image was played for a week or two weeks in the main urban center and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many people saw it as little. Kruger's second film, Commit, is released this year (2000) (after about two years of delay) and it disappears in the same way. And again critics discarded the film on a small scale and kept the film aside, praising the presence of Heather Graham on screen, but rarely his acting ability. And again, for me, the promise is a difficult success. I think Kruger has a true voice and a personal visual style and these features should not be easily ignored, because he works very annoying canvas. The title of the <br /> <br /> has many meanings, but in most cases, Jolain (Graham) refuses to leave her husband Karl (Luke Lys Wilson) and leave. He followed him from New York to El Paso and became the most striking collector in recent history. His respect for his marriage affair leads to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yes, the plot is simply simple and so easily overlooked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fifty percent is divorced at a near rate. And for me, its personal revolution against a succession of broken promises and fraud is fairly intelligent and strong. Believing this belief that people do not believe in each other enough, Jolien must inevitably discover that her beliefs are not narrower with society. Several comments he mentions his character as one-dimensional and I am afraid that this is a simple readable film. Or perhaps a misreading. If Jolain was just innocent then she would not be attractive. It understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of "normative" which makes it so attractive. Socialistically, he is a complete deviant <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, his mistakes are roughly rare and in this movie mani and lon, it's time to run. Graham was never good enough because he did not have a perfectly standard character like Jolien. For the first time in his career, Graham is playing an adult in a comfortable, even a little arrest. She carries the film perfectly. Both Lick Wilson and Casey Affleck (like Jolain's brother) have several fine moments, such as Mexico Mystic and Mark Raffalo and T-Bo, Alfonso will be as a little psychological truck driver. As Mani and Lo, the characters are part of their environment, completely part of the complete organic creation. These letters may sometimes seem to be pointlessly quirky, but they make sense in their context. Golan Bjogik, as an artist by Jolien's devotion, even fits in some strange ways, although her character's foreignness has never been discussed. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for me that looks back at the depth. Another commentator stereotypical Mexican painting lecture here. And again I'm tempted to make a mistake reading call. Joline is looking for self-support. He knows that his commitment is beyond control, but he can find it in any spiritual way that he can understand himself. Aura's character understands that most people do not believe in him and when he sees a woman who is respecting him, he trusts himself. <br /> <br /> I think I understand how this movie can be seen as cool, I would like to disagree easily. It's consistently fun, often sunny, and warm up all the warmth of the character which is very nice. <br /> <br /> I give it 7.5 / 10 and when I log in here, go to 8.
