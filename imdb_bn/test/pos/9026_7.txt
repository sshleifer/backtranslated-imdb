These pictures do not win any awards for greatness. But if you have one and a half hours and there are some fun-loving fantasies, you can do something worse than watching it. <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly young and beautiful, the script has something really fun moments and soundtracks are very cool. Rupert Prenzy-Jones looks like the most fun of Jack, when Laura Fraser, like Justin, is sweet, sweet and fun. <br /> <br /> I hired it because I like the series 'Spooks' which is currently running in ARPZ. And here he is young and buff and a girl's perfect eye candy for the night. <br /> <br /> Get some wine and some ice cream and have a chocolate.
