One of the worst known secret-based horror films of the seventies. It's great, exciting, scary, spiritual, and even here and at the moment, even very smart, which can not be said about such movies. I can not help to see some of the staffing and metaphorical aspects of 17th society and generation while completing this movie. The scripts are clearly cooked when the kind of "crypt" visible type is provided with some good old ones. The result with a creative director accomplished well is delightful and worrying thoughts. Simple, yet effective completion, especially shows how these things can be used properly. <br /> <br /> Excellent castes were unknown to me, as Moody without Liquid Jones but the town doctor as funny Sheriff and Storth Martin. Martin, surprisingly, always stole the movie. With that voice and skill she is one of the greatest loonies in the movie, whatever for me. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a mystery to me why this image has not gained so much recognition. I think it is almost equal to Rosemary's baby and exorcist, as well as almost the exact location of the hideous Canon. One Holluva movie!
