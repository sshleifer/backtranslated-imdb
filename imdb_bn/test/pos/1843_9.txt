Especially considering that I was able to enjoy romantic comedy movies one day. <br /> <br /> The Minni driver is very good as a preventive patient, who has a mysterious connection to the wife of Dvoovini's dead. (I can think of several horror movies using this story line - I think there was an LMAN film with Jane Simu.) But this movie is a defender <br /> <br /> Duvv is sympathetic and his dogs are beautiful and sad - dogs miss his dead wife. All her friends want her to find a replacement, and in a wonderful scenario where she is a blind date and driver waitress. Her date is terrible, and she find herself intrigued by the mini driver. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good movie because the story works, it is not too romantic, and the audience's intelligence is not insulted. Highly recommended 9/10.
