I first heard this picture from a friend. She liked it and always saw it. When he said this to me and said how old it is, I immediately decided that I do not like it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dance was such an amazing film! I love music and dance. I bought the soundtrack and DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were brighter in it. They captured so much good emotions and feelings of character They both had such good dancers. I saw that after watching the film, I can dance like them and hopefully I will take a Bollywood and Latin dance soon. I became a fan of that kind of dance and now I am hiding it in all movies and programs. Dancing in dirty dance and expressing my passion for music. The child goes to the headquarters of the staff and the film shows my dance and is clearly the last scene in which the baby and the mother dance together. I believe everyone will have to see dirty dance at least once in their lifetime. If not, then their loss is !!
