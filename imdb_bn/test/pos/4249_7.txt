Sure, this movie is full of Black Junk Protector and most of the time. In that sense, the movie has indeed been the date. But America's number one paragraphical industry, as a satirical look in advertising, it is still a target. But as important as the counter-message, ie, those who make the industry more socially, the big profit effect? Do not promote war toys, alcohols, etc. In this way, the film also about the greed of capitalism For example, for example, how Putin's dress suddenly changes strongly like the third party revolutionary Fidel, before moving away from the firmness. For a moment, it seems that the small revolution of Swap has succeeded in his staff, and he's been running, maybe this could spread the movement. But then, the former militants had been threatened with a huge rupee and probably shook his head to hijack an aircraft from Cuba. But Deni's final word is a satirical thing that Arab (I believe) burns the money tower (advertising, capitalism) apart from the ruins of smoking. It seems to me that changes can only be successful as a clean work of destruction and can be successful as a reform process? A message consistent with the fundamentalist attitude of the time. <br /> <br /> Whatever really interesting moments seated, especially as well as the commercials as well as they still play. Those who compare Marx Broos with the anarchic style, they make good points. The throwing lines fly thick and fast with violent set-ups. Forty years later, it still got a consistent handle on a solid film. Although, despite the illusion, the film is a bit of bold fundamentalism, with the moment of telling a little more truth.
