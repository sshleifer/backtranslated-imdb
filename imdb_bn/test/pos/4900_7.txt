The strong-minded musical family, the sloppy-loving father and the daughter of four lively adolescents, firstly, the appearance of Felix, the appearance of a gradually young musician, and secondly and most profoundly, Mickey is his amazingly attractive orchestrator friend. <br /> <br /> Michael Cartidge takes a while to get this piece of floating in America. The first part often seems like a simulated commercial imitation, except for a particular prominent, high bourgeois charm, and then John Garfield enters the scene as visible Mickey, Mushdock shows his first pictures with black carls, sleeping, blurred on the eyes, unholy And the savage, Jeffrey Lynn's easy-to-do, is the opposite of the crazy charmy Felix. Garfield is complete, and very little, the reflection of the rest of the family ("I'm surprised by what I'm doing", he faces), and suddenly the film has become interesting, although I agree with the critics that the plots are inadequate. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> It's really a permanent thing about it.
