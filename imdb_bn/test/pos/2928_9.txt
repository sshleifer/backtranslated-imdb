La Petite Torrett is a beautiful fun south park episode. Cartman is in the dock store in one day and here a boy swears loudly but he does not get any trouble. Her mother then tells everyone that the child has "terirt syndrome". Curtman loves to swear he can not get hurt, so he told everyone that he had terirt syndrome. Kyle, although Cartman tries to tell and tell people, but they think he is an annunciator and type him in "Tourat Sensitivity Training". Cartman's Terrett eventually gives him a spot on a talk show, but he has seen that he has to control his / her tours. Can not say and start talking about the shameful events happening with her. Meanwhile, Kyle is an interesting way Trying to.
