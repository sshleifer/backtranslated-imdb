Where do I start? I agreed to laugh a little and I flew! This movie is perfect, it is indefinite. Jacques Number Two was all honesty grosser, more obscene, funnier and more entertaining than the first. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that you will say "Oh My! No Way!" Or "ouch!". Completely mastered and set-up, each event and scene was parallel before and so it made it even more perfect. I like it every minute! I would just say that there was a scene where special footage needs to be censored to prevent NC-17 rating! It was so lonely that they had to keep it in any way! Amazing good <br /> <br /> 9/10 Incredible fun, do not miss!
