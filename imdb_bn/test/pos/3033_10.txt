Excellent story of a dedicated young teacher to teach minority children in an area from South Carolina. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In spite of being a headmaster, Mr. John Voight faces this challenge as a headmaster, dedicated, idealistic teacher. Believes in strict chains and in addition to modern educational strategies, a little respect for the Crusty Old School Superintendent, who is happy to see the delay of Human Crunch. Maj. Sinclair is the head who loves his children. <br /> <br /> As a retired teacher, I can relate to this wonderful film in some ways. The ignorance shown here and the lack of cooperation with officials is also quite evident in the urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voet understands that these children need much more than the traditional teachings of the classroom. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> was great for learning and disciplined. I guess my question answers The behavior was there and they were inspired to succeed in spite of their environment. <br /> <br /> Finally, you will be tugged in your heart. It was memorable and so well mad.
