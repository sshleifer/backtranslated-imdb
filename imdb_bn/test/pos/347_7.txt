I love his late and late career all about the direction of Al Adams, but "the nurse Sherry's possession" stands on the head and shoulders on the brain, but admits that "Blood Donor Horn" and "Dracula B. Frankenstein". This picture is really scary! What am I saying that when you see your "City Sherri" watch, you'll be out of your seat? Not certainly not. But this pastiche of "The Exorcist", "Ruby" and "Kerry" elements is one of the seventeen-century general, miniature horror films. Your finger is not so surprising that there is nothing surprising about it, but the film is dry with the atmosphere. (And what's the end! Do not worry, I will not loot it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed it with it and it does not matter if it's a "nurse Sherry" success. Happy accident Jill Jackbox is not as desirable as a desired but helpless nurse, who has recently been overwhelmed by the soul of the dead community (Bill Ray, who is brilliant in his short role). Geoffrey Land is OK as her surly doctor boyfriend. Here are some of the blockplastic elements (the cheapest drive of profit - the lowest line with the flickers, but after all), they actually contribute to the plot rather than the window cloth. "Nurse Sherry" was a poor fertilizer production, and it was seen at times (set, special effects, etc.). Still, there is the heart of the film, mostly moderately acting and direction, and some really cool. Sam Sherman was also eligible for the use of Harry Lubin's theme music for the television series "One Step Bond" at the end of the 50's / 60's by the end of the 60's, which would certainly join the obscure environment. There are two significant movies in the DVD (there are many features in the original version and there are many features that are harmful to the harmful elements on the cutting room floor) and theater trailer, TV spot and a great commentary by Sherman. Does anyone know what happened to Bill Ray? Beyond John Carradine, he acted as the best actor in the film of Al Adamson, and he acted like a novel leader.
