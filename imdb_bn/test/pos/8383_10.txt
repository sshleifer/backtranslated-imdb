When I saw the preview for "Inglorius Basterds" I would admit I gave myself big prospect. This film is not frustrating. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie with such high expectations, my expectations are met or exceed; This film is that and more. Even I rarely clap at the end of a movie, this is me and everyone else in the theater. <br /> <br /> I said I'm a bit favorable to Quinton, I grew up "Paul Fiction." I saw it at the age of 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film. <br /> <br /> Since then, Quantin did not live up to his billing. Instead of being familiar with its style, a little expected, the standard was not genuine (I did not see Jackie Brown, and then there is a greenhouse). Not until that "disobedient Basterds." What Continuations Needed for Continuation of War, Spaghetti Western feeling that can only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leon, but by seeing that Lyon dies, Tarantino is the self-appointed person of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So let's see a movie that I will not give up. There was a spot of writing, a beautiful transformation in using one but four different languages ​​in this movie. Notably, this movie was set in the classic Tarantino mold, a great view of rich meaningful conversations and a sudden threatening step. <br /> <br /> the role was extraordinary !! Christopher Waltz is critically deserving of Oscars. I do not say often, but for the film, one must definitely get one, he spoke every language of this movie and distributed such amazing touch and endurance. He stole shows in a movie that everyone was surprisingly impressive. <br /> <br /> I have no problem in making this film, because I have seen this movie all year and probably the next best film next year. . In most cases I think more about it, this movie can crack the best cracks of my top films, and the quintin movie from "Paul Fiction" Take this from me, check out this picture. I love this film, do not judge enough. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday and I'm still flying. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for making this movie. You're back to friends again. I can not say enough for Ingolierius Basterds! "
