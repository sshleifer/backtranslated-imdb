The title suggests that this film is a series of "An American Waywayfall" in London. There is no mention of a character or name from the previous movie's symbol. So as a signal, AAwiP fails to say one. <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a long time I saw good violin film One. And I've shared a lot, such as an American Werewolf, The Hawling, Olfen, The Wolman, and Underworld Trilogy in London. <br /> <br /> This story tells three Americans to go to Paris on vacation. One of them at the top of the Eiffel Tower is trying to commit suicide. Begins as a romantic relationship which gradually becomes a nightmare when the secret of the city's dark secret is exposed ... <br /> <br /> I really liked acting in this movie. Especially the movie's two stars: The woman tried to commit suicide and the man who saved her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans also play their role nicely. I really did not find anything boring about acting, so thumbs up for that! <br /> <br /> The effect of Wegolf is beautiful. It does not look too cheap or fake to me. Of course, opinions are divided into this topic. But let's just say I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> There are many good humor in this movie too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perfect for valve fans! 7 out of 10 stars!
