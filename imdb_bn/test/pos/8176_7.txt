The pre-unified China story will be a popular one. The hero King of Jet Li was popularly killed. <br /> <br /> This is another story made some years ago. King Unbelievably Beautiful Lee Gone (A Geisha, 2046, Remembrance of Miami Vice) starred as the king's lover, who was sent for the assassination of a murderer so that the king could defeat him. He appointed Fangyei Zhang, but fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I suspected that he too knew, but anyway <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful story with a huge military operation, and, of course, another chance to see Lee Gong.
