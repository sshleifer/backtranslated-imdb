I used to live with my parents when I did this on the Dutch TV. Usually I was not one to care for anyone else watching one with movies. But the way we all sat and saw this movie. This type of movie is broadcast on Wednesday evening. This is the story of a woman who will soon die. But before she dies, she wants to ensure that her (many) children have the best possible oster-parents. So we were seeing this and my father started crying (the most emotional of our four). I was almost immediately followed and very much teared my sister and mother much before. We were there, completely moved by this simple but impressive story. If you want a good tone, this is the one for you!
