Aundo, I love you! I could not come to a better conclusion than this movie and it ended. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them very well; They will hate it. But this time, I saw it alone and I saw it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long, I was locked up with the story and was finally surprised. At first I thought it was strange how he disappeared, but at some level, it created a perfect knowledge. <br /> <br /> But Aundoodon says that this film does not make sense of reality. Instead, it thinks strongly about what the word "normal" refers to and challenges the viewer. It gives you an insight into how to think personally about how to end it, I can say how it turned out and I can feel happy for sweetheart.
