I was happy to see this short film at the Miami Film Festival on Saturday and told me to be surprised. There was only one movie on the whole program which I liked. It is beautifully shot, composed, edited, played and written. After screening I saw a group's director and asked him what he was doing. He said he was working on finding funding for the characteristics of the short features. He described me some scenes. It sounded like the first film kind that started great in the industry. I highly recommend taking it when you get a chance to see this brief. Close the star close star.
