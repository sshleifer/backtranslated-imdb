I thought I had written a comment before this movie, but I can not find it here. Anyway, I'm writing again. I accidentally found this movie from my college library collection. It was free to watch, why not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I saw it. I like this movie. I saw some Russian movies before, most of them have serious issues. I was surprised that it was a good comedy. I had a great smile while watching it. And this is a movie that I would like to buy. This thing is so funny. And they are not just fools, they are very original, and good thoughts, so they do not seem completely foolish. I was surprised that this movie did not attract many visitors. This is a classic that you can see over it. <br /> <br /> Those actors were too pure, their acting was real, not faked. If you do not see it, go get a copy soon! Definitely recommend.
