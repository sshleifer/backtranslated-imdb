Regardless of the age of OAV, here the animation quality imo equally below. The plot itself understands, but not the letters. <br /> <br /> It may be a favorite word, but it seems that the city of Olympus has become almost populous by almost living machines, would you feel comfortable like people? Which machine will ever imitate human pride, short sight and greed so effectively? I suspect it. There are such pointer in the film, but only when 'biodridges' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters, they may be annoyed to press their team. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Little light is shed on the backstory at all, a great pity. The short length of the film, keeping an eye on the saga and crime, means that we can not see any letter depth. All down the foundation, yet we have left with no finished products. A cropping version of this OAV made a great TV show, once some character sub-plots were established. <br /> <br /> Highlights of these short films are maternal design and action / specification. <BR> <br /> Once the errors are found to be an opportunity to really digest problems, I really do not recommend it to ownership, but it is definitely a clock or two price! While this review is mostly negative, I really value your time to see it, but it's nothing to pick and buy. <br /> <br /> Overview: A watch opportunity.
