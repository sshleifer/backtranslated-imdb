I saw the Fantabulo! Because in the past few years, Michael Shane has become my favorite actor and has not seen him in the scene for the first time before being ashamed and secondly you have a copy of the love of Hertlands or Deny Philippine. This product was not frustrating - Michael Sheen transformed himself into a magician between Kenneth Williams and gave a sad run-down performance as a skill to walk with. Unlike other performances, but like Kenneth, Michael really stole the show. I do not know how he does it, but he does not seem to convert until every performance he plays in Michael, and I can not blame him as hard as I try. I would get tea, enjoy!
