When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Goss made a movie about their band, I was frustrated! I love their music and hope this movie will be really fun! Now that I have seen it I can not honestly say these expectations were not satisfied but I think I was more expected. The film is full of the great music of Tennesses D'I and I really love hearing about it all. There is a lot of great jokes and I like the story at least the first bit. I do not like the way the movie ends. The end is very sudden and in my opinion they could have added a bit more. <br /> <br /> Overall I think it's a good movie! Everyone who loves rock music should watch it! This will give you a good smile!
