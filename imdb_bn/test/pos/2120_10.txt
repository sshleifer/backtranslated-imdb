My kids, DD7 and DS 10 enjoy the movie, and they are quarreling in their seats. It was good, old shaping, retiree, family fun. This movie was made for kids ... someone really understood them. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see that Julia Roberts, Bris Willis, Guy Brooks and other stars see their common presence. <br /> <br> Anyone living in the city was modeled after the fantastic "Big Texas" model, I can say that they did a decent and accurate illustration. The kids looked like kids, not like superstar. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone will help to send this movie to Hollywood that we need more such movies. See it, then spread the word!
