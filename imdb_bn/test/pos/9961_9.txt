Venice Merchant is a fantastic movie. This is the very original Shakespeare game. If you saw Jeremy Irons in Casanova and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! If you've seen Joseph Fiennes of Love Shakespeare and you've enjoyed his performance, this is a movie for you! If you've seen Donny Brasco's Al Pacino and loved his performance, this is a movie for you! This is a very enjoyable movie and if you are studying Shakespeare like me, see it a great movie !! The only problem with this movie is that you can not see a little guy see it because it has nudity. But since the other, it's really a good movie !!
