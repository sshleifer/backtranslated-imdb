People will have to give this opportunity a chance. Those who wrote bad reviews (very few of them) are obviously those who did not see many episodes. One really needs to sit and pay attention to these shows. Characters are all realistic because they have many errors. They make mistakes, but they're really wrong, which is great thing to watch today's television. Also, acting for the most part is fantastic. Lorraine Graham has been known as Emmy for six years. Someone will give credence credit to this woman. Similarly, Emily Gilmour plays the role of Kelly Bishop. Also, it is nice to see a show that can have a young girl in the middle of it, and the teenager can not be hungry. Rory is a smart girl, which is not seen in television anymore. If only other shows can match this show ...
