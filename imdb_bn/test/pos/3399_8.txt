Great set, costume drama with costume and performance ?? Although some people are making channels to Rite, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Soze and James Reid are trying to maintain friendship despite having relationships with two men and families. Superb villain You want them all to come in a very bad end. Lots of these strong female characters ?? Both good and bad. Secondary story lines are also developed. Some of the big ones of the past era are Caes. Good representation of history and conflicts between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Curl up with your DVD or VHS player on rainy days and choose it. A fold hole and a cat should be optional.
