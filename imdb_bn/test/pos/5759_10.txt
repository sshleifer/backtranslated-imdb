iv was a fan of Rick Myl and Ady Edmodson, because I can remember the weather in his or her kids. And I just want to say that I have never been so disappointed in my life !!! Guest House Paradiso Bloody Bright! I do not know it's going to be a cup of tea (with flip, slopstick comedy, violence and dirty language) but do not even see it if it's not yours. It does not know anyone sick and twisted things Rick and Adie come up with when working with each other !! I think this movie has received such a slot from critics, because I do not think that I think this movie is 10 out of 10! :)
