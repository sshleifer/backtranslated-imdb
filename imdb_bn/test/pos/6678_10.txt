Just saw this and it was amazing. There was serious doubt about not hiring DVDs. So if you ... and stupid action-movies to watch other than ... and do not hesitate again. Do not let the dull cover stop you. The script is the best one ever. Intelligent, funny, real, touch and keep you on the edge of the whole movie. I have seen another movie like this before and really slept, and usually I get bored to see the second movie in one night, but it actually awakens me and does not have any annoying moments. It revisited many things in life and gave me a good feeling. <br /> <br /> It's also awesome (one of Kevin Spacy's best roles). The scenic and beautiful music used is very well selected. If I want to bring something negative to say something ... well .... I really can not find anything ...... Enjoy! 10 out of 10
