An interesting comedy in Stockholm from Stockholm to Berlin, in December 1945. The poor writer / critic who left his job and could not apologize for the train on his way to Berlin. His ambition was to create a difference, and after the war ended he took part in the creation of new unified Europe. <br /> <br /> I like the black and white layout of the movie, as well as the train at the speed of the close view. <br /> <br /> Robert Gastfuson created a classic "Gustafson-Root" in this movie. If you're a fan of him, then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Through his words "nobody can feel that it seems anything", the philosopher Witzenstein said, the film is mentioned.
