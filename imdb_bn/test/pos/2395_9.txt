Eddie Monroe Hoout She is a great actor and I can be her daughter at any time. She is beautiful I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to destroy the end but wow. Girls are so harmful. Her daughter was wrong. If Eddie was my man, I would never be disgraced. Those Mobsters were spectacular. The story is one of the moral trust trusts. Your friends will hurt if they can. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that my mines should be removed! I would recommend watching movies. Why? I said so in Bakasura. It kept my eyes on the screen. My sister also liked it, so I'm going to see it again because now my friends want to see it and want to double its value. Peace, Happy New Year!
