This movie is really sick, and fun. I have described them to cringe it to their friends. I have seen it about eight months ago, and the song 'Gana Gader a Rith River' is still in my head in the middle of my head by echoing through my song. <br /> <br /> So basically, it's a trimmed romio and Juliet, but it's beyond what you would expect. Let's just say turmoil, reference to child abuse, Gore (of course), but unfortunately, the happy ending ... sort of ... it's more weird than happiness. Capi Caputate bright! He has such an intellectual snobbish tone, he is abusive, but civilized. She quoted Shakespeare's quote from any other person in the film ... always playing her unfortunate role as husband and father. <br /> <br /> The meat man was very beautiful. She was drowned of Juliet, deeply infatuated with her, and due to Tromeo soon to be heartbroken. And Tromeo, a true romantic. He is a handsome, really sweet guy, frustrated to find true love. 'Brightly burn torch!' Unfortunately, Troma was just reversing that terrible mesh green and resorting to their other antics. They really carry with that element sometimes. But hey, this image made a great impression on me. How often do I mention this in real life situations ... that's kinda merciful. <br /> <br /> Enjoy, however!
