This movie was taken from the famous form of Journey to West, where a monk wanted to find long lost books with the teachings of Buddha, along with three of his students. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not based on legends like previous movies, it led to romance and funny filled funny scenes. <br /> <br /> This actual purpose of this movie is more resonating on monks that were initially preserved from being eaten by monster flying creatures. One of his students, Monkey God, was able to get him out of the battle free of charge, but he turned around and threw him to the depths of the underground and locked him in the special black hole. <Br /> <br /> The monk got up in a small village where he found Mei Ian (the daughter of so-called ugly serpent) who loved him at first sight. Although ugly, he will not let his face move apart from him. However, soon after the search for the rescue of three of his students was interrupted and each of them became worse with Mei Yan after the monk. The problems become deeper and the conflict between the relationship gets worse. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story will be kept to yourself, but not to say that this film does not represent the general story, who seeks to find meaningless, fun and light pictures of those who travel to the west and barriers to love This is even more for them. <br /> <br /> At the very end, the entire essence can only be described with a word, and that is love. The monks, the heavenly gates, the Celestial Palace and the Buddha themselves have shown how love can overcome the worst fears and is considered suitable for the most powerful enemies that can be used against the most powerful enemies. <br /> <br /> Waiting for those who purchase a fantastic and fun working this ticket. Of course, there is no remorse at my side and those who were with me in that movie watching the same movie.
