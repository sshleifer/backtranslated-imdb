This movie is the most fun Danish movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The plot is fun, surprising and exceptional. Danish humor unlike any other, and it gets you every time. The whole audience laugh at 90% of the time .... It was incredible. Characters have played so well, and two actors, Doc Mickelsen and Nikolaj Lai Qas have played their best! <br /> <br /> I want to decorate this movie very much, you will not be sorry, believe: -)
