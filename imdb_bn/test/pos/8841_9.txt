While watching this on TV, I first saw this movie and I was too late ... although I was really lucky there. It's really incredible; From location (this might be on the planet since it was separate; it is like "lazy" in the council swimming pool brick), with interesting characters (Keith David as a particularly responsive child - "If we are wrong about him?" - Then we're wrong . ") And impact (more lucky than the aliens). <br /> <br /> Yet, the film does not have any of the original tension and scary effects. It is that you start to scare people; Knowing that one of them may be - may not be - "They seem to be all". It definitely got the feeling of "who goes there"? <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is cool; It really plays in isolation, fear, and situation seriousness. Finally, the epilogue scene really, really cut. Even more than that "But then again?" Bladerunner's punchline. Enough said.
