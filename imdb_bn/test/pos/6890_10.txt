I can say I really miss this show !! My wife and I just got married while this show started !! Why CBS came in the air ??? I think the best part of the whole family is to enjoy !! It laughs me !! It made me cry But when CBS takes my wife to the air, I think CBS made a big mistake. Do you know what would be so great ?? Have a reunion show !! That would be so cool !!!! If anyone knows the DVD still ?? On the last season of the Promised Land, CBS showed the whole end season ?? I think CBS took it off the air in mid-season. My wife and I will not forget it. That theme was fantastic with opening up !!! This show comes only once in a life! We do not forget the promised land !!
