This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Gin Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and works modestly in his sword fight. (As long as it can be doubly done to him, it is difficult to know ... but Peters himself is working very well and doing it well.) ++++ could be a nice film with good and serious script. But it's basically delicious. But still entertaining. ++++ Regularly not with Jack Taurinea's film, but of course, on regular Zin Peters movies. The color of this '50's duration, usually. Not too lazy and realistic. Blackbird and his first partner and drunk doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a little weak. I do not think it was okay. Of course, Jean-Peters and Debra Paggate are probably the best two stars in the '50s.
