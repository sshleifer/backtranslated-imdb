This is the best 3-D experience Disney has on their themepay. It is certainly better than its original 1960s-acid-trip film, it is better than the "honey I am audience discipline" (and more interesting), the Disney-MGM is swimming very little by swimming in the 3D vision, and even the original 3- D "Movie Experience" can beat Captain Yo. This movie has released Disney's greatest musical hits from Alladin, The Little Mermaid and others and brings a smile to my face throughout the show. This is a completely child-friendly movie, opposite to "honey ..." and has had more impact than the spectacular "Mupp Pet Vision".
