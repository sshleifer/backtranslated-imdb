I think Babylon 5 is the best Sissy in Farsi and it's the best science-based television series (Dr Hu, Black 7, Red Darf, MSST3 and the previous B5). I found that the characters and races of FairScape are far more than many fun and fantastic "human-born-birth marks" that are found in many series. The effect is quite good and the story is engaging. Despite the season 2 and number 1 in several seasons, character development has happened very well.
