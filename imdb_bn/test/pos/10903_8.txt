In and out, in my opinion, a very funny movie. I think Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. I like most of Howard's bachelor party. Because they are cracking jokes about a few things, including Barbara Streisand. I thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very nice in her wedding dress and Howard looked good in her toxoid. My favorite quote and out is, "Is everyone homosexual? Is this a 'hesitation zone'?" That was absolutely ridiculous! Sonia (Shalom Harlow) I was not a character Because she was very proud and had a father-in-law. In conclusion, I did not recommend this image to Kevin Kine fans who did not see it. Ready to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it.
