I am very surprised at the reviews I've read about this movie - usually well-read, thoughtful and informed - certainly by people who are hard about thinking about movies. I am not able to add anything for the excellent review work done by the IMDB members already done. If I could, I would like to correct a small but broad misunderstanding that appeared in many reviews: Mr. Baseball was American and behaved in ugly fashion but he was not a ugly American. Originally American was Homer Atkinson, the novel of the novel of 1958 and one of the heroes of Lady and Mr. The exact opposite of baseball. Homer was an archetypal American, and an archetypal engineer - he went to Vietnam to work with people, he was honored and loved by people he met, he used to be competent in collaborating with his host, durable technology, and he was informed by them and informed because he was a democratic Values ​​and imitation of American attributes Her ugly was completely mouth, just skin deep; His personality and his humanity were deep and real. <br /> <br /> m Bezal gives examples of all cross, unconscious, unsafe unrest, which we suppress European and Americans often on other cultures; Homer's Atkins, The Upsite American, was on the other side of our currency, which represented our humanity and manners. I believe that ugly Americans still m More than baseball! They are still our last, best hope
