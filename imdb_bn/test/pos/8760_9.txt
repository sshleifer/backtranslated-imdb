If you do not meet this, then look for it. It is available in DVD. This is a production of Channel 4 (UK), perhaps, connected to German and Danish TV. If you have seen the film, it is basically the same plot. Several interleaved stories are connected through drug trade. The story is trying to complete an agreement on behalf of her husband, a housewife (played by a nice lendase broach), who was surprised by the international drug vendor (and usually dangerous people). <br /> <br /> The minister, who is in his job for the loss of his family, is investigating matters related to international drug trafficking. When her daughter came out of 'problem', she opened her eyes to the reality of heroin. Then he officially went to Pakistan, where he was taught that this abuse is not a problem (only drug or its casual use) and it can also produce some sample (a wonderful scene where he draws together and why it and why it is a problem) . In Pakistan we can see the other side. Frustration of farmers who can bend the production of opiate and crime lord. The system is becoming richer due to vain efforts in finance. And a country is so drenched in drugs, yet a relative fraction of our misuse of the West. Nearly a customs officer / Interpol agent tried to catch 'Dutch' connection to heroin smuggling. Dr. is seeking justice for his murderer. This is really a great composition. Super, performances performance from all major actors in a way that European movies can really do. <br /> <br /> must be seen. Especially if you have seen this movie, they appreciate each other and present some different opinions / attitude from both sides of the pond.
