This is my favorite film and I think it's perfect. I can not remove the name of any other film, I never see this movie and think that if they do this or her or whatever it will be better. What is the definition of this industry? I think so. Each brush stroke is perfect in the mix and it flows from all scraper scripts. I always like the work of Paul Screder (you can not contradict a wonderful movie with taxi driver and light sleeper), but his writing often appears on the bombshell border, but his guide is usually unincorporated. It's deliberate, I think, because its movies usually deal with the quest for freedom and are set in the real world; Ugly and harsh His style makes his themes suitable because he offers his characters in a simple and realistic way and show their visitors the truth about the situation. Imagine that Scrador instructed the taxi driver or pulled out the corpse, instead of the Scotchies. But like the characters of those two films, when Mishima was a standard shader element, right-wing, vain and contrasts with society, his works were fine and beautiful. Indeed he was the second writing career as a female writer, which could reasonably be described as romantic potboilers. So you certainly do not think that Skeeter was an ideal person to capture the beauty and beauty of the film. I think he is watching the film. Fashionable helper script splits the mixture into three parts; His life, his death and his mind His life is represented in black and white, still camera, formal composition. For his death, for which he will always keep in mind the best, manual documentary style. And his mind is presented by the dramatic collection of his novels, everyone expresses these complex human thoughts, who never wrote a letter that was not a reflection of themselves. Thanks to the eco-eesiac's amazing production design and the amazing staging of the shaders, these plays are beautiful. In all cases, acting is fantastic, especially as a mixer from Ogata, who captures the essential charm, arrogance and atrocities of humans. The photography covers the nice and the pictures that the viewer will hold forever. Finally, the music is just great, perfectly image matched, although written and recorded before the shooting, the editorial process was adjusted and re-recorded. I do not know how much music has affected the shoot, but it is completely bonded with the image. I have seen a lot of ideas about what the movie theme thinks, which wants to talk about Shader. You know, big things about life, death, etc. But I do not think the film is saying something. Mishima has already said that the movie repeats only.
