When you see a movie that had a deep impact on you for the first time, there is a great danger, after 20 years it will not be the same magic as before. I have to admit that I was not as good as I think well but delightedly recommended. Pangang Young Copperbang is still 12 years old when I think this film as pretty. There are many movies that this film has a certain type of brightness. It's sturdy, it's brilliantly played and does all that well it makes me feel like a kid again and can do that a lot. John Albansby and Abigail Cruittenden's rolls in this film are the 1st grade and I have forgotten how good they are till now. I ask any parent of their children to sit and see them and see if they will have the same effect on me. Young Hood of the Young Figs! 10 out of 10
