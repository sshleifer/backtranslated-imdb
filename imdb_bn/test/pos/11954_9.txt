80's comedy (especially those with John Cusack) is amazing. Almost everyone is mountainous and instant classic and no exception to this film. You will laugh for hours by making a lot of money in other movies (such as Godzilla and Gossa) that are so mountainous. Some might complain that the film was occasionally a little orange, but it was 80 and things were always a little cheesy. A young Demi Moore and even a big Bob throw in a cat and there is a ridiculous on your fans. If you do not see it, you are good !!!!!!
