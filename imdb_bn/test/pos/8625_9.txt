It's about 12 minutes in the song, where Daryl Hana and JFK Jr. embrace the first, there's a really nice song playing ... what's that song ?! Who is singing? This is a song that seems very romantic and it is a female singer, playing piano etc. I have tried to see all the things in the world like Google and iTunes etc., but it does not come, nor even the songs website. So, if you hear it, I definitely want to know enough about it so that I can get the CD with the song or try to find it in iTunes. I do not know what my email will be stronger, I'm new to it ... but I'll be back here.
