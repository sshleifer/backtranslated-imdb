Perhaps the best movie made by Kevin Tenny (probably, his Witchboard is not at the top of my horror list), it's a weird, interesting mix between Pin and Child Play, it's better than both, but not so good. Sure, this plot is probably narrow and probably very predictable, but the actor is very good, Rosaline is very happy (and thus Candance McKenzie - God bless him for the shower scene!), Very well disturbed girl and pinocchio dolls for explaining the spine to you! Scary enough to give down a few thrills. Not all bad for a B movie.
