Anyone who usually hates Ali Ji, Ali Ji Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching it, I had a hysterical fit. Yes it is sexist, weird and extremely overestimated, and I like it. Some comedy has only one or two comedies, this movie was laugh-a-thon. I have never seen any comedy as Ali Ji Indahouse. A comedy for Ali Zee playing it will be eligible for 8 out of 10. Absolutely bright
