It reaches everyone's mind and feelings deeply driven in the Black Desert. In a brutal but beautiful world that is searched through words and word memories and edgy layers. Landscape develops its own personality, expressing their stories as parallel to the inner geography of all three letters. Lack of lost love, fear of unknown, and then the emptiness through the very exposure of this solitude. Three confused souls that fight all negative points find absolute and positive things. Drama compulsory James Franco and his co-star give fake performances. Silly schoolboy, suicidal blonde, embittered car thief - combines with all the unexpected twists. Together they create an explosive portrait of fracture love - one that unknowingly creates emotional blindness in man-made to correct between the hardest forms of danger and delusion.
