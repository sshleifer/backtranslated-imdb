I was quite good at this movie. It was night on three nights at TCM (Turner Classic Movie), and his offbeat humor kept me at five rupees. Kelly acted nicely in this role, especially with grandmother (whose queue almost laughs me from my seat). The main actress was right, but the father was able to keep her character separated from the marriage controversy and humor came. If you like the good offshoot, old movie, I'll recommend it. Unlike other comments, I like Gene Kelly. He was the leading leading actor for the first musical instrument and I think this role, he has done his charisma. One drawback is that the dance scenes are a bit longer, but if you can go through them, then you are clear.
