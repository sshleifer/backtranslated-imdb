Well-made, well-behaved teen Meg Tilly will spend a toxic tombs night as an initial to a high school club. The problem was buried under the name of a powerful psychoanalytic name named Rammer, but he did not die, and he needed a living for his powers. <br /> <br /> Fuzzy horror movies are very exciting and cool, an interesting and favorite cast, and the highest special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / >
