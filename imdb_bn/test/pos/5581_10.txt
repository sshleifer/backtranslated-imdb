Somehow, I missed a lot of the first episode of Farsafafe, so I repeat on different channels as I see them in all kinds of orders. I first caught it - completely by accident - when lounging a hotel room. In the first 10 seconds, I was completely finger - it's all about SF. <br /> <br /> letters are strong; And the living Moya pilot was what Lexus should do. The plots changed into quality, but none of the nice ones dropped down. And I have to mention the Rigel - what a glorious illogical character! Here there is no one of your commemorative carbohydrate Star Trek Alien, this is the real deal - full of iron, self-service and hateful personal habits, Raigel is a genius. Last week the SciFi channel showed "out of their mind" (body swapping episode). The real classic, I could not laugh at the start ... <br /> <br /> Long Farspac can satisfy our screen!
