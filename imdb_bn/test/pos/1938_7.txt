"Reverse Edge" was one of the most annoying films of 1986 and "blue velvet" for a year, you know what you are saying. His power is lost today and much better than exaggerated "kids". In the preview of "kids", it played the role of young people in the country to express their frustration. In fact, it was slightly more than a absorption film based on almost shock values. "Reverse Edge" was promoted as a teenager, but the reality was even better. It is the only time to have the dead nude body constant image from the unexpected annoying. Outside of it, the film is worried and all its minor flaws are quite realistic. <br /> <br /> Kaneu Reeves, especially known as a wooden actor, gave her best performance as a burn teenager. . Ione Skye is equally sympathetic and customizable. Dennis Hooper (on returning to this "Blue Velvet", and "Hoisiers") gives a great performance as the remnant of a vague but kind Hippie generation. Crispin Glover, while always entertaining for viewing, seems to be a bit out of place as a manic stoner and team leader. The best performance is obviously Daniel Roebuck. As a murderer, Rabak is horribly passionate. Her shame is that she is not a big star as a better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> This picture is pretty fantastic and bold. Do not make this mistake for other lamps, John Hughes Clived High School Flick like "The Breakfast Breakfast". It's a shocking piece of nihilism that prefers with viewers. The film's supporters since 1981 suggested that the Canadian film "Out of the Blue" was directed by Danny Hooper. In spite of another frustrating examination of the gap in the generation and its ambiguity, the "river bank" has had an impact. (7/10)
