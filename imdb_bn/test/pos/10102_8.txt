I watched a lot of movies, but now my genre is an Asian horror. I bought this DVD and at first I found an interesting but confusing movie "Zhangwa, Honggren", because I did not understand many parts of the story. But I saw on the IMDB board that "The interpretation of a masterpiece (all your questions are answered fast)" is written by the title opener, and I was really impressed with the high quality of this user's opinion that the Miss Point story I want to congratulate Opener for his wonderful work and to help with the help of other visitors, I am going to write an accurate summary of this movie on IMDB. Finally, I agree that "Jhangawa, Hongguyen" is a great Korean movie, but I can not give ten to my vote because very few people can see the same movie more than once, like this movie's claim and the propagator Besides the great support I did not understand the whole story. I want to watch this movie again in the near future. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
