I would say this film is annoying. Cruelty is portrayed in a very sick way, it's like a psychology within 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel self-esteem among human behavior. The scenes are ending with violent, homeless slaughterhouses and the kitchen's cruel sex scene. Every emotion is absorbed for the extreme, the frustration of the Butcher, the love for her daughter is almost inconvenient, when the anger finds that she has been abused, every feeling is so normal and false. This film is truly honest and cruel about human nature. The film's message is that one person's life can change in one second due to the behavior of one and the most primitive emotions are most powerful and can determine its performance. I liked the unique method of filming, with silence and simplicity with atrocity which only break internal thoughts.
