This movie, Bla Masters, can be inexpensive and weird and sometimes it is, but this movie is thinking of problems outside the set ages. Ather is the person who is to protect against terrible earth, weapons, that nuclear weapons are compared to an unforgettable and unpredictable way. He goes through the barriers as an intelligent character, which is more of muscle strength, although he has a lot. I would say that this view of the film will transcend a movie such as Conan the Barbarian, which at least I can say, quite a bit brainy. It does not diminish the great adventure film by any means, but it gives its impression of ather that he will not disobey. For a low budget movie, this movie is better than the settings and the battles are often trusted. Jol, Wilne, is one of the most interesting psychological conflicts with the prisoners throughout the film, which highlights the film's tension, even if it seems that it is very suitable for the job. <br /> <br /> This movie is a little too extra scenes that may seem interesting but noteworthy. Although the serpent fought with God, he is managed as a giant doll, well-versed, as a snake with silhouette, and the war is quite strong. The movie measures the most unusual ways, quite stupefying, but exciting: Deltaplane order. The scene is not presented correctly, none of which reads, where its device is available, it is quite uncomfortable, but it refers to a true poetic and beautiful medieval sequence, it is exclusive, the end point of the movie, it is a place where some people Has become a fantasy hero. <br /> <br /> If the blade master is not among the most amazing films of all time, then it is not surprising because of its lack, it is a big surprise, considering the fact that it is a philosophical and good choice of conflict, it is true. Talks and hearts show that this movie is so unwelcomed. I recommend this for every fan of this genre and try to take it seriously as an intelligent film that is taken more seriously than it seems to be.
