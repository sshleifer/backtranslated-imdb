I like this picture, which I saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005, I went to India with two friends, and this movie was very real. I related everything, and savored every moment. Characters are trustworthy, stories are ruthless and last realistic, but are not sentimental. I enjoyed discussions with the director after the display. This film looks very well in the mix, but does not complete the mix of 2 worlds (East and West). Supporting Cast was surprising, which has brought life to a real traveler in India. Humor is subtle, and sometimes dry, and makes it absolutely more realistic, because it becomes the daily circulation of characters. It is so easy to detect with each situation illustrated.
