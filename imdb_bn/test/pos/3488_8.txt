A formula for murder is not a well known gaolos, but it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto de Martino, a classical man like The Enchantist and Blazing Magnum. The film was released late in Gaylora Chakra, but in the early seventeenth century, 'Sonali' was more than most of the films released around the time. In spite of the lack of logic in some cases, the film works effectively due to efficiency, it mixes some truly wonderful plot twists and an explicitly defined characters in the scene of Angelo Style's death. This movie is probably not as exciting as one of the other genres of the genre; But this assured way is feeding the visitors to the central situation, and the resulting tension is sure to be more than compensated. Before pushing the plot step by step, a young girl named Jawana was raped and started showing a fake priest. Then we fast forward a few years and the girl is now a female, unfortunately a wheelchair. He is being trained for a sports event by Craig; A man who has romantic designs on her. However, his proposal does not meet with Joanna's personal assistant who has romanticly designed him. <br /> <br /> The movie shows a half way through wrapping a plot through which the background of the movie is created and when it is not just logical; It's good to see and indicate that you are on an interesting movie. Director Alberto de Martino is not clearly scared to show some harmful grooves and the best of this film is responsible for the death of a priest by hijacking - and I personally do not hesitate to get this sequence known in my name. The plot may be a little bit at times, but usually the action is very good. What the director feels like in the conclusion of the movie; But it is perfectly packed with tension, and the way it is run is good, in which it takes advantage of all the plot points that went before. The musical score from Phulasi's The New York Ripper also works well in this movie and breaks the tradition of Gialoro, De Martino's film only features actresses David Warbeck and Kristina Nagi, her only feature film role. After all, this film can not be one of the simplest Galileo; But its good value is down for tracking and this kind of film is recommended for fans.
