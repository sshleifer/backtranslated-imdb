I love this movie .... all the time my favorite one !!! It was my first mom movie when I saw me at the age of 9. I recommend it to every African-American. This story is about a black family love, faith, challenge, and everyday life. All actors work well together I wish it was video, but so far, I have not found that available. I grabbed it on television a few years ago, and recorded it, so whenever I'm interested to see it ... I have it! Soundtrack is very awesome! A must see!
