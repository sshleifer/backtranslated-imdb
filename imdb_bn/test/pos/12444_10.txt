I can not remember where I first heard them, but I heard a song and liked it. Went and bought the CD and finally found the kind of music I liked. I heard about this video and knew I had it. There are a lot of clips from playing on their concerts. I tell you, this video does not compare with the concert watching them. I have seen them twice at the concert and do not want to miss the opportunity to meet them again. The other two things about it are some interviews and even a video of their biggest song. Couple little side note ... I saw them at ozfest 2001 and they ruled there, but they were very good to see them at a small inner stage (they were some really cool things with being able to spend the light), if someone wonders, voter means a devout followers.
