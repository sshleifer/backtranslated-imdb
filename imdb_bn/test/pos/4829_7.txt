'Wicked Little Things' really distinguishes themselves from other Zumbi films. First of all, all the zombies in the movie are not giving you a fix and your body is separated by their bare hands. They kill you with a pixel or foveal. And after ward eat you. Secondly, they will not die. Most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but this can not die simply. Third, why this movie separates itself is the biggest reason, all zombies are children. How do they just die zombies? They were working in a coal mine when suddenly they all collapsed. Now they carry the forests with their picaxes and swifts, so that they can come to someone so that they can kill them and eat them. Oh, they come out tonight. Just, at night. It makes the movie more fun, but they will come out in the morning. Despite all the violent and glorious harm of the film, 'Wicked Little Things' is a great choice. 'Looking for a movie about children in the jammy.' Do not expect great things like 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'Land of the Dead', but expect this film to have a lot of seriousness and violence to formalize a real zombie fan. Everyone has given a great hand to Rob's Job to play Scout-Compton in 'Halloween'. She will have to start acting in more horror movies.
