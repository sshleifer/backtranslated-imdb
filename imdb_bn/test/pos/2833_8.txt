... 54 years ago, in my hometown, when I first came to France, I saw this movie, I was nine years old, and today I still remember black and white frames, especially black frames, because it is so fictitious, scary Was, who was attacking the mountain pass by the dark pass, the two soldiers, the prisoners were forced to fight each other by their prisoners, GÃ¶ttingen Sa The wagon was returning to war to fight for an end to the release, the last battle between Peck and principal, and Happy End, which allows me to take my breath away. I have not seen it since then, and I do not know whether it would be good idea to see it again today, it was such a wonderful moment for me.
