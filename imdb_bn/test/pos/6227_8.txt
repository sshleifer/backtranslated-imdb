I must admit to thanking this movie now I scared mannequins. Hahah <br /> <br /> But yes, this film's first performance is quite beautiful by my criteria. Most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles. The script seems to be very good, definitely there are some pinch stuff but some modest written characters and some horrifying scary scenes. I still get shivers thinking about one scene with dude and mannequins. <br /> <br /> Yes, I would say that you have to see this movie, it's great, and very entertaining. A good watch 8/10
