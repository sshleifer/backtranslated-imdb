Before I consider this movie you want to say a few things. At one stage or another, if you think you've seen good cameras, you will be surprised to see this movie. For the record, this film was made in Russia in 1957, but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen in the West after almost 20 years. Many of the levels of emotions change through the film: happiness-love-war-frustration-joy, but ultimately you have to stay somewhat unique: enjoying a great composition of film making. From our time, young directors will have to read more such movies and they will probably be able to create something similar .. Though I think movies like this are difficult to come ... If you have seen "I'm Cuba", then this movie gives you many appeals But if not, then be prepared for a unique experience. Russian directors have something common: the joy of making small budgets, great actors and art ... and yes, they are able to create more skills than all the Western world together. I'm not the big fan of Russia, in fact I hate everything from the Communist, but in the part of the world the film is made to create a strong feeling to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. <br /> <br />
