I am personally a soft spot for the horror films set up in hospitals and shelters, so my reputation is doubtful, but I do not like to "hide it in the basement". Well, it turned out I was right! This is great trashy entertainment with a couple of fantastic shock and delightful absurd characters. Of course, you must definitely look at the poor production quality and completely unrealistic plot, but if you manage it (and if you're a fan of such a dawn then it is a necessary quality), you will be rewarded with a harmful "video-nasty" blood And form the insane core components. The young and intelligent Nurse Charlotte reached a remote sanatorium where he was supposed to start his new job. He wanted to know that a doctor was killed by a doctor who hired him and the replacement of the doctor-in-charge master was reluctant to accept the new arrival. Life inside the sanitarium is rather weird, patients are running around free and each door is kept unlocked. After the whole series of intriguing events, Charlotte discovered the secret secret of this organization ... the first 10 minutes (pre-credit) is great and so completely annoying climax. Everything is pretty fantastic or without tension mostly but you wait patiently because you just have fun to feel wild. The refugees looted textbooks, but I still love it. Some of my loved ones are former judges (who are still talking on legal terms), suspected army-sergeants and crazy old women. "Do not show in the basement" is recommended for very little brain fun, especially for 70's trash-cinema, sick puppy and other types of scam fans. Lunatics have taken shelter, yes !!
