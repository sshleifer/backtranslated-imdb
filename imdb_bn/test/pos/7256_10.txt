Plunatte and McLean fall in my favorite movie (The courage of the historical step with comedy), maybe it's why I lose so much. <br /> <br /> A highman (plunket) and a stratum 'gentleman' who gets entangled with him and his schematic (Macleane). All this leads to all kinds of escapades and adventures which tinged with comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rich at this time. <br /> <br /> This is an enjoyable movie that is fairly simple but a suitable plot that gives plenty of entertainment.
