While studying Susan Harrison (The Belerina) in reference to a Bonaparte episode, I was reminded of this gem. <br /> <br /> This episode is inspired by Dylan's "All Alone the Watch Tower". (Hendrix's cover is probably best known and his best one) which is his seratum. <br /> <br /> This episode is responsible for several 'best' - about 22 minutes is not bad for television. <br /> <br /> But it's "Twilight Zone" More comments in the series are unnecessary. <br /> <br /> '5 characters' are usually serling. The intense, dramatic, inevitable towards the end, is turning to an edge that is spectacular for the first time. <br /> <br /> This episode is lost in one sentence and it is very good to loot those who have it. Do not see it. <br /> <br /> But you feel terrified. And you will not hear Hendrix again with the same ear.
