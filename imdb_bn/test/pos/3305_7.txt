This is a mad woman drama that people can enjoy. This plot follows a young girl (Hope Lange) who goes to work for the publisher after the college. We are the editor's editor (hey, this is Hollywood) and can forgive his jump from some errors. Here is one of the few films that appeared on the big movie producer Robert Yance (here, beautifully showing the rats with women). It features a mature Joan Crawford and awesome support cast. See it
