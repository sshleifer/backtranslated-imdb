Perhaps I'm one of the only Avid Awesome fans, who think that the recent tide of recent tides is so much publicized! Movies like "RINGU" or "The Eye"? Which are acclaimed around the world ?? Simply did not satisfy me and they looked more annoying than afraid. Well, this stupid opinion does not go for the South Korean jewel "a sister of two sisters". This is a stylish and completely complex psychological terror-story that actually gets under your skin! Depending on a local local story, this movie may be a bit confusing to be listed among the greatest achievements of all time, but the atmosphere and the tension building must surely be of great reverence. Among the few movies it is impossible to label is: "two sisters" events qualify as horrific and intense family dramas and deep psychological portraits. In addition to a messaging story, in addition to "The Story of the Two Girls", I think there are great elements that are usually absurd in Asian movies such as amazing music, good acting and innovative cameras. The palace is family events that are truly a strange place where secrets and dangers hide behind everyone. Many sequences (dinner with relatives or night's appearance in girls' homes) are mostly the ultimate animations. They really feel uncomfortable to me and I believe that I saw the share of my horrors. "A Tale of Two Bones" is a must-see for a horror movie-adventure and Asian film fantasy. For a short time people have a little caution, though: this movie always forces you to keep your eyes and ears. This is a movie that needs to be seen again, although it will never really get it "100%" for it.
