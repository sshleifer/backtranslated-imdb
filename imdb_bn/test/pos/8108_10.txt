Before the United States entered World War II in 1940, I was surprised and amazed to release this film. Sponsored, satirizing something serious and terrifying as Nazi Germany could have misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brightness is not limited to making jokes from everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message was often not valid if the film was matched with dramas for a great humor. The play was not alone in drama and resonance. What is the film Smiling on somebody (Adinod Hindel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (Jew repeatedly) may be the best way to love them. In the Jewish specimen final lecture, I forgot for a moment that the war took place almost half a century ago. They have words now, and there is no time to fight. For this reason, I believe that this film was far better than damages, because it still had a deep impact on it.
