I grabbed it late with the late Mexican cable, and I have to disturb it. The title was translated as "secrets" (secret). Well there's a mystery that is an important part of the movie but it's coming! We are not fools. We know there is a novel behind it. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is quite interesting and it is managed by its strong Ramavatik performance. Always beautiful and stunning Jordan Bruster and Christopher Eccleston provide great performance and have such great chemistry among them. Cameron Diaz is also good, though he has at least a screen time. Blythe Dana is perfect and touching her last appearance in the movie, sad. Great Performance. <br /> <br /> Jordanian character and his sister's ex-boyfriend traveled to Europe to deal with his ghosts and understand why his sister died. Through Flashbacks, we learn sad truths and we can not help but feel sorry for the whole family. The end is really moving. <br /> <br /> So there is nudity, but it is the lowest. Actually, sex scenes do not want to be artistic and steamy or sexy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I'm looking for this charming and beautiful on the screen of Zoranda Brewster. And I ended up picking up the story and dramatic presentation. <br /> <br /> If you like difficult dramatic features then try this movie. Awesome movies. The last, last scene was very sad .. two small sisters through flashback.
