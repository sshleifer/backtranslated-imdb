Frankie Darrow excelled a nice child actor who plays pugnacious little toughs with giant chips on their shoulders. He first appeared in the top 30s of the "The Public Enemy" (1931), a groundbreaking crime drama and "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a radical depression era film that runs the railroad. He was originally a small version of James Cagney. Despite the height, the desire to do his own stunts was used by most programmers when there was no use for him in the greater studio. <br /> <br /> A rebuilding of "crime school" was "Mayor of Hell" but it was a lot of humor, and Dead and Kid's and Humphrey Bogart were shown as a very muscular deputy committe. "Helm's Mayor" is really the combination of "Hell's House" / "Crime School" / "City of Ages" Although Cagney did not see his appearance in the 25th minute, his influence was immediate (as usual). He is a hot leader led by gangster who is a political party's salary party run by the crowds. <br /> <br /> The car running racket with Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darrow) and his gang (including "Our Gang" to "Farina") but they can loot a common store and chew the owner through a plate glass window. Bite off. They appear before the juvenile court and are forced to serve as state reformers. It is illustrated in bright colors - a model school where boys are given the opportunity to learn a trade. In fact, it is a hell location directed by a wicked warden, Mr. Thompson (unusually played by Doodle Digges). Only compassionate person Dorothy Griffith, live-in nurses (played by Lord Evans). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " . Upon attending the school, she witnessed a failed escape attempt and after talking to Dorothy, the school realized the need for corrective reform. He is now running the school and instead of the "Boys Town" line, a system of "self-government" has been brought. Although Cagan did not have much to do, the film carries with the determination of its determination with DARRO energy. "Passi" is temporarily out of the picture (he accidentally shoots a circle and leaves the state), Thompson returns, and due to his cruel behavior, due to the death of the boy ("skinny"), a raged crowd of the rest of the boys They burn down a barn and Thompson falls to his death - "Paties" is coming back again to calm the man for some time. <br /> <br /> Sure, all the boys said very hard. Their crime, but I do not agree with the critics - Thompson was more than just a "middle". The boy died due to his tragic behavior. There is a scene at the beginning where the boys serve some continuous slopes - Thompson orders the ham and the eggs and puts butter on his bread while talking to Dorithy. <br /> <br /> Alan Jenkins played "Uncle" Mike and Rock Terry, although he has been a "blonde" builder, he remembers, "I think it's going to be a young boy, where are they?" !! <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
