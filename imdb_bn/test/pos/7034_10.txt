I'm waiting to see this photo for ages and I have finally! As soon as I heard the title, I knew that this film would be my favorite film and when I saw it I would believe that I was not disappointed! <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is dance, love and Patrick Soze! There were a lot of things and it had to deal with important issues (which were in the 1960's), such as abortion. <br /> <br /> Nice acting like this act was excellent! Sway was like a great! <br /> <br /> Although this image was absolutely fantastic, you can not say that if you did not see the last scene, then you saw it. It can really breathe because of the finished dance industry's brilliant performance, if you dance at the end of the film and it will not surprise me if it does not dance to me! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The actors will always have this fantastic film in their career!
