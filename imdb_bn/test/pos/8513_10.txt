I'm going to leave a lot of comments here and say that this movie is one of the five best bonds, On the Mejesse Secret Service, Russia with Love, License to Kill, and only for your eyes, Roger Moore actually played the role of bond instead of close friendship). Of course, San Connery has pulled the whole thing together - co-writer, co-producer, and love with Russia as his best performance. He is competent, energetic, and definitely enjoy himself. Her acting is mature, confident, and laced with the right amount of humor. Unlike his mechanical performance at Thunderball, his sleeping watch only made you live twice, and his jolly, Panchini Roop that is known forever by a cartoon named Hero! <br /> <br /> It is a legendary reusable of Thunderbolt, character and plot overwhelming set and without machine. This shield is much better, as well. Claus Maria Brande brings her unique style to the role of Lorgo, depending on an iPad, speaker ring or annoying uniform uniform. Kim Basinghe's athletic and lovely, Barbara Carrier is dynamic, and for once, our Barney KC is a great Felix Litter. The images of M and C are original, and the left-wing agent's small-fuse jacket is fun without falling into the snapstick. <br /> <br /> Director Irvin Karsner uses her position well (Bahamas and French Revisas) without losing her actor's eyesight. Although intense inspection reveals some series of special effects and lapses in continuation, the film continues very well in contrast to Kersner's Thunderball (which its director, Terrence Young, does not even like). Visitors will obviously miss gun barrels trademarks and 007 theme music, but they are still owned by ION Productions. <br /> <br /> Michael Legend probably could not write the most memorable score, but it is too intrusive by capturing the atmosphere of the position. Not surprisingly, his best moments in France are especially interesting in his French love song (Health Spa). And tell me, how much do you remember the song for the monkey? I personally forgot man with golden song and a view to a kill! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> He did not curious with a tiger of Bengalis, nor did he fight with the "Indian" snake charmers with tennis rockets. Despite Eon's great efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and Late Jack Schwarzmann have created a fine film together, which I think Ian Flaming praised. <br /> <br /> If you want to see James Bond kick in shins by a dwarf, involved in another tiring struggle with "Jads", jump into bed with Grace Jones, or lead a chase firing a slapstick through San Francisco, this is your Not for the film!
