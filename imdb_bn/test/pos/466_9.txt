This is really a movie that you will see twice. When I first saw this photo I was really drawn into the story. Although most of the stories are inside the hotel room, Badi (Nick Drake, Wonderful hug) and Duffen's divisions take you out of their homes and out of their world. Through their conversations you get a feeling for the loneliness and pain of each loneliness. The soundtrack perfectly accompanies the movie, dark, lo-fi and playful. When you see the film for the second time, you can highlight the best ending of the first time in which you missed the first good news. I hope this movie will find a distributor for the DVD so that it becomes more accessible. Great movie, you will not be disappointed.
