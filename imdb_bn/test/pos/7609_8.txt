I saw this movie for the first time, when it was still new and I was satisfied. This is a big Hollywood make-believe story for teenagers. However, it is not lifelike. As much as you want it to believe, these stories do not happen. That's why it's annoying to watch the movie. They can play with the minds of teenagers, imagine how many girls in high schools still believe in this magic and are frustrated. I will not recommend this movie to my younger sister or my cousin. Instead of thinking about the actor, the director has to spend more time with the plot. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the price of the concept is not 10. There are many movies about teens. So why do not we make good?
