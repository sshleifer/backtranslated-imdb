National Velvet (1944) image that Taylor placed on the map. Then boxer champion Mikey Rooney coastering. Taylor plays a girl of love with her horse and when Jockey Miki Rooney is unable to travel to the Grand National Race, the lusty lease spends her hair, seeing a boy and running the horse ... well I will not loot for you. It was a quality melodramm that was famous for extracting MGM. And another basic color photo to boot it!
