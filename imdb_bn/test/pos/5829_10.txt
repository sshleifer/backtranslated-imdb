It shows if the best TV is not the best show. Why? Easy: It does not have us guts to show real life in prison, without any shocking and expected twists. It's not a prison break or any other show, actually, like the story of the Sopranos children for weight shows. Insults, curses, clear violence shots and the use of drugs, rape of male sexual organs and rape ... all these oges more. But it is not the best part of the weight; Characters are powerful points of this show; Although we are looking at the foolish criminals, we are all very nice and not boring. The actors are excellent, my favorite actor Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher are playing because they change their behavior so unique and completely. And most ... there is no regrets for their actions. Overall ... oz amazing show, the best one out there. Forget about the CSI and show you about the fools ... this agreement ... OZ!
