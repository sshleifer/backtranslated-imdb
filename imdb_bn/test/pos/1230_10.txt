This is a hunting short film. James Franco and Rachel Mirror both hit, which provides the real ring and performance to stay with you. As it is called a sad story so it does not have much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the result, even though it was right for the story, because I have already come to take care of these people. I can only think of a few small films that affect me. Beautifully shot, played, edited. High efficiency stories work around, even in the early days, using the right words and / or music. The last credit song ends in work, wringing even more passion from me. This is the first rate from the beginning to the beginning. The author / director and all involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of a photo in the comments section. I promised to do so in exchange for a copy of the DVD. Reviews can be good or bad, just my honest opinion. This is it and at least I can do it. I'm glad to see it.
