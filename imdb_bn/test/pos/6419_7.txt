Footprints categorizing a very interesting movie is somewhat difficult. The "Psychological Thriller" I can think is the most appropriate description. The female playwright Alice Cespi has discovered that she does not think of anything in the last three days. She's only a needle to paint a shadow of a hotel. He is a repetition, very vivid, dream about a science fiction movie that he believes that he scared many years ago. He does not trust anyone in search of truth behind his memories, but it seems a little rare that he went to the city where the hotel was located before. It's an exciting twinkle whose main quality is how impossible it is to foretell events, and especially how it ends. The abnormal loneliness of the main character and the reciprocity of all others ensure that the old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, the beautiful color and some spectacular painted sequences make it a visually appealing film. The only one and only Niklett is important part of Elmie, the Italian horror everyone's favorite red-red children star, it is an extra bonus.
