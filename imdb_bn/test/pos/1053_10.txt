How Stenwieck and Morgan are perfectly, in many ways, equivalent to the modernity of Christmas Carol of Dickens. The film's success depends on the character of Alexander Yardi of Sydney Greenstone. The modern equivalent of the Yardi Dickens Scrooge, as he strengthens control over his staff - until the Christmas spirit is over. The role of 'Park in Work in the Park' for GreenStreet was one of the best stageststuffs on stage while becoming a partner in Lantas Company. Greenstreet entered films only five years ago, when at 61, when he became a classic of the film, the first and best film John Houston ever pointed out: 'Maltese Falcon'. The 'Koodles' probably did not have a good reputation as a potter's figure in European ceramics, its traditional land. The attractive set used by most films is an attractive jewel.
