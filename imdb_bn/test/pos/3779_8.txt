Chaplin is a daffei in the final film of 1918, which is a dubby who does not seem to be able to walk straight. He spent "there" time at one end of the first world war. Several Gaga stands: As a temporary grenade for Libergar cheese one. In the tranquin, the square is made of four quarters of barracks and when the chaplin and its companions are washed off by their forests, it is highlighted. Chaplin captured multiple German soldiers singly and held German commander to refuse cigarette. When he asked how Chaplin had surrounded him, he replied. Chaplin is a tree of everything hidden behind enemy lines, and those scenes are very funny. He escaped from a bombing house where he met a French girl starring Adana Purvich. He was followed by German soldiers, then fled from them, and Purviance was arrested for helping him. Chaplin bombed a soldier and used to run uniforms using uniforms uniform. He certainly ends up capturing the Purviance and capturing the Kaiser in the process. On the way, Chaplin sparks some sight to bring German soldiers back and is sticky. With this film, Chaplin longed for the possibility of the location of filming while maintaining the attention of the nearby audience, with some of his contract with the Mutual Film Corporation banning him. The film gives him an opportunity to make fun of the enemy, and again he will have more impact on the Great Dictator. *** big 4
