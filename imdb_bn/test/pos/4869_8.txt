This cartoon documents the second challenge between Will E. Quoyet and Rodrunner, and is definitely better than Fast and Furious (1949) first meeting. <br /> <br /> If this is measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon will not be available in the top 5 or 6 of 1952. Regardless, this is a very interesting short. Quoit (Carnivoros vulgaris) along the road, radarune (Accelerated Incredibles) circulates and becomes completely tired. Characteristical "Latin" characters are very basic, and other non-related cartoons are already mimicked. The quote has broken and has released an amazing expression - I do not know - These Jos√©sec Expresses provide this cartoon much more than the laughter share in seven minutes. Then he has an idea, and another ridiculous expression is worn. Sloppy jokes are all delightful, and it is really a real evil to use such pain on a poor, helpless, genius quetta. Everyone knows, but who care? <br /> <br /> Old Rocket Gaga is also present. Quote kept himself in the rocket, which would make him tear enough to catch Rudrunner and catch him. Instead, the rocket flies into the air and becomes a fire in distances: eat at Joe's. This classical gag is derived from this cartoon; Although obvious, it still makes people laugh <br /> <br /> The highlight is really chasing through the minhout. We wear two helmet lights, and we can see the two tunnels with only light. Here, the comedy reached a peak. A visual view of the first sequence of Rodrunner's first sequence. Due to the exit of the quote, the text of Michael Maltese gives the final touch and unintentionally illuminated a match in a room full of explosives, where the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jump and "YIPE!" Spell Characters. After the explosion. These small things make you laugh only within just seven minutes, and as soon as it starts fun. Rocket skates are another good idea, such as tight-drink water free drinks and in indoor space (a sequence in space jam [1996]). Their results will be in vain for the results. Free drinks have become a problem for Will E. at the end of second-end order: i.e. rocket skate. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon packed with fine animations without letters. Although they are very well animated, the two characters are very primitive; Which can be an understatement. Although it may seem strange at first, the humor of the upcoming sequences is forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like Wine Jones, check it out. If you love RoadRunner, get it on video. Excellent entertainment (rating: 8/10).
