All right, we go here, you probably have read in previous reviews in this movie that it is horrible, badly played, it will have to avoid all costs. Well I guess in some ways this way, saying that you can not write a spoiler in this comment because there is no plot to loot. However, there is a fine line between the plane horror and absolutely sunny and believe me this film is next. The acting is so bad, the plot is so unattainable and so completely baffling ends you will smile the whole way through. This picture contains scenes that take the comedy to a new level. Do not expect Oscar winner, but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster, it's worth every penny.
