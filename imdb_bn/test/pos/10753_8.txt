Capture me by surprise this movie. Over the years, I've skipped most of the pictures of Harold Lloyd's soundtrack (as well as Keonton's) because they lost their basic formula, because of their outstanding reputation among silent movies. However, when I watched this movie, I was pleasantly surprised that I really liked it ... ... once I accepted it, it was not really the movie "Harold Lloyd" (despite his acting). Because it's nothing like the style of its previous movie, although it's not too bad to play a very different genre and a completely different type of character. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the sources of the formula are almost entirely missing here on the old films. Lloyd does not do the work of the old known stunt, romance is like a romance on its first screen, and the plot is just weird! Instead of a normal role, he is a Chinese missionary who returns to America, for the first time after becoming a young boy. For this reason, although he looks like American (excluding his white suit and Explorer helmet), he thinks and works a lot like China. In many ways, he is very na√Øve about America and innocent in sheep. At first, he met a man who was confronted by a local party boss. This boss always produces a losing candidate for mayor race - because he is a "token" candidate who has no chance of winning and is bought and paid by the corrupt mayor. Well, the old Giza who ran for the office traditionally died and decided to run innocent Lloyd - he did not pray to be the winner! Well, unidentified events have happened and Lloyd won !!! This, and the decision to clear Lloyd's city displeases the old political machine and they do not stop anything to destroy the honest Lloyd. When Lloyd seems to be in prison for corruption charges, he has created a project that is 100% impossible to get signed from violent and very illegal. However, despite this, it's incredibly fun and a great ending. So, to end my advice, suspend suspense and enjoy. An important note: This film is certainly not politically correct. The word "chink" is used repeatedly. I found it objectionable but consider times, as you should, I should ignore it. However, if you are one who is not angry and likes, then I recommend that you do not see movies in any way - just like you have been bored again and again.
