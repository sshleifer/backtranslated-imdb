One of the most notable quotes of the entire film, the medieval Tita de Guirollo, mediated middle class, is spoken through half of the middle-aged person from Salerno in southern Italy. When we get to know him at the beginning of the film, he is living in an elegant but brilliant hotel in Canton, Italy's Italian language, in the last ten years, operating a business that is slowly running to us. Although this noticeably visible unknown scene brings Swiss bank employees, who usually calculates the cash of the D.D. Guarlom, that there is no $ 10,000 missing paper notes from his usual suitcase. He was silent on this news, but he wanted to close his account with the threatening of his bank manager. Meanwhile, he tells us, the audience is that when you bluff you will have to be misguided until the end, without fear of being caught or ridiculed. He says: Tell you the truth, you can not bluff through for a while and then half. Finally, after finishing this task - the Left Front through just half and the truth, and the consequences of life, and ultimately, love - the only reason for the start of Tere de Guerrello's suffering. <br /> <br /> This first helpless character, at the age of 50, is a skoling, tecton, cartman, a person who does not answer Chambermid and Waitresses as hello and goodbye, has become one step, someone who is deeply caring about the audience. At one point of his non-living, Tita decides to feel anxious about being "laughable". The first half of the film can be described as something "slow". It actually expresses the delusional, deliberate motion of the hotel de de guarlom√≥ day and night, which reveal apparently unreasonable and irrelevant details. However, the scenes may seem to be unnecessary, but it is just as essentially as you can with this skillfully created and innovative movie created with your expertise. The existence of Titara de Guillomo - the people who have no imagination, identity or life, are unexpectedly unexpectedly loved and when you feel at least folks - it is also very well-edited sequences and very interesting uses of music (especially standing by the theme of a Canadian Scottish band board). <br /> <br /> The way Hollywood and Italy disagreed with the controversy about the release of films such as Dell Amur or L'Amalasamato in London Consul, with different contradictions, was never the opposite. Another interesting element is how the film uses playwrights insomnia. Unlike the Machinist (and much more explicitly, Al Paasino film insomnia), this condition of Dela Consum in Del Conjungence uses this deeply emotionalized malaise as a symbol, which is so deeply spread in the ambiguity of ignorance, it is almost impossible to pin point its cause (if really Have one). <br /> <br /> Waitress Sophia (played by the legendary Anna's lady Olivia Magnini,) and Tita's best friend remembers memories, a man whom she did not see in 20 years, unexpectedly finally a small window on her life Provides (though at first glance at first) to accept again. Although it is not explicitly spell out, the audience knows that it would be impossible to accept a love result from a person like yourself. Without a single scene of gender or violence, a movie, which was released in its own time and did not accept anything for the audience's expectations, Italian movies from the collapse of the synthesis in the second half of the 70s in a delicate representation of that little, calm, intelligent renaissance of Del Ma'am in Le Conseguen. Italian is waiting for more Italy's Polino-like fare, more La Vita del Bella-style films ... Negro is neglecting the creation of Delmarger, El Imbalsamtora and others in Le Concise. Your loss, the world.
