I noted that the official IMDB review refers to Leland as a Sociopath. I believe that this assessment is openly and deeply wrong. <br /> <br /> It's a movie of sadness, and a special teenager is able to see the sadness of the child's daily life, because it is waiting around every corner, it is the impact that life expresses in advance. A socialist is a person who can not negotiate with others and who does not take care of this difference when they understand the difference between right and wrong. A socialist is a subject that keeps itself subject to the subject of the universe and completely disregards the effect of its actions for the people around it. One of the defining characteristics of the psalmist is that the true social system does not have the ability to feel sympathy - there is a lack of ability to feel the feeling of others, as well as due to the activities of social activities, others are not related to mood swings. Action The social system can not feel the pain of others, or realize that the pain of others is the result of the social work itself. A socialist is a person who is not fully formed. An important part of mental and emotional makeup of the genuine psyche is absent, "conversation therapies" are anti-social defense and other methods of treatment that include the search of human interaction and personal feelings. Socialism is destructive, even when the matter is treated and placed in a highly protected environment, the social system can harm others. Many societies usually work less or less and can not increase any blurring on the radar of criminal justice system, even though they keep leaving diarrhea in their sleep. <br /> <br /> Leyland Fitzgerald is not a synagogue. He is the person who is blessed (or cursed), with the ability to predict the inevitable consequences and consequences of human interactions. Leland literally shows the sadness written in the face of people in the eyes and around him, that he slowly assimilates and departs about the loss of life internally, and people want a good metaphor that is gradually inevitable and illogical truth, separation. Those who fall in love and those who kiss and cuddle today, older couples turned "merciful". Leland's "mother" (a wealthy New York social worker who loves Leland and is determined to stay in the city and stay in the city while visiting New York City when she visits New York City.) 12 years after her last visit to New York City, she explained to him Did that he was always cheating his husband that he had got a divorce, whose result was Everyone's heart will be broken, and become an unavoidable part of the loss. His eyes still reflect light, but once that their energized electricity has gone. This scene - this explanation, is coming late - why is Lland, a seemingly barbarous, intelligent crime (killing his younger brother with a friend of his former friend) why it is very important to understand Leyland knows what is ahead for this little boy - continuous impossible goal of life, learning only words that identify danger, sometimes not knowing the love of other people, sometimes not feeling the feeling of love and not connecting with another person. In this film, the little boy expresses everything to Leland as being inevitable and dangerous for the world than any other character. This law of the Leland - killing this little boy - is a mercy for Liland, because it is something that he can do in the world where action results can not change. The true social system knows what actions and changes the results, but they do not take care of the harm done by others, care about the Leland. What Lolland's eyes, barbarous and horrific acts most people see as the only decent thing to do is to eliminate the suffering of only one person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It will be comforting to present this interpretation of the Leland's actions as a - comforting, but incomplete. In the end, there is nowhere else "blame" for Leland's work. In such cases as often, there is no easy explanation and no balm to apply the mad soul. Why did not Leleland learn something that even the most discouraged people generally admit that sometimes - sometimes people love, and relationships succeed and even tragic lives are transformed? For the Leland, there is no middle ground, there is no internal core which he can retreat and re-group. There is only pain and sadness. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father - the brilliant writer (played by Kevin Speacy) - because there is not critical time during the development of the Leland, but it may be a blessing because of the extreme cruelty of this man. <<br /> <br /> Finally, this viewer is moved by a great feeling of sadness. Why did Leland undoubtedly see the world behind depression and depression? There is a maturity for the character of Leland - for example, for example, when he is repeatedly saying that nobody will blame for breaking his girlfriend with him - it is both striking and heartwarming. Despite the warm condemnation of Staik, Lelander's teacher, it is absolutely true. But heartwarming, so much of the disappointment that is not born is born. Indifference to Leland's fate is a reflection of her belief that is not really important. He can change his fate that does nothing. <br /> <br /> This is not a socialist in exhibition. This, if anything, reverse its pole ......
