This movie remembers "Boys' n Hood," "Maines to Society," "South Central" and others and even some actors think of them as well. The film "underneath us vs." is underscored by almost all black neighborhoods vs almost all white police forces. Here the police are so bad that they feel like a character and in one scene they attack a boy when they drive in the car, then they become "free" from their owner. It's like the old western bushbacking, but the contemporary setting looks absolutely realistic. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on young Jason Petty and her friends, for which the school is simply a disadvantage that takes time to boost the car from their "real career". It is New York, NJ, jobs in a Jung-belt town, but the infamous higher crime. The problem is so deadly that police have written "steal" in their car, to show that a whole unit must be dedicated to this special crime. <br /> <br /> The guys use "thin gym" to "break into the car slowly and go for pleasure-riding, as it is a big deal." When police attacks them, they only deal with real problems, harmful, Nazi- There is a rebellion against Lieutenant boys, they are not like humankind who may be eligible for liberation, but as a human goal. Actually, he is the courageous Nazi officer of Warsaw Gatoro It is a little memorable, which shot the Jews with joy in the film "Scandal's List." When the boys steal the police cars to attack, the incidents quickly swirl, they are severely beaten by the police, and Jason finally ends up in prison. Clearly this is "bad Boys ", who will steal your car within a minute, but the film wants us to know them Seeing anti-heroes, Jason has shown his sister and his friend to take care of his grandmother. The film is surprisingly well, with whom to stand side by side and who is feeling sorry for: boys' lives are going on, honest citizens who left the car And the right is being stolen and caught in a shootout crossfire, the moment or the city of the nyarke itself, whose law The spirit is dead, betrayed by the police. <br /> <br /> In addition to the leading photo of the latter, the film is a realistic look of the home-dweller and their family and the city's theft culture, where only 2 career shows - law enforcement and crime. Strangely, the whole thing of the drug is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> Movie makers (including producer Spike Lee) are clearly biased against Nevarch's police, we hope they are not pictured badly here. However, they gave us a powerful, influential story and a scary story about inner cities and black youth and fine as Sharon Curley Jason.
