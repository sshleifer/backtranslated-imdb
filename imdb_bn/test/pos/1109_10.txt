I grabbed this movie on weekends as part of the Kansas International Film Festival at Glenwood, which naturally provided thoughtful and eclectic specimens of the world film. <br /> <br /> I was interested in Australian films for a few years, so I was very happy to include this movie and I was certainly not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Played nicely, run firmly, it was as such a journey to a man's eerie story and his heart in the dark heart. It reminds me of Lynch's wild at heart, it's a weird madness in it, but I was obsessed with the movie for other reasons - as it represents a portrait of Australia that is very trustworthy. <Br/> <br /> I once landed down once again in the 1980's and my wife almost 7 years ago. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go long enough to explain my holidays, but director Freien had a lot of ideas that I could see so strange and stupid about Australia, a country that is responsible for the nick cave on one side, and Steve Irwin ('Crocodile Hunter') on each other <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Australia Actually much more But I realized that only one and a half hours left to do this ... 'Sigh <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is very, very successful.
