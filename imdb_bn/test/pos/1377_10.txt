All right, maybe it's because I came from the northeast of Scotland and I talked like a son of this picture, but I got this great fun. Funny to be sure, but the film has made great efforts to look great and the actor must give it all. I was actually quite dominant when they died. When Captain finally finished the Captain This manuscript? Well, two half game. Half of the first half of the photo is well-written and sharp. The last half hour is not so great, many questions are left without answering. This doubt will disturb others as it bothers me. But nevertheless, Sturton is the best fun and a very smart first feature.
