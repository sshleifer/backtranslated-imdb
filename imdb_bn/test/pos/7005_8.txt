The opening scene of this movie is incredible. I saw a number of scientists filming with special effects, but my roommate and I saw each other after the open sequence and he explicitly said, "sensitive overload." The film's plot is quite simple, but the nice thing about this advertising film is that it portrays most of the technology for themselves instead of spoiling the time when interpreting "excessively" to the audience. The creatures of this movie are very interesting. You will not really get a better look at them up to two thirds. Overall, a very entertaining movie.
