I'm not a filmmaker but I know it's hard to tell a story and it can draw people in just seven minutes. I do not want to end up in a good movie. Eric did a great job to create microfiber charts and think of him as "human". Like music and voice used for microbes. Looking forward to seeing what I have for Eric in the future films. This is not a movie I want to see in the end. Great job
