I own all the family guy season so far and I would say the voice of Vol. 6 All have their biggest disappointments. There are lots of laughs here, but I think the vol. Like the last few volumes, it offers 6 fewer and fewer smiles. At least for me <br /> <br /> I was the biggest annoyance with Vol. 6 It seems too heavy in left wing politics. If you can smile to other people, you can laugh at yourself, but this volume really can show your political outlook under your neck and I think it is far away from the show. All conservative satellites are terrible places, very gun control is needed, under the Insuied School Fund, intermediate religious people are crazy, friends of Bush Satan. I can go and this is just the first three episodes. <<br /> <br /> Surely there was some fun in it but when you are not making a comedy then you become such a point and you are really showing your political opinion to others.
