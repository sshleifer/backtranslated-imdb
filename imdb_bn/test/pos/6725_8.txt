Flowers! If this is one thing you will take away from this movie, it will be flower. They are so characterized and used as a plotted device, you will be an expert to identify daisies and black tulips while filming ends. <br /> <br /> Set in Amsterdam, Daisy tells the story of frustrating love triangle between 1 girl and 2 men. A professional hit-man is a living out, another Interpol agent. Featuring a pan-asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and crew (Hong Kong director Andrew Lau, author from Korea, and Thai Post Production Team), I can temporarily feel a headache. <br /> <br /> Heath-man who has found a soft spot for the artist Hei-Yu (played by the beautiful Jean-Ge-Hein) is the park EE (Jung Woo-Sung) hit-man. In the first view, Daisy's love of grass, where his laziness attracted his attention. However, being shy and aware of the dangers of his professional career, he can only bathe away from him, make small (or perhaps big) things for him in an anonymous fashion, but the person taking the cake sends out his matched daisies 4: Everyday without fail in the afternoon of 15. She guarded her guardian from far, kept her safe from damage and damage. <br /> <br /> Hye-young in love with this mysterious stranger. He is waiting to be seen continuously, but I am really surprised how difficult it can be to dodge the duration of time. Yet, he has moved too heavily, and this is the only thing touched by. However, like its star, its Interpol spy, Zhong Wu (Lee Sung-Jei), is one of the secret missions on the city's hey-young people, and they are also influenced by it. The same profession, because of his profession, if he can take the first step, he doubts. <br /> <br /> Where visitors will be frustrating. The lady was obviously mad at the wrong person (then again, it was a "good" guy), Park E Jeong Wau's pains, but he still refuses to recognize himself and recognizes himself and enjoys jong wu. Anonymous anonymous anonymous identity It's almost as if you want to give them a slap in all places almost <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And this leads to two men's leads Nervous fun to become difficult to fall in love with their careers, or their loved ones without danger. But employees can not be disturbed by fans, there are enough cats and mouse releases and unwanted cameras, which are in the face of Infernal Affairs, as well as wide gunfights, although I think the last image is difficult. <br /> <br /> What is the clever appearance of the stone. A non-linear timeline tells the story (no worries, it's not bad, you can still follow the description) from all the points of perspective, leaving you suspicious, and ultimately the three way split screens show all their emotions in a single transition event I thought it was working very well. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie in plenty of mushrooms and busy city squares. Classical music mourns the spirit. With romance movies, all the leads are eye candy - girls will have field days with two handsome men, but boys will have to face a few groin (Argh! OK, at the right angle) Jin Zi-huun <br /> <br /> <br / > If you have an equal balance in the Action / Tension section in romance movie then you will love Daisy. If you like more traditional cooking, other Korean movies will be released here at the same time, you will be my Sunshine, your option. And yes, I completely dug the last scene, which I think only the Koreans do it best? Kinda reminded me of JSA.
