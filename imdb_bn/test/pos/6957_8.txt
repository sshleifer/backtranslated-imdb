It is a fine, low-quality movie, and Rip Tourn, he is well-known, it is an important low-quality actor. I read Howard Frank Moshar's novel many years ago. How beautifully the beauty of the Krevin book and the northeastern Kingdom of Vermont! I had a good fortune to grow up in the VT in the 40's and 50's, and I was still there when the "Erbenberg event" happened. I did not see the Kingdom_strtranger, based on the case of Cranven / Mosaic (and other novels), but this image inspired me to follow it.
