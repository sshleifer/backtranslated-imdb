I do not think I mean yes, if you compare this movie with The Godfather, or maybe a new movie like Casablanca or a new movie like an English patient can also take. It does not have camera work or cinematography like these other movies, but does not mean that it's a bad film, or is it? I think why this film has been undergraduate because many people always compare it with great Oscar winners (you should never do that) which makes it hard to understand the beauty and reality of this movie. Best Picture, Best Role and A Supporting Role Best Actress, This film really deserves all of them. Fantastic Dustin Hoffman is one of us, once, his best performance. Several times in this movie I forgot that it was not his son, that was so real! I did not see a movie about relationships in different families, where actors were so easy to play that particular role, but still so beautiful So, in my opinion, Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors. There are a few actresses in the world who deserve the best: Catherine Hepburn, Merrill Strip, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can not help it, I think she's superb). Although Meryl Strip, he has played a supporting role, he is amazing and real and you are not only helping to grasp his talents and his talents as well. Wow, all I can say is that. Justin Henry considers her age, her tears and her relationship with her mother and dad were beautiful, so I call the cute little Justin Henri good work. <br /> <br /> When I was seeing this picture for the third time, I could not cry alone. I tried but I could not. Thank God I was alone! This is probably the purest film I have ever seen. Other films nominated for Best Picture were Apocalypton Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All The Jazz. I am ashamed because I have not seen any of them, but from what I heard, the apocalypse is great, but when I heard about Soft Rai I only thought about Sally Field. I think, considering the other nominees, this film deserves five Oscars, and it touches and will cry other people in the future, just as in the last 28 years. In this film, we are doing good work for all the performers and actresses, we will not do good to show this film for our good acting and memory. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
