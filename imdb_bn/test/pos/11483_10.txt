I saw Linda, and it's a top rated movie! Life of Paul and his wife Lindner, who he eventually married as a young man and eventually married. They became very good friends with other married couples, Jeff and Stella and four people. However, their friendship takes a twisted trove after the holidays together at Varona Beach .... A twist that does not return to their previous status as married couples friends. <br /> <br /> Linda will definitely see !!! ! Virginia Madison's acting is acceptable; However, Richard Thomas steals the film with his incredible performance ... and the emotion that he displays. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie! "Lotta honey"
