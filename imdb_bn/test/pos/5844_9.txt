Oz is a great series, one of television's underlying shows. It is something that is related to a specific relationship in the soap opera, and it is the manifestation of every temple which revolves. In fact, from my discussion with those who are in prison, this is really true. Every interaction has some machination to work in the background. Behind every action, there is a project, another plot to do the job I like this series so much that it is one of the few TV shows bought entirely in DVD. <br /> <br /> And yes, I agree with the author before me that commented that it has elements of ridicule. Wheelchair's character suggests its living scenes, which make some ridiculous humor.
