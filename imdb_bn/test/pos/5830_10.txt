I admit that I have almost quit watching TV shows. Why? Because most of them are doctors, forensics or some girls / boys, who can predict a murder by sitting in the toilet seats. But I must say I was wrong when I saw the first episode of Oz, one of the most inspiring shows on TV so far. Oz shows a show about the most protected prison and the episode of life in every cell within the prison and its frustrations. What I like about this event is the courage to show the life in prison without any annoying character, stereotype and unrealistic dialogue. Even the characters of the show are not supposed to be heroes, even when you are fast connected to them and their life. Sure, most of the violence and rape of some of these shows take boring images and medicines, but the point of this show; To present how cruel and frustrating life can be to the prison ... Hack, you can not show life in prison with "favorite characters" like "clean character", right? Oz is perfect in every way, the actors are doing an excellent job and the whole hour of this show is really going to throw really fast. The only thing I did not like on this event was the last episode, I think it has become very weird and cruel and the last was not satisfactory. However, overall oz is still my favorite show on TV, it's Soprans and Million CSI and more. The house exceeds the crap with just one main title. Brilliant show that shows what other events are taking away from us; Reality
