The best actress in Australia is a refreshing black comedy. Likewise, lock stock and 2 smoking barrels held the fun part of the London gangsters, with two hands screaming through the Sydney Underworld. It will not be very fun if it is not near the bone. <br /> <br /> Australian classic. If Australia can pull more rabbits like her hat, it could actually keep an eye on a film industry.
