The fundamental plot of this movie has already been made in a few comments so that I will not be disturbed. I would like to commend the first producer, cast, director and crew for creating a superbly compelling movie in a small, $ 1m budget, which is a small part of Hollywood rentals that does not look cheap. These people have a drive to do something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune to do this. It is basically the art industry. I know, I know, one of you will decide that this is not an art but a little something and it's okay. I'm happy for one thing that these people will be facing time and effort for our benefit without our multi-million dollar salary. <br /> <br /> for criticism now. I think the scenario presented is believable on a point. If everything is nice, it is nice and the hero / heroine protects the day and ends well. I am going to be the cause of the extreme merit of these incidents because the blind fortune is more responsible than the courage and strength. <br /> <br /> When Lei is attacked, he is not seriously injured, yet he goes to the bottom of the ground as a dead guide. Then, miraculously, his coveted revolver is still in his holster and it really works (after some cleaning and fetching). Eventually, when Lita was attacked in the land bank and jumped into the water, again the cross failed to kill him. He stretched his hand with his hand and dragged the trigger repeatedly, eventually blasting the brain of the croc (literally). <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that there was a way to end up filming with face masks with people who would go to Lee. Based on what I saw, the attack of the croquet and the hold kept until it stopped. Crochet revolves around and the victims drown and drown. That is the first 3 victims but Lee did not happen. He had a tooth mark but they were not deep. <br /> <br /> I think it was good to win the Crack, obviously, as a result of which mangrove, its territory has proved its authority for millions of years. But then how many of us were painful or frustrated that the beautiful girl would not be alive?
