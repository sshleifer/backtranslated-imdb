This gentle comedy with Billy's famous humorous, heavy Bitsuvera overturn is a big exit, unexpectedly for Billy Crystal. This film has various tears, dramatic, serious underlying themes (especially with a scene with Steven Sighal). This movie was an entertaining and serious, lost movie about love, relationship between husband and wife, husband and wife, especially about friendship and quality with a good dose of humor. The balance between drama and comedians is not always consistent with such a new classical style, but the actual message and motivation of this film remains firm. Delivering a demon man in Romania is the genius of the Crystal Scout / agent character discovered and interesting behind the scenes of movie agents. Yet attention remains on both the love and the sensual relationship of learning about yourself. Ten stars out eight
