In 1994, I first saw this movie at the Istanbul Film Festival. It was very good that I took a few friends with me and went to meet again the same week. Characters have played very well and the humor here is amazing. It sure is a very strong gay movie. In some scenes you can see an episode of friends with a more sophisticated line. I think I'll put it in my VCR and see it tonight ...
