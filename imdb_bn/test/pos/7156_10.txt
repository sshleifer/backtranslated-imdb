I have seen many long "spiritual" films for a long time. Maybe never A scene around the dining room table is a piece of comic perfection. I understand a release date coming in the fall. If it comes to your city and you want to see a movie that you think it is, it is it. Aviva is brilliant in her and she certainly is a future star - (Superbod is now out of nowhere) - Also all actors seem to be perfectly calibrated. This movie has a tone set which is used to surprise. I do not want to say it - this is a comedy but the underground message is so fatal and directly "comedy" is not a big word for it. I love this picture. This is a thoughtful people comedy. But even that phrase is not really good enough. FTF has a message and this message needs to be heard right now
