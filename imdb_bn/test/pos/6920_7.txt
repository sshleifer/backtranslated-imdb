All about this movie entertainment. Imagine your friends that you love to spend time, that you know that you are becoming somewhat silly and are probably taking a letter or two. That's what this film is about. An innovative script and brilliantly performed. It's not about agreeing with the public, it makes fun of a bunch of gifted geniuses. I'm sure that what they all thought when they signed up for it. <br /> <br /> The above review seems to be completely inappropriate and I think it was in the wrong mind when a person who wrote it saw the movie. At a lighter moment, if you are careful to see it, it has great dignity. <br /> <br /> A job done well, I thought it was a great movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
