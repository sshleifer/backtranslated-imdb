I was amazed at how well this German version of Scrum-like film was. Slashar films exceed all modern American efforts. <br /> <br /> All these movies do not. Possible characters, genuine mystery, mystery, graphic murder and a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This stylish horror movie is the best one to come out of the year. German movies are just going from the latest energy power. This is shameful because more people will not see this movie because of their disappearance. It is easily available in DVDs, so if you hate subtitles, you may still see it. It will be one of the best horror films you'll see throughout the year.
