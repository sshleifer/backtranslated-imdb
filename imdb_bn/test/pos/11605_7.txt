I told Malice what agreed with. The film is depicted in such a way that it seems to be a kind of ambiguity in the original content. Emotions are not properly conveyed. I do not think very good performance contributes to its mediocrity. In my opinion, Tasu preferred Aishwarya Rai instead of Rai. In some of his scenes, he looks a little lively, which, ultimately, should not portray the movie. I noticed a bit of extra acting in some of her scenes. I can not help Aishwarya Rai's cranky critic :); Sorry for that. Rituparno Ghosh's 'Raincoat' is a good movie. And I saw the dancer saw the rocket; I was not impressed at all.
