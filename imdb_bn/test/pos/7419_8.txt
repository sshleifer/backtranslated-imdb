This movie has one of the best club scenes, very good soundtracks (if you like techno / trans music) <br /> <br /> In some situations (for example, the main character Karl begins to take drugs, for example), but the plot is for entertainment, but the characters Everything is shallow ... <br /> <br /> If you do not like Techno Music then I will not recommend watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Chakra This movie to play solo / 4/10, with really cool effects and club scenery and soundtrack 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies to listen to excellent tracks and grab a little club feeling, this is a 10/10. <br /> <br /> Special effects sometimes hidden, sometimes visible. (Such as fast dynamic clouds / sun / moon, morphing background, morphing cut) <br /> <br /> I enjoyed many for it, shame was not a dancer in the movie;)
