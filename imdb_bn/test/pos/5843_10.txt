Oz was a fantastic show, as long as the male nude does not stop you. There was a lot of male nudity in this show, you wanted to see any show in a pornographic channel. The minute that it was the best show on TV and the previous commenter said "better than Prime Szpictor". The main suspect Tom and Jerry vs Simpsons. There is no competition. If you have DirecTv, they are now restarting it from the beginning of Channel 101, they are now in episode # 3. Highly recommended. The creator Tom Fontana also did homeside, which was a great show. But why are all male nudity? We all know things happen in prison, but do they really want to show it? That show was the only thing that turned me off. If I want to see naked men, boys rape, I kill myself and witness the first hand. Otherwise I'd love free black penises every five minutes on my TV show.
