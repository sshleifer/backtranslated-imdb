I have seen this movie twice at the International International Film Festival (TIFF), this film is in competition and I really hope that Istvan Sapi will get the award (at least for the best picture awards). <br /> <br /> As a silent movie fan I am interested in contemporary movies, which quote or revive last year's film. Previous critic Fretz stressed the quote from the lang and the frame. W. Murnau. I can see that the movie directly refers to Lang's metropolis and the metaphor-impressive character of its plots. But I did not see Murunu. Although there is also a clear Melies-tribute: a (here smoke the cigar) people's face, and made of paper, draw hills and city-landscapes. I mostly enjoyed the film for its visuals, and in the meantime it was very interesting about the mutanie and communicationless creative media was used by vulnerable residents of the city. From this point of view, this movie is a unique reaction to the silence of the silent film, because in silent film, no one can find the story with silent characters. In this case, the story of the stolen voice could be questioned for silent film inspiration, or there is a desire to play silent movies. There is another example of this type of reaction in Gaya Maddin's verdict, where residents of the mountain villages are prohibited from using their voice. I would like to write a paper about this, if you know related movies about this topic, please let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I recommend to Establep Hope's Film near every movie (this is one of the critics: Jewel of the Festival). <br /> <br /> PS: The winners were announced, and the movie won the Best Cinematography Award!
