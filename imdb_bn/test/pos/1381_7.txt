'7' rating is definitely not a smoker - this movie was made in a low budget - but it works well in its range. <br /> <br /> A normal vessel-boiler plot - The ship carrying the ship is a place to destroy, people in ponds and prisoners of war, unknown planets where some of their presence awakes. Mayhem ensues, many ammo is spent. <br /> <br /> Special effects emphasize future technology with holistic display and control, depending on heavy, cheap looking plastic props, have been done extra and accurately. As well as the pacing of the story was removed without permission to fill the boring audience where they began to separate things. <br /> <br /> I present it as a flight light on Saturday noon. You can get up and hit the refrigerator without interruption and it can still be enjoyable. Even better, your girlfriend can talk to you most without harming your enjoyment - and she'll be happy: after all, she talks with you! It's that kind of movie However, after the planet has hit, there are some holes in the real story lines, but hey, it's a song en nemo action movie. Connector story lines require you to have beer and chips as soon as possible. So do not get yourself a brain-crank on the finish.
