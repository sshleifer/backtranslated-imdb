Kite Runner to win Oscar! It is perfect in every sense, story, script, acting, film screenplay ... nobody would guess that it was painted in China. Two childhood friends and those who follow their adult life can leave a lasting impression of stories. Under the Taliban, life illustration in Afghanistan is very real and scary. I did not read the book, but I saw a comment that kept the film down because "books are always good" ... it's really no problem. No one "did not go to the wind" because it was not true! In fact, it won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Other Oscars. I think this movie is brilliant - writer and director, and actor Bravo!
