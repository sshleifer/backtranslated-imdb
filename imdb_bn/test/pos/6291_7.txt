I did not expect much when I decided to watch this movie, so I was surprised to enjoy myself completely. A couple of scenes were almost uncontrollably to smile. Character was engaging (no pun intended); However, the story is predictable. Its fun comes from showing the crawl (Shore's character), it is a DTG-yet-wise California township, where a girl from a country's college brings home for Thanksgiving, she tries her painful (yet favorite) way to cope with her living. I was surprised that all this was a message. If you have a chance, watch this movie!
