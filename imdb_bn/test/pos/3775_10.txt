I first saw this movie in the early 80's and we got it here. We all know, Betamax went on the way to the 8-track tapes, it was intense, it was also a really nice picture quality. However, I'm happy that I found this movie again, I've been looking for it for more than 10 years! This movie falls into the category of movies like Biman: series jock, anilines, fun action (body language). Mark Blankfield is absolutely delightful. Shy Dr. Daniel Jakeel, his transformed sex-mad partner, Mr. Perfect with Hyde, Sonatauth, Chester and Sonarchen. The part I loved was when he hijacked the poor man and then went to Madam Woo Ou. Completely cycled experience without drugs! If you need laugh therapy to make it movie. When I first saw it, there was tears in my eyes and my stomach continued to smile. This is a movie that I can meet again and again. I highly recommend it.
