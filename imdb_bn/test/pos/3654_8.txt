I have seen this movie in an entire movie of the International Film Festival of the movie Avid Movie Buff and Indian Pre-Pat. The film is beautiful and flowing for the first movie. Self-direction in the direction, especially for the locals who had been assigned the fly and fly for the bit part. Although the plot and story line is not elementary, but the pleasure of seeing performance and scenery offset the lack of it. The soundtrack of this movie is a great attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what you can do in 45 days a day, see Hariri Om for inspiration. It has not been published in Q & A, but I guess it can take a lesson from the director to learn the Hollywood budget film.
