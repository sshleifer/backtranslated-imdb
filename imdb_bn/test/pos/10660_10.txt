As the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the mutiny of 1905 and the heroic prediction of the October 1917 revolution, the grandeur of the superiority of the silent film's superiority was established by the Boolechish Peptkin (1925) Commission. Curiously, this film director Sergei Yenenstein was one of the oldest and most influential advocates of the film industry's formal process. Later, because of the legality and suspect politics of Lawsonstein, there would be numerous conflicts with governmental organizations "Socialist Realism". Influenced by the Russian film's theoretical, Lev Quasov and DW Griffith's intolerance (smuggling in 1919), Eijenstein created films from "clashes" of the rapidly edited images, created lengths, speed, content of different types of shots, light, and cameras Angle The most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's artistic method - and perhaps the single most cited in the history of the cinematography and the sequence in the research order - "Odessa Step" in the Ptkkinine. In the structure, a "five relayer" is a divided into five narrative pieces, an organization clearly evident from five law enforcement systems in the Western world. In "Men and Magogs", the Iniesten revolutionized the revolutionaries of the pre-revolutionary persecution and the war crew of the war crew, because the situation certainly made up for rebellion. Even before the sailors and their high ranking officers / lords were seen visually, Eisstein made a symbolic narrow condition by clashing violent and evil breakdown waves in the ocean. Onboard ships we witness the crowd, exposed condition. Eisenstein's arbitrary lashings, hard work shots, and most memorable - for the evening meal, Maggots emphasize the secrecy of the sailors with the harmful meat. Other officials brought the medical doctor close to the ship, so that the sailors were declared appropriate meat to be served with warm soup like rage. Most of the Marxists, church people also failed and we saw one of them destroying a plate written with words from two separate camera angles (probably the first deliberate "jump cut" film in history). <br /> <br /> Inter-titles marked as "QuarterDek's play" and "an appeal from the dead", the second and third parts of the Pottin represent actual rebellion and the first title of his leader and enemy and the first hero of the revolution, Waqulinchuk. In the United States, by the appeal of Vakulinchuk's brotherhood, the primary rebels involved in the attack on the entire crew authority. Fierce emotions which ensues a chaotic scene are well served by Eisenstein's editing techniques. Fourth of the officers were scattered and their symbol of privilege was destroyed. The ship's doctor threw the onboard, dramatic cross-skulls in the maggot-shaped meat and his glasses leaped hazardously. Sadly, Vakolinchuk's death is worth the price paid for rebellion (an omelette without eggs broken) and decorated with Odessa Peer's dignity. Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens gather with sailors to honor him and pledge "death of the oppressors". Boxing shots give rise to narrow and contractional signals to revolutionary spirit. <br /> <br /> The sequence of complex and unforgettable Odessa steps constitutes the fourth Act of Film. It starts with lifting music on the coastal and selected objects (parasols, glasses, baby cars) on various elated faces of people and starts off and starts with a series of medium shots. Suddenly the songs are closed (as the title of a title card in huge letters), and the lines of soldiers, including the rifles and fixed bayonets, appear at the top step. Here Eisenstein collapses the entire force of the collapse of the movement as nearly hundreds of shots are assembled, citizens are awaiting the fierce catastrophe and civilians against the torture of citizens, with the cruel attacks of the citizens driving horses and cossacks. The Mais-N-View is a church, at the top of Sier and below, the symbolic dialect for Russian tyrannical organizations: the astronomical empire and the symbol of the Orthodox Christian Church. <br /> <br /> Punctuating sequences are two scenes involving mothers and children. First of all, the mother and the little boy facing the joy of the crowd were among the first victims of the killers. The boy shot, but the mother continued to run until she stopped running, fearing the boy's fallen body was afraid of her. With a very slow pace of performance, the camera follows the camera because she takes her children's violin body by the stairs to face the soldiers (only shows in a triangle shadow line). They shoot briefly his death. After this lull, the cancer continues for a few dozen concession until the second mother's stomach (mother is pregnant in Russia), because she tries to protect her baby in her car. In a famous scene in Unchappelabs, the car slips underneath the stairs. The alarming faces of the despicable citizens keep an eye on the slow pace of its destruction. When the car reaches the bottom, it spends Cassac with a sword and offers a classic cooling effect that we do not actually see: killing this pure and symbolic innocent. In the Odessa sequence, the final series of shots is divided into three stone lions, one rest, one sitting and one roar. This performance gives them an animation as a visual metaphor for the awakening of human awakening. <br /> <br /> Somewhat immune system, the fifth law will bring us back to war, because rebellious sailors flee on high seas and are waiting for collision with other ships. Fleet. They and the spectators expect punishment, but when a meeting arrives, no shots are fired, and instead all sailors put their hat in the wind with the symbol of virginity in the waves. The revolution has not been successfully launched for another twelve years, because at this time Eastenstein's history is reconsidered. But that combines, Battleship Potemkin stands as one of the silent film era's basic work, and it maintains remarkable cinematic power.
