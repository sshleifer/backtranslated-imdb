I rented this movie with very low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. This movie is a very good element. And no one will guess it's less budget. <br /> <br /> The 18-year-old pop, known as Pip, managed by eight-year-old Richard Bell, was named Paul Anthony. The way his elder brother died was the circumstances surrounding. He was defeated by this incident and a runway teen on drug and alcohol has a difficult life. On his 18th birthday, his father kept Pip and his grandfather put a tape for him, from which he heard his 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> What the whole picture says is that together with the release of two simultaneous stories. Pip's current life and the past life of his grandfather in WW11, which Pip listens to his tapes. <br /> <br /> There are three outstanding performances of this movie: 'Paul Anthony' Pip and 'Brendan Fletcher' playing Jason, 18 year old WW11 soldier, his grandfather. Also, Mark Hillrath has played the role of WW11's wounded drug 'McAully'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, pick up the Hoastler on the local street and find the whole neighborhood. And then known in our local store, Clark Jeff, who is a sweetheart acting by David Baszelli, who just likes to like, and is very unreasonable for some unknown reasons, and the sledge of the streets is the street holster, Clark, who is just sleeping and all the possibilities A walking is a bomb during the toxic time. All that he is not a very liked person at the top. This section is not true. <br /> <br /> I love the flashbacks of war. They were very well played and very touched. Finally there is a scene where a soldier is dying and another soldier, 'Jason' is there to show his comfort and love because he suffered severe injuries and died. This is a wonderful and touchy scene that left me in tears. Beautiful acting. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is one of love, freedom and the power of the human soul to survive.
