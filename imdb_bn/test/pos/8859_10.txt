John Carpenter sees how much he loves with how much he reflected on the original 1951, the only difference here is that Carpenter John W. Campbell Jr. likes to stop the short story paranormal cores. The secret of the success of this edition is that the pressure of unbearable excitement that the group of men has become suspicious of each other, literally takes hold of the pressure to wait. Carpets are properly directed to supply shocks and mystery to keep film title. It's a terrific scene or a "shade in the sequence", to me is a perfect combination of film horror and sci-fi. Attempts are being made to keep in touch with a group of men under the dialogue, and the score of the carpenter is a wonderful cruel counter-beat that refers to the growing destruction of the movie and the panooya. Casts are fantastic, a firm assembly of actors led by the centurion Fav, Kurt Russell, gives the effect of the right amount of impact when used. But most of the end is the end of glorious glory, which can not look at the end of the ideal and is incredibly suitable for what has gone before, let's wait and see what actually happened, 10/10
