The story was well-plotted and itself interesting. However, without the recovery of this film, my writing is difficult for you. To avoid this, I'm not going to tell the story here. <br /> <br /> I think this image is a good adaptation of the book of Sarah Water, compared to the previous "velvet tip". I first read the book and later saw the DVD. This image retains most of the spirits of the original character. Of course, due to the time limitations, in the last 30 minutes the film turned into a fierce competition to cover the third part of the book. Therefore, they could not properly illustrate the scene of Mr. Ibb's Kitchen Kitchen and after that (even the book seems to me to look at the kitchen scene). Despite this, the film actually did a good job representing the story. It's really worth looking for. While BBC-America can broadcast this movie, it is still unclear. <br /> <br /> <br /> Notice that Moudud and Sue were fixed 20 to 20 years instead of 17-18; More irresponsible when modern actresses are closer to age.
