Actually, I do not understand why so much controversy about this show. When it stretches on them, strain the original material. The story has been updated and, some episodes appear to be "fast", it is a good thing. <br /> <br /> The role of Christopher Eccleston is perfect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> - Doing politics with acting doctor as President Amirritus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A huge Dr. Hugh Gek - I was actually from number 1. Seeing the show till 8th number is always taking notes. Personally I could pull a horror movie from Canon) It is currently the best advertising scene on TV. Check it out and buy the DVD.
