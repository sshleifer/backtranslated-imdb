I saw the 2-hour version of the chunk sand. I can not say that long The film has a specific natural movement and it does not seem to be isolated at any time. Clothing and set reminds us of what we will see in old movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai did a good job as a performer. It is indeed a mature role with enough opportunity to act in the story. The script supports very good stories. The goddess works as a unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. The film is about the feelings and desires of such a character and at that time the conflict between the devastating condition of the widows. <br /> <br /> His best friend, Raima Sen, also starred in this movie. -handled His innocence and praise in English and the skill of educated education have been very good. This is actually something psychic that exists at that time. We can see how far we can come from so many ages! <br /> <br /> The film is a fine line in the story of women's liberation war. I got the development of the story, writing out similarly on the outside of the house. It ropes in some steps of the freedom struggle and opposes the struggle of Indian independence against silent struggle for women's rights. <br /> <br /> A good movie is certainly worth watching. Aishwarya's performance: excellence Rituparna conducted a very careful story. Yet another classic of Rabindranath Tagore
