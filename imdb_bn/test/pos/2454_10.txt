I have never heard of this picture and only got it because I'm Martin Shane fan. Now I am wondering why it does not really qualify and get recognition. The four characters feel for them all, the father is trying to strengthen his authority, the mother is still associated with the traditional family values, and both of them try to be present even if they want their own life and son, despite the total division of their families. Vietnam is frightened by its experience. Someone thought that this scene was seen in thousands of 'ordinary' families after Vietnam. Emilyo Estevez as Jeremy was fantastic - her unfulened experience by her fighting experience could relate to some of her family. The screen chemistry between his and his real life father Martin Shane was wonderful. And there was a time when Emilio's pain was like Martin's "Apocalypse now". I'm sure Martin has counted Apocalypse as one of his best movies, Emilio will count it as the best one. The gun scene was completely leakage of the mind, because all emotions were in the face of the family. Actively played by Etevez, Shane and Cathy Betts. Last night I saw this movie for the first time - and today's main story was about the experience of the Gulf War, which shot some members of his family to death. How many youths are going to destroy their lives in the war?
