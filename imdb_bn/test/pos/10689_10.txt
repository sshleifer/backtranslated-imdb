This movie is amazingly good. The rules of Nizam war were incredible. I did not see all the shows in Kosugi, but I probably saw it as the best. Perhaps the most fascinating battle sequence was at the beginning when Ninja killed about 20 people, one of the most fascinating rules of war I've ever seen. Another good warfare was a police funeral where Nija allowed more people to bury. The last fight was very impressive. Also I like the soundtrack of this movie. The story was enough for a naya-cinema, in fact it was different from other Naya-films. So if you're a fan of movies, you probably like it.
