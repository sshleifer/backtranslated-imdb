Gen-Y Cops ... Because I've been released, I want to see it because I like General-X Police. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas TS did not return and B) too much crystal. However, I enjoyed Sigalle because it may not be as good as the first movie, but it is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> !) As it's back. Actor New Actor in the movie, Edison Chen. He's a great replacement for Nicholas TS ... Edison. I also enjoyed the performance of Agent Curtis Paul Rudd ... he seems to hate to hate as a nail, smartmouth FBI agent ... but soon, you want his character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> /> <br /> <br /> See for the Camero from Ron Smernberg, who is a cage fighter who has a misguided little fight with the match. Smoorenburg is also double the stunt for Rudd <br /> <br /> If you like Jen-X COPS ... you love Jane-Y COPS !!!
