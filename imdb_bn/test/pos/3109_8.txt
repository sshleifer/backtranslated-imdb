Hugh, I'm learning very quickly that sometimes when you see a movie as a young man and after 20 years you again get a different perspective - because in the initial 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Kikar was - how much director he was and how much the movie was flying. What I can say is that ... I really liked this picture, it touched the same area of ​​my life: The long-standing friendship between the two women What can that always be? Well, at a certain level, yes ... and the film came out shortly ... "how". <br /> <br /> This is the first time I've been young with a lot of life experience so I focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part of the two. At that time, I had no difference and what would happen to two women discovered there ... and how they would affect their friendship. Through their men, in their career, decades that defined them. And one thing I can understand is that something else stronger ... can tell them more about their friendship and each other. <br /> <br /> Then I became old, learned the film ... and saw it again with my best friend from high school. We understand the 'rich' and 'famous' angle ... and we are still the best of friends ... but this film is not a dramatic play of a movie ... it can sometimes be seen as a few camps ... at the top of the point (a' Genital 'and' dallas' level on Kinda) above a little above. And in fact I can detect in the "Teddy Bear" scene because we used a beer that is much more than stuff, through our trial fun toys and trouble with men / workers, etc. It does not feel like the top ....! Many have already said that Magaw Ryan and Matt Latangi and Dak Rambo and David Selby are very good in this 1981 piece. It's a nice "chick" flick!
