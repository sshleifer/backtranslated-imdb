I saw this photo my mother. He was 81 years old and was raised to be a great. He even acknowledged this. I do not think he understood what was actually happening, he had already raised his mind that the child was guilty. Scary I felt for this child and his family. What tortured they went through and remained faithful. That is the true faith. Return to the movie. I was disgusted with the police force and their ineligibility. I am so glad that this public defender has been selected to work in this field. It was fortunate for this family to have a person who was very careful to look through the frogs he had given him. I can say if a police lie. He does not have to see the eye savior. When he answered the question, move to the side of his eyes. It is unfortunate that a black person will be punished for his black color. I read books about black people by dragging behind a truck by three white men. Finally they were convicted many years later. I can not remember the title, but it was the same courtyard. White whatever they want with black I am sure the child of the film will be attacked for a long time. I have told my mother that most serial killers and pidophiles are white. There are no comments from him. I would like to appreciate the director and producer of this photo. I think the exposure they gave to these intolerant injustices was a necessary project. I am a bright spectator of Indi Cinema. I think that I have good writing and stuff. I am satisfied that this movie happened to occupy this movie. I was compelled to write a comment because of how firmly I feel about the film and the existing inequality existing in our modern society.
