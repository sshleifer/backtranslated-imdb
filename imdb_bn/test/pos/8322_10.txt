John Grirson noted: "The documentary style can be defined as:" creative explanation of reality "<br /> <br /> This imagined 180-minute documentary is the first time a computer-generated project that respects the dinosaur's intelligence to the audience. <br /> <br /> /> <br /> When I saw Jurassic Park, which I was expecting with great excitement, I was very disappointed. Of course the dinosaurs were great, but the storytelling was unnecessary. I thought: "If they do not make any documentaries in dinosaurs, no crying baby or bad birds, only dinosaurs make realistic as possible, which once surprised us as a reality." <br /> <br /> My dream came true. The BBC has created a delightful documentary by exploring various era of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This section is for people who do not agree with the behavior that they wanted to guess about many aspects of behavior, skin. Patterns etc.: Of course they have. There was no one. I think it's fantastic that they could present something realistic as excellent. Estimates are based on the knowledge of many polyantologists and it gives a very good idea about what it was like to the audience. If you want to know exactly what you know, just visit a dinosaur bone museum. For this reason, I included the Grecian quotation at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> However, the hat is closed to its creators.
