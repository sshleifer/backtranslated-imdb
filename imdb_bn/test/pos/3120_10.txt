For my money, perhaps the best film - or at least the most accurate film producer Ford ever created. The dialog starts fast at the beginning of the story from clip, point.l and ends with the final credit only. Ford uses a relatively small throw, but indicates them and photographed them with a jump from a gigantic and epic proportion. Seriously realistic, warmly entertaining, wildly played (it is hard to believe that Johnson can not be a leading figure after this), with the best photography and editing in an American black-white film. Seriously many things awful in Agenstein's editing method, but sometimes coldly isolated or 'scientific' Eisenstein may often get. And a great musical score. A wonderful panorama of an important and weak understanding episode in America's history. <br /> <br /> A little chin: It is not clear why the movie has included Mormons, I know as much as I know, the queens were never pacifist and Emish was there. After this confusion give up some ugliness. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the image is such a festival, it is easy to ignore. In all other ways, the true masterpiece of American film which will be revived and again (and again and again).
