I must admit that I could not see this movie in the theater. The summer blockbuster was released at the beginning of the season, this cute little picture could not help but the special effects of millions of dollars could be lost in the shadow of the film, can not it? <br /> <br /> The original part of "Come Back To Me" has a lovely and easy story, and it is very well-written and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in her most of the film as an actress ...)! The impressive story is nicely woven with tricky tricks and comedians and brings life with the fantastic performance of old and young actors. <br /> <br /> Those who say that David Duvovini did not really get good shot in the break, his "Fox Mulder" mold, I agree. I saw his other film work, and, to the extent that, what he could do for himself is the best. Minnie's driver is just as beautiful as Grace, beautiful, engaging, fun and lively. <br /> <br /> These two are out of bounds, but you are surrounded by close friends of Grace and friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute sewing, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real-life energy. However, I can go without mentioning Robert Loggia's talent, and fall in love with Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I saw this movie again in the movie just a day ago. This was his last film, and he gave an performance that an actor could certainly be proud to leave as a great career ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, what turned out to be "back to me" turned out to be a funny yet Love has been the story, and a film that has turned it into my favorite one! Take the time to do this ..... it is a good maker!
