If you are one of the people who think Lucyo Fuli Gore, Hunts and Jabbis, then you (and you also need to see "brain" issue). Although the film includes some cruel scenes of violence and an uncertain subject, this is not the main issue here. This is a truly captivating, story and character-driven killer mystery which could possibly be the best-performing essay. Here, he has proved that he has created a real artisan, memorable, annoying but very beautiful composition, filled with vague Catholic images and interesting social commentary. It's a great but important role in the fantastic Barbara Bucket as well as a great cast with Thomas Milan (from Beatrice Sensie) and Irene Papas. Nevertheless, Brazilian actress Florida Balkan (who saw Phoolie's "miserable woman's skin"), who stole the scene in the role of the shrine, gave her an insane madness by superstition, and her deadly murder scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second protagonist of the film, Sergio D'Azizi, who helped Rij Ortolani live with scores of Moroccan Marikon-Esquien, "living a secret to the exclusive Italian village". I thought that the stone hit me with a stone on the side of the bad one, but it was a typical Italian horror classic - a running, tragic, and thoughtful act of the final thought. 10/10 for me If you like it, then I recommend Alfred Sol's "Alice, Sweet Alice", and they both are underlying gems.
