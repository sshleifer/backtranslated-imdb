It is one of the best musical instruments of 1940. The glorious Technicolor Rita shows off Hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair. He should have made more films in his paintings, but Kolkata could not stay in exchange for the spectacular vision of technikolor. <br /> <br /> Rita is more like a street Parker than a hold-up with a gene. The most fantastic number ever. She looked beautiful instead of centuries gowns, so she was given the opportunity to play her own grandmother. <br /> <br /> Opens the image with "The Show Mystery Gone On" - it looks great to me - but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His policies work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Morin (Leslie Brooks) is determined to improve herself and is going on for a glittering competition for Vanity's Golden Wedding Cover Girl. Rust will find itself as well as in the audition itself. In a very funny scene, Mourin has just received so much audition and saw Rusty, giving some tips to influence judges !!! "Do not be shy and demure - gossip and blurry". <br /> <br /> They decide to kill and go to see him, but seeing John Coud (Rusty) on the other side, he reminds him of his past. Cornelia (Eve Ardenne) is still having nightmares on the sweetness of the rusty. Genius (Phil Silvers) and dancers, who wear clothes for women - (who has a complaint) - For the first time he saw his song "A sure things" - race Set at Meanwhile, Danny, Rusty, and Genius are looking for pearls in their local diner. Then they introduced the "Make Way for Culture" (in my opinion) - in the Happy Songs of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> An interesting song called "Data to Two Test" and the dance name Danny and Rusty Already in the rusty selection was the cover girl and Danny McGuyers' place to visit. Lee Bowman is displayed as Danny's romantic rival and keeps a flute on the thing. Lee Bowman is probably the most annoying leading man sometimes - so Danny does not have to worry. <br /> <br /> The song "Rusty long" ("Mouth by Moutha Mears") by Rusty Mears, and is nicely portrayed by Danny and Rusty, the gown that wears Rita is stunning, with their designs, Trevis Benton and Gane Walking. Danny loves to be good for Rusty, but fear she will lose her. Genie Kelly is fantastic at number "Alter Aho", where she dances with herself. <br /> <br /> "poor genesis" Another look back at the turn of the turn - this was written in 1906 and it's funny to have funny funny peculiar popping fun - Heyworth looks fantastic in a wonderful d√©cor. "Poor John" and "A Sure Thing" both look for Al-Norman.He's a wonderful surprise Dancer, who appeared on several primaries, including "Jazz King" and "Paramount on Parade" <br /> <br /> The "cover girl" dance was just wonderful, Rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. After a part of the beautiful model parade through the cover of America's top magazine, Rusty was very attractive "cover girl" Under a ramp, there is a beautiful golden gown dancing under the dancing. I just love this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
