As you know from frame number 1, the suit and the good person have been destroyed ?? He has no luck ("Soto Nulla"), or after that he believes in the car radio with that song and his best friend and company's associate suspect who took him to the unknown part of the desert road. Alberto just wants to stay alone, take flight abroad next day ?? Well, someone guesses left. <br /> <br /> Is this picture going a long way ?? Get that short? The person listening to the same music in a cab at the airport with a closed view with the man. In it, many lucky persons have found stories in different ways, some are dying, some are being born, others are suffering from depression. Is this time he really destroyed ?? Or he? The film is a demonstration of director Fernando Fragata, who has special effects on sound recording and other accomplices. Those who generally reject Portuguese movies because of word problems and unclear lecture record, they will go on to find other issues to criticize at this time. The car crashes (it's not spoilers, the film is too clever for that) makes for a great view, and is apparently done with cheaper tools. (Look at US studios: You can raise the dollar or two by hiding the appropriate Portuguese director!) <br /> <br /> The rest was done by frega, from script to conversation, to edit from camera work. If the conversation piece is free, then it should be re-congratulated, and most of the inexperienced actors should be cast. Most non-speaking parts are credited, but most people are used to being widely used in music video clips and film promotional trailers. Cast has a dozen actors and actresses, among which ten relevant individuals, and a huge number of relationships ?? The step-by-step is a romantic, suspenseful way, memorable of the best artists. 'Alfred Hitcock' (QV) and 'Cloud Chibrol' (QV) thinks that the cat and mouse play in the director and his people and the nature of his characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and comedy to speakers of the Portuguese language and, if you enjoy this movie, anyone abroad who receives a suitable translation of dialogue dialogue abroad.
