I recently gave this movie as a gift to the DVD, and if this was an appeal, it was initially uncertain (though my favorite actors have a major role). In fact, it's a way to become a favorite. First of all: Thanks, it's not like a book * which I think is too loud. Secondly, it is one of the best films I've ever seen about World War I. "What?" You can ask. "This is not a war film!" True: We see no war or bomb explosion, no trench, no gas. But the price of war shows, the damage done in the lives of those who fought, lost their lives, and the effect they had on them. <br /> <br /> We first see Helen (Sarah Miles), a baronet widow, waiting for her release in a psychiatric hospital. All women in the film seem to be widows: some of the war, but Helen's older husband Sir Thomas (we see him in a photo later) died ill and when he was in the party, his crime-annoying breakdown He lost and lonely. Unlocking the pound camps and trains around the hospital's premises: Like many people outside the world, Helen suffers from a shell shock. <br /> <br /> He must find out outside of the hospital his feet again in the outside world: a world which we experience through his eyes as slowly, solitary and useless. Her mother is unable to provide any practical support to her. A widow has developed herself as a mental obstacle, behind which she is hiding to deal with the pain of her daughter. (Like many people, especially at that time, he feels embarrassed to be mentally ill.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is becoming dangerously obsessed with him I can not. It's a fantastic performance by Robert Show. Ladbeta is a former regular soldier, a former sergeant-head who runs a boxing club and arranges for own car rentals. Simply, he feels strong and strong, reliable, but has cracks at the bottom of the surface: he is not really consistent in civilian life. He invented (the reasons he later explained) is a family and home life that he does not have; He has cruel explosions with colleagues, and fondness is less sexual. Helen to get closer? A woman whom she hoped to get married even after wartime social liberation? Psychological faults-line reveals that separates them. In those days, someone may diagnose PTSD. <br /> <br /> Like the other person in the life of Helen, true politician Captain Hugh Canttrip (Peter Egan). She is aspiring, handsome, but very young. Not saying, his girlfriend, Connie (Caroline Mortimer), her mother, grasped her hair and ensured her clean napkins before she left. He was known to both Ladybetter and Helen: during the former war, he was under his control, and Helen saw him in political circles and considered him "popinjie." However, he and Helen have now started a relationship, Helen is seeking financial, financial and emotional support for her political career. As a stanhope at P.C. Sheriff's Journey's End, Peter Egan, Hugh, is more than the success of his stage, more than an unknown cad. Helen and Hughes have an open, separate scene behind the car, where they quoted Brooke's 'The Old Vikings on Grantchester'. He asked the war criminals, "Was it too bad?" He can not answer. He said: "Well, you're back now." But his humblely answered answer ?? "I wonder what sometimes ??" ?? The key to his character. As flashing light and shadows across his face, we know that there is some fear that can not be placed in words. Number of kidnappers, how many of his fellow junior officials suffer? Expect leadership from straight out of school or university and from front ?? Well known. In a dinner party, the local political person in a nervous lecture (through whom Helen reassures him), revealed that he would stand as an independent, and a Liberal (the group that took the country in the war). Her emotional life is damaged as Ledbetter's. He can not easily remove himself from anybody, who is emotionally and financially dependent on him: reading in the line, perhaps he is a child-widow (perhaps a former comrade?) Child, whose paint we see the wall in his house <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The crisis between the three is slowly build, the scary scene of Hellen and ledbetters in the factory, and the lebटर hooks and sounds When he was running them, trying to persuade Hugh kananike that, like the development of his relationship with Helen, but they may continue; He, at least, will continue to support him. Jealousy, emotions and his belief that he must protect Helen from the ledbetter led by a similar gold digger, and must face it fiercely at his house. <br /> <br /> The last novel is completely different, and is good for it: it is dramatic, but has less melodramatic, and maintains an uncertain voice. We start with one letter of recovery from a mental breakdown; We end up with one other trouble. Helen, a sensible, now wise and powerful than both men, who are not able to do so-called so-called "landfill" from the nightmare of the whole war. Opening the new end: One feels that, at least, he will be confused with any cheating. In it, this reflects the reality of the times in which women (Helen, Connie and many others) have broken into a world where many men died or returned home with different degrees of mentality and physical harm. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back now." ?? "I wonder what sometimes ??"
