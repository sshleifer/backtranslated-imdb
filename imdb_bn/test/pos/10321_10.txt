I was small with this first three stoges, and this is my favorite! <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I said, I said, what do I say? Shame is my favorite third stog, I like him more than a colony, but I do the same as the chimpanzee. Sheeng is great, she is funny, she is stupid, she shaped! <br /> <br /> I really like the scene where he left the nickel and went in search of it with the Mau booth and they eventually truncated the wire and really hurt badly! <br /> <br /> But what I thought was scary, when Shamp was shocked against his masked glass, he looked like a distorted professor snap <br /> <br /> Poor shape, he had a lot of this in short Bad events have happened, but this is just the usual three stigmas, many bad events are happening to them! <br /> <br /> Another little thing for fans of these little three stogas must be seen! <br /> <br /> 10/10
