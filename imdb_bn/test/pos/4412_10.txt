A slope of human flesh is asleep on a red pillow. This nude flesh is "Little Joe", New York's Hastler who lives with his biological wife and child. After one day of her life, after the waking up of her wife's sleep, she wakes up to go out and work for a traditional man - a routine. But the person who wants to keep the bread he pays for his new girlfriend's abortion. We are certainly not here in the traditional family unit ... <br /> <br /> After playing with his child, Joe suddenly went on the road to the public. Clients get thick and fast: General gay people who want to meet again because they "work together", the old English scholastic scholar who paid $ 100 to Jose Clothing to look like an ancient Greek athlete; Cruel dancer beaten by Joe Toure, then proud of rape; He and Joe do not think that what they do together is old rabbit queer in the gym. After hard work, Joe returned to his tired home, only his wife and girlfriend were expelled. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, a protagonist with a conflict and a resolution (even very slow one), even a strong motivated mission, and then this day's daily routine I can concentrate in details about which are quite common but extraordinary for themselves. "Mainstream" people It seems all too authentic and natural - the actors are hard to see, their role is entirely complete - but the whole thing is still part of an impressive handicraft - a beautiful painted portrait or a complexly engraved statue. Director Morris carefully invented every event, around the theme of the human body, it is packaged in every competition, but with a shiny little hand that you almost do not see it. Woman "package" Joe's sexual organs, Old English has become a long unanimity of classical beauty, which has created art and poetry from the physical beauty of humans; Stripper's transvestite friends are packaged as "real" female products while reading the Hollywood magazine themselves; Jim Bunny purchases Joe's friendship and affection, thinks artificial porn is true and we can not say, that Joe is doing the closure for his cash and cash. The film itself represents the role of Napoleonic reality of cinematic reality, but how we can behave well here is the primary example of fine art or concept art. <br /> <br /> The talent - the word is not used lightly - Maurice's film was found to find ways to take Warhol's Aunty Prestances, which was interesting but boring to hell, and to make it worth selling products that are the most interesting of the cinema industry Remains in - commercial cans "flash" and "trash" and "hit" a Choose a label - "Andy oyarahola" - gives an overview about the product, which is as much about the product. Yet, as you have withdrawn from Morris's foe, so you spell by his ability to maintain the highest quality and depth. Constants like camera flash, which constantly appear, draws attention to the nature of the film, but you hold on to similar confusion - of course, one of the most extraordinary parts of movie magic is to spell the audience.
