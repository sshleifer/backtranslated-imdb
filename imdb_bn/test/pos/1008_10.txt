This was one of the few Norwegian movies I looked forward to look at. It started as a few advertisements with a motley bunch in football matches. Then they made it a movie. Leads are not professional (and you can see that) but they still work a lot and blew me all over the movie <br /> <br /> Known for making crappy cinemas (no crime) but I had a good feeling about this one. Even if you are not interested in football I wanted to see it 2. The story is much better than expected and the laugh just kept hanging up. There are Kyauos loads from Norwegian celebrities and players. Characters are well illustrated and you feel for them. If you can see Gonna have a Norwegian movie. Let it be this one!
