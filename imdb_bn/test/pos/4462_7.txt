In a small, beautiful Sicilian village, someone is brutally killing young, sexually motivated boys. The local police force was busy looking for the killings and kept the list of five or more main suspects in them, including Jueweep (Vito Passerie) and lady, Vusi, Voodoo doll-boxing backdoes witch, Masiera (Florida Balkan). Also Don Alberto (Mark Pope), a handsome young pastor, local boy's school, Andrea (Tomas Million), a police assistant assistant and a beautiful Patrizia (Barbara BUET), runs a superb but poorly run-driven local boy - The drug addiction seems too much (I mean, very small) for boys. Generally, the plot will not be fully published until the last few frames with Geello Subgen, but if you can stay there sufficiently enough, then close this movie. The script keeps the lowest red fountain (written by Florian, Gianfrenko Clarici and Roberto Jianvivi) and keeps your interest, and the story is supported by excellent location work, Cinematography (Sergio D'Fiji) and Music score (by Reese Adelani)). Acting, especially Balkan, very good. Phuli fans have squeezed milk like Bind and Jambwei in the 80 second recurroes, they can not expect to see more artifacts and less Gore here, but they will still enjoy a special sticky chain strap scene in a graveyard (maliciously, still functioning, singer Ornella Vannoni's Ballad "Kya Georhi Inceme A") and Phulki liked so much that she Ilma The piesaoyaicika (1977) used it on again. The children's murder scenes are basically placed on the screen (except for a brief collapse), but the camera does not hesitate to settle on their dead bodies. The film was not released in theaters in America, and due to some Catholic anti-Catholic elements in the story, it has only a limited theatrical release in Europe.
