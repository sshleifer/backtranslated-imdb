... I can not believe I was involved in this show, I was deep when I first saw the scene. <br /> <br /> First, everyone is hot, crazy, Ivan, Calvin, Fisher, Capi, Heath, Capi etc. <br /> Secondly, girls are beautiful, sexy, smart and be afraid to be called No I like that. Which at the same time makes their money and greedy, not just realistic. <br /> <br /> The third relationship is so big, especially KC and KPi. Recently, every event goes far away from its main road and people end up with the first person who was not even in the first season. The relationship between Capi and K.C. is a true love, which is permanent. It does not end when they love each other throughout the year and when a guest star appeared. <br /> <br /> Today, two people are incredible to love each other but it can do it for a long time. And college colleges define each other, so I want to stay in college. Just like KC and Cappy <br /> <br /> I hope there are many seasons of this show and hope we can stay firmly in Thanksgiving and they can stay together ... love this show
