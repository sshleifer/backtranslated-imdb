This critique and confused me about their opinion. Most of the time before I watch a movie, critics say about which movie, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mainly because of the cast. Kevin Speacy and Don Chadle are both the most acclaimed and the best actors in my opinion. And Ryan gosling is a fast escalating ride as well. His reality and humanity which he has spoken in most of his works, believe the true character of the audience and what is happening to him. He is my favorite actor of my generation I've always watched Jane Malone beautiful, since Donny is from the dark, and if he plays the same role, then I do not complain about the hack. <br /> <br /> Back to my point. This movie really moved me. I believe it. Acting was the top class. As one would expect. Actually the movie has left the audience with the ultimate goal of a good movie; Reflections and pondering which ensues after the final credit roll. I think I have to meet again to understand how the film was fascinated by the critics. I know that their review is taken with a pinch of salt. At least I know now.
