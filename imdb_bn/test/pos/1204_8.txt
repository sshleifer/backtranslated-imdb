When I saw this movie I was four years old for the first time. I love it about it and remember everything. After 13 years, I was 17 years old, and decided to see it about a month ago because I was studying in the school in the 1960's. I do not know exactly what I can expect, since I saw it 13 years later, but I was completely blown away by it. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and now I can sing with every song myself. Williams is bigger than a known berger, "leader" of the Hippie group, who always achieves what he wants, one way or the other (of course, of course, of course, of course). John Savage is a very strong believer in the cloud, Oklahoma Duffrey who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is beautiful as a premier and perfect rich girl, who, eventually, rebels against her rape and joins the Hippie. Other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dakas, and Dorshe Wright. Annie Golden just as Jenny, pregnant girl but still adorable as cute and innocent as a child. Dawn Dakas and two other members of the Right Group in Dorsey are well-off and hood, and Charm Barnes, who plays Hood's motherhood, have astonishing voices. <br /> <br /> My only problem in this movie, the relationship between Cloud and Sheela is not very convincing. They are sometimes shown together, and when they do, they fight (remember skinny dipping scene?). It seems that their relationship is very weak, and at the end of the film we believe they are crazy in love, only on some of their meetings. I also see that many people writing reviews here are annoyed by the movie's PG rating. I can personally increase the rating up to PG-13 because some drugs are used ... But in 1979, remember that PG-13 did not exist. I do not think nudity is bad, it is not sex in any way (actually, there is no sexuality in this movie), and it is only to show innocent innocent children. In most European countries, nudity is not considered to be bad, and why I can not see it here in the United States. However, I give this movie a high rating and I am glad that it was rebuilt, because in today's "open" political world, they could not even think of creating it and even if they did it would be a very "watered down" version And I'm sure that you will not get full effect. At the conclusion, it is a very underlying film that must be checked out.
