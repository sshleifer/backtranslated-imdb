Chaplin's most famous film is its full-length feature. And, I think most people watched some of their pre-feature days clips when they starred in dozens and comedy shorts. It's really embarrassing, because some wonderful shorts are waiting a lot for the discovery of the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If anyone sees this film, it will be a nice opportunity to see more good shades of Chaplin. Because Chaplin chose these three shorts and together with some details to create this 1959 feature film. This is great for various reasons. First, since Chaplin's first film since 1914-1915, his character of Little Trump is still in his or her first incarnation, or absolutely absent. Plus, even when he was there, he was often self-confident and self-centered - we were very upset from the Little Trump. Secondly, the shorts that were selected were in great condition, if you see this movie, you do not have to worry about having to worry about empty pictures and hate music, which does not fit the process (a common problem). <Br> <br /> So, to see their great looks in Chaplin's short shirts, give this movie a chance. It is sure to provide you some nice smile.
