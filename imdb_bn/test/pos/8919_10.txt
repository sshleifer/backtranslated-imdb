This is really an Australian religious classic. If you have seen one of those lucky - then you are very lucky. It is released in most countries, but for some reason in Australia it is not. I have a copy of the DVD from the UK. Not a great transfer, but I bought it, saw it before a film festival. Guide spot and performance are rock! This dark film is scary film, but often part, very fun part. I'm requesting you to watch this movie, it's a coolness that you do not usually see 99% of Australian fare. The screenplay is made very well and you are sent to travel where you know it will end badly, but for the last ten minutes, you can not choose how badly. Great work from four leads, especially Lachi Hulam. <br /> <br /> When it's all said and works: great work in the display!
