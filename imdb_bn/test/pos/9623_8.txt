"Death of Five Birds", Kung Fu Classic Classic of 70 As for the film "broken" on Hk cinema in the West, it must be seen for a serious fan of this genre. It's a great entertainment film, hard-hitting, non-stop action, tough and most believable war dancers and dubbing at the top of the 70's ("Oh, I see ... so you want it a great way !! HWAA !!"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers" is an eye-opener revenge story ... and I literally mean eyes for eyes! Lo Leyah is very good to portray a hero. After that, he had played such a wonderful villain in his career - including the pi moi in the classic fixtures of white head, which was used to create the mother of Tarantino's Kill Bill. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that I wish I had a good quality DVD - it looks like a VHS transfer mine. Overall it's a great movie - do not miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, CA.
