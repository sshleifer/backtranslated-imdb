Although not declared as a murder, it was not only pleasant but almost exceeds the book, it's a nice adaptation. And you know, it's a huge improvement in the version of Geraldine McEwan. I do not feel proud because of Geraldine McQueen adaptations bad, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well, but a bad script, a confusing final solution, or both were destroyed. Geraldine McAnain Edition suffered from a plodding pace, and above both problems, and I would consider the second worst of the adoption of the ITV, the worst of Sittaford mystery, which turned even shameless and confusing to its own qualifications. This adaptation of the Namesis book is a huge improvement, it does not honor the book despite some freedom, but it corrects many of the issues of the ITV version. Despite Lionel's additional character being teased, how he was compared to how he acted, and uninterrupted pansing one or two more moments, it is firm as an adaptation of a decent book. Beautifully illustrated with beautiful photography and timelines detail, and the music is always nice. At this time, the performance is quite surprising, and most of the commonly completed scripts are made; Joan Hickson is always brilliant like Miss Maple and the firm of Leisure Fraser, Helen Cherry, Jonah Hull and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is a cool and moving performance as Clathield though outstanding. Overall, pretty good is better than the recent edition of all sections, good value of watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
