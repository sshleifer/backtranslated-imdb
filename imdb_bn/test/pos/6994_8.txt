Pitch is a wonderful good movie in black. I did not have a fan of Van Diesel when I saw the pitch black, but the pitch black saw my respect for the vin diesel increased. He used to play a man Reddick for many killings. His character was cold and surprised me a lot, which made me wonder, eventually leaving the Reddick to go to the ship and left his ass behind death. I loved this movie and how police deals with human tendency. This film is in a low budget, but this movie shows that you do not have enough money to make a great special impact and a good film, I think all the characters have made this movie. I give 8 out of 10 movies;)
