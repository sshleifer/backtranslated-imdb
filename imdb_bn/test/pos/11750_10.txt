I am again sitting in this picture and only wonder if you can see the kind of movie choices? Humble music, William Holden and Jennifer Jones's humble voice are crying this old man with a lovely, romantic scene, and I'm not the one who is often crying in life. Where are we going to William Holden and they have to do this moving, wonderful, movie? It is tragic to realize that they probably will not think about it, just try to block it out of your mind. Yet, there will be no hold in them and he will not appear only once on that hill. You can only enjoy this movie and see it again.
