When I was young, I met the end of the hair. I just saw the last 5 minutes of the film. And I was really impressed by it. I got a hammer pump and I told myself that I would like to see this picture. <br /> <br /> And I did, and say: This picture is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message ... the message of this movie is one of the most important things: "Love, no fight". This film is a real masterpiece. Meanwhile, this is my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I heard the last song is the most tragic and happy. I could feel myself joining the crowd almost. All I have to say is: "Brighten the sun and shine the sun"
