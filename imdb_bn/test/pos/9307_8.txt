We saw this movie in my chemistry class, so it was probably an educational value. I thought the film has done a really good job in connection with Manhattan's science, moral problems, and personal experience, but it was not entirely attentive to play it firmly. I would recommend this film for scientific interest or for people interested in Fat Man and Little Age moral issues, but if the subject of nuclear bomb inspires you, you will not see it.
