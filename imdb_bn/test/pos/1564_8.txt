A great performance by Emily Grace! While storing my satellite list, I stubbed this movie and expressed interest in the plot summary provided by my satellite service provider. Acting by Emily Grace I had high amusement and had many condolences for the character "Elise". The story guessed what would happen to Elise and was not predictable. The overall story was some great twists in refreshing and supporting characters. The end of the story is rather a fair way to end. I will buy this DVD to add to my library. I'm a new fan of Emily Grace and I look forward to seeing more from her performance.
