I found, too, "Oppenheimer", an excellent series, and one of America's best gifts of PBS. David Sauce was particularly effective like Edward Teller, I think, and the overall idea was spectacularly good. The only reason that the series does not give a complete 10/10 rate is the production budget for low budget in some areas. The real content is the first rate in my memorabilia. <br /> <br /> Oppenheimer Minniari will be released in the United States on July 31! It will be set to a Region 2 / Pallet, but it seems that a Zone 1 / NTSC set should soon be closed. <br /> <br /> If you have public players in the US, you can order Amazon series from the United Kingdom now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> !!
