Adam (Eric Jungman) and the overwhelmingly best friend Harley (Justin Eurech) is running a cross-country marriage As well as they choose sexy hits hero Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Then, for any reason, a giant truck keeps trying to run them off the road ... and probably killing them. Who is doing this and why? <br /> <br /> Beautiful horror movie. His energetic and dazzling direction is full in which you get right into action. This is a horror comedy. Humor is mostly infantile and really fair but actually somewhat funny. Also this movie really piles on Gore - but that's a good thing! Acting is okay - Jungman shows his dire role a bit; Urich is stuck on the helpless role of fool-fat, sex-passionate best friends - but it closes; Brooks is very good at very limited role. <br /> <br /> I'm ending long before the "twist" is over and ultimately the logic disappears completely (especially the rescue). Yet, it's a minor, sometimes fun and never scary horror movie. I give it a 7.
