This is the best thing I have ever seen on television. The story is mandatory - because all this is more true. The authors have done their homework - the accuracy of the facts is well documented. Acting is great. This Sam Waterstar would never have been the best role. And black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago, I contacted anyone involved in the production (PBS or England) and said they had no plans to release it on VHS (it). This is a BBC production and the US Playhouse ran in the United States. It has interest to see - it is difficult to believe it can not be made available to anyone.
