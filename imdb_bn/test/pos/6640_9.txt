It's a frozen one, which I saw as the most deadly of Bergman's movies. I think it is one of the most powerful films of war for its evil and human spirit. <br /> <br /> Some musicians who left a big city for a remote island, living as a farmer, could make themselves unworthy and shameful, which was generally impossible for them, even struggling to survive the terrible reality of war. They betray their spirits, their friends, and even a great effort to survive each other. Liv Woolman and Max von Sido are caught in the middle of a civil war, confused, and bright as normal as a couple. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
