In World War II, a badly harmed hunger known as "English Patient" was found in the African desert and moved to Italy, where he joined a confection of medical forces and others in a abandoned monastery. Among them, Hana (Juliet Binouch), a Canadian nurse whose lover usually meets the unpleasant edge; Kip (Newenne Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Hattley), two explosive experts who searched for monkeys for bombs; And David Curvagio (Willem Duffo), a Canadian soldier-fate who knows the identity of the English patient and has settled. <br /> <br /> Through the flashbacks we learn the story of the patient: she is Lajo Almasi (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who works in the late 30's with British artists like Joprey Clifton (Colin Firth) and her wife Catherine (Christian Scott-Thomas) Read with a group of cartographers, while mapping the desert to North Africa. After Clifton released them after public business, Kathryn and Clifton loved each other in the desert, which naturally ended, happier than them. <br /> <br /> If anyone is able to ignore the miracle parts of the story line (like why a patient found in Africa will be sent to the original line of war in Italy?), then you can appreciate the "English patient" in the face of intelligent, layered, The sweeping epic of David Lan's' 60s. The film "Doctor Jivgago" and "Gone with the Win" - a lot more than "Titanic" or late other epic romance, is set in mind - an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop. You can not expect a war film, though it is usually seen in the violence (if all in a little too short) in the scene of romantic divisions, but this is usually the case (especially with the question of a rogue SS officer in Karvazione (Jurgen Prokno)) <br /> < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Critics of the film want to say quickly, Almasi is very patronized with far-reaching characters - her marriage relates to a married woman and believes in her country by providing maps and intelligence to the Germans. His friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and Karvagiye's torture, and actually killed a British soldier, who arrested him at one point. Alamasi is the same as the one who suffers in many ways - She loves Catherine and is loyal to the world that she sees the earth narrowly (or any other subject) in terms of her love; Almasi says, "He is going to hate." Two are rather involved in brave love (Shahbag in hundreds of people's ear shots in Christmas party) and it is clear that Kathryn has made the mysterious, exciting almas more attractant than comparatively annoying geophrey. <br /> <br /> The 1944 subclot seems somewhat frustrating and impossible; Romance is never believable in Kip and Hannah, and I think it is possible without the film. But these sequences add an interesting piece of mystery and complexity to the film, so I will not accuse too much. <br /> <br /> Like the epic above mentioned, the film is easily capable of publishing time and space easily, such as a crowd scene, a strategically posted poster, and a military presence device. We do not need to live in Cairo in 1938, but it is helpful to tell. Anthony Mingilla and desert painting by John Seill are absolutely fantastic; Sand smoke, sand storm, and the scary cave of the desert are captured in beautiful details. Gabriel Yard score hunting and atmospheric <br /> <br /> Playing is usually difficult. Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious, complex, and spooky. The difference between Almasasis of 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; An exciting and somewhat unexpected, other spectacular and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas Catherine as effective, female explorer is looking for courage, and Colin Firth gave her one of her best performances as Joefrey, who initially realized that she did not compete for the exciting almighty. Works well as Willem Dafoe Caravaggio, the camouflage-driven spy victim powered by camouflage, revenge. Jurgen Prokopo has given a memorable performance to Jose Ferrer in "Lawrence of Arabia" (and similar character): Very brief, but then some memorable characters. Some of 1944's actors are ineffective: Juliet Béchéte is nothing special, but Novian Andrews is good but unreliable. As Kevin Hetley, the unfortunate partner of Cape, he can do much rather small role. <br /> <br /> "English Patient" is not a perfect movie in any way, but it does not deserve all the popular public going on to a large number of offensive attack movies. Perhaps it was a show of how the sensitivity of the film has changed from the era of the Lions and the Kubrick era, or maybe the people were expecting some simple understanding. The complex is blamed, brilliantly operated and shot, "English Patient" is a wonderful modern-day epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
