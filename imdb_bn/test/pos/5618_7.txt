I think Samuel Goldwin is trying to accomplish two things in this film. The first film is a tribute to Jassa Hefetz, which is considered the best violator of the last century. Secondly, the children of death brought the same title to their screen on the screen and signed them with Warner Brothers, who are trying to create the second gang of Apurin Apchin. <br /> <br /> Although the film was good, there was no claim of rebuilding for this film's other children. <br /> <br /> The gang leader Jean Reynolds, who once played violin, but now leads the street gang to the street. Her parents, Arthur Hohl, broke her violin with her father's father, Reinalds, and threatened her for reforming the school in her mother's poor protest <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Reynolds is running a music school running the old music mesro, Walter Brevin and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They take him, but they have financial problems with many traders led by their Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This picture is mostly seen because it is an opportunity to watch classical music lovers and listen to jocos. The way you gather in hefettes is to solve the problem of one or the other. Joel McCracky is also in the film, but Andrea Leeds has a colorful piece rather than a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Except hefetches, the film is a touching touch that touches children's abuse and brilliant husbands. Arthur Hohl is an average man and Muzzy Moin is very definitely very deadly wife. <br /> <br /> Cast kids work well, a young girl named Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and Jacklin Nash, who grew up and Nelson Eddie became the nightclub partner Sherrwood went on. She was even a beautiful Soprano as a child. <br /> <br /> But you see the show for Heifetz.
