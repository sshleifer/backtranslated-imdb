I want to say that I did not want to be good in this movie. Generally, 90% of the movies in the movie present the Communist past. However, the film exceeds the Romanian movie to be eligible for more advertising. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> > This "crash" of Eastern Europe dragged me into live film at every moment. I even felt the desire to come from me, after seeing it, the desire for freeness. See it! <br /> <br />! You must enjoy it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
