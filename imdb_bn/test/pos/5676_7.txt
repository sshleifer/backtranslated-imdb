When I read the tomb - 3 people lost in the wild fight against huge chickens - I was not exactly drawn. It seemed like a terrible form of a bunch of ordinary people in a genie-stained film - except for this, there are only three of them, so we would not be happy to see them pick one by one. <br /> <br /> I saw it (can not sleep and do nothing else) and it turns out to be much better than expected. Acting is great, and you get the rare sense that the atmosphere is really a low budget winner. <br /> <br /> It should be Horn. Make the first rate film. It's not perfect but it's a good price to see. I give it a 7.
