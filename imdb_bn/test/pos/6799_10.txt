This is a beautiful movie. The scenes are well illustrated. Anne Reveyor's dialogues are really good writing and inspirational, the philosophy and ideas that this movie gives and what makes it great and surprising. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is awesome in the film and her role has improved greatly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Follow him and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a very nice film and must watch for family and children for a evergreen Christmas favorite.
