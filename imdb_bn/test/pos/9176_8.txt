'Hits' is a wonderful surprise: romantic comedy, which is actually romance and comedy. For me most romantic comedy extends from medium to horrible because they are not fun or romantic. The hit has acted as a fun, light-a-fee-trip traveler like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes, who actually laughs me and yes, a little, "how cool!" <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), Ur Hit. He is a self-proclaimed 'date doctor'; He helps the optimistic boys like Albert (Kevin James) win like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hit has to deal with Sarah (Eve Mendes), a Gossip columnist doctor broke down ... <br /> <br /> 'Hit' is really funny, and it works even in the Stapstick scene. Just because the cast is so energetic and clearly fun. I would be surprised why Will Smith did not make more movies like this. His sharp, fast-fire delivery is perfect for this style, and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a real discovery; I have never seen his show 'Queens of King', but he is funny and hearty, and he once again proved that a thick white male can not dance hip-hop (Smith's reactions are pleasurable for his pleasure). Mendes is hot and jerky (not the memory, Gij) Smith as the perfect match, and Amber is as sweet as Valletta Allegra. <br /> <br /> 'Hit' is not perfect; This is a tad very long, and things are very close to the end "dramatic" (though it is free by the happy ending of fun dances). But it's a great refresher of cookie-cut romantic comedy that keeps the theaters cool.
