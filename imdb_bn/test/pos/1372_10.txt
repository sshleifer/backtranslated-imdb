I acknowledge that I know something involved, I'm Planet, Evil Open, was a pioneer before, but it was more than 10 years ago and I lost contact with them. I saw a piece of BBC Scotland news and Scottish movie, mentioned it and showed the clips from The Planet and its director Mark Steitner commented, it requested me to order a copy of the DVD. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It is very strange to see a movie spoken by my native North East Scotland, but the pass is quickly passed. <br /> <br /> ^ Light spools <br /> <br /> The Planet brings up a number of science-physical classics; Star Wars, Alien, Peach Black, Forbidden Planet and Predator, some merchants from a deep space transport ship survived their unknown ships were attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, they escaped from a deserted desert, one after another, they were killed invisible. By the attackers, the ship is just a passenger, a mysterious prisoner also makes it a planet, the crucifixion Mean fighting a battle was fought. Surely it hides a limited budget, well done with Mark, Mike and everyone involved, I look forward to your next job.
