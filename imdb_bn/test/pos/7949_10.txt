I was lucky to see this movie at the recently concluded International Film Festival. I was actually able to see another South Korean film (the power of Kongwan province), but in August, Christmas raised more of my attention. The story is simple, ordinary boy and girl (or we say the daughter-girl's son?). It makes me specially how it is rendered. We can say that the film was calm and respectful. We do not have shiny and transformed romance here, only two common people wonder about their friendship and unexpected love for each other. I liked the film as a picture of past and present relationship. I wish that it has been shown here as regular film. I'm sure that it will call a larger audience.
