I saw this flick on Saturday afternoon. Man, it was the pull. I got the metaphor, symbol, and all the elements that are. No, I do not care about one way or another about the sex of characters. But, the passings and scripting of the story almost made me sleepy. <br /> <br /> Until Ruth Marshal became nude. If you are a breed-a person who is not homo-phobic, you can rent it. Ruth is a gay sex scene which is quite hot, and then a hetero sex scene which is higher than the maximum map rental. Her Jagagly De-Kapas made the film for the price of the watch. <br /> <br /> - Lord Avatar
