The questions and answers of the human soul are here in this beautifully created historical documentary. Sheer beauty and horror of one mind walk through life, is published as a whole. Dieters and ovaries combine and are associated with a mental deviation that has become a straightforward Sylat, which is plastered with images painted by one of his personalities by the vibrations of his own voices. The 80-minute film has discovered a new dimension of the story. What I call this apparently new sense Only God knows that God is not such a miracle for us, but he likes to remain undeserved. <br /> <br /> This is necessary to see. If you want to experience the awesome horrors of war, this documentary will cleanse your soul.
