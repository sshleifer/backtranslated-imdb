For some unreasonable reasons, Jerry's films often seem to come from the quarter to directors, although they rarely have box office disappointments. It's a great mystery in my life because its films always have their 'feel good' factor for me. But this picture is not just bad: it's a very good and cute comedy. Those who can be screamed by the 'modern' filthy or cruel humor, do not see this movie: There is nothing like that and you are wasting your time. <br /> <br /> I simply watched this movie once in the movie. I've been waiting to see it again and that has been several years. Do you think a proud Millionaire businessman would not bother you with his own small private army to win the war against the Nazis? Well Jerry Lewis will dare to try out such a plot for a comedy and out and it works, I'm saying, brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I think that, 'Nunee Professor' and most of her other films, both her film concept and execution, her comic talent testimony. I think body love might say, "You know, the true comedy can not only create six-year-old cruelty, it will also do for his father." Perhaps some of the dramatic Nazi generals and one Lipp General will dislike this picture. If you only see one more comedy in your life then see it. Be careful, though you can laugh. And I'm not kidding!
