I do not have the vision of the cable and no longer "DirecTV". So to be a rural citizen, I have to wait for the DVD release. Blondes is not a lover but Blonds, I of course certainly have "Barb Wire", but I have "Stripperella: First Season First". I still could not find "VIP" or second season for stripripella. I have a DVD of "Hawaiian Hawaiian Wedding". My problem with "Playboy" is that Pamela Dennis Anderson has been able to afford. I could go. I love Pamela! I could feel guilty about enjoying Stripperella that there is no one or nothing. But there are some elements that I dislike, but with them, other series may also show smoking and alcohol in some cases. But for those who are my personal peeves and I try not to waste the fun of a series like this for them. I was very surprised by the change of animation style, but I adapted. However, the nudity of women has diminished, and it is a big disappointment because it is expected of a series of premises to have many expectations. But then again I adapted. While visiting Robert Williams, there was one of my favorite episodes of "Mork and Mindy"! So of course one of my favorite episodes of "Strepeela" is when visiting Pamela and Tommy Club and the comparison starts! If there is really a "season 2" then I hope that I can find it, completely, my collection has to be completed. I suggest this for other forms of female form and blondes lovers. (Hey! Psst! "Blond" and "blondes" feminine look for "blond"! Your software should already know!)
