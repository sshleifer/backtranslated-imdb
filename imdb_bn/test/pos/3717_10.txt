Remember that this Gulf came before the war, which gave us the "dark lessons" of Warner Harrison. <br /> <br /> Le Dollar's Combat is not "Sci Fi". It's more like trial. I saw it at least a dozen times. It is actually a suitable partner with Harjog's "dark lessons": "And at that time men will want death, but they will not find it, because death will flee from them." <br /> <br /> On that day, today, in Iraq today can be. <br /> <br /> Return to Le Darin's Combat, do not forget to look at the second end of the film. I do not call it a "wonderful ending", but if you already guess that you will not guess what would be anything more than if you missed it.
