There is a little friend of Tromoh (Will Qianan), a poor surviving street in New York City, but what they did is tattoo, drift and always got a party. She falls for Juliet (Jane Jensen), a pretty rich girl, whom her father seems to be a very humiliating boy, because she knows how our character characters get together and fall for one another. Theirs. Unfortunately, their parents are with each other, Juliet's father wants to go to Tromso's Babi Movie Studio, but really love to win them all and stop the debate? <br /> <br /> Wonderful and great horror comedy is a wonderful modern day with tragedy, tragic, ridiculous people, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews for it, a dark humorous legend of the legendary story that started this, some good smiles, piercing, graphic violence and burning fire like a cow burned. For me this is the second trimester of the second trimester of immortal "Poisonous Avenger" and "Tromas War". Yes, the acting might be somewhat bad like some tromba flickr, but the above elements make it for it and it must be seen in a movie if you like the horror comedy, Peter Jackson, and Tromba or you want to see a ridiculous version of a favorite story, but BTW The Tikiq Avenger and SGT look for some fun presentations.
