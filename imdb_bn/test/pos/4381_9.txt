It started weird, the middle was weird, and the last was weird, but I really liked it, really. Homer is a modern day version of Odyssey, but it's really irrelevant. Interesting stories and welding. Clooney was very good and I congratulate him for taking such an evolutionary role - so that he did something different or never again. A lot of surprising stars - why not more than Hunter Hunter. Do something different tonight and see this really different and unexpected flick.
