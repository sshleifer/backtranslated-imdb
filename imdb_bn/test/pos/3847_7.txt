Walt Disney's 20th animated feature was deer by the great man himself (who died late in 1966) and is generally not considered as the best output. The main problem is that, on the page, the film appears to be only the original version of Lady and the Tramp (1955) or 101 Dementes (1961), both of which are certainly more favorite by fans, both of which are an animation and cat lover, I am this reasonably enthusiastic concordance In which a screwed female cat (voice by Eva Gabo) and one of his three little children is rich Ila (Hermione badadele) are thrown into the streets of Paris by Butler's greedy. Fortunately, they meet the street cat on the street (Phil Harris), which leads them on their journey, and goes on the way through the strayed jazz band (under the leadership of Scatman Crotha) and two helpful and rich dopey dogs. Meanwhile, Edgar Butler will celebrate his supposed heritage and do their bits to help the mouse and horse pet their pets. Legendary entertainer Maurice Cavallier's title song (which contains a verse in French), and Scamman's band came back from retiring to sing a song song "Eribidi Wits to Be B Bit".
