Net is a great movie! It's a computer expert working for the Cathedral Company, cleaning viruses and testing games for clients, in Angela Bennett (a wonderful performance by Sandra Bullock). Angela is a common nerd that does not have friends outside of cyberspace, does not take out holidays and goes out and is connected almost all the time. One day his friend Dale Hesman (Rey McKinnon) asked him to help, sending Angel to a disc with a weird program that contains many confidential information. The same night, when Dell was going to meet him, he suddenly died on a plane crash. Going to Mexico on her holiday, Angela has met with a beautiful man named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam), who is a cold blood killer <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it shows how we depend on people, many computers and machines (sometimes we can do) And some time if we become weak, someone decides to control and change our personal records, without the scope of proof to prove us.
