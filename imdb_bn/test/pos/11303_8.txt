Well that's a Barbie movie for once. I'm 18 years old and embarrassed to say this but I'm hooked on this movie. When I was young I hated Barbie but the films I love. Shiva is so beautiful and I fell in love with her. She is so cute as the pole beer and completely in love with Aiden. Oh people I'm in love with shiver. I do not give up hope and accidentally love Annika's determination not working on it. I love this movie and hope they will be well others. Other bright movies in Barbie and Tone Lake. I recommend this movie to all ages (even boys) because the movie is good and I'm so difficult to please. Magic of Barbie and Pagasas is a diverse that exciting and exciting.
