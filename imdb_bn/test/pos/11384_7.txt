Most of the three names in this movie are Bart Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julian Moore. These three provide powerful performance, but the whole throw makes an excellent job. Although the film does not allow itself to be exposed to pornography itself. Although it is important to understand the lifestyle of many scenes and characters involved in the use of drugs on the other hand, I think there was some overkill in this section. Paul Thomas Anderson did not direct most of the directives, but was chosen for the film based on his 1988 work "The Dirk Dingler Story". One thing that was brilliantly illustrated is the atmosphere like families, as they work, live and party together. Although usually a common family they do not seem to care for each other. Wonderful soundtrack helps to give you a feeling during a time when the discos were really angry. It has many disco favorites and some other nice songs. <br /> <br /> This story is about a gifted young man called Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) who is invited to pornography. He changed his name to Dirk Diggler and turned almost overnight and starred in the adult movie star. Jack Horner (Reynolds) director who took his films very seriously because he believed that his work was more than just pornography, but it was a real art. However, Dirk became very dependent on the medicines and soon bowed down under the dangerous road, where he was all empty. Although there is a greater focus on character Dirk, other characters and life have subplots for their trials. Hope you improve your will and your situation. All in all all work well on a film.
