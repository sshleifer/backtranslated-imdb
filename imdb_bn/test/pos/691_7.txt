If you are in the middle of a deadly battle and it is still not clear that you will come to the top, but the issues that will concern you are to maintain the morale of the citizens ... that our soldiers overcome all the odds between a brave, wealthy and dedicated cause of a great cause. And this is the director Anthony Asheth during the war of 1943. After more than 60 years, some dates of the movie are not amazed. It does not help in classification that helps define the list of men listed from the officials. Here, many other British fighting films, such as men, always have the pronunciation of thick regional working class, but officials speak with literate fluency which they keep at home in the best governing body of England. In this movie, the submarine Sea Tiger captain Freddy Taylor (John Mills) is cute, confident, wealthy, aggressive, under control, better with his men, ridiculous with his colleagues, quickly to decide. And it's that he helps lucky. Most of his men, capable of their jobs and things are always ready, colorful tars with an interesting situation. Although we spend the first third of the movie to tell these people while on vacation, those issues are fast intensified. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his sub ordered to destroy Brandenburg, the new German warfare. They boarded the ship in the canal and missed the ship while moving to the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and the Sea Tiger will decide after it, with the real risk of not getting enough fuel to return to the mine field, anti-sub networks and return to the home base. After various exciting situations, the clash took place. Sea Tiger lays down six torpedoes, but it does not know whether it would finish its work. After a cute missile, Taylor Outfoxes a couple of German destroyers but then there is not enough fuel to understand. When he planned to surrender and surrender his submarine, just at the last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), who was a Sumon and a Lonar and spoke German, said, a small Danish coastal village, which was a fuel, depot. He seems to be still for the Germans. The last third of this film is the sequence of growing steps as a sub-attempt to prevent the Germans from supplying enough fuel to the Sea Tigers to return to Britain. This is a wartime campaign movie, so do not expect failure. And did the sea tiger really put Brandenburg down? Do men meet with their wives and lovers? Did Hobson meet with his wife and little boy who gave him a smile once? Did Freddy Taylor finally get the chance to use all the women's names in her small black book? You will see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are promotional war movies and campaign war movies. Some, like Powell and Pressbars of One Attack of the Aircaster, have lost and the 49th parallel still stands to watch because the stories are difficult and unexpected, and the manufacturers do not use clear-cut shortcut clich√©s. Others were made to Don in Don on Dive enough when we see how terrible it was when we were making the film. Nevertheless, Ashtith can even create many mysteries with some clinches. Sea tigers make their way through the sub-net. The plans necessary for the occupation of Brandenburg and the torpedoes were realistic; He was ready to attack with the aggressive attitude of John Mills. False-out preparations, such as destruction of sea tigers, are realistic, bust and beyond, as you can expect, and the war of fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. Don A. Dive is not a classic war film, but it's a good, well-liked example of its type and time. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mills, it was valuable, long, long career. Especially in fifty years, he looked at WWII day and starred in several serious images. He achieved the quality of being serious, joyful and steadfast, but because of being faithful a man could be proud of the war against England. The film was topped by Eric Portman, a superb actor with a unique voice and the ability to give you cold strikes for you to keep sweaters. Each of the subcontinent has a lot of fun but strict-high-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman worked fine together in this movie.
