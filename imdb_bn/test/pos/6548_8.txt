After the ring trilogy was discovered, I greedily embraced all other Japanese and Korean films that are following or following bandwagon. I do not have a simple definition of panic, but this film definitely pushed some of my buttons, although I can not claim that this movie makes many meaningful. I did Skymish so I did not want to see what was happening on the screen, when there were many points in the film. The picture has stabbed me, so I was scared to see the things I saw. <br /> <br /> This is an imaginative film that apparently proposes a great deal. It provides food for thought. And when the film ends, there is a lot of content for the debate. <br /> <br /> Characters Define well at least say. Can they make such films in the West? <br /> <br /> So it can not be understood at the end, but when one is secret, supernatural, malicious, one is not able to explain the final interpretation of the film.
