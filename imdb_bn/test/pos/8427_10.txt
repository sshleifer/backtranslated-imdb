Finally I got a version that I like! Ana does not look like a school servant in this version, just a very thin, old, beautiful woman, as described in the book. Captain Weintworth does not seem to be over 50, nor does he constantly see anger, as described in the book, because he is not as old as Anne and is quite handsome. And they play their part with such promises and realities ... that's all about acting. They were trustworthy. They created real characters, and the letters of the book were life-styles. If you have not seen this version, then I request you to look for it, order or book a request from the bookstore or library for it. It is worth the price and waiting price. <br /> <br /> I saw the 1995 version, and saw the 2007 version and it's the tower over the other two. Why it is not rated higher outside of my understanding The book expresses the tender of their relationship and the film revolves around the book.
