Amalia Rodricks' song pain and almost helpless distressed souls are a place that can only stir up the music. The presence of his voice and witchcraft, the fierce torment of Fado, an art form that I was surprised to see in this movie. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this beautifully and lovingly documented filmmaker, in which the filmmaker opposes the temptation of editorialization, and only allows this icon to share the magnetism and elegant emotions. There is an inevitable correction between Portuguese Fado and American blues. <br /> <br /> Documentary filmmaking, at its best, sends unknown reality to us before. And this glance has been given, we are transformed. <br /> <br /> Aggression, Level Almeida
