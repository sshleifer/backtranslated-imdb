John reprises his role as a neurotic man between two and a half men, which he perfected in this series. She has a good relationship with a girl like her colleague, and tet-a-tet between her and her partner's best friend is quite funny. Then they realized that they were attracted to each other and started dating. The most interesting lines on TV - I think in the final episode - he and his partner are discussing that he wants to offer to the girl. <br /> <br /> His partner prepared him at this time and said: "What can be worse? He is not saying." <br /> <br /> Armed with a new hope, he proposed his date of dinner. What he replied, <br /> <br /> "God, no!" <br /> <br /> I cried a lot and I cried.
