Everyone told me that this movie is not neutral, sick, etc. So I finally hired it and I was surprised. I thought the torture would be very bad, but at the end it suddenly fluttered, but that was the case. I think it's a horror movie, probably not something under mysteries or kisses of lambs and / or girls kissing. It sometimes gets stupid, but the rest of the film keeps me on the edge of my seat. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R - For strong persecution, violence, language and sexuality
