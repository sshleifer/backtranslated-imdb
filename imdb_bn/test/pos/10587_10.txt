I was waiting to see this movie so long and finally came yesterday. In short I'm finally what I'm happy about. The laughter wall is sunny off. The plot is incredibly believable that at least some of it must be true. If there is anything on this movie, it must be in the coffee shop scene. I have to have every guy there. You dump You are sure that your fools have been fooled by some of your ex-people, which you are sure to do. Now when you see something for the next few days, you will get terrible thoughts in all these wrong areas. She is screwing everyone and everyone knows it. I could probably chuckle that person and see his bathroom all day and look back at myself and smile to stay there.
