This is amazing because it shows how many movies have been developed in the 7 years and how the changes were slow in the next 20 years.

Tyrone is the leading man in power creator caravan, he is a rough and average man.

Raoul Walsh was a master on moving caravans and cattle in the West, he directed 'The Tall Man' in 1955, which is very common with the 'Big Trill'.
