There is something about the true story that makes them much more interesting than fiction. I suppose it is true that truth is unfamiliar than always fiction. Falcon and Snowman Christopher Boyce and his friend tells true story about Dlton Lee. Boy (Houghton) is a former boy and intellectual, trying to find a job that can support him and give him entertainment. His FBI father was able to pull some strings and his idealistic son could get a job to work in the Defense Department. There are some responsibilities in the age and he feels optimistic drinking and spying with his colleagues. However, when the time has passed, he begins to learn the top secret information in the age that allows him to doubt the morality of his government. Idealists see the illegal activities that take place in Australia at all times in the CIA. The boy finally decided that he kept secret secret information that he would run out of KGB. Of course, there is a misconception of age that America is doing bad work, the USSR is a good person. Over time, the boy and his drug-dealing friend Li (Pen) started selling their top secret information to KGB. Idealism was once what was, active in capitalism and espionage. Unbelievable performance by the power of this film Holton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best intentions, they both will soon find a downward spiral of theirs. Great direction, music, everything. Just a great movie, but my favorite one is all the time.
