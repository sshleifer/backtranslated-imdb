Red Circle (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> The most literary meaning of this word can be the best movie ever made. Do not lose control of men here and never - once show their emotions. There is no dramatic explosion in this film. Everyone is quiet all the time. This is an abstract dream-world, where people live by their own codes, outwardly the world is missing a gangster code with values. This nicely illustrated hand singer, Melville American Criminal Offender tackles her definitely dark and secluded style, yet has made a huge budget of ten million dollars and grand fashion with four great French stars at that time. As a master thief, Allen Delan, Ives Monteand as an alcoholic former police, is an escaped criminal in Italian star Zia-Maria Volta and Andrei Borwill plays an irrational role as a terrorist police chief. <br /> <br /> Describes Melville Lee as the last film CERCLE ROUGE and it's really a masterfully stylized police. He claimed that he wanted to shoot a picture silent and he succeeded in many ways. The two main effects of this photo were John Houston's 1950 Houston film The Asphalt Junklele and Rules of Jules Dasin (1955). But unlike these movies, where we learn a lot about the background of individual gang members, cleaning them all, their small needs and anxieties that inspire them, is not simply a ruthless inherent kind, but ordinary people are involved in daily concerns and humanitarian efforts, Do not say much about our criminals. Why was Corey (Allen Dellon) in prison? Why is his partner, Vogel (Jean-Marie Volt) arrested at first place? Or why did the former police marker Jensen (Yevs Montand) release the ball, is it his alcoholic? We do not learn to motivate them behind their actions and find out what these men drive. Women are even more absent than their previous films, "emotional" relationships among men exclusively. They do not seem to be even personal life. In an emotional evening area and although its previous LE Samorai (1967) setting is not abstract, Melville still sketches a very cruel world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Dellon, has perfected and cooled herself coolly. <br /> <br /> For deliberately preferred and for more than 140 minutes, Melville takes time to tell the story, but its speed is a perfect way to show the lonely world of speed and length of these men. Nothing in Melville's films is not found out and here's nothing different, every small detail of important significance for the story is seemingly. Although Le Samurai has maintained my favorite Melville film, even with the greatest movies of all time, it is also very good. <br /> <br /> Camera Oscuro --- 10/10
