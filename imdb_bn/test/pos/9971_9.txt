I saw it in the beautiful Elgin Theater at the Toronto International Film Festival. Beautiful cinematography, I was blown by beautiful cinematography by a very tricky game and last but at least not least, the barbaric performance of Al Pacino, who was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by Jeremy Irons equally powerful performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image discovers themes due to love versus loyalty, law versus justice, and passion. Some may protest that the subject of anti-Semitic origin, but the historical context of the story, and the subtle and different ways that should be considered in this adaptation should be considered. <br /> <br /> 9/10
