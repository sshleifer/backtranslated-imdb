American films beginning in or near 1965 were frustrating and turned around for iconiclastic, which was great for the time - seeds that would gradually create the path of bold and brave dramas. However, the birth of this decade was ruled by his own firm belief for several decades, because most of the films released on this date have been dated. No exception to the cactus floor. Its very title suggests with occasional lapses in a "sunny" romantic comedy recommendation. It does not seem to be a bad thing: On the contrary, movies about quarrels should start somewhere and America is essentially a culture of specific heritage, lying in a profound hypocrisy, when it is shock itself to see the indirect implications of the mores of time. Meanwhile, European films solve this same situation, walk like a million rupees and live for a long time because the hypocrisy we believe is said to be "next" and move forward. <br /> <br /> Tony Simmons (Goldie Haun in his breakout role), a young, warm, warm, high-quality object carrying a new dualist named Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), which promises. She can marry him: she has already married. Instead of marrying her intentionally, Tony decides that she really wants to show his wife and "sets things straight." In the film, his assistant Stephanie Dickinson (a bright Ingrid Bergman returns to American cinema after the absence of twenty years), a woman who works near her age and is married to her. There is a reason for this: She has maintained a calm feeling for Julian, even if she wanted to extend her relationship to her wife, she was unconscious while asking her to keep her wife in front of Tony. And then he closed Tony's innocuous innocent activities unexpectedly and presented Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as Stephanie's "lover". However, Harvey is an old man who has a relationship with a very young woman (Eve Bruce), whom he had lied to in a very interesting scene. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the person we are looking for is always there. What could be the grateful role of Tiger's next-house neighbor Igor Sullivan to Rick Lange, who is the person who looks at the true beauty of his colleague Stefan not only turns the person who protects Tony from the start of his life. It's not your average comedy.) And do not need to say that Elegant Greggman's delicate, lover's illustrations have lost any possibility of love in any way, who is shaking, who is lying for what others say, Always be meant to be real people. I can not imagine anyone else in this quiet but profound role. Movies like <br /> <br /> can be enjoyed by the value of the price and can be seen as escapist fun - a product of its time - or it may be seen as a deep symbol, like its title, it carries it deep inside. This is a tricky film, similarly Haun and Bergman's performance are equally complex because they are not so easy, stupid and woolless, they do not come out and express what they say. Their acting is "not really played" but playing real people, warts and all. Cactus Flowers is a story that can not take itself very seriously but reveals itself as a deep and very human.
