At the age of 19 I saw this movie in the theater. I have a vivid memory in a different end. Completely different but not significant. I saw the movie last night and I was wrong, so I guess that the following can not be called a mockery, because it never happened. The last thing to remember is that the boy was completely hiding in a nude room, Frances Austen found him very easily, and after facing that, he slowly kneeled and went to his camera. It was just his face frame and it was clear that he had let it happen, even though against his will. But nothing like this is shown in the movie. When Cindy Dennis was 32 years old, he made this film, Michael Barnes, at the age of 22, in the film, he complained to his sister that Frances had a big deal about sex. Yes Well, so, go to bed with her dad, and get along with it. WTF?
