One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The performance of Charles Buchinsky (later known as Brunson) is simply outstanding. This is the director's career crown, who often said that it was his best work. The plot has been copied many times, but it was not at the top. Gun maker Wilde J. Moore may be fully submerged in the mid-80's DW3 and then sought to increase its brand. This is not just a film, it is an art that many generations praise and appreciate. Though the film was not fully acclaimed in the United States, it is widely followed in Europe and Asia, where the film is shown at regular film schools and it is popular among filmmakers throughout Europe. All in all, a true classic
