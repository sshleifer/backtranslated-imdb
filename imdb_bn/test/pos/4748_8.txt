I recently got Seven-UP on the video and I certainly had it a very enjoyable movie. Roy Skider and Tony Lo Bianco are as great as police and crane respectively and as a young Richard Lynch Psycho Hennchen Moon. Delayed Bill Hickman is quite good as his partner's bone and you will set up a great car's chase sequence on the edge of your seat. The other three members of the Seven-ups team are very nice, but this is expected. <br /> <br /> I am happy that many people on this site support this movie. I think it should be a film that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed it every minute. The bad scene must face the consequences of his actions, because the final scene in two leads is wonderful. Seven-UPS is not frustrating.
