One of these social dramas is how the WB is involved and in the thirty years guaranteed box office hits. They are mistreated where these primary "dead-end kids" are sent to a renovation school. Cagney, is appointed as a Gangster School Commissioner as a contract. He does not take it seriously first, but he changes and changes the changes needed to improve the lives of the boys. The idea is to govern the boys and their community. Whether or not this sound is beyond my belief in social reform but it's a movie. It's a lot like Boys Boys with a little dark tone. What a deliberate happy end delvees affected the scenes ago but still better. WB will then make this same movie with Cagney / Parent's role with Bagart.
