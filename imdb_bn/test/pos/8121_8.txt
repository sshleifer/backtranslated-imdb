After waiting for a long time, "Bedrooms and Holidays" have been created in Perth cinema - Commercial is not a mind - and I thought it was fun, honest, and took a swipe of those who tried to find meaning in rocks at 'tribal screaming' groups and 'What's behind my eyes' It is playing here in whole rooms because it tells a story, played horror and said something about the human condition.
