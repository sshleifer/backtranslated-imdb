I did not see a film of John Cassettes until two years ago, when I first saw a Chinese book in the Berlin movie, which I think is interesting, to express it diplomatically, but not so special, I wanted to see her work more quickly. Then, I tried - with emphasis on trying - I saw other things, especially Shadow. I must admit, it took me a while to really enjoy this movie. At first Cassavetes in an unclean, raw and crude way it was shot, kept me somewhat and I thought it as an original - absolutely - but faulty and test date. But now, these little imperfections show it very fresh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are three siblings in the African-American family, three of whom Siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) are able to have two light skin and white. Cassavetes claims that the actual group reflects the actual conflict between the group but retains their original name but the film is viewed as opposed to ethnic burden as related to human problems. Cassavetes performed film shots and jagged in ten minutes, a response against 'seamless' Hollywood production standards. Original inspiration of Cassavetes - At least the movie was filmed in the filming style - Praise be praised for Wales's pioneering spirit when Italian was neo-realists. The use of amateur and reform can be something like Italian neo-realist directors, but with his Bobb scores by Charles Minggas, Shafi Hadi, the film is really different, many Americans, really different from any earlier made <br /> <br /> The girls' music, "I feel like a lolly-pop" (or some) like me, just like a light year ago, like ancient history. Although it does not matter how much date it may be, it still creates a delightful time capsule in New York in the early 50's. I think this is the first filmmaker, without a Hollywood film maker, can draw a separate movie, understand and without real budget. Simu Cassell, who played and was involved in Shadows, claimed that it was Zeit Daasin's Naked City (1948) which was the first and inspired all of them, but I think that this American American film makers have opened their eyes. <<br /> camera oscura --- 8/10
