Steamboat Willie (1928) 'is often mistakenly tweeted as the first Mickey Mouse movie, although this title actually goes to' Crazy on the plane (1928) '. The source of encouragement to this common misconception is probably a part of "Simpsons", which in 1928 referred to the source of the Ichchi mouse as 'Steamboat Itchi'. Probably a parody of this cartoon Interestingly, 'Steamboat Willie' itself was a parody, the latest Buster Keaton release, 'Steamboat Bill, Junior. (1928) ', although this connection was expanded slightly more than the title and general story setting. In this Walt Disney short, Mikey Mouse Captain Pit was in charge of the river steamboat for the cats, who kept him gravely beside him. But Mickey is not destroyed. Moving away from the tasty, strong Micky of the very latest generation, this little mouse is only concerned about Nimo Euros, expressing pain and displeasure on a series of farm animals to supply music for their own pleasure. <br /> <br /> The first laughing parrot, which can burn a bucket and a large potato on the head. Then swallowing a goat, it is cranked to give music ("Turkey in Strei") from a guitar swallowed. A cat is swung around by its tail, throatled a throat about the throat, and a little ugly boot. There are some lucrative humor for cartoons of kids' 'Stamboble Wiley' 'directed by Walt Disney and Ub Weaver's, although I've noticed the same elements (though not quite at this stage) like the next few Disney shorts, such as' Gulivar Miki (1934). 'Let's not forget the minnie mouse, of course, who suffers for treatment, for which she can file sexual harassment today! The comedy may be strange and the animation may be even more, but this cartoon provides a bucket of laughter and it is very easy to see why this little farmer movie became one of the most favorite characters in history. If you're a Mickey Mouse, or Disney fan in general, it's a steamboat you can not miss.
