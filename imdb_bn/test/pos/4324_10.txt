After all, I just want to say that I am a huge LOST fan. Everyone who makes the show, I love. It really got everything, really. <br /> <br /> I am glad that their great people are making it, for example Jack Bender is the greatest director, well, maybe J. J. After that. Abrams And of course, full credit to repression Lindell and Carlton cues. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> However, the end of the season 2 is always the best one of LOST !!! Live together, Die goes to Desmond David Hume's story to go to the island alone, and Henry Ian Cusick plays such a character! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> So, people, For the 20th century the Russians are there, and how long have others been with God. The words of Jafri Liber, Lindell and Abram However, I hope we can get the answers we need, in the season 3. Can not wait! Not my vote.
