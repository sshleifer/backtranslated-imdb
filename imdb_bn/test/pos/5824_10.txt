HBO created this show for us to see the most realistic view of the potential prison, and they did a job job. Wage was created by the creator of the killings, who wanted to show a raw version of the prison. This show includes all other Habib core programs such as The Soprans, Sex and the City, The Wire, Orlis, Dedoug, and Six Foot below. Oz is a nickname called Oswald State Pensioner, which has never been called in the United States fictional prison (though pronunciation, crime scene, and ethnic distribution is also known in NY). The unit shows the main jail unit, the Emerald City, which is thought to be the liberal unit manager Tim McManus, who thinks of the relatively ideal prison unit. Overall, this show shows us how it is if someone wants to stay in jail. <br /> <br /> The 10 gangs shown on the oz. Firstly we are Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve the condition of living for blacks everywhere. Under the leadership of Karim, a black militant leader led by him who wants to destroy racist everything about the judicial system. As a group, they are not so white but rather against injustice. Our second group of black houseboy, who is basically black in the street, who wants to keep all bad traits and run a drug business. Their leadership changes mainly because they are always losing members due to violence. In this group, a character character played by Simon Adbyc. AdBC is an African prisoner who is basically the most horrendously evil character living. This gang is fully supported by the Irish occasionally, and there is always clash with Latinoos and Sicilianians for the supply of drugs. Oz is mostly black, there is one of the largest soldiers in a gang inside the homebase. <br /> <br /> Latinoos and Sicilianans, like homeowners, lead different leaderships due to violent deaths throughout the procession. Most of the syigilians are most notable in the operation of any illegal activity in the wage. Latinoos are presenting their presence so that they can be at least coastal coastal if they are not under control. In contrast to homeboys, there is not as much internal warfare as these gangs have, and this is usually more stable for drug use. The above mentioned Irish is a small gang managed by a manipulative and nautical Ryan O'Reilly. O'Reily always managed to have good graces with all drug abilities and whenever he wanted manipulation of his way things managed. They are not under any illegal control, but at least those who are in good condition with them. <br /> <br /> We have Bike and Aryan among the white prisoners. Bikes are just a bunch of tattooed drug users, who mostly support the aeronas. Ozan is the most hateful and hateful gang for most visitors. They are led by Verne Shilling, who can be seen among the most racist, sick, and evil characters. Both gangs do not control anything illegal, they only see dark-skinned prisoners that they are a big threat to the white kaydees who think they are soft. We have others Others are a gang outside outsiders who are not a problem to any other prisoner. In this group we see Tobias Becker, who accidentally killed a young man who lost a young woman whose life was forever imprisoned. We also see Augustus Hill, a black officer who was tied to a wheelchair to kill a police officer, who described Shoke and presented the audience to each and every person. Character crimes are shown as presented to them and Augustus tells us how long they are in jail. Finally there are Christians, and Gays in the gang. Christians are religious only to abstain from mental situations, and gayes are a group of cross-dressers who are often raped by other prisoners. <br /> <br /> This show gets in depth in many cases related to the offender. More clear than judicial system and no movie about prison. As the language is combined, we have more racist epithets and cuss sounds than any other TV show here. The Augustus Hill commentary provides us with a good way to understand every problem related to Oz. This show is not as well as the light from the middle to the middle heart. It is clearly seen in any way that it is possible to do more than anything, including rape of the prison, murder, lethal dispersion, and drug use and distribution by ordinary cattle. In my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show ever made, but at the same time why I can see these shows will annoy other people. If you are interested in shows and movies about fisheries then the oz must be seen.
