I was also fortunate to see Peter Fawke "checking out" at the Phoenix Film Festival. This is a very sweet-driven movie that puts the life of viewers in Applebom's tragic condition. Without fun, every character of the family contributes to the priceless comic relief, which encourages not only humor but also some pleasant tears. Peter Fawck was born to play this role. He plays a young "young man" of three who brings together his adult children, which may be perhaps the most important time in his life. The Applebum family enjoys a 2-day tour in New York (with carefully selected characters) but does not like the audience, but nourishes the family for their own sake. "Checking Out" is a must see movie, not only for those who nurture family, but not everyone !!! Thanks to the director, who could bring this gift to his audience. Robin Sly, Scottsdale, Arizona
