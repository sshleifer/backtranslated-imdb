Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to jail for the killing of an autistic child. When asked with pressure, why? She does not have an answer. While in prison, he agreed to decide his teacher Pearl (Don Chadell) with his own hand and helped Leland understand why he helped it. Throughout this film we learn all about Leland's annoying life with his ex-girlfriend Beckie (Zenna Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Speacy) and his whole sad life. <br /> <br /> This film is the second movie of Matthew Ryan Hague, and it is almost spectacular This is a movie that will leave you thinking about it and be amazed by how it works. The movie is quite dark, but if you can manage it, you will understand how good it is. <br /> <br /> There is no bad guy in this movie. You can not blame any such thing. There is no stereotyping, and the audience does not try to convince Leland. Instead, we come back, relax, and reveal this boy's life throughout the body of the movie. All the problems illustrated in the story are very real. Drug addiction, parental expectations, excessive sadness; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Her father lives in Europe and does not really care too much about his son. He loves only one person, but he has his own problem. He knows exactly what he knows, but in the film he said, 'Why you want, but there is probably no one. Maybe this is something that happened. 'There is a reason why, but we do not find it about it in the end. When you watch the movie, the audience is surprised that the young man can learn so much about the world. Notice that Leland ignored that ignorance. <br /> <br /> A special thought-provoking scene that really influenced me, it was during conversation of Pearl of Leland. Pearl just cheated his wife and when Lelland asks why, Pearl answers that she is only a man. Then Leland said something that has never happened to anyone: "Why did some people say that they did something wrong?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another awesome performance was given by Chris Klein. In this film, he starred Alan Harris, who is the boyfriend of Bucky's sister Julie (Michelle Williams). Although he is not one of the main characters, I am deeply astounded by his character. You can relate a lot to Allen. You know how anxious he is to the Pollard family. As if they were their flesh and blood. At the end of the film, you can see how far he is going to help them. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is an excellent composition that overlooks many people. However, when you take the time to look at it, you will probably see everything that is mentioned above as true. And once you finish seeing it, you do not look again the earth in the same way. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
