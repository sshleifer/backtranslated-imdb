After the "Godzilla versus sea slower" (which will give you an idea immediately), I found this movie in my old video and I did not see it in a while, so I decided to watch it. I do not think much about Rainbow Bright because I liked the cartoon and it was nice. Most people feel that way about her. You can probably do it. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, I was wondering if it was right! I have not been able to fit the Rainbow Bright molds. But he is facing the butt! This will be the ever-weird animated movie! I can not believe that these characters were so popular (the series is not too much) so much during the Victory As soon as I saw this movie again, it became my favorite. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to give too much. If you see the movie in the video store, rent it and see it. Ask any question. You will get it a kick. Especially humiliated princess character. And robotic horses. And hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you do not know, you can say that 80's cartoons are actually an incognito "head" movie! Have fun!
