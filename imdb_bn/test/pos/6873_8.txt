Walter Matthu is memorable for a long time comedy, with his similar comedy partner Jack Lemon, from The Fortune Cookie, The Odyssey Kaple 2. But people forget that in the late 1970s, he appeared in a photo with a partner - a female partner. It was the English double Oscar winner Glenda Jackson, who first showed her comedies at Mothoor's house at House Coloss and then on Hopeschot. Mother's role in both films was slightly larger, because her characters were more central to the plots, but chemistry was very good among them. If you ever want to see both how sexual intercourse can become crazy fun, Walter and Glenda Dr. As Charlie Nicholson and Anne Atkinson, we can see that two people have sexual relations over the bed of two people under the old film code regime, each floor has one foot! Sometimes the sex from the clinical and mechanical perspective has not been seen. <br /> <br /> Before the start of the movie, the head of Charlie has become a widow. He had only one woman in his life - his wife So now he is eligible graduate. He is the chief surgeon of the hospital, but the chief surgeon said. Amos Weatherby (Art Carni) Carney might have appeared apparently in Cynell (after a few moments in the film that she stopped and stopped her affection - see the scene where she is running Richard Benjamin's car). Amos for re-election (his nearest rival for Charlie Post - if he wants to). However, Amos has driven Charlie firmly to believe in keeping a job because of his self-confidence. <br /> <br /> One day Charlie was admitted to hospital. He got a little accident and resting on the bed, but Amos kept him in a cage like a machine (which was not used since Charlie's comment since 1920). She gets to him from the device, and is soon romancing her. He joined the hospital staff, but he was critical of the Church's will to fulfill Amos, and he criticized some selfish tendencies seen in doctors in the hospital. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Amos is trying to calm the widow of the owner of the team, praised the services in the graveyard (the line mentioned above in the line of festivity). However, he has still decided to sue (his lawyer, Theater David, that he never looked after in the hospital). So Amos suggested that Charlie romance romance to satisfy romance with that expensive case. But how will this reaction be Ann? This film is quite funny, and as well as creating a signal for Jackson and Mateau, it was also a television series directed.
