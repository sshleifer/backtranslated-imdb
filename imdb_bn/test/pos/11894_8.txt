I have seen the film and are very happy to see such a stupid movie, the character of the mainstream American main producer and the story. It is a period from time to time, a period of time, a period of time, a picture of a lifetime. Whereas the film is very successful as well as absorbed worldwide, in response to some specific reviews, the audience talks about sharing my assessment. For example, there were 3 countries in the Netherlands. Negative statements should be respected but one should expect to be guided on such a true basis. If you see a chance to see the film and enjoy it.
