It does not matter whether the Dru or Leigh is the total children, but many girls who are very nice and warm but they seem so cruel. This movie is not an Oscar movie, but at least there is a good point to see how young people or life is for "real" people. It laughs at us and those who really can learn to accept others for them. This movie represents the real world and is really what matters.
