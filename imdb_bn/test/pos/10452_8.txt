This is one of the best and best rated teen movies of all time. <br /> <br /> I saw this growing and it was my darling, probably not popular as "fast times" but just as great <br /> <br /> There is a serious side to this movie, It is mentioned by other critics that it started as a comedy and drama through almost half of the morphas. It's beauty and although it's a different set. You get it all. Humor (not opposite "Fast Times"), drama, and a great great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I personally think that every child entering this high school will see it, it will give an idea about the journey to start with them.

(Who can forget the scene between Gary and Camilla?). I can still hear it: "Oh my big strong burrito !!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some scenes in Gary and Karin are very difficult to see (especially the thickest scene). There are many women who went there like Karen, who liked the same. Think about it - how many men have forcibly refuted women in gold hearts (like Gary)? I know I did it - and so many women I know. This movie will inspire the discussion and, I have seen it despite numerous times, still have paid tribute to filmmakers and actors. Everyone can find more than one person with one or more than one person related to this movie. Finally <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not the kind of music that makes this movie unique, it's story, easy and easy. Best of it and the best in a teen movie classics.
