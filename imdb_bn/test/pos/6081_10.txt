A deep and deeply moving love story featuring strong performance from Ralph Feyens, Willam DeFo and Juliet Binouch. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a badly burned man (Ralph Fiennes), who tells stories of the second world war and his nurse (Juliet Binouch) who flew out of the embryo. Just before the war, she fell in love with beautiful Catherine Clifton (Christian Scott Thomas), but she started Jeffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and two started a sensual and banned matter. <br /> <br /> A very scary and tragic story of love and desire against some absolutely fantastic positions in the desert. Especially if your Anthony Mingheles works but especially the very very tears in the end will be prepared many shades.
