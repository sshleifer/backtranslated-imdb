This movie felt very true in life. I thought naturally without any big moments that ended but many little moments came together together. You could tell it a honest love story It does not matter what the main characters 'sexual orientation' is, it's still the story of love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes involved in the family. Setting is a very stressful time for some people what time is it. Such as "holidays." Christmas be precise. <br /> <br /> Like the best movie, it can not overcome love matters, compatibility, expectations and perfect ones. Eventually Alexandra and Casey made a choice for each other, knowing that love is difficult, and about giving. Savash.
