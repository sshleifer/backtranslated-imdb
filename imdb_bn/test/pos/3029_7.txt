This film is basically an example of the styles on the substance, but the style is good and certainly "The Cell" is a memorable and unique one for yourself to create the above average film. <br /> <br /> "The Cell" is a beautifully tempting set, costume and look with make-up. Yes, it's all to see the actual eye candy. The film has a completely 'dreamy' sequence which is strange but very beautiful and imaginative. This movie is an art-house type movie and a perfect mix of a common Hollywood-thriller accessible to both fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story has been brought very nicely and not always have the knowledge. Since the movie is not always as pleasing and interesting as it is, I mentioned earlier, the style compensates for it. The style makes you end up watching and provides the best moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Ophrio is as heartless as serial-killer. Vincent D'oprio is really unused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. I'm not particularly happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that he can work in some of his movies, but he was not really fit to play the main character of this movie. His character was not strong enough, and Vincent D'Anniefio and Vince Von influenced him. Still I think Vince Von was also wrong in this film. She does not play a lot of role and no, I'm not saying that because I can see her in comedy today. The rest of the assistants are good and still give the film a certain degree of credibility. <br /> <br /> Howard Shore's musical score was also amazing and sometimes like "Se7en". This film is well-suited and has given some extra mood and atmosphere of the scene. <br /> <br /> It is far from perfect film and the concept is not managed far and correctly. Still, "The Cell" is a completely visible film, and perhaps its style, fundamentality, and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
