I just saw this movie for the first time, and it's just like ... <br /> <br /> Yes its story, sweet love story, and how can any woman fall in love? Pen Blue has killed me ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scene to cut the Confetti after the marriage of Eric and Wonder was a scene where drink a cup of tea and watch a gorgeous movie, yes, tissue stone Good to be loved and fascinated, I know and I hope to get the DVD real soon. All the actors played their part perfectly, it was a WW2 film that you believe was credible, and not being top like other movies ...
