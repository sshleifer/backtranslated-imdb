Without any doubt, Best of Bart Reynolds Film Best! Even better than smokey and bandit This was probably the first real bloody police thriller of the 1980s and today's film provides the perfect mix of missing humor, action, mystery and style. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With butterfly knife The film was based on William Dyheel's novel, who wrote the Primary Fair, I'm one of my favorites. Henry Silva shot six times, crashed through a window and fell into Atlanta's thirties above the high growth. This is probably the most wonderful stunt in Hollywood history, performed by legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. Robinson Elmor Leonard played "Mok≈ç" of the film Stick, also starring Burt Reynolds. Stick features another great Dar Es Robinson stunt. Robinson falls from a Miami apartment building and unloads all the clips of his six shots from a 44-megawatt. Very nice thing <br /> <br /> The sharking instrument is my favorite police drama. I never realized why I did this picture. If Burt did more such films, he would have made a better reputation for himself. He proved to be a gifted actor along with Sharky as a gifted actor as well. Bart is supported by Bert Keith, Charles Darling, Barney KC, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward and everyone's favorite bad guy Henry Silva. Re-create this classic film! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other hot actors and you have a great movie that just waits for the movie. <br /> <br /> I can give it 9 out of 10
