Just saw the movie, it's actually quite good. The trailer gave me the impression of another two-week-long single-show-movie (La la _Brice de Nice_) or an expensive, stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it's neither. Secret Agent OS 117 stupid, but at least he knows it, I've always found out that James Bond was a fool but worked like a smart ass. The dialogue is a bit of a tongue-in-cheek comedy, which would be expected from British instead of a French movie. Women and music are beautiful. A consoling tour in the past, when bad people were former Nazi or Soviet vow, the car was shiny and the colony of France was!
