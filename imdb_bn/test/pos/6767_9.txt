All right, so I usually do not rent and rent foreign movies ... especially the foreign dark comedy. I think I can count on one side that I got really cheerful from beginning to end. This movie will be added to the short list. Even dark comedians sometimes shut me off of Hollywood because they have incredible dry ideas of humor. But these were my eyes well up with tears. Hit my side I do not have that hard smile long time. This movie was recommended by my mother and I do not think that seeing it, I did not even dream that she was not disturbed. Do not be afraid to read your movie time - you will miss a ridiculously good acting flick.
