If "I love tonight" is "Musical instruments for those who do not like music", it must be said that "gay deparporo" is certainly not a musical instrument that does not like opera. In fact - despite apparently being based on an opera comic opera - it is not really a musical, but a fooled story with a disconnected alienated Arius to show the voice of a character. And what a voice it is. <br /> <br /> When Neon Martini, young singer Chiba who joins the bandit army to get a spot on the radio (not, after the plot does not make much sense ...), when a glorious golden tenor whose style is recorded Do not date a day from an era. Some of his contemporaries are trillings and warlings, which are included in an odd fashion, but the chipo finds "nisun darma" of the world cup crowd and it is very easy to portray the process charts very easily. Unfortunately, he has a compelling grin and a moderate dramatic range, he plays at the same time and is totally unable to sing. As a result, otherwise the speeding movie, when Chiba puts his hands on his chest and starts declaring, the speed of the movie decreases every time, and the viewer tolerance of the result depends on his understanding of operating performance. <Br /> <br /> In addition to this flaw, Hollywood Convention and especially the Mexican Bandit Stereotype is an enjoyable wide-body cartoon cartoon that achieves the most important goals of this kind of craze so that its characters are compelling enough for their own rights. Curiosity will become otherwise inferior when visitors keep interest. There is a traditional dual relationship with the bandit chief and his sidekick, a mysterious rock with an engraved teck face and an encouraged heroine (a young ida lupineo) performs generically "You hate me but you really love me" routine with a refreshing twist The whole movie is entertaining and beautiful, and I think I got the value of my money - but it can not be denied that their own designation in musical touch introduces the commendable, serious pace of problem.
