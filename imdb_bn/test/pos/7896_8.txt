Rich businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick), accidentally killed his daughter's hippie lover after an argument. Panic-Straiken, he returned to the bar and met Joe Kouran (played by Peter Boyle): his loud country, how loudly, loud, angry, satirical Curiously, Bill lets Joe find out that he just killed a hippie. And this is just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic film in an impossible friendship. A bond between two men, a white collar background, another blue-collar background. One thing between Bill and Joe is general, they are insulting about how crazy they are. Both Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle gave very realistic imagery to their characters. John G., director of this "pre-rocky" effort. Avidason conducted this low-budget jewel with the same character as the film with $ 100 million budget. The script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy, realistic dialogue. Despite its strength this film has its weaknesses. The script falls asleep in roughly 3/4 paths, but it just wakes up at Jingle Climax for the time being. This film features 24-year-old Susan Sarandan with her Hippie Lover Frank, which features very early and irrelevant actresses with Billie's daughter Melissa, which is very sad by Patrick McDermott. The only grateful that he died from the beginning of the film. One of the 70's forgotten movies should not be in spite of some flaws. Although the "Joe" date of today's standard date, chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is quite relevant today, and this is the glue that holds the entire film together.
