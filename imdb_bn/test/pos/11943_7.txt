This is a nice little life movie of a man (Peter Cooitte), who is living in the middle of a perfect suburbs, one night police suddenly entered his house and arrested him 27 years ago for killing some people. <br /> <br /> In his prison, Quote referred to his wife unfortunate incident 27 years ago and how he thinks that Wayne Kennedy has been in contact with him. <br /> <br /> The story from here is called Flashback Fashion and you know more about Wayne and Quiet and how they came to meet and when they were more interested to know what happened. <br /> <br /> The role is not to do the Crow, though the man playing Van Kennedy is quite vague. The real solid position of the film is the mystery of what happened in the mountain. The wife spends almost all of the movie open by opening the sources of mystery, and every time something new comes, our mystery is treated with another flashback of further expression. This is actually quite good. <br /> <br /> As long as the livetime goes to TV movie this little Flickr is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
