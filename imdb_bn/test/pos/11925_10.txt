Quick summary of the book: Boy, Billy Taper, the 12-year-old school is a major problem, and if he kicks out of another school, he will be sent to boarding school. I am not really sure why his eldest son in Switzerland was taken to the Arab terrorists (or somewhere similar to him) in school. There are no friends to deliver, and the choice of using his laptop to hack into his school's database. He encouraged terrorists with the help of two teachers and kept the whole school. The book was not bad, but Tewoo was cleaner. <br /> <br /> Now about movies; They removed the Arab terrorists to the Cuban terrorists, and Billy made 17 of his friends and leaders of his team. They get trouble, but like normal teenage staff. This movie was credible. Maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. You can see delivery, Joey, and the rest of the people and see how they act (or at least missing) acting like that. <br /> <br /> Great action scene. Everything goes as well as planned. The overthrow of terrorists was dirty, and good boys were hurt. I would not say that, but it's a heart-wrapping (I know, I use that word a lot). Shane Astin is excellent. As a teenager he usually played dopey best friend. This movie again proved that he could play leading people, kids, whatever. Will Wheaton, who played the only son of the New Jersey Mafia man, was his only performance. He hated his father and what he was standing with. (Many tears from Wesley Crusa) I usually observe this section of the film for the purpose of the fun of fun; But the toy is not the soldiers. Streaming story lines, dialogue is generally credible. I can not think of a moment where I shouted on my TV, "Oh no not that" a great movie that should be in everyone's collection.
