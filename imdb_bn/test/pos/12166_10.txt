This small little thing makes me absolutely fascinated. <br /> <br /> The only thing I saw was the work of Doug Stor Man's creator Sam Brewez. However, where Bravez tells us to "learn how to be seen again" and give us headache that is trying to inspire the bright color and dazzling (which I still completely digest and embrace as high art) ... the film is very loose And will be marked as hypnotizing. Man-Ray's spinning objects / ordinary use of cameras does not create a very shy feeling, but instead creates a warm flow of senses and continues with the world's gravity running around us. <br /> <br /> An interesting feeling is that this small task is that until it goes along, objects become more recognizable until we are a nude smoke (which I think is that I always look at the good rounded breast of the woman ). Light and shiny circle and spiral on shadows and shadows it is an object of miraculous beauty, something that you could hang on your wall and delve for forever. Because of this and other pictures of this movie, I should see it again and again (finally seven times) because it completely fascinated me. <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
