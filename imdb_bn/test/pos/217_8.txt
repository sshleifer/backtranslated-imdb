When I was a kid, I was a big fan of the nude song but recently I saw the Show Squad Square! And I think it's great! Leslie Nelson's awesome, Alan North calm, RK Hake Rex Hamilton? But anyway, it's a stupid show. <br /> <br /> One of the favorite parts of this show is the fridge frames when the last credits are viewed. I think my favorite one is when Norba (and not OJ) is walking during the scene and he tries to adapt to the fridge frame. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem with me is that the cigarette gauze becomes too old (when the drug shows someone a cigarette and asks, "cigarette?" and the person replies, "yes I know.") I think they By using so many times. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good gags, great show! <br /> <br /> 7/10
