While showing the history of Z-Boys in the town of Dagne during the New York coast, I only showed a glimpse of what was happening. I had a P-SS-Black Knight skateboard with ground wheels. It's been long gone, and on my personal life ashes hip. But I did not forget It's like watching long lost brothers and friends, and wherever I live it hit me. I can not see enough of this film. Every time I see it, some other direction comes up, some other aspect comes to sharp focus. Vintage footage, incredible steals, current personalities have been brilliantly combined with the shadows of past astronomy, heartfelt and exaggerated drama, all have been nicely edited together to create landmarks documentaries of a real slice. American history Glenn Friedman's words - "It was incredible."
