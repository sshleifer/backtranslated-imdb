It's an extraordinary comedy, which was about to live in the aftermath of the racist uprising. But both main characters actually looks as bad as each other. Based on hit ITV comedy, it is very politically incorrect. And for this it is better to entertain all after the comedy. Movies are not just more than a real faulty plot. However the cast is as great as normal. Jack Smithr and Rudolph Walker enjoyed a group of groups together, enjoying each other unitedly. I've been watching this movie for many years and have been able to buy it in DVD last week. The film is still funny funny at the moment, this means that I can recommend this movie, just as I will be back in the 1970's.
