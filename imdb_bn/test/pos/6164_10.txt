Absolutely many levels are one of the best aviation movies of all time. Outside of Britain's rebellion, the hardware junkies drown on the largest single filler of Flashable Spitfires. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Be careful: romantic and even dog lovers are treated in this movie a very emotional ride. The original message is divided by many warfare, which is their best hours, their lifespan when they feel most, in fact, all others were sad and gray during the war. <br /> <br /> Join conspiracy check pilots who escape from their country when the Nazis attack and RAF Free Check Squadron. There are a few subplots, all of which carefully value attention. It's just an old old movie that will love even the most persecuted anti-hardware romantic (keep the clenix in hand). Beautiful photography, first-rate performance, accurate description of RAF life during Britain's war. Easily a candidate for private DVD collection of any airline entrepreneurs.
