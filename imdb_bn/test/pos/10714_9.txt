What can I say about Krara v. Krummer? It is easy to patronize but below it works more passion than life. It delivers a lot of fantastic moments, it lets you laugh, it cries you. You sympathize with the letters and you care about them. Many movies have failed, Krummer v Krramer is a success. <br /> <br /> I think everyone will agree with acting. Once you see Cromar v. Krumar, for some time, acting in most films begins to feel plastic and unusual. The actors seem to get their role as well and the characters really live on the screen. Some of them have beautiful chemistry. I think the best of the film came from young Justin Henry. The other child she has ever seen is different from the actors. She is amazing natural. <br /> <br /> There are some types of neurotic beauty in Merrill Strip. And Dustin Hoffman is one of his career's best performances! The story is very well written. It's simple but complex at the same time. The idea is a simple part, the feeling involved is a complex part of it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this picture yet, you must be missing! Now look at it!
