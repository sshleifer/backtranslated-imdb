One of my favorite Westerns and John Ford is one of the best in my opinion. No major star, but Ben Johnson is bright on everything he has seen, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. His association with him is that he is leading the ward bond as an ancient Mormon ancestor in the West. Harry Kerry, Jr., Jane Durwell, Russell Simpson, and Hank Warden, are continuously supporting the likes of John Ford's status gigantic train, like Claude descent member James Arresse. Utah Mormon train is one of the greatest and demanding initiatives of all time. We can not really feel it, but we see difficult events being overcome by pioneers in the west; River crossing, dry long long stretch, deserted desert, face-to-face with Indians and similar, sets for all the songs of glorious songs by the sons of Pioneers. Mormons actually excavate trill excavated sections with peak and fowl, as illustrated in the film. My main regret is that it is not made in color, but I think there is a color version. However, those craggy stones, which are featured in various scenes, are located near Moab, called the Fisher Tower. Highly recommended.
