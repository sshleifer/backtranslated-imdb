Blue Planet ... Wow ... where do I start from? Hard working years without asking any questions are sometimes one of the best documentaries made. <br /> <br /> The spectacular sights displayed on the Blue Planet, like most of the Attenbor Stump Documents, are rare and not even experienced by most people. There should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you are a 'weird' type that 'wants to know'. <br /> <br /> The blue planet is not the perfect documentary. After the third episode it gets a bit repetitive. How many different species of animals can swim, kill, burn, mate, and make eggs, and how do we really need to find them in all these ways? But if there is a deep interest in the life of the sea, then this repetition can not be a problem for you.
