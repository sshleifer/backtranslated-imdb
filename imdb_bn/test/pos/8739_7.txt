Ingrid Bergman, a faithful receptionist of Dentist Walter Matthew, who is acting behind a little animal on his boss, is absolutely amazing in this film. He operated the satirical return of the cat in the script and stole a horrific scene where he and Goldie Haone spoke in a record booth (Ingrid's solidarity in front of one, but his face tells you that he believes with his heart). Manu is a peculiar choice for a top man (he is too old for golf hawn and is very undetermined for Bergman, not too inappropriate for being a dentist), but I was trying to please Goldy and tried his best to get rid of him. Yourself to false He (who won a supporter Oscar) is as fresh as he is today and bubbles First of all, this bedroom is not very sophisticated (and totally reminiscent in addition to "no Wednesday"), but they welcome the cry of today, from teen-based comedies. "Cactus Flower" is a beautiful smile! *** *** to ***
