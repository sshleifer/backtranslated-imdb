Thank God for this movie. It is a document of talent that is considered to be more unique and rare in the competition, three decades later. <br /> <br /> The music is extraordinary, writing, performance, system and production that is so full of talent that is completely contagious. Music and vocal arrangements are incredible. Every time I have been praised by the praise team like Nell Carter and Rain Woods, I raise their soul. The film might be different from the version of the stage, I liked the cast album soundtrack, which I found really grating and developed under. The arrangements here have been filled up and expanded into dynamic pieces which can not be made at any stage. <br /> <br /> But this film is not only awesome about this movie. Often the mix of hyper-realistic dialogues (remind me about superhuman movies) interact with lots of musical instruments and dance numbers, really work. All genres of this movie - Instruction, Writing, Photography, Editing, Music, Dancing, Wrestling, Acting, Decoration, Art Direction - I have gathered together among the best musical films. <br /> <br /> I think how surprising it is about the "hair" character based on this very amazing information or plot. They are not painted as caricatures, but as realistic and very human. We see a little shiny of where we came from, but the picture is done by vintetes which can draw characters on the page through full acting, direction and editing. Berger and Hug's misogyny paint an undercurrent theme which expresses their vague macho-hippie ideology to paint their character. The life scene of Bagger's house revealed important information about his psychology and the brief view of the cloud's house was told by Cloud and (possibly) his father through his simple, realistic, and real-life interaction. <br /> <br /> I like fashion in this movie. It mixes one hundred ideas with most seventeen letters (one has to leave Williams hair extensions ...). What was so chocky in the late seventeenth century, the era of traditional knowledge that was all bad taste The cloud bay ike knit tie was the hot trend of 1979, and the singer and dancer's hair and clothing (especially white in the Central Park scene) suggested the timelessness of the music themes for decades. Together with this element, Tola Tharp has united with the great sophisticated danceography that enhances both of these artifacts. <br /> <br /> "hair" is not a film that rewards the film. If you come to expect it, you're probably going to be arrested by artists not bound by your rules. For me, it has opened an insightful and passionate musical conversation about my eyes, ears and spirit, war, friendship and family which passes his time and is still meaningful and relevant to me today.
