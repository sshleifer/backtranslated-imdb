Hitako has created at least 11 films, ordinary people, erroneously charged, run (sometimes true, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in the circumstances beyond his control, the first is "39 ​​steps", which he really made popular in Great Britain . It really is its signature theme. <br /> <br /> Others "Young and Innocent", "Subbulous", "SpellBand", "Stage Racing", "Strangers of Train", "I Accept", "Catch Thieves", "The Long Man" , "Northwest north", and finally "insane". "Sabotur" Robert Symings began to fight warrior plant activist Barry during the war on charges of killing his colleague and his best friend. He played with model Patricia Martin, acted in actress Priscilla Lane, during the course of her run, and later, of course, various Nazi / fascist sympathizers <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , And the other from New York to New York), and the "colorful" locals meeting along the way. And so, just like "The Man Who New To Do Make", I believe this is an American remake of previous works of Hitako. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Simmons has been chosen because he is a very ordinary American, a "everyone" type with whom the audience can detect. I love Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved than "Madeleine Carroll" and "Ruth Roman" in "The Third Strein's Train". Elsewhere mentioned, though, opening the villain as Otto Kruger Show. I like the performance of Vaughan Glaser as a blind uncle; Its line is great. There are some fun touches, such as some comic reliefs, such as the character of Priscilla Lane, and the road sign of circus side actor and truck driver Murray Allper. Here, unlike the other opinions, there are not many letters that believe Barry Kane's innocence immediately. <br /> <br /> There are some slow parts, mainly when it takes the first step in New York, it starts fast. The last plan of the fifth columnist is going on. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite films of Hitcoak (I put it in my top 5), especially on this day of new war of terrorism. I think it's home hit. <br /> <br /> It seems to you, "Could my colleagues be involved in some evil?" In fact, one of the movie posters for "Sabotur" is "Watch for your back behind Man!" Announced. Imagine how adults acted in the minds of adults during World War II.
