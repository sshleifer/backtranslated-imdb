I think Francois Traffaut was the one who said that among the best films, the joy of making movies, or the pain of filmmaking. This flush is definitely the first type. Tromeo and Juliet are a pleasure to start from the beginning. This Shakespeare Shanannigan Energy Junky initiative is contagious. I've seen Monty Python and Holly Grill so I'm not so frustrated. That's good!
