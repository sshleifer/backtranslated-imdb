What a movie! It is a mature, fun and complex script that is obtained from the perfect entertainment content (if you are not a prude) and Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, Hard Eight). PT Anderson will undoubtedly be closer for some time. The evidence is that this epic and aspiring masterpiece is here. Each character is skillfully played and touched and fully shaped. As Jury Herara (director) Julian Moore (her film star) and Mark Holberg (as Dirk Degler), they are all imagined from Bart Reynolds. And the story? How nice! Business and failure and consequences and honest look of the family. One of the best movies of all time! I give it a >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
