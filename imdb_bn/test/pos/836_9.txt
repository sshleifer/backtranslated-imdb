From the last few days I'm really hooked on the "Women Scorpio" series and I'm still waiting to hit myself because I wait till now ?? Which way is too long ?? Before buying the full box set. "Best Stable" in the third impressive effort in a row, and indefinitely the main trump in this series is that writers always bring something new and different for each installment. For story lines, settings, themes, and filming styles, it was never a absorption series after or after. The so-called "woman-in-prison" is less or less eligible as a flick (at least one antipalal), but you probably will not be able to group 2 and 3 divisions, because they rarely see any footage in the walls of the prison walls. And the overall tune and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well. The first film was harsh and great, and the second was psychedelic and part three was often mood dramatic. This last statement does not frustrate you, however, despite "dramatic ambiance" still "bust stables", it gives more features than exploitative themes and annoying footage. The opening sequence, for example, is pretty fantastic. Sassori still goes from the law to a mad, literally way to freedom, when there is no other possibility to cut the hand of the permanent police force to hold his hand. Entering through the city with a cut-off arm, when displayed on the credit screen, with the familiar theme song, it is pure and true absorption gold! The story is trying to lead an unknown life with our hero in the big city, but the poor thing can not escape only from its past or even new kind of pain. Sassori makes a prostitute friendship, even though the dialogue takes place without exchange, and the job of sewing atelier. His own impaired brother (!) Humiliates prostitution when Sassori is suffering from local pimping and underground crime network. He knowingly resisted a cold from the good use of his body, confronted a former enemy from prison, and when he submitted to barbarous abortion, terribly revenge a prostitute. Meanwhile, an armed police roamed the streets to find a punishment against Sassore. Many of our talented directors, Shunya Eto, strengthen the lines of these stories, and sometimes do not lose consistency in visual aspects or fascinating film genre. Most of the "bust stables" have impressive compositions and impressive camera angles that you can imagine, the edits are faulty and external locations are effectively frustrating. Those who know the character of Sassori are aware that this movie lacks a memorable dialogue, but it always heavily compensates with Miko Kazi's screen charisma and appealing harmful ones. In addition to the cruel gulf mentioned above, very little invisible, but the short flashing of extreme violence is very bright for horrible and empty end words. Actually, I think sharing may be the only (or at least, my favorite) of the three series. My only tiny and completely irrelevant point is about humorous listening, one of the birds produces when one is locked in a cage. That bird sounds like a ventriloquist's dummy with stomach cramps.
