It should be acknowledged that the best act of Harold Lloyd's end was with his last great silent comedy "Spadey" in 1928. Then he entered the soundtrack (Chaplin and Keaton and Lorel and Hardy and WC Fields) and did a better job than Keaton. , But the other three as well. Chaplin was rich in his own film production (but he had read his films, so the productions were five years). Laurel and Hardy was under the cover of Hal Roach, so production quality was very good for their shorts and sound films. Fields work with Mac Sentyat rather than packet and then free-music. Lloyd tried to run the route with Chaplin, but with less success. He made his own film, but unlike Chaplin, he is not the owner of his own studio. Also his first two choices were not good (especially "First Fit"). But he wisely started to choose and "Movie Crazy", "The Cats-Pao" and "The Milk Way". These three (and perhaps "the sins of Harold Didelbach") were his best sound initiatives. They are all entertaining, but there is no "end of protection", "The Freshman", "The Kid Brother" or "Quick". <br /> <br /> The top four soundtracks of the film "The Keats Pao" is the most controversial. Ezekiel Cob's solution was too extreme to frustrate the Mayor who was elected for the 2006 girl? When a movie is made, how it dictates politics: "The Catos Pao" since 1934. In the second year of Roosevelt New Deal (controversial to be involved in serious government instead), movie audiences watched movies such as "Jibral Over the White House" and "The Phantom President", where our leaders have been able to liberate the country from internal enemies and to strengthen the worldwide disarmament They did the constitutional activities. Even Seychel B B Miller was involved in "This Day & Age" on this day, where thirteen teenage girls used a mouse to force a gangster to confess his crime. <br /> <br /> Forcing us to use violence (even a gang of Allan Dinhart's gangs and a bunch of Badlers) accepting it is annoying. After all, the Supreme Court has protected us from confession under our anxiety. What we have forgotten is that we are not reforming the Warren Court and Burger Court until they have been created. For example, Powell ("Scotsboy's Boys") in 1923, although the opinion of the Justice Justice Sutherland was confirmed, every criminal defendant had his right to counsel, but Gideon V. Wainwright did not extend it to the court until 1962 to give order to the court to give instructions to the court. Since 1963 Miranda's case is now well known anti-self-criminal warning There was no need to do this in 1934. <br /> <br /> If you read other films till 1954 and even the techniques used to get confession in 1960 - Kirk Douglas confessed to his crime before witnesses in "I Walk Allon" and Burt Lancaster Kept guns. When the lancaster leaves, Douglas admits to being convicted, only the gun is unloaded. Suddenly he realized that (legally - in 1948) he admitted without hesitation. Any citizen freedom fighters will hate it for reading this note, but in the conclusion of "The Bitspaw", Dinhart and his accomplices did not have Kibb / Lloyd, but they were sent to prison in 1934. It can make heavy handover, fascistic, or awesome calls, but it is thought, but it will be done legally.
