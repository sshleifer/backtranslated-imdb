I did not give 10 out of 10, because it was not difficult to unveil the plot because it was not ... but it causes care for characters. Acting, by all casting, superb, especially the young man Hickson, and this is an heartfelt episode due to its heart. <br /> <br /> To investigate the death of Jason Ruffle, Miss Maple has called for investigation and reconciliation that was killed seven or eight years ago and he has to discover why and when he goes along. Mr. Ruffel is like a Caribbean mystery, and so there is a feeling of connection. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> But if you're like me, who loves to know someone and discover how they keep them, then Nixis is for you.
