Ali Ji achieved his fame on the small screen - although the big screen did not lose him a cudo. Ali Ji Indhouse is a light smile-a second fun festival - just like a small screen. He has not lost any of his characters or stupidity, and behind it - not a movie is the brainless lungs. A human body has been revealed to Ali, the idea of ​​running for Ali Ji's Prime Minister is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and stupid stupidity of stains gangster has been mixed with the harsh, harsh world of politics. The film is also full of bright new characters - and instead of interviewing after the interview, we get an appropriate comedy movie that is not repetitive or annoying. Then why did not I give ten stars? Well, the finishing was fun, but the crack and the failure - it has no knowledge. And in some parts, the film has become obnoxious to try to be fun - but it is for you Ali Ji - if it is not objectionable, it is not itself and it is completely destroyed. Ali Zi's big screen debut was the success of my belief, and should be in the 6-7 average rating range in IMDB. But it can be even worse, and people have mixed opinion, especially in a film like this. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali GI Indahouse is a comical British comedy at its best - and fun, and most clever. A great job! 9/10
