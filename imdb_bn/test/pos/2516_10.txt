Cool action - yes proves - but not in this way - that strategy. Hey people - Shock - this is an X-file. <br /> <br /> I have almost no visualization with Skilie / Mulluder - it has to be fitted with them, one has to rely on each other's internal knowledge - and each other's adaptability skills. They read each other's moves and finish the job .... (sort of). <br /> <br /> Oh yeah - really good acting - what do these people get to do this job? Or - a slow day when the convenience store does not call for their work. (Hey - Duchovini - Where's the old Donuts of the day ?? Malcolm - go to school ...)
