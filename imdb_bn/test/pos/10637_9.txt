I saw this photo at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. I am formulating "Austrian = Grim" thesis in La Pionest. Hashtent Cannes received the Best Actress Award in Isabelle, a woman for her artwork, who lost her humanity in her efforts to achieve artistic ideals. Trapped by his talents, they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways until he suppresses his passion and his sexuality. When a little student falls in love with him, our expectation increases, but soon we realize that he can not feel the love of others. This is too late for him, and the final 30 huroing minutes of the film, which does not say, that the beautiful music carries in the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music that describes life and beauty is not enough.
