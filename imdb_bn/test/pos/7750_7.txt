HarhÅ« Sujumiya's upbringing is now based on some of the Pat Sutras in the Japanese school drama Anime. The formula is a little bit: <br /> <br /> 1. The main hero comes from the world outside the ordinary society, and has great power. <br /> <br /> 2. A helpful introduction is a very nice and sexy girl. <br /> <br /> 3 There is a common character that shares the main role of the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in normal social settings. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the main hero of the story, and about the normal character that connects with the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. No effort is spent on achieving any magical power. They just have it. <br /> <br /> 7. Generally, people outside this tight night group are not aware of their super-power, and take their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So you have there. Suugumia Haruhi's antithesis has been created with the lines that have become a successful form of comics and anime in Japan. Although it follows a Pat Sutra, the series is created wildly and the episodes are always set in a striking back drop among normal social settings that are always transformed into unusual circumstances around Haruji Sujumiya. Every player in the story brings some unusual insights into daily life, which is generally not known to us. The philosophical packaging of their insights makes this series extra recreational. The first rate of visual, and beautiful is done. <br /> <br /> The crazy ideas are always coming along with the complex settings of the story, you can give headache periodically. It is even more complicated that these episodes are in sequence which adds confusion to more. When I saw episodes of Chronic series, some plots eventually became sensible. I recommend you do the same thing This series is much more entertaining for watching this way. Google <br /> <br /> LIST_F_A_MEMANCHALLO_F_HEW_SI_ZUUMIA_PISIDS <br /> <br /> For the correct sequence of all episodes. And oh, you can see the headache when you see it. Let me know if you had it.
