Almost any movie experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a school teacher housewife who suffers from hunger. He is also PTA! But then an automatic accident raises the woman, and it's hot! Samuel L. Jackson is very happy to help Davis find his past as a very private person, just to find out he's heading over his head. Davis also has some hilarious lines, and the interaction between him and Jackson works wonderfully. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Davis's husband, who seems to have created the whole film around him, But it works. <br /> <br /> I dragged this DVD and often started it again. I still love the makeup scene. Is Jina hot or not?
