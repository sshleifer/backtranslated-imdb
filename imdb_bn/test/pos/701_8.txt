I liked this western starring Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford. West Western got many things Here gunfight, action, and non-smuggling smuggling. There is a bit of a romance angle here that indicates here. Andal Buchanan, who played Uncle Willie McLeod, is a character who pretends to be shiny fools, but is actually aware of what's happening. Sheriff and Glen Ford Place in Randolph Scott, starring Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith. Finally tried to change his way. I like the different mixes of movie characters. I did not always find it fast, but I never found it boring. Although in 1943 the movie was in color. 8/10
