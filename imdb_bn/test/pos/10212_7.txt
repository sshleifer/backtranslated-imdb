"Western Union" is something of a forgotten classic Western! Probably because of its inability to DVD in the United States. However, just as it has been in Region 2 of England, all lost. This is a blessing in some way - it is not only incompatible but completely satirical, when one thinks that a film is established and established, which is without a Region 1 release as Western Union Telegraph Company. Believers believe! This is not only sensible! <br /> <br /> Produced by Fox, "Western Union" was operated by Fritz Long in 1941. This second event was Germany's Great German director! With Fox's "Return of Frank James" he did a wonderful job of the year, and in 1952 he passed another Western way with the superb "Runcho infamous". Lang was not a Ford or Haq but he followed very well with "Western Union". Edward Cranzar's first three strip technicolor's photo is proud of a good cast under the leadership of Robert Young, Randloft Scott and Dean Zoger. The female leadership was taken from Virginia Gilmore, who rarely worked in the film. An actress who did not make any of her career. His appearance here is only cosmetic. <br /> <br /> It is very excited that top billing over Robert Young Scott! It evidently starts with Scott's picture when we first saw him in the film's horrible opening, which is being followed by an animal across the plain. There is not much in the entire movie of the young man and one finds a place in the west. He just looks stupid silly fool against the gunfight Barton McLane! Apart from "Crossfire" (1947) - perhaps an actor who did not completely separate himself - Young appeared in a string of forgotten romantic comedies in the Fifties and Fifties, when he achieved his greatest success in the TV's "Marcus Wellbe MD" for seven years. Seventy years In 1998, he died at 91 years of age. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Scott Western Union's boss Dean Jagger carries a reformed law to secure Siaux's fraud from the fraud and for the appointment of McCain and his gang, who are trying to destroy the line for their wicked end. Robert Young, a former young engineer who joined the company and joined Scott in the context of Miss Gilmore. Provides some humorous relief - and annoyingly some would say - Slim Somerville and John Carradine play a minor role as the company's doctor. <br /> <br /> While fascinating together, the western region 2, but the fans who are superbly good will be happy. There is not that terrible cover with my spare pot that is no extra, even a trailer and that soft graphics. Footnote: Associate Producer Harry Joe Brown, who later created a partnership with Randolph Scott, who would create some of the best western subdivisions of the Scots in the fifties.
