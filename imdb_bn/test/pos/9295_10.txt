Not sure which country you will buy a show, of course it is Australian and if you have seen any attempt of our comedy then they get a lot of suicides, but they are not annoying for forty years old people with cheers. Those who are talking about current issues (most of Australia's case) make fun of their bad advertisements, make fun of our politicians. <br /> <br /> The boys had a show named CNN in 2002, which was not as successful as the war, which started from the beginning of the year, so all the things they are talking about are the current news that really matters any kind of annoying or sad They try to illuminate some ridiculous light.
