It has been a long time, such as a real, quite funny, black comedy sponsor. If you have "roulette to eat" in your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Betty distribution" immediately. Interesting fun things have been attempted before (see Paul Bertell and Mary Vernov on "Martuuri Academy"). At some great moments of black cinema, "The Undertaking Betty" is better, with better cast. Who can imagine that the enterprise of the venture can be a fertile role for real, raised and heartfelt comedy? I am surprised and you will be too. I highly recommend viewing "Betty Understanding" - Mark
