The question is, the original Anderson Princess Anastasia was not. In addition to the different differences between the physical appearance (Anderson's eyes seem to be big, lips become thick, nose bigger and finally become ... etc), Anderson was unable to say Russian was a ridiculous thing ...... I brought Anna Anderson and her colleagues I hate so much. Many swindlers have scam curiosity and patience for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme. <br /> <br /> There are still some amounts I have sympathy for Anderson. In those days life was tough for young Polish peasant workers. And it's hard work for someone to disguise other women for 60+ years. In order to imitate Anasia's thinner lip, she had to keep the lips on her head and sometimes people had to go crazy to believe in the memories of her chaos. As a result of only psychological problems <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If she has entered her beautiful appearance, learn beautiful body, patience and skill Maybe she could be the first-class actress. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> looks like based on the perfect real figures. Prince Archie Gleb is a combination of Botkin (the most likely brain behind the whole scheme), Lichtenberg's Duke George and Dmitry and several other images. And Daria Romanov seems to be based on the superb princess Jeannine Jorgez Romana. But unlike the real clash, Prince Arich was discouraged and he supported Anna's support for his love of love, which touched. <br /> <br /> It's a great show. A nimble fiction but still remains true to the reality. Amy Irving's performance is that she successfully represented Anderson with the success of her self-confidence, mixing others' disguise and making herself curious. Princeton Genenia of Anderson said exactly like: "She was always herself and never gave a slightest impression of being part of it." Highly recommended.
