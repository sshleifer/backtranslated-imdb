Coen Brothers have really outdone themselves into this wonderful singer of three escaped convicts. Although it is based on Homer's old work "ODC", but to follow the story you will not have to read "Odc". Brother Coen Celluloid and Aurele Wore a Tapeetry! The soundtrack is the underlying film, in fact it is a soundtrack product and a film wrapping paper. Each character is surprisingly absorbed and hated in old days when the films were rich with character actors, whose very presence in the movie adds prosperity, texture and authenticity. George Clooney Grease-Haired Everett Ulysses is fantastic like McGill, who is laughable and respectful of language and vocabulary for honest thinking. O brother, where art you can easily find the best coins for movies and clonier's best efforts. Clooney is good enough to ensure the best actor nomination, such as Team Blake Nelson's ex-girlfriend Delmar's screenplay, although the film is suitable for the best film.
