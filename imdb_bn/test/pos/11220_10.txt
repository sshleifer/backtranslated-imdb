I like the "Northfork" movie I did not know anything about movies before watching it. Therefore, there was no effect or information outside of me to indicate what I saw on the screen. For the first time I would advise anyone interested in film if there is no other reason than the actors displayed in it. Do not read anything about plot, story lines, or movie assessments. Actually stop reading more of my comments, though I believe they are not common and will not ruin the movie for you, I do not want to reduce the price of the movie to you. Find out the meaning of this photo's own path or decrease it in its probability. <br /> <br /> In general, I am surprised by the Northfoc, who has three modest strangers. As soon as the film is released, they can qualify as three angels in a psychiatric hospital, "sent" to find three entertaining exits or a sick and feverish young boy's dream and confusing, or "lost angel". <br /> <br /> The sick and possibly deceased boy will be able to satisfy three "unknown" people, to become his guardian (mother and father) and safely take away from the northwest (not less than 1000 miles) to abandon the lost angel. . He has even announced that he has tried to evolve the lost angel as his guardian. One in three responds to the boy on a positive basis. The other two have no real enthusiasm or emotion for this involvement. <br /> <br /> The care of the sick boy shows the depth of care of the people and the deep conviction of his faith. He crossed the exile and exile of NorthFork and his people; He is the light of love and hope both softfark and movie exhibitors. <br /> <br /> The film's final closest, boy and new guardian travels to a flat area where the land is waiting. They came to find two other strangers on the plane; Actually one is pilot. The engine starts and closes the plane. <br /> <br /> 3 who are strangers? If only a stranger was interested in helping the boy, why were there three planes? Where are the planes going? Found the other two "lost angel"? And if there is a lost angel and who is so? Who is dressed like six men underwear? If this is all about the ill-fated dream of the sick boy, how one of the three reached to help an officer wearing a dress when he jumped on his head (not the boy or stranger also contacted him). <br /> <br /> This title is a sad mistake of saying one or two sentences under the title of the title of the people (it is not a satirical, it is only Statements about ijnapana). So if you do not see the movie in NorthFrank, then the above questions look at the NorthFork movie when you see interesting and funny forks on the street street. Before you see it before the movie plots advertise the essence of the plot, you must look at some of the above questions and see it again ... I know I will. <br /> <br /> Terry
