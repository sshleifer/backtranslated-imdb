Spiller Alert I work as an extra in this live-time TV movie (pictured in Seattle). This is really interesting when you take part in the production of a movie, because usually they are still in the process of writing parts (as here) or editing cut and making major changes from the final parts. <Br /> <br /> Both my husband and I have worked as an additional in this film, and I remember that this set is discussed whether it is possible to determine if a little girl dies at the last moment. Frankly, I never received enough punishment for the crime of striking Margaret Colin's character, telling the lie to the police, etc. Do you think that if you have to hit and run till the end, instead of getting out of his waist the victim is right? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the world was rarely working with Margaret Colin, although Lisa Vidya (now life time is regular ) Was different. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole movie is about 7/10, but poster comments are still a real tear-jarcar and a great Saturday afternoon.
