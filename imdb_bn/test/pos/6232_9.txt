One of the first slashar films to come out of Halloween (probably from Halloween made from Irene Iblanas), I must say that I think the "Secret Trap" is horrible and fun. "Tourism Trap" is one of those extraordinary treatments you find now and then each one, and the rest is left with the most enjoyable feeling. It was the fate I had to tell you, but one night I had my local blockbuster (one or two months ago out of business), and there was nothing to get. Then I got blurred on this movie, it seemed like it looks like a ridiculous B-movie, I rented it and took it home, the boy was for good fear. "Tourist Trap" is closed as a bad movie, it's certainly a chessy moment, but eventually you get a lot of fun with it to take care of it. <br /> <br /> Which has affected me the most, and the most awesome one of the things I saw in this movie is this number one setting. A scary movie without a good setting is not very fun here. I just love the love of love, I think we can relate to it, it almost feels like we were there before. Which makes it lazy. The next characters are, the similarities between them are not true, and they all have real personality. For example, they are stoners, alcoholics, even sexually transmitted people, they feel like normal young adults. Plus they look pretty realistic, and then their chalk connors are. Who plays a great role as Mr Slawson, we all like it very quickly because he is so real, he feels like a nice guy that we are fans. This movie is scary ending, and perhaps the most important thing is how they remove half-way from our audience and start the right rights for the right reason. For example, in most of the horror movies, we've mainly jumped due to the sudden change in music pitch, but "Tourist Trap" prepares itself, in that case. It feels completely creeped out with the perfect use of light, mannequins, and curiosity. Plus I love because even though they may go a little bit more on some things but you still feel that it can happen. A horror film that takes real comedy movies should definitely do it, and it makes us (listeners) unsafe and fearful. <br /> <br /> As a whole, I do not have any big problems, it can be a little strange at times only. By the end, "Tourist Trap" keeps my heart in a close and dear place, one of my horror films that makes me light and feels insecure about travel.
