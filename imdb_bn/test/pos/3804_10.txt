For the first time I saw this movie, I thought "What the hell?" The 10-year-old child wanders in strange places, meeting strange men, after a game called motorm! Hello yeah I enjoyed this movie a lot! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a bright young actor! It's a shame that he stopped working. He interpreted his character Gossake very well in the film. <br /> <br /> Gus got tattoos open and went to the most strange cities acting with Fly, Drew Barrymore and Mt Loffe! Want more? <br /> <br /> Do not try to understand the story, but why this movie is needed? Just open your mind and let Gus drive you to this journey. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, you won Motorama"
