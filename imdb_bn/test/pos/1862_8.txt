Paul Bettany played his favorite role as a tortured father, whose favorite little girl was the death of the disease. For him, he deserves all the credit. However, the film was mostly correct, because of the Darwinian literature he collected information for his theories, because the incomplete story was told to the children and completely excluded the debate about his ideas. <br /> <br /> Two things made me terribly disturbed: Soundtrack, its radioactive vocabulary, produces virtually sadness down the audience's throat, and film trailers, some beautiful graduates, preparing for the war with the encouragement of him and his wife and his best friends. Show enthusiasm Against blind faith, thus completely misrepresenting the film. <br /> <br /> If it is to remove scenes from movie trailers, its result may be a small family drama. As a result of child death and his parents' hardship. Obviously, what I do not expect from Darwin about which movie, though the film was well explained.
