Three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you feel sorry for one of them: Ernesto, who is despondently dedicated to Mercedes. This was part of the frustration: Mercedes screamed for a source and did not eat any good Harry, no profit. Then Satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a great part as a transvestite, and the ongoing story of Harvey Kettel is incredible to play the Gorilla for his honest TV. When you expect it at least, Quintin Ternino is half focused, and Anthony Quinn brings Ernesto back to a rich man. <br /> <br /> The time of the story and the wonderful moments can be seen again, but ultimately it is very difficult to know what this movie is about. It does not have a happy ending or even a complete, but it seems to be right in any way. <br /> <br /> This movie is weird, but then I do so; I liked it.
