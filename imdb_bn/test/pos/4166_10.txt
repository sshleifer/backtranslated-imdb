All of these cartoon characters were lovely. The Norman Vikings Protector is a few memorable phrases and skull master, bad guy, will always be pledged to kill Mac with some crazy cackling. Best of writing <br /> <br /> When I was young I was looking at the set. If they come out with a DVD of all the episodes created, then I will be forced to buy it. This and a Canaan Barbarian cartoon which I miss most from childhood. I think all of these great cartoons of cartoons are most unappreciated. I used to see this cartoon at Channel 13 in Los Angeles area. <br /> <br /> I think the owl was always scared, warned McCaw that he was suffering and he was elected. Mac did not believe that he was elected and always gave the owl problem. Norman had fewer conversations but his simplicity was fun. When he was fighting with them then I would say things like "I ate the monsters for breakfast". And then he was battling zombie when he said, "I eat zombies ... sometimes." Classic cartoon comedy and action. <br /> <br /> I will vote that they are the highest of the space.
