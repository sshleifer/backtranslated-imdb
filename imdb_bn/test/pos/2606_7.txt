The film starts with commitment because there is more interaction between Spaniqi and Bakwihat, but with the progress of the film, two boys together have less views. This is slow enough speed. Billy "Bakoat" gives Thomas a very strong performance in his early scene. When he left behind in the river boat, his fear and abandonment were clear and his tears were really heartfelt. When he asks people for help from man and rejecting repeatedly, the audience shows that it is a joke or it is really surprised. Another moving moment of seeing a children's birthday party through a peek fence. As another critic, I was worried about the big dog by stalking the dog! Once Spaniqi and Bakwit live in Marshall Valiant's house, Spani mainly communicates with adults and children's chemistry is basically lost. <br /> <br /> The Old South / Hawk fin-type setting does not let the kids go outside the door without doing much for the plot. Ralph Morgan is the most compelling adult, but then the other roles really do not have much of their material. Louise Beavers manages some fun moments with a Yankee soldier towards the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> Villains are not really terrible enough and lovers are not strong enough. However, I think if you are enthusiastic about our gang, it seems very valuable, if for some reason it does not have the extraordinary interest of the whole piece. I give seven stars because, if there is not a great movie, what would happen next, what kept me whole time and oddly kept.
