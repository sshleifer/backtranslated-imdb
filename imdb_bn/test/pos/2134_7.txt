This great movie is never seen in my town, so I had no chance to see it until I got caught up to 80 television in German Television. I was expecting something of a disaster, and instead found a well-played Grand Western with fantastic position to work. The small tube can not really hurt it, and this 4-hour movie has almost a dull moment, so I hope to see it again on the big screen. What would that be a spectacular! If you ever have a chance, do not miss it. Unfortunately, the hard work of "Heaven's Gate" destroyed Michael Simine's career at the time of his opening, and he withdrew from the extrovert comic ("Sicilian") and from the wonderful fool ("depressed hour") that was sent from the "year of the dragon". .
