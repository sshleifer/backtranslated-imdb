Mr. Bean has always been my favorite No matte shows how many times you see the same thing, do not get tired or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the world's greatest comedians who do not even have to tell people to laugh. Its gesture, its facial expression and its face itself is so interesting to see. The situation that he faces in the event is simply ridiculous and the way to manage them is even more. There is no reason why this show should not be taken 10 because it's great. It is something that will ridicule even the most serious or sad person in the universe. Some of my favorite favorites from the show include: 1) When Mr. Bien lodge in a hotel 2) where she sees the scary movie 3) The baby's mind (especially the diaphrake scene). Actually, all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show. Mr. Bayan can go to any height that proves that he is fun, completely isolate himself in episodes. The situation he handled was easily swelling. 10 out of 10
