I really liked this movie and had spent a few years trying to get it. This is not only available and it has not been on TV for many years. I enjoyed it and songs because it was something different and you feel how each person is viewing something from different perspective. We do not even commend us to do anything that does not exist anymore. <br /> <br /> My 12 year old girl just invented music and entered with some songs. One day I hope to get a copy of the film so that she gets a chance to see it. (Oh I love to see it again!) <br /> <br />
