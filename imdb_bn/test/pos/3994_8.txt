This film was the best director of the Cane in 2002. Won kovon-tech (tied with PA Anderson for Panch-McCau profit), the 19th-century Korean painter has a significant impact on the roots and Korean painting. One of the strengths of the film is that I try to help us with the eyes of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects that help our drunk painter friend, Choi Min-Shik get? Inspiration. <br /> <br /> The aspects of clothing and industry are all impressive and the performances are also good. This is not a movie that has not moved me, but it's one that means what I mean by finding art and finding your own voice in it. That's pretty cool Just before the beginning of the century, it is interesting to see a version of Korean, where both China and Japanese power both the Korean and the Chusun Kingdom are ending. Many revolutions and political ideology are collected in the film, but there is never a center. It's firmly on the painter. Finally, it is a well-made film about a painter's life. But it does not have a regular three-plot structure, so you will be able to take the story of a non-standard Hollywood to see it. Yes for the industry! 8/10
