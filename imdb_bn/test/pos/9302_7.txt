This is a weird and compelling film. This huge thing used by Japan in the United States 'NM Los Alamos' nuclear bomb, and during the second episode of World War II, this huge issue used in Japan is very deep and certainly deeply annoying. The film's plot comes with a lot of heavy issues and most of the actors have to be creative. I have never seen the film, or I had a lot of interest in it until I read the book "Smoking in Bid: Conversation with Bruce Robinson". Robinson wrote stories and screenplays. I think Robinson's conversation was better than reading his point of view, but I could remember how to break it. I think Paul Newman is quite good, but at the bottom, miscast. She is very Hollywood. At one point, Newman's office had a large, mid-way storm storm and such a deadly presence, I immediately thought he was playing the character of Newman. The main scientist who plays another role is also fairly good, but in no way is huge enough to participate in large parts - the ultimate responsibility of making the ultimate instrument of death and destruction. One of the more effective characters is believed to be a joint personality, played by John Kasak. He is curiously affecting his whole life, and ultimately, that character whose fate really hit the house, and who forced me to think more about the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese citizens in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
