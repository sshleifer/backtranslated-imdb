A few would argue that the main animation director Hayo Miyazaki had some power to hold this power. <br /> <br /> John Lasseter's "amazing" beautiful doll show for theft of many movies plots and then should be appreciated as a genius .... but I digress.) <br /> <br /> Miyazaki is the film that gives our film after the film with important mature issues (usually environmental themed), and there is an intelligent script that even the most awakened spectators are usually animated by any film Who can hate if the opportunity is given, but it can enjoy it perfectly. However, Miyazaki (almost) will never forget who will be in the audience of this movie - <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I think there is a loss to think of another filmmaker with this power. You are going to launch a movie somewhere where the three-year-old (my nephew link) will always go on, a 7 year old (my nephew Amber) loved everybody (and his "power" was Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, 12 years old Nephew Harun) reviewed, "Of course it was good! Everything is Miyazaki-san!", A 32-year-old animated fan is crying The letter of love and guidance of the excellent animation (ER, that would be mine), and a 58-year-old woman (my mother) capable of connecting to the mother character (and I bet the old charas also) and the child's "authority". <Br / > <br /> And I respect Miyazaki-san most respected. He thinks that he is completely talking to his audience compared to the average filmmaker. On the surface, to be seen as "piano" Are a small fish girl, a simple story of the people of the world, the taste and it wants to join, and he's a friend and wants to become, little boy's name so ske (slightly "The Little maramyada like"), but the game is completely different layers. The form is true, Miajaki makes her film popular with the real character with her own strong and strong will, the mother of the strong female characters, the mother of Sosaki, the lady of the big nurse's house, with her own and very strong will. <br /> <br /> The girl takes the cake, Ponyo herself. Once he decided that he liked the human world, he used his own desire only to achieve his dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent, and she keeps a witch fish, but young pony knows what she wants and just becomes a man outside her own strength. <br /> <br /> <br /> One day the man takes his friend Sosk with whom he loves so much (though he is not like Ham). The sauce is considered to be a man of the house (age five years) when her mother, Lisa, decides that she will have to help people during a rest where she works during a typhoon which is unknown to her in the search for a man of piano. Franky Jonas (Yes, he is related to Jonas's brother. Can we just get past?) Perhaps, young Sask (which is better after most lines) gives the best performance in the film. His character is also a strong deliberate, but very respectful and friendly - at this end of the Pacific, your child's character traits are not found. Finally, Pinoy's father Fujimoto must certainly deal with the decision of his daughter and her wife's wishes to allow her to be his man. He hopes to "remember him sincerely" Panoe and Sask. And again, Miyazaki allows a character to become stereotyptically "bad guy". Although Miyazaki has received some criticism for some reason (but for some reason), it is true that his movies are magical and yet related. No one in real life is completely a "bad person." All people gray different shades And what Miazaki has done with her character is just right. <br /> <br /> And then there's animation itself. At the time that CGI will help the influential influential films of this film, especially in the water, Miyazaki chooses to include a CGI. Of course, the hand-painted animation was colored in digital way, but each film had a hand in it and I was very grateful for it. Character animation was extremely fluid, and there was some lip-sync going on (even unusual for an animated film). The background seems to be rendered with color pencil and the audience had an impact on its own. That's what an animation looks like - and what to look for it. Finally, I got to enjoy Piano completely. Of course Miyazaki's best (in my opinion, the honor that is still held by Kiki's distribution service), but still a 10-star comedy movie for the Inner Family
