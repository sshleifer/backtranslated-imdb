Nigel Balchin's brilliant novel 'A Way Thras the Wood' was adapted by Julian Felios, who also managed the piece of the mystery of this 'terrible British' drawing room. This is a film whose impact illustrates a variety of modest / malignant characters and it is here that Folose's director selections are superb. The story is a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film excites a mine of disaster if an event occurs as a transformation of each player. <br /> <br /> The successful business lazy solicitor of James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) in London, married Anna (Emily Watson) for more needs in her life: couples assisted by their long-term 'Clean Maggy' (Linda Baset) a beautiful The estate survives. They joined the socialist ceremony and among others, the Rupert Everett met with a sluggish neighbor neighbor. Anne decides that her neighbors should entertain and take a plan to protest against James's protest: James 'will not be present due to business'. A hit and run accident occurred on the party night, in which Maggi's husband was killed on a Rang Roover (which he said was accidentally killed). When James returns home, he sees a scratch to convict Williams Range Rover and Suspect William. Anne told James not to go to the police with this information - 'Is it possible? But to destroy the life of Bill as socialist, parents and son of an important school? ' This is the first 'false' virus that spreads: James Bail, who opposed James Beale, who told James to go to the police, Annie admitted that he was driving the rover of Bill and was responsible, James confirmed Anna to keep calm because of his fame, Ann Acknowledges that he has a relationship with the bill, and three of them agree that they do greater good work They will be great together mithyaye postal order. Annie had finally surrendered to her favorite Maggie saying she was responsible and Maggie who was guilty of stealing her theft, which was saved by the mercy of the person who brought life to live anyway, the agent who painted the story in a wonderful conclusion. Lying lie, lying lie, lying etc. <br /> <br /> The main influence of this conspiracy is the method that affects each character of isolated tragedy. Every change in a dramatic way. Tom Wilkinson has given the best performance of a career filled with brilliant performance: In front of viewers, he can tell more about his gesture and facial expression than today's actor. Likewise, gifted Emily Watson has added yet another wonderful role, such as the surprisingly memorable Rupert Everett who, despite being still another rich British 'gentleman', gave a man to both the dry and ultimately poor of his soul. And always great Linda Baset takes a small role and it centers its character on the center of uninterrupted lies. <br /> <br /> Tony Pierce-Roberts cinematography and Stencils Sirowies combine multiple atmospheric stories by adding musical score impossible. It's playing at its best, which always has a fine perception on the piece of director (Julian Fellowes). This fine man interplay really makes dodgy stories really work well. Grady Harp
