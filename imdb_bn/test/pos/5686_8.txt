Black Water, co-directed and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Trouque, is still effective in its effective workforce. The film is a low budget Australian movie which unfortunately can not be recognized because it is one of the best among the features of animal life, as far as possible. Setup is rather basic; Grace, her husband Adam and her younger sister Lee are traveling to some of the Northern Territory's mangroves when a saltwater crocodile flips in their boat and is trapped in trees. The whole movie is about their survival when the crocodile is waiting for the hartal. Like the Greg McClein rog (another murderer Kroc film released in 2007), Black Water does not make fun about the audience, who will be eating later? Hopefully three prayers will come out safely. <br /> <br /> Three unknown actors did a great job in the role of most of the claims, it was illustrated in the picture with a true crocodile instead of CGI. The situation of the characters is practical and the dialogue seems natural and is not obliged. Suspension is produced throughout the film, we can not see much of the animal, but it is very dangerous to know about it. This is your seat-seat stuff and if you enjoy real and (most important) horror films, it is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/5
