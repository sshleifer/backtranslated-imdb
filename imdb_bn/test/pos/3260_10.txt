Many years ago I saw this movie (probably? On television) and liked it. So I decided to rent DVD the other day whether it's still on my assumption. Did it Set <br /> <br />'s infamous King Cross Zilla (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex stores grow), it tells the story of "Jimmy" (played with Beth Laser). Jimmy is a young man ... probably late teenagers or sooner, who did not have a stable family background. She is at the base of the society and acts as a 'tout' for a sex club (encourages people to enter the shop). He is aware of an underworld named "Pando", who is a local rebel man in the cross. Jimmy hopes he will find himself in Pando Roder and get 'in' with him ... he wants a small cut on social mobilization, he hopes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < You just know a love story will play in them. That night, Jimmy was contacted by Panda (played by Brian Brown). Jimmy is a 'job' for Pendo! Jimmy is waiting for 'feet at the door' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stylistically, if you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movie, you have to expect ... twists and turning and black comedy. <br /> <br /> What is so great about this movie? -ness' It is not Tarantino or Richi, but generic Australian contribution to the general. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this movie is how it hangs together. Sometimes you are the character who you wonder what they are doing in it. In the end, all these 'loose ends' tie together beautifully. It's like a celluloid mobius strip. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the character of Pioneer of Brian Brown. Pando likes the puzzle, and enjoy playing games with his chronies. This little story has been revealed about him which is so enjoyable ... for his taste in the music, for beginners <br /> <br /> I saw among the movies of Heather Ledger (Dark Knight, 10 things that I hate you) Introduction. "10 things" were not taken with. If you hit the laser fan (Laser recently died on a sad, accidental death), it is an opportunity to see him in his greatest Australian role, I think. This film has great chemistry between lasers and buyers - so at one stage it acts as a love story. <br /> <br /> There is nothing terrible about this movie in the movie Tarantino and Richie Underworld, but it has some adult themes ... the scenes surprise you with their coolness and beauty. In this sense, it is not an ideal film for young viewers, but it is not a film that will get excited about the pregnancy. Finally, I want to say that making a good movie is very good for Australia. Generally, the type of film that my country produces can be immune to it. This film has the power that has many Australian film weaknesses ... such as It's a great story, great acting and a great script. We need more popular, quality movies here that should be made in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend. The other Australian movies I have liked include: <br /> <br /> Breaker Morton (10/10) Mad Blake 2 (10/10) My Brilliant Career (Not yet reviewed by me) Proof (NR) The Devil's Playground (NR) Year's My Voice Break (NR) Bed Boy Bobby (N. A Great, Dark Comedy) Dishes (D. A Great, Comedy Comedy)
