Neil Simone is one of the best plays to be made in a movie. It's full of great characters, and memorable dialogs. Johnston Silverman created a great screen version of Young Eugene (he played with Matthew Broadreak on stage). This is the first of Simon's autobiographical triangle, after the wonderful "Bilxy Blues" and TV movie "Broadway Bound". If I were told that there is a flaw in the movie, then perhaps those letters can sometimes speak in clear conversations, but that's just because it's a great conversation. Rent this little gem, you will not be sorry!
