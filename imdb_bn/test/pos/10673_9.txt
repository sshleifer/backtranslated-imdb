At the end of the 70's or early 80's, there are my darling memories of watching KI-Television (now Apa-9) in this new visual film in New York. Although a product of Swing 60, this film is very young. The effects are as spectacular as 2001, and in some ways higher (model work is defective). With an interesting cast, great color photography and set design, and a developer score, GTTSSSSSS winner!
