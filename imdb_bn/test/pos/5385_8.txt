I recently saw this movie from our local Helsinki Film Archive since 1918. It seems that the Danish Film Institute reconstructed it to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Norwegian film company in 2006, which was the largest in the world in the early 20th century. I believe that at the moment there are several copies of the English translation running around Europe. <br /> <br /> I found the fascinating movie and thought well for the journey of Mars. The plot line is basically original, but I do not want to publish it again at this time, there is actually a danger of losing things for you ;-) <br /> <br /> Also available on DVD, the Danish Film Institute (Filenstadt of Dat Dans) Search for more information on 'HimelsSkin' pages at dfi.dk.
