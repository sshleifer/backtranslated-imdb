It's a low-budget stop-motion giant film from Brett (a nimphyred Barbarian of Dinosaur Hell) ... and it gives me what I hope from a product: Lots of heart (though Chess) dialogues, some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters. That's why I gave 10 out of 10 films - because it provided what I expected to pay ... and a bit more: Bret did not give penny-pinch while installing his critter on the screen. He hangs many bugs at his cast for the final. And, however, I love stop motion monsters that, compared to the CGI credits in big budget movies, it is very fun to see.
