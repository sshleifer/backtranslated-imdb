Murder by number is a pretty good movie. Although the plot was running at the speed of the sled, the character of Sandra Bullock merged with her partner, and the movie that got caught up with the previous trauma situation associated with the film, was able to keep the audience involved in the film. Saying, I think that it is "who did it" type atmosphere that eerie sort of set does a good job. It guides you that any boy was really behind the murder, unless both of them. I think Ryan Gosling and that other child (lol) that is a good job to sell vs annoying dark relations. Gosling is not sure about playing a bad ass, but for a man who will act as a notebook-like star, he did a great job. Once the film was rolling, I myself asked myself in the story, "My God, what would I do if I lived in that condition?" Like the movie of CSI type, good extreme crime drama is not just for movie junky, but it's all good. <br /> <br /> 8 Outta 10
