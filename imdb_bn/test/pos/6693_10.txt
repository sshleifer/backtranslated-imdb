Infinite possibilities of life are formed; Some are familiar, others have a mystery and so are determined to stay. And what's huge, there is no established boundaries or parameters of knowledge outside the field? Who can tell or what is possible? Valid questions, which are raised and researched in the story of personal journey of a particular person, are a strange and dramatic adjective that denies the truth and logic, 'K-Pax' directed by IK Softle, ​​and Kevin Spacy and Jeff Bridges. . A person who moved to a mental hospital in Manthat, was injured in an incident at the Central Station in New York. Mark Powell (Bridges) is sent under the supervision of the person who tries to uncover the truth about the patient, who claims to be from a remote planet K-pack. For Dr. Powell, it has become a quick challenge, strong conviction about its calm, direct, impending methods and the tendency of production (that banana banana and all eat and red delicious apples are his choice). But it's Pavel's work, as well as its nature, be suspicious. The claims of the protests are intact and the most intense inquiries and more. Standing in Powell's cautionary stand, who thinks himself as a satirical one - Prote even tells him the exact date and time of who is going to go. -Paaxx, a fixed return trip that allows Powell but it gives little time for everyone. And Powell simply can not remember the idea that he is dealing with a real alien; And he's going to solve something quickly, if he ever knew the truth. And he must know. Indeed, above all, the only thing that is going to liberate her from her own mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And as long as you are not sure about the content until the content, you can detect Powell, see the situation from his point of view and try to solve the puzzle with him as well. Creates astonishing atmosphere in the software and creates a real feeling of encountering a truly unique story, and you start to realize that the prototype can only be what it says. And in relation to the reality of the film's disposal, it is a serious matter to try to wrap your mind. How do we respond when the evidence is against our physical limitations? The heart of the movie has a deeper depth of humanity, which is not just proto, but rather Dr. Powell is also very clear. <br /> <br /> We hope that Kevin plays a promising role as Spasi Prote, making his character deeper and physically convincing emotionally. same time. This is a unique person, and Spacey gives him the ability to carefully and share the moments that are specially published, which adds credibility of the character and credibility of the story. For the film to work, we believe who is and what is protected; We do it, and do it. SPACE simply pulls it nicely This is a memorable performance, which creates a character that you may have with you for a long time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Powell This is a fairly simple role, and the challenge for the bridge is to take this general and common character and to make it unique to its own right, which was not a small task against the prototype. And, again, it was important to raise the bridges on this occasion to utilize this film. And, with exceptional skills and as he is satisfied that he is successful, he is successful without question. Bridges connect Powell with intrinsic complexity and provide it with its performance, which connects Powell and Prototype with dynamic and sometimes intense mobility. It is a demonstration of two of the best actors, which they are doing the best, making a living and inspirational dynamic. This is a great work of Bridges, who never tries to steal spotlight from the proto, which helps to elevate the film's level to even higher caps. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfred Woodard ) And Saul Williams (Arnie). An experimental, emotionally involved film, a laboratory on 'K-Pax' possibilities, as well as a test of growing complexity of human condition. It is a movie that wants an open mind and who is able to communicate with it in its own stamps and hug them and reward them. In the end, it gives you an idea that the keypack is real. And it commits you to the promotion of the trip, and how many we share with common people, people or aliens, to share with us all. And it can reflect you on your own journey - where you were and where you're going. And that's the movie's magic. I rate this 10/10 10/10 <br /> <br />
