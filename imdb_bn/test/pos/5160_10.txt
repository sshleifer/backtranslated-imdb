I'm not really coming this one. Roy Anderson cried out to me, I'm the perfect whistle for static cameras (Long Live King Bourouze!) I smiled violently for the first fifteen minutes of the film, he hit me directly in the eye. You have to be a brilliant man to make yourself sad. Underson reminds me of the third player of Flash's Moby Dick Pikode, who is a man who has lived a lifetime, is a real joke that the good Lord himself is playing on us. And this movie's egotious web is really fun. <br /> <br /> The level of mockery is in fever, there is a treacherous visionary musical instrument about cruelty in the world, and then completely ignore the pain of spiritual self-reflection cry. The very depth of arrogance is plumbed. I could not go further than Bergman's "silence" in this honor. But every single character in this movie is a symbol of self-love and self-respect, wonderful by the character. We have shown such an existence that the impoverished and lazy railways around the world have done injustice to them, they are really legendary in their own home cells. This film is a great art of human self-deception and self-delusion! <br /> <br /> There is no such thing as a woman to understand what is happening in this movie. An elderly woman who agreed to leave the Chapel, stopped praying for the forgiveness of all mankind, I have heard that the most brilliant condemnation in the modern world. He has revealed through his prayer that what is wrong with the world will not be amended by merely a tinker, there are only some flaws, corruption eruptions which can only be corrected by redemption and the day of trial. Seeing this movie, I remember the nude monk, a deep waist stood in the cold river at midnight, thousands of cairie elephants screamed for the sins of humanity. Another big jacket is clear that his prayers are in vain, and in reality he is preventing everyone from coming home. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for torch, no one lives, no idols are left in the altar, no group of people are losing the glory of any other tribe. Sometimes our sins have been a more amazing beautiful brief. It's a movie for the end of the world, it's glorious, great awful real joke in human life! <br /> <br /> It's hard to choose a favorite from the photo catalog, I started licking my thighs and often tried to pull the table cloth by shouting laughing. Set service. I do not spoil what can happen, but mystery build up, and really something happens to be unexpected. This is probably the most fun thing I've ever seen in a movie. I am quite well-preserved and I could not control myself: it's the magnificence of this film. <br /> <br /> "U, the Living" shooting is unusually formal. We are an artist, dingy chestnut, yellows, grays, and sky blues palette are shown set by brilliant brass texture shock. A tone does not come out of the place, it is half an hour of syphionic hostelarian shield. The color scheme that can be set up is certainly great. And no shot is lost, as there is no extra inch of celluloid with all the great movies. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I saw the best movie.
