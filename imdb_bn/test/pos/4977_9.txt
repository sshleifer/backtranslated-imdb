This is classic Western. Well, Glenn Ford, Dashing Hero, former soldier, that guy will not take a gun again. He finally land grabber, Edward G. Robinson has set up, who is mostly the valley owner and it wants everything. Thereafter, there are frequent Stanwick, the real ruler of sleeping. Edward G. Robinson's wife, nobody will allow her to go, even Edward G. Robinson looks weak He is so bad that everyone is standing beside his blind ambition and brutality and to govern each other in order to rule the valley. People kiss him in front of him and face death. It's worth the wait. Leave a young Brian Keith and a few others and have a play on your own. Essential stamped, shooting-outs, hard ride cobbles have amnesia and close-ups and a heck of your western area. Before anything, enough mental counter attacks and turns, so that it does not fire only an ideal cowboy. Up
