Swiss scientist said. Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rothbone) and Dr. Morgan to save Franz Tabel (William Post Junior). The British government hired Watson (Nigel Bruce) He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately the evil Dr. Marie (Lionel Atul) is working with the Nazis and do not agree to get a doctor - and his discovery <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes was like a stupid concept in the 1940s but it works for a reason - Basil Rathbone The best she ever kept on the screen is Sherlock Holmes. He played the character so well (and accurately) that it does not matter which era of crime he is solving. For Watson as Nigel Bruce ... Everyone has problems. He took Watson as a fool to be a fool ... not the book's Watson. You're seriously thinking about why Homes keeps with her. Yet, he grows on you (in a way). Then Atul got a whale while playing with Mariyati - the talks between him and Homs and the war is just great! I did not like Dennis Heyy as Inspector Lestrade - he's so stupid. Watson makes a look like a genius. And the post is very good as junior tobel (Although her pronunciation is weirdly variable!). <br /> <br /> This movie has been completed extensively and has been running for more than an hour. Yet it is understood slowly and slowly and I did not understand the secret code section. <br /> <br /> Yet it is only valuable for rathbone and athul.
