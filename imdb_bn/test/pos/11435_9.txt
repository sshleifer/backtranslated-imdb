When I went to the movie, I did not have much hope. I did not know anything about this movie, but it was the only movie I could see, because I was in a small town. So I saw this movie and I was fascinated! "La Stele Che No Si'e" is a trip through the new industry China and it shows honesty! You see China's ugly places mostly and see what's really happening with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad but hopeful people. She is a naive Italian guy who can not believe what she sees. He is a Chinese translator who lost his son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny but poetic every time! An amazing movie with wonderful actors! So just missing one star!
