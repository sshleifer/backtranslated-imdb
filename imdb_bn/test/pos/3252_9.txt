Brilliant film! I want to say sorry that it is a little trick like me. It's like how it is with post-decoration era. For many photos only a gangster flick it is automatically compared. But it's a good writing, funny events, a common gangster who is similar to something from the family male, Tarantino, which is a good harmony! <br /> <br /> However, this film has got involved with a person who is mixing in Australia. With a hard core gang, and a debt and deep s * end it. For his assistance, his dead brother (someone who really remembers Val Kilmer?) To pay his debt and escape from those gangsters on his legs. Gangsters are cold blooded, but spend time playing chess and focus on their children's encouragement! They have difficulty in making a bank robbery while serving tea to their granny and what to do with their kids during robbery. So a funny gangster hit with laser good form (though I'm not a fan) and brian brown gang leader as a great stepping up.
