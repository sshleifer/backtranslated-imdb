Before looking at this movie, it is worth the emphasis on Hindu Pantheon. Three main female goddesses - Sita, Lakshmi and Kali, along with Transformers, three main male deities - Tomb Raam, Slave Krishna and Shiva Undarak are all taught. To make the public known as the audience of every audience, the public will enrich the story of the present tense. Indeed, as a part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the "real life" of the movie, a folklore was formulated at one point. "Fire" speaks against society's misogyny and homophobia, its producer is native and works with a beauty that maintains the message on multiple levels of awareness, it creates a deeply satisfying presentation. In the last ten years, I have seen this movie; Very highly recommended!
