This movie is a perfect action / drama / thriller, every scene you have to suck. I saw this movie and was surprised to see how talented actors are in the movie. Damian Chapa was particularly great, he played his role perfectly. The story was made for this actor. Let the characters make movies so realistic. This movie gets a plus from me very easily. Look at this film perfectly, compare it to the SkyFace, but it is even more deep in the story. This movie does not give you a better picture of gangster life but it gives you the character of passion, and in the end you really feel for the original character. Watch this movie !!!!!!
