The Childs Play series is not my favorite, but Chakir Bride is really good. This time our two dolls and their ex-girlfriend (when she was a man), Tiffani Together they go to a journey to find an object. The man is hit by a truck and is literally exploding, with some interesting scenes from the film, such as Chakhi and sex scene in Tiffany, and the end that allows the execution of other seagulls. Really was not a straight forward horror, it was a kind of mockery of many comedy mixes and horror scenes. This movie makes comedy well with many horror movies. If your child's play fan does not have any of it then all up
