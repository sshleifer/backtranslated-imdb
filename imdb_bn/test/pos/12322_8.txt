A fine movie They just do not have them more like this! We keep an eye on a high middle-class family in Dublin in the early 20th century. They are a hosting after Christmas dinner for their friends and relatives. Talking to their table is just an idiot who is lazy but it is very well written that one is mad. There was as a guest such as helping to create a close atmosphere playing some fine piano away from the dinner table. Perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player, here is the odd mistake this film will add to magic. No real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers.
