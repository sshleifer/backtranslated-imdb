I did not know what to expect from this. I always think that Left margarine and CKY crew are a group of perfect things to do stupid things to entertain. I do not know that they can work. But the performers in this movie are all off performance. 'Aaaaag' humor! The scene blinked with Ryan's right and her revenge against her ex-girlfriend perfectly. Sometimes the movie seems to be some scenic but at the same time they are funny I recommend someone who likes good smiles but this movie can not appeal to people who like a series of detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns.
