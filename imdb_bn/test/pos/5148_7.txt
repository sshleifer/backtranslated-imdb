I saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. Here are some wonderful details of this commentary by other commentators and they seem to have really enjoyed it, so I will not go too far to give a movie summary, but you can see a little bit of Woody Allen and maybe 50 small sketches of the film in the little Federico Fellini or The collection of vintage is integrated into a single conspiracy. Some of Vintet's are related to each other in their character and plot lines, but a corner bar is frequently used as central view where they always give the last call. Early and finished scenes have a common theme that bookmarked the movie. It took three years to film and most of the time spent in Sweden to find the most common and respectable people. Government deposits for best foreign language films for Sweden's 2007 Academy Awards This is a great film, but it is officially submitted for the best foreign film. Sweden's formal submission last year was very weak, but it's a costly appearance, but relatively close to Jos√©, so there is no scope for Sweden to recite Oscar again. This movie has its moments and has made a 20-25 minute short film, but it gets old and cold for a full-length feature film. Roy Anderson points out. Gustav Danielson cinematographer. Editor Ana Marda Warne has plenty of credentials for this job. ABBA reputable Beni Anderson gives an entertaining music score. This is an interesting movie of many humorous comedies and I like it, but it is not really something special and it can only be 7.0 out of 10.
