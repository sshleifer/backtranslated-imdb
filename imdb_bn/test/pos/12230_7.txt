"A fair to remember" is a completely derivative, almost ridiculous movie, but it has warmth that makes it an effective and enthusiastic holiday movie. This is a fantastic new person, Challenge Cates, a high-powered add-on executive, who is forced to leave a client who has rejected another client from Seattle just before his wedding. He has to transport and seemingly have no money to transport money from the beginning. This was the first stupid thing - was there any ATM? She has to make a fortune. At any rate, he shows a cab driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he takes him to his presentation and when he comes with a big box of garlic (client's product), he takes him away at the airport. All flights have been canceled so that they have to go to LA for marriage, they hire him to take him there. <br /> <br /> Aside along the path, they can be tied and learned from each other. It's a very sweet movie though it's nothing new - it combines "six days and seven nights" and a few other movies. But chemistry is good in stars, they are liked, and are good at acting. Guy's company head in search of Jeff Springer and a Kymo of Karl Malden. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie for the holiday season. It is life time.
