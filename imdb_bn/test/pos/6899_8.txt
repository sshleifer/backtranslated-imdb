I saw this at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and loved it a lot. This has worked as a little strange comedy for me, because I do not like horror, but I had a few minutes to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> The dialog was good, the clothing and settings were not close to the BBC-quality, which is amazing for an indie film. I like plots twists and even manners in the way, it keeps me surprised by the best ways. Even I was warm to the character of Willie Grimes, I liked it very early. It would have been better if the girl wanted any inspiration to be interested in going to the island. It was felt like a plat device. <br /> <br /> I love Dominican Monghan, and he did a good job at pratfalls, awful, and more thoughtful moments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This funny and unusual date movie will be.
