I was just lucky to find this fate. I'm taking Walmart's 5.50 DVD advantage, because I watch many movies (and rarely watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have a family served in Vietnam and many friends. I have shown the pain shown to me about this movie that has actually happened to my friends. I want to see more people in this movie - I think we can understand what happened to Vietnam when we show these wonderful actors in Vietnam's picture of the victims of this war. The story seems realistic - it is not difficult, but they feel what I have done. I think it helped Martin Shane and Emilio Estevesz playing fathers and sons - it makes their relationship more credible,
