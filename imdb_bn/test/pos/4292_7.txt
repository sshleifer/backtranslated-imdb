No car comes out of a village when an old man roams his bike on a street in a village street, killing him and driving. The rest of the picture hit him, why he was injured, and found out the results of the village's remaining parts of the murder. Isolated lies really a very British movie. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are especially British events, but the way to respond to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson James Manning, who is a hard-working, respected citizen of the "hard-high-lip" attitude towards the respectful. His wife Anna (Emily Watson), who is twenty-one years old, is more emotional, more emotional, and has more dramatic tendencies. <br /> <br /> The guy who really spices this sleeping village plays the playboy Millionaire William Bulle, a delicious Devil Rupert Everett (most American listeners will remember him as a friend of Julia Roberts forever, who is watching each other at my best friend's wedding Have stolen). In separate lies, Everett is cruel, cold, and selfish, but he is a complete blast on the screen. No, it's not exciting for a movie title (separate lies?) How did they end with that hair and forgotten title? Did they not have any marketing teams? Will they now care for people to see this movie?), But beyond the title An impressive drama about the power of forgiveness.
