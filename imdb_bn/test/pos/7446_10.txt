Square is really landing this one. They do not try to please everyone and instead focuses exclusively on the Final Fantasy 7 fans. And boy, they are going to be happy fans when watching this movie! The story can not be so interesting or credible, but it is clearly related to the story of the game and there are several honest-God-funny fun moments! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that the battle scenes are so difficult that they spend the diamond Could! Even if they really sucked everything and everything else sucked, it has made the movie worth the price. I mean, they are sometimes some of the best PERIOD made. <br /> <br /> See this movie. Bye <br /> <br /> PS: I have not heard reviews of my teenage girls. It was, like, what I intended to do entirely.
