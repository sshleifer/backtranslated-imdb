Flipping through the channel I was lucky enough enough to stumble at the beginning of this movie. I must admit that I grab almost immediately my attention. I love old films and should consider this or a classic! One of the most wonderful gems of this film is that the main character is not only a woman but she was also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie!
