I did not know anything about this movie until I saw it ... my brother actually offered me a look. Generally, his suggestions were not much police, but I was stuck to see some so I saw it. <br /> <br /> Well, to spend long stories, I can give it 10/10. <BR> <br /> This movie centers around two people while staying in the same place. Firstly dependent on the organization around it, another rebel. He liked what he liked. <br /> <br /> From the first moment of the film, we quickly see friendships in two buildings and they see each other a little different. This is an extraordinary work, which guides the good story without wrapping on the rope, people are jumping from the bath tub, or the superheroes are coming to save that day. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of rope and reality here, everything can not be done - not all golf can ever be spread - and this movie shows lots of fun. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and are not affected ..... I would like to suggest that you do not see anything again.
