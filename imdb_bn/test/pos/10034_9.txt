It is true that "they have died with their boots" George Armstrong gives a very fancy account of the life of the cast (Eral Flein) in life and career, but in particular the Little Big Horn is one of the best in the war. The 1941 film was not attempted to portray both America's American Cavalman and the Chief Chief of the Native American leader Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I often say that his ineligibility "Little Big Man" seems to be comparable compared to anti-caste positions. Moreover, the picture should not be confused by the title ?? This is not just a movie of Little Big Horn, it is a film that shows the incredible West Point cadet, the hero of the famous civil war, the Indian soldier and the last, but at least nine husbands. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the time of the castor at the Wester Point Security Academy, where its reunion and inconsistent behavior often causes the lapse. During the disciplinary military exercise, he met his future wife Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who himself is a custodian, a resident of Munro in Michigan. Castro wants to go to court, but the outbreak of civil war will call him. The legendary courage of the cast is shown in the sequence of war scenes, which is dedicated to his involvement with legendary South Carolina general Jeb Stewart during the most Gatesburg wars. While on vacation, he traveled to the court of Monroe and Elizabeth, who promised her in marriage. Shortly after the war, Castro and Elizabeth Bacon were married. <br /> <br /> With a civil war, the cast is demoted, the actual command is not available, and it has to be processed gradually for promotion. Small, professional American army. He started drinking, his wife intervened on behalf of his former General-in-Chief Winfield Skot. The custodian has been given the command of the American 7th Cavali, which he trained as an elite unit. Castor and Crazy Horse are better than war, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians have made clear the violation of the previous agreement and decided to build railways through Indian land. The custodian obviously admits the trial of Crazy Horse, but in a letter written on the eve of war, publishing a conspiracy of money-laundering and going to war to serve as a soldier. <br /> <br /> "They Died With Their Boot On," though short on historical accuracy, was like the war film and Westerns in the 1940s: Both Cast and Crazy Horses played by the lead actors, neither Indians nor Southern Confederation has been broken, and the mercury is just charming with beautiful Livvy de Havilland. The only subtraction, and for this reason, I can not give this image 10, in the description of racism in the African American people; Elizabeth's servant Kelly stereotyptical, overweight, good nature, superstitious black mamy It is also interesting that the film is not finding fault with Castor or Crazy Horses, but with the greed of railroads, companies impose a ban on American politicians with the semi-criminal system to break the promises made to American citizens. Just a few years later, the interim that American entrepreneurs may even think of remotely suspiciously seems to have been considered as filmmakers communist sympathizers. No need to say that they "died at their boots" excludes the fact that the aggressive strategies of the castor often depend on folly brutality, greatly increase the importance of its involvement with Stewart and before the Little Big Horn war Do not mention the lack of reunion. Nevertheless, his contemporaries saw the custard as his hero of war by his contemporaries and exploited something significant in the battles of Brandy Station, Gatesburg, Trevillian Station and others, although weapon achievements were not determined for civil war "<br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said,), and the positive views of Native Americans as well as bigger organs One of the negative, which can not be seen for decades the major Hollywood productions. African Americans for racial integration would be if it was 10.
