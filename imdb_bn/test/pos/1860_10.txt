Due to many confusion in Darwin, Pro and Con, I do not believe in the ability to recognize this film. I would say that the real man is pictured here without stupidity. He is what he is. Although the film is a snapshot of the man, touching the story of the story has expanded his life for years. It can deep thinking, thinking about modern life and how we think, and can stimulate a study of that person whose thoughts (and others used to be) have certainly influenced our lives. In the historical context, there are some films which are the primary tasks of the actors to stay away from the road. The history had taken hold of and the actors did their job. Good work for them, I say.
