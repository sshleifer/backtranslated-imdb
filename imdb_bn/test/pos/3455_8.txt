Reading I saw this movie during a special advance preview in Berkshire. <br /> <br /> Two of the main characters, Michael and Rory, developed a friendship, when Mary already introduced Rory to the residence of the caretaker. Michael is surprised to find a person who finally understands him, until his Serial Palace thinks that he can not communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduced Michael to the absence of her life. Rory is an impressive character, who does not let her condition (mascular's distortion) get her. <br /> <br /> They apply for imprisonment and free living and find a nice flat and assistant and they all have fun if they can ever dream. <br /> <br /> If you're behind some "entertainment" do not go to see this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is strong, the actors are excited and the mood is raised despite the sadness that has taken place with the film. <Br> <br /> I recommend it thoroughly. Although you may have something like me and weep, take tissues as you need it!
