This image easily competes with the psychological power, dramatic effect and top-achievement of "12 Angry Man". I hired it in a jolt and amazed that I did not hear it before. I do not know it's the first episode of Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but as well as the development of pissing, interplay and characters, some shiny camera work as well as a carvaganza, such as a natural eye suggestion to everyone. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Martin and Amilio is excellent chemistry that we have seen with Martin and Charlie at Wall Street. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her character's subtle frustration and escapism; One difference in his character is "to play in the Lord's field". He is boring and can still sympathize with one at the same time. In a few moments I think that this plot reduces the touch and moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend are almost another film, Estevez all come together as another character. But those small allegations. <br /> <br /> This image must be based on a true story or written by someone living with this experience. I find it a solid 10 out 8. <br /> <br />
