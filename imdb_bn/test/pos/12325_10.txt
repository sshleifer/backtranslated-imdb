I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I believe that this film is a "perfect" film that has never been created. Perfectly I tell stories, plot, acting, staging, camera work, etc. (This is a general opinion; I do not have any background in film production.) In many movies, perfect scenes such as Bartender presented a report with French film police officers. (Actually, that scene can play well for a short time.) The scene on the dead fulfills the whole film, perfecting it. Probably, John Houston sold his soul to create such a movie. Hopefully, Danielle got him out of Webster's contract!
