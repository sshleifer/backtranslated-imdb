You need to be in Japan to enjoy the beauty of this movie! I lived in Okinawa for more than two years, and North Hanosu 4 4. Believe it or not, what you see is a very good and accurate picture of East and West mentality, in contrast to East and West mentality, both are from the point of view of sport and personal relationships. It is better than a US that a fun, funny, and hearty movie can ever judge it. 10+ out 8+!
