This photo was a new direction for Natalie Portman. She also plays an adult role, although she comes to it from a child trace herself in the movie itself. Anne, (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who played her new divorced mother Adele, travels from a small town midway between Beverly Hills. These tortured souls try to talk with their new relationship, like their new life and Portman's character. Curiously at the beginning of Adel, he grew up and became a good mother for her. <br /> <br /> Anne tells her mother that she wants to be an actress, or she thinks so. Adele uses that crunch that has problems in their life. We see their struggle because the mother and the girls are left in their own house and left alone with their old life. <br /> <br /> Acting tops them both. They seemingly became the mother and daughter before your eyes. You can feel a bond outside the real movie. <br /> <br /> While this movie is not really taking us towards a new place in such movies, the acting is done well, and the story is not very flawy, let me recommend it. <br /> <br /> I would say, it will probably soon be gone, I do not believe that it may require stable power for a large Christmas season or so started season season. If you like this actress then watch it already.
