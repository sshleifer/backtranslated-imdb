Best wishes and even the first pick of the early days is western impressive; Other contemporary films of the same vein include Coverage Wagons (1923), The Iron Horse (1924) and Simron (1931) ?? What I did not see, even though I'm next to VHS. This film was filmed on a standard "fullscreen" ratio and a test widescreen screen called "Grandeur", but only Ben-Bone Fox was released in DVD; How to surmise it will see a larger proportion, but framing carefully ?? Not to mention extraordinary cinematography ?? Even "Standard" version is quite clear. <br /> <br /> Young John Wain surprisingly did commanding in the border (a role that did not lead to the expected starboard? In the top of the next decade, among the 'B' Westerners, John Ford Stagecoach [1939 ] Came to save her!); However, he and Marguerite Churchill (Dracula Dauuter [1936]) made a nice couple? Despite its somewhat tiring character. Supporting Characters include a variety of stock types: Old Western, Comic-Relief Sidekick (intelligently designed for their faces!), Intelligent and vulnerable villains (their acting of tiren power!), Their two small quarters (a Mexican and a Southner, Admitted to Wayne's rivalry in Churchill's hand), etc. Among the members of the Wagon Party, a fearful Sweden (hopeful of the Promised Land is full, but those who are continuously his damned mother-mother-in-law) and then Owen regular ward bonds <br /> <br /> This storyline automatically corrects more than one option, crazy and action-packed vignette? We see the material of potential residents, Indians and their own opposition; However, this film is completely pure feeling, smooth on its required dates and stability. Also, editing is somewhat sticky (especially during the second half) ?? Little wonder, since this movie's DVD version is only 108 minutes long for the 158-minute "Grandeur" version!
