I think cool talk and a brilliant show with very cool action. 2 men who pretend to be the master of women's temptation, show their skills at various night clubs and 4 experts (pickup artists themselves) make comments, choose the winner. Their joke is fun, and some participants are really fun to see. Much more, this show actually teaches men to communicate with men, many experts' opinions are useful, as you can see how it works. Actually I think this is one of the best TV shows and I totally recommend this to all men, who like women. <br /> <br /> PS / For my broken smell.
