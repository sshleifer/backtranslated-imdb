When I was hooked on the "JG" from the intermediate road of the 2001-2002 (second season), when I tuned to see "Smallville" 10 minutes ago. Thanks to "Start", I now have all the 2 episodes over tape but last night (episode 4.9). I am a middle-aged man, and I only see the weekly TV show. <br /> <br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a great handsome woman and fun and smart boot; B) Dialogue is very well written; C) It is flat-out ridiculous, too much rubbish as "everyone loves Raymond" shy. Most current TV comedys are very successful and have been influenced by the trivial insects, which are called "with married children", where they are encouraged to encourage the audience and feel superior to the characters. In "jje", there are errors of letters, but we can see our own foibles among them, and smile with them, not theirs. This is TV provocative, where writers challenge us to exchange fast-fire and with out-of-left-field pop-culture / literature / references to current events. I get an unexpected pleasure to watch these episodes over again, catching all the one-fishing and references in the previous episodes. Star Wars is his own little world, which I will be visiting happily as long as the series continues.
