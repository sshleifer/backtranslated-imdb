A good movie about a police officer and his wife caught in the murder case. It started off surprisingly, but hit a wall at a specific time. We are sure that we know what happened, then a small plot that appears like a red herring is thread-backed and frustrating. Nevertheless, the side of the Clujote is fantastic, and the act is very good. Marcel Korner drayle de drum co-star Louis Juvette also gave best performance as an intelligent detective. Farren wrote that I wonder if coins were influenced by the cinema brothers. Like this picture, the police officer does not appear for nearly half and then he becomes the focus of the film. There are many drill comedy around it (though sometimes its methods seem like a fascist).
