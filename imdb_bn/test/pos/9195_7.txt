Isabel has just gone out of jail. He decides not to return, but life is difficult for the former criminal, especially if they are homeless like Isabel. When he found his boyfriend Roofo, he could see the light of hope, but Rufo is not just a junky, but AIDS is sick. This Isabella will not surrender, because if there is a way to have a desire and he has a normal life with a house and a family, going to fight for his future. Most of the Spanish movies are unknown about a very difficult and sensitive film, the actor is superb and the story is very sensitive, perhaps a good treatment for the secondary characters can make the film better, but it's really good. I highly recommend watching this, but be aware that this is not a Disney happy movie, it's hard and dramatic.
