When I was in high school I read "Diary of Anne Frank: The Young Girl", and felt completely embarrassed in her story, and also with her in Broad Annex's Broadway game of life. However, I am a little annoying about how people felt about their diary and a person like him, seeing him as a saint or receiving the message of hope of the world. I do not think his diary was the original purpose. He originally wrote it for himself, even though he had rewritten some secrets before betraying the residents of Secret ante, which should have been published sometime. <br /> <br /> But I have never seen him as a saint or a messenger of hope ... but as a gifted writer who could have thought of his diary very good and very entertaining. There is no doubt that he was a very compelling writer, and he got a tremendous talent by fully expressing himself. You really know her well through her diary. But the importance of his diary has been proven that it is a convent and an important historical document to prove the events of Holocaust. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the sense, his young life was taken away from him and from other residents of Holocaust. It is a serious allegation of more than 6 million Jewish nation's Nazi-controlled murders, and it should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> I am sorry that her diary is getting more confused than it. I hope when I hope, I have the Bible ... the world's most widely publicized non-fiction book. God's Word is eternal in the Bible ... but Anne Diary is a diary of a young girls under the great situation, and that is He is not a worshiper or idol worshiper, because he was an ordinary girl with many flaws, who received incredible talent as a writer and died at the age of 15 from Typhus in the Bergen-Bellensen concentration camp. He is a victim of Holocaust, and otherwise extraordinary documentary shows so clearly that he is Hitler's most famous victim. <br /> <br /> Besides the story of Anne Frank ... the survival of the stories and Holocaust from his family members and friends was vivid, vivid and powerful. I especially enjoyed the witness of Mip Geez, and today he is still strong and alive. Hannah Bozler's testimony was very interesting. And I like hearing from Otto Frank. But I also agreed that the picture of the young girl with dark hair and the last known eyes were especially memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about Holocaust which I disagree with the documentary ... It does not believe that it is a matter of discrimination ... rather rather something deeper and more deep, and that was just a work of pure evil . Pure wicked <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
