I accidentally saw this movie in Paris. I accidentally went to the wrong theater and I realized that it was not a preview or a small film, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> <br /> Pauline did an extraordinary job to attract your attention to her performance. I could not say I was impressed enough how this real femme was deadly with his screenplay. The rest of the cast performed very well. Do not make me wrong, it's not always the greatest movie ever made, but I did not know anything about it. I left a lasting and very positive impression. <br /> <br /> Finally, France did not stop talking to France once! I stopped talking for 3 weeks after watching this picture.
