Rajkumar is not a comedy film producer started with Santoshi, and it's really sad because the only comedy movie she made is a wonderful composition. This film is really fun. Highly loudly loudly loudly said, really riot and character smile are really fun. A billiard girl comes to India to marry on the story line and two young men are silent behind her, the story remains a twist along with a gangster connection. I am playing a smart guy on the street, with Saurav playing the role. Fulfilled the role of innocent fools of perfection. Ravina fined, but Curseema has really become boring in some series. But Rashid Rawal and Shakti Kapoor's character of real steal shows, they enter frames and start to laugh automatically. Overall, an enjoyable movie that you can see on it. Bar without being disturbed.
