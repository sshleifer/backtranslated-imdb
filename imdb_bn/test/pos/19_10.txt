This is one of my three favorite movies of all time. My only impressive director is director Peter Yates, who played many scenes instead of acting together in the scene, but the performance was so great that I pardoned him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is absolutely incredible; Bright During the Second World War the theater (and what it was on September 30th), a very good picture rendering script is great. Many great, delicate touch, lots of wide, overplayed strokes, all of it perfectly accomplished. After the scene the scene just blows me away, and then there are impressive climax.
