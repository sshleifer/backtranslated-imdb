As other reviews say, there are some missing videos from this collection, but there is too much of what is on this disc. There are two separate soundtracks, a real recording and a completely new performance version. Any new music from the residents is welcomed and I think for the first time the audience can be more friendly, but I like the original recordings (probably only because they are "original". This DVD is produced amazing, new and old videos All the interesting, live performance videos which are probably offered are at least interesting (though the East Snippets of hidden live recordings as welcome as eggs are very welcome). It is not a hired, it must be sure to enjoy your collection.
