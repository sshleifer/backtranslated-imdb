Instead of going out of position and creating a realistic film about the drug addiction of Windy City, the opponent had decided to go on opposite path to the auto-primum and as far as possible to show his film as artificial, thus faced a men's fashion set. Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were making their photos all over the world. Nelson Allgren, based on the novel of the film, was scandalized by the record. What, one wondrous, was up preminger up, and why did not he film this way? <br /> <br /> The film set suggests a MiG Magoo cartoon so brief. Lewis, drugged, dressed as a gangster used to draw artists in Mad Magazine. Arnold Stang, the wonderful comedian he was, came out of the place in such a serious film and his appearance has become the most popular with an over-size baseball cap, laughing laugh. Rascal Strauss, another actor who is known for the humorous role, is also excluded from the place because his big, loud-sounding line and rhinoceros line of delivery seems more suitable for the film of Jerry Lewis. Against all of this, star Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Alan Parker have had to work overtime to keep the viewers from getting scorched. Sinatra is a bad and mentally suggesting a person who is easily ill with his life, so the role of drug addiction is absolutely appropriate. Miss Novak, a plant-like and supernatural depiction, he is sympathetic and he is a product of beautifully furnished objects. Parker has been working very hard as Pure Hollywood and Vulnerable and Cunning Zosch. He is not a believer, but then the film is not. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to America's real-life images of drug addicts. Calgary sets alone makes the incredible. Prummingmeyer was looking forward to the effect of the dream, because the cardboard backgrounds gave a nightmare to the opera with a stylish feeling, probably going back to the first days of Premminger in Vienna.
