It is a great off-the-wall romantic comedy about love, work, public anger, and the medieval crisis. The main character is a talented film director who has decided to make himself a shameless PG-13 movie keeping in touch with IRS. It's a nice throw, a wide-ranging fun (from the DeadPan to the slopstick), and the delicate text. This is the motivation of a film industry. Metocomentity has many nice cuts in reality and filmmaking, and in some places the film goes through harsh realities. The result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece in middle-class humor.
