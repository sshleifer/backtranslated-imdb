This film shows a deep perspective on the relationship between the mom raised in a Christian environment and the appearance of everything. He and his son, who recently returned from Vietnam, were very in trouble. There is no connection to the relationship, and it is a correct and correct illustration that lies with a person who is lying and shows only on the pages page. Cathy Betts does a wonderful job of portraying a false believer who does not want to forget, forget or just face her cruelty. Jeremy's anger is never frightened, and between him and her feelings creates a very annoying conflict in her love for him. This is a very honest look of some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads to despair.
