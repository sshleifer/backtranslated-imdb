It can not be believed that the Bowsticks Cup is not yet available in the right video or DVD. I only saw it once, despite closing the TV and not being a wand (thinks), it seems like it's a fun thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Where it was famous cast pitch, stupid coach driver ("Ponty-A, Ponty-that", "I'll take the next departure"), stupid plot; <br /> <br /> I am frustrated for some good British humor because of being stuck in the US, but the production body is not enough to spend the amount of money it wants. Come on, find it out in the Kosher DVD.
