I am surprised that the memento (which is a nice flashing) is very respected on the top 250 and it does not even appear !! What's going on To be honest - when this film ends my knee-jerk reaction, then the film is better than Memento. After gaining excellent ending warmth, I conclude that they equal their excellence. Why am I not confused with just 50 minutes? I'm going to guess an idea (sadly) it's black and white or because of the reason (sadly) that all of the characters have British pronunciation ... sorry because there is no reason to appreciate such a great movie. <br /> <br /> I am telling you that if you loved Mimito, then you would love to follow. Bright!
