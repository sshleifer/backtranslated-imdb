At the age of 17 my wife and I saw this. The only good thing that my father had (contact us). It is "Our Cinema" and the music "Our songs" Michelle's song "Our" song. Yes, nowadays, the crime of showing children to the nude, but we've been screwing for 16 years, why are these kids? The rich boy fosters a poor girl, then the rich child is born under weak condition, then the wealthy father steals him away from him. She is left alone with the child. This is a love story and a "rising up" story. Music is fantastic, and the story one can relate to anyone. Maybe this day the DVD will be released.
