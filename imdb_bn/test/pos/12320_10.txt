Visitors see for the first hour, pieces of ensemble conversation. Guests talk, listen to music, discuss recent opera premiere and make fun, sometimes strange. Slowly, the conversation is remembered by long-time friends or relatives whose memories never fade. <br /> <br /> This movie should be with you, it will drag you, listen to, and how the group's guests are saying, how they communicate. Focus on body language, when they look at their faces while going away from light, smile, and music, but does not actually leave the most precious memories where the titles die.
