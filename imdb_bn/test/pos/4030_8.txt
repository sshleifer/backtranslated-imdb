This hitcock tradition is a whodunnit. Suspicions come and go as you keep in the dark. A supernatural like Dennis Quaid Dexter, a man was lost to death and Meg Ryan was as nice as his child. There is not much to like this little mystery and all the pieces should be nicely fitted together. If you like suspense, do not be sorry to see it.
