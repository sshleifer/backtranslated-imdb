I'm salivating for sequels. I have to do something to be insane with my tension, anxiety (if it is not good!!) And insane with a permanent lack of information. I had to calm down a bit, some time to pass, of course, without the matrix. It was just that. <br /> <br /> I got it informative (such as the neck of the neck ...) and some of it was interesting. I gave Kerry-Anne a lot of pain when he said, there was only one bathroom and those boys were there. I found only one problem with it. Since 95% people were really men, they only let their mouth run wild, and there was language. It's not bad like crossing RedShop Redemption, but there was a scene that Kenyan is describing a bad day, if you're a little bit, then plug your ears. <br /> <br /> It was entertaining and it was what I needed. All Matrix fans who are going to the nut need to keep them cool. They mention a tiny bit about the signal, and someone almost gives some away, but he catches himself (time to shoot!). It gives you almost no spoilers, but if you have a matrix head like me it's great. <br /> <br /> There is no spoon.
