Abe Zwick nicely closed one, perfect. He did not make any other film, but in this movie, he has created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred that affects both the cast and crew. He presents a crumbling debris of a people broken down under the pressure of a growing meaningless life, screen command. <br /> <br /> Paul (Juque) is an old queen who is Stanley (Owen Croftford), who has blinded her eyes without any idea of ​​the future to follow her star. He is a small thief who recently increased hatred hate. He was forced to move to the suburbs of Miami to leave the city. As a camouflage, she dressed up like a dyke-up old blue-socks with many sexual sexual harassment as Church Lady. He told Stanley to tell his friends that he is living with his "aunt Martha". Paul himself has no friends, spent a lot of time in the house, and will face Stanley's dissolute lifestyle. It would be enough to cross the line between any people transgendered homicidal mania. <br /> <br /> Again, Geek Paul portrays Paul as a sad personality, who has lost a sense of being related to other people. However, there is a certain poem in her torment, which definitely burns the film slowly. He is sad, but elegant. This, finally, is a very sad film. It certainly has a lot of sunny moments, but there is a part of frustration and frustration that is humorous. This film is valuable for Abe Zwick's performance. He could really have built his career in Martha. Once you know him once, he is quite gas. Just cut off your hair and make sure to turn your horse around. He really hates!
