This one Randolph Scott Western is very difficult. He plays Bat Masters and goes to Liberal, Kansas to clean up the city. He was a great friend with Robert Ryan, who played a lot, played the role of direct leadership. So far, Robert Ryan did not play a very dark role. Actually, in 1947, Randolph Scott made another film which was not Western and did not do anything after the West until he retired in 1962. This film makes good pacing and firmly up to Climax. I could not say longer as I would give away the plot. Do not forget to see this one. 8/10
