This saw at the Newport Beach Film Festival. The film is really exceptional. The crowd I liked liked it with. Funny, ruthless and great acting. I try and tired of true Hollywood romance, who can relate? David Cranholds (Max) is really amazing as the super-screw confirmed and true lover of Grace (Natasha Lion, who is very nice). When we fall for the highest Grace we believe. Why? Because love is crazy at first sight and we're dealing with lost two people, and probably not crazy, soul. He also notes the notes and ronna archives as sexuality / sexy neurotics as both "roommates" of Max and Grace as Giallmo Diaz, in Shiabgaz, NY and before finding themselves. Do not miss this one, something special! The soundtrack under the leadership of Kevin Henne (Bucked Naked Lady Fame) is really super super cool.
