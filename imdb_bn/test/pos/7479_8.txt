Thursday is an original movie? Not a hack, but it's a lot of fun! I was buried in a movie channel in just one night and it was an enjoyable flick. I was expecting a lot but some interesting scenes (I liked the first scene of the store), some interesting stories by character and a few steps to move. Some of the best performances of young actors, Pauline Porrijkova was good and I was particularly impressed with Haroon Achter (who inspired me to further your friends 'and neighbors' and 'Irin Brokewich' to inspire more)? So if you want 90 minutes easy fun then go ahead and check out ?? Thursday '
