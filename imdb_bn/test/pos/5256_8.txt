Women are an intelligent film about women of all ages (but mostly 30+) and their problems in life. Not just men and unbelievers, family relationships with friends, connecting with others, problem of photo, compromising your values, success of life, and finding out which will make you really happy. <br /> <br /> It's also about being true to yourself. Many times, people will advise you but do not follow it manually. Sometimes they have created an illusion for themselves, and do you really want to follow the same path or give feedback based on your feelings? I really liked this movie. It has been speculated that it sometimes tried to be like sex and the City, but it probably helped me to choose. The difference here is that it was like discovery after the discovery of gender and city stars - here, mostly married or a man trying to find out. Now, they are trying to find happiness in their marriage and life. <br /> <br /> This is obviously not an Oscar rivalry, but it is entertaining and achieves its purpose. <br /> <br /> And for men there were equal parts of men and women in movie theater (mostly had their wife / girl girlfriend), and people were actually laughing. :)
