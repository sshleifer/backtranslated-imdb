I must admit to the unknown story of Cameron Diaz, and I was also surprised that he had an important role but he was not the leader. I touched it very much because I could really identify the pain of loss to a loved one because I felt it from close quarters. <br /> <br /> Both Comilla Bell and Jordanian Brayester were really good at their painting. The heroine Fobay and I must handover to the voter to find two actresses, who really thought that they were sisters (in real life). Not for Cameron acting and star star billing. It's one of the movies. He saw part of a decent, rebellious Hippie who wanted to change the world, though sometimes he came as a rebel without any reason. <Br /> <br /> The treacherous family has come from where his only strength is that his big sister believes, when the little girl Fobbs leaves the faith for Europe, it gets very upset. As she grew up, she went out and found her sister, and gradually discouraged her sister from the truth and fell for her sister's lover. <br /> <br /> Shooting around Great Europe and equally well positioned. It's back again.
