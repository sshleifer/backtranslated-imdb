Cristopher Nolan's first feature film was critically acclaimed by critics. It's a student movie with a real-life shot of $ 6,000 in a micro budget. The picture is shot in black and white, and the people you are catching are Nalan's acting friends. It does not say bad actors because they are pretty good. You can present Jeremy Thebald and Alex Hawke on other projects but unfortunately it was not created 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Bending thriller, many like Memento, do not play chronologically, it changes the scene almost as much as the Pope Fiction. The author is fantastic This is a great twitter thriller, but due to the temporary order of the movie being moved around it makes it more interesting. I think the last 10 minutes was particularly nice when everything started to become clean. <br /> <br /> In addition to a film of such a small budget and no recognized name it is so good. Hollywood studios offer and after three films, Nolan has been best cemented as one of the most exciting new talents in recent times (it's the best Memento and not quite good but still great insomnia). I can not wait for Batman <br /> <br /> This image is small and sweet and of course a great watch. It is very professional and twists are fantastic and completely wonderful. I thought David Julan's score was very nice, very atmospheric and it was a pepper quality. He is going to write other films of Naulan. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would recommend it, I would like to get all pictures of Nalan. This is a low budget jewel. ***** <br /> <br />
