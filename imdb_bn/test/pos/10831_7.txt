This is a war-time drama - WWII, French and Jewish and German, but it is somehow funny, sincerely so. Director Jean-Paul Rapenewoo was co-author of the script in his famous "Forest Voice" (2003). "Bourne repeat" (1997), "Bon Voyage" sounds as the title of his chip by director Bertrand Tavieri's "safe behavior" Urdu "Lysais-Pasar" (2002), Will Rolf Schubber's "Gloomy Sunday" (1999), or Weed Cloud Brie's "Lucy Retak" (1997) - C'est la vie (whatever) - and we have a nice talent thanks to Isabelle Adjani. It has its delightful performance throughout the center of attraction (and attention), its cause and effect, which makes the movie so much enjoyable. What is another isolation of hell, its plans and expectations - it will be thought again. The backside of the story revolves around one of the young entrepreneurs: Gregory Dangerier (like Francoz weighs 8 "women") like Frederick and Virginia Laden, like Kemil Outstanding Gerard Depardieu, Wicked Enamel ("An Actress in My Wife") and several star cast in the versatile Peter Coyote (here French, English and German jugging). <br /> <br /> A lot of characters are coming and a movie is going on in this plot, and how it can be glossy is an efficient skill that does not require analysis - Rapenio is simply a genius. The story is made solely on itself, one episode after another, even with overlapping events, but never confused - it makes everyone happy, the way everything goes to the screen in detail and we are all presented French sweet, literal. Thrills, tricks, tender, suddenly flees away and the turbulent runaway, all are playing before our eyes. <br /> <br /> Since reading the Director's note on the official website of the Sony Pictures Classics Forest Watch, Rapnew indicated that this was his most personal and successful work. In 1940, Bird's screenplay from his childhood memories was very close to his heart and he "wrote and rewritten the script for almost 3 years." In addition to the adaptation efforts of the director and his son Julian - Gils Murchand, Patrick Modiano, and Jerome Tonner, this movie is a great scripts for all love of love, a great script with directors and passionate directors and collaborative writers together. > <br /> The song of Gabriel Yard ("English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Replay", as well as in his earlier films scores), which provided a suitable theme which had the speed and the pace of the plot - almost like a train non-stop, Adjani reflects Vivian's vigorous energy (even when he is tired), which is fulfilling what comes out, with head There is always the head mtate and stylish dress, do not look back, let alone time for sorrow. <br /> <br /> Oh, do not forget the titles of the skilful, translated, amazingly translated by Ian Barley, who subtitled for Italian films: "Bread and Tooltips" (2000) Wuken Pen E Tulipani, "The Last Kos" (2001) ) Ur L'Atimo Bashiyo, and Tom Tiger's "Heaven" (2002). <br /> <br /> <br /> In 1999, based on the real story, Julien Kohler's brilliant performance in Germany and Maria Shadar as Jaguar.
