Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now I think Paul Scrador is the greatest painter of all time, but I really do not like what I've seen (without exception and exception), but it's a wonderful, annoying and highly rated 3-dimensional character. It follows the life of Japan's most famous writer, Yukio Mishima, with Flashback and his stories on the last day of his life. I do not know how, but Paul Shader guides them all together in a very artistic way. Acting is great, so photography, and a perfect score by Philip Glass. Although confused on the first look, these films have become rich with each visit. Really a film is an underlying gem
