I watched Uzumaki almost a year ago and became gentle. This is the only Japanese horror movie I have seen before, KYAADAN (which I proudly own in the DVD), fantastic! A city concept absorbed by the spiral sounds like something out of Lovecraft. Definitely it reminds one of the intimate shadows, the residents gradually turning into monstrosities (monster snails in this case). And the washing machine can forget the order? I hope we'll soon see one of the available DVDs (I've seen Sandnes recently shown on US TV, hopefully they will do it again soon) so that we can all see it. Highly recommended !!!!!
