The story of a Spanish paraplegic truth, Ram√≥n Sampedro, fought for decades for those euthenized rights. The same year, with the million dollar baby winner of the same year's best photo, the film made the people of the year want their script to die. Supporters for both the disabled and the conservative pro-life group both (for unfortunately disabled supporters) protested and nominated their Oscar nominations. The nomination also took place during the time of Terry Skiev's disaster, only to remove it from some historical perspective. Demonstrations, especially from disabilities groups, some ideas against million dollar baby ?? The film is clearly illustrated, without deprivation, and being helpless. The central character of the film, Maggie Fitzgergard, has become a pedagogue, does not seem to suggest any advice, there is no help, and wants to die immediately. The film is honest, very stupid and incomplete. Based on the true story, the sea must be more thoughtful on the subject. It has often got railways in the same class like a million dollar child, even its protesters do not even see it as incredibly ordinary. The reasoning of the film gives the parties different time. And it immediately declares that the desire to die is only one of the heroes and heroes. Although it is guilty of some offenses, I still understand why it may be a problem with the disability groups. First and foremost, there are plays of dramas with a paraplegic bishop. Please do not look like I was portrayed. Her verbalized wheelchair is portrayed as irrational, and in almost a comic sequence where her spirits, boy-toy employees, are dragging her to her chair, her stairs. He could not even reach Raman's room, and one of the girls was forced to continue the conversation. It seemed as if Ramon was in a wheelchair-accessible family home, but the whole life would not be spent on the bed and life could be full (who knows that this film portrays reality). Director Amebar (others) has included some ridiculous scenes that try to make this movie more prominent about suicide, such as cross-cut sequence where Raman thinks and his lawyer's baby is born. But without a few ugly moments, the film is very good. It can hurt anyone who can die when others bring so much joy and insight into life. However, to the end, our lives belong to us. Do not we have the right to choose? The film's powerful asset is its supporting character and its acting actor. It describes the battle of Ramon and how the decisions around him affect a beautiful accuracy. Especially the family members were great, and Raman's final departure from them was absolutely heartfelt, and I had tears. This movie comes from my favorite actor Lola Duenas, which I thought was good, or at least certainly the most valuable, last year played in Aldodvar Volvo.
