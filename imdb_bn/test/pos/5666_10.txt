<br /> <br /> Georigino is a weird, dark, emotional object; Welding is impressive, Plot Strong, reminds me of the story of AdGar Bo. It's probably not a great composition, but it's our strong image, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion, and it's a sentence that leaves everything in mind: the wolf is coming. Georizio still forgot, and after liberation nobody realized it. It's a shame. If you have the opportunity to see it, well ... try it.
