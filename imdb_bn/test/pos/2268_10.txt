What a basic piece of work I've always enjoyed the "Actors" Liev Schreiber, but now one must appreciate the people of one multi-dimensional level. How can he get that field of sunflowers? It was computerized, it looked realistic. And how do you dog myths are you going to get that kind of performance? Is there a division for the academy animals? I'm guessing that what I'm saying is that I really really enjoy this quirky, offbit, little indie film. Cinematographer (some beautiful shots) from music (bought CDs while coming out of the theater), and of course two from "D" (Directions and DOG) from excellent cast (Eugene Hootz was not a pro actor). All a "10". <br /> <br /> /
