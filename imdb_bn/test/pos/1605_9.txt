Starting from the end of the film, director Viccanti has achieved great achievement in his industry, the amount of films that are guaranteed to be a cultural treasure, only God knows how long. This perfection - as a movie, but the story has some minor flaws. <br /> <br /> Thomas Mann's novel is also the perfect part of the industry, so it is impossible to bring in any other media. Visconti follows many to follow the story, and only when he allows himself to deviate slightly, that infection falters. And how wonderful is the visibility, despite the tension in the air, hundreds of fine signals and metaphors, despite almost helplessly rendering Maheller's music - miniature obstacles in the plot disturb me. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just the victims of the will of the person who was lost. However, I'll give an example, which I'll consider as important. <br /> <br /> WARNING: Spoke Chess <br /> <br /> In the story of Mannan, Ashechhe could eat strawberries that would probably kill him, after leaving his frustration in Venice boy Tadzio. Fail to realize one's pleasure, he has decided for others - which makes him poisonous. It's very fine in the book, but it's there. Banned fruit, but one more sign of it surrenders life. <br /> <br /> She used to eat strawberries in Visconti's film, but instead of the beach it is impossible to see. The back of Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It also works, but some nausea, in fact, and multi-layered symbolism, also provides food for thought. <br /> <br /> But this is all forgiveness, when this movie encourages us to graduate, mouth and constellation, and of course many other symbols that we can possibly position - the last gesture of Tadijo, standing water, equally glorious And the mysterious end.
