While watching the remnant, I'm hoping an exciting movie with a big name about a controversial topic with actors. I'm not expecting a movie that was so exciting, exciting, poetic and sad that I picked it up and did not let me go even after leaving the theater. A word of advice to those who have not seen it yet, enjoy not enjoying this movie (or enjoying) in your politics. Take it for what it is. I saw it with my conservative Jewish family (I am a black sheep, a pseudo-liberal college student) and I think they will write it as "liberal publicity". Instead, they said it was a great movie with great performances (they themselves prefer to play movie critics). <br /> <br /> It is tragic that a film like this will go on the market by its Oscar-approved actors continuously out of the new talent as well as continuously underrated Sarsgaard like Metwally. The whole cast stood better than others, gave good performance; My only problem with this is that many characters that do not allow for many screen time for each letter. In fact, I felt that Fatima was famous on screen as part of the "sub-plot" and Khalid Anwar's story. <br /> <br /> All characters have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but they do not do a good enough job to give the actors a depth with their little screen time. Strip is not a real horror, innocent Senator, and as much as I do not want to see such a terrible role in actress, it is impossible to believe her. Guilenhall, perhaps one of Oscar's for this film, probably seems somewhat uncertain about his role at the time. H is trying to illustrate his internal conflict, but usually comes exactly as his line is forgotten or do not know how he should feel. The cheerleader gave an excellent performance; Its unforgettable conflict with strip is one of the best parts of the movie. Metalli was, again, awesome, and I hope to see him in more mainstream films. It is embarrassing that perhaps Guilenhall got his nomination earlier. Iglal Naur, shown on IMDB, has already made several films but he is a new actor in my eyes. He, along with Mohammad Khous and Jineb Wukach, all played great. <br /> <br /> The stories of Fatima and Khalid have not been commercially credited, but it brings tragic humanity to the story. In the end, we were not explicitly told that the description was interesting as long as I was trying to connect two stories genuinely. I read some comments here that say love story was in vain, but I do not agree. I think it clearly shows controversial issues and in general the other side of humanity. Khalid was a real terrorist, but he is doing this for his brother's revenge, and even though he is responsible for this attack, you see him on humanitarian basis through Fatima. I do not think that we will feel bad for the actual terrorists, but I think the "we are all people" theme was certainly relevant. <br /> <br /> Regardless of your feeling on terrorism, politics, etc., the theater. The following line is an interesting story with a message that we all have to hear.
