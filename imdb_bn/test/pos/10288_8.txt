All the achievements of writer / director Gilles Mimonni who created this tornado, fuzzy stories of deceit and betrayal. While maintaining extreme control, he maintains arm-length viewers, sometimes not allowed to be aware of them. Even you have guessed his clever intelligence. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> Jean-Philippe EcoPie supplies power to her supportive role. Plot description or character can not be given specific explanation. <br /> <br /> Theory Arbag camera effectively uses us to remove this disguise, and the editing of Cardin Biggerstuff keeps our story one step ahead. Peter Chase's theme is excellent by getting married to the ideal of marriage. <br /> <br /> Many people will say that Gilms is trying to face the deepest issues on Mimoni love. For me it's simply a scary, incognito puzzle that weaves a compelling web. Only French is able to do such tantalisation. Hollywood has destroyed it with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday, March 2, 1998 - What's Crowden <br /> <br /> Nobody is thrilled like French. When they fix it, they really make it right. <br /> <br /> Vincent Castle is the catchy Mac like the new Lisa, emotionally romantic in Bohemia and Monica Baluchi is mysterious like the first Lisa. Gilles deliberately cheated the plot from Mimouni to a cyclone and fatally cross the wire. <br /> <br /> All credits will go to trick manipulation of its plot, and go to performances from three leads. As Lucien, Jean-Filip Ecoffey is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
