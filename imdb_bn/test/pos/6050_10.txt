Semi Fi! I saw "D.I." After seven and a half years in 1957, I joined the Corps. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The web and company got it right. Boot, in '59, actually, the boot camp is shown as "flower metal jacket" - yes A black assignment is called "snowball" in my training platoon. I was called "stick" because I was skinny as a railway. Every hiring nickname was a little bad name, which was stuck with him in the service of the Corps. Getting smacked, or knocked on your ass, when you were sop up screwed up. "Drop, and give me fifty," Ho-hum must be. Then, turn it, "drop, and give me two hundred!" <br /> <br /> DI was a bunch of sadistic bastards, but it was a controlled sadism, and a primary purpose of keeping us alive while fighting our stupid MoFos. 200 years of experience "Tragedy", and D.I. , Or said, its purpose was a motive purpose. <br /> <br /> a bad d. Eye. Grunts are killed. A good D.I, although seemingly the world's largest asshole, keeps alive. If you die, you can not kill the enemy. <br /> <br /> If you do not know, Marine Corps has an elementary mission: kill the enemy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
