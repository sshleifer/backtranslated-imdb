I was waiting to see this documentary, which was considered as the most entertaining film I actually created. These 60 black and white films are being grown on most LA stations in LA. I also remember the show on Friday night, which was known as "Wonderful Tales of Science Fiction", which displayed a different cyi flick every week. This documentary spent much time in the opinion of four famous filmmakers and their opinion about the classics of the film and how they used them as inspiration for filming. <br /> <br /> This is not the case I was hoping for this documentary. Instead of a brief highlight of the most well-known films of the era, it can actually be a comprehensive test of the decade. Anyone who has studied or been interested in this movie is well known about standouts such as the War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, The Thing, The Lord's Stuff, etc. I liked to see some parts of lesser known movies and probably had some interviews with people involved in making this movie. My viewpoint was very attentive to the speakers' opinions and my War of the Worlds was a commercial kind of new liberation war.
