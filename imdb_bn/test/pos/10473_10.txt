I can not think of a movie that holds the concept of grace more well in religious feelings. The well-established theology of a small congregation, their leader was very scared after the death, they plundered the thing they had preached: grace The perfect gift of Parisian cooking talents comes back to them by calling on the love of each other and an old man worried that he has ruined his life. CHOICES is a central theme, as well as grace. At the same time, artistic gifting is acknowledged as a powerful, extraordinary role in everyday life, and the coming of life. Improve or ignore impossible. It's altering a message to hear its message.
