My girlfriend, when we go to London in London on the cold summer of Leicester Square, after the film, saying: If they can not speak English and they do not show stadiums, you may think that this is a South American city or any other object in the world, NYC- Not queens at. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani, now my official hero, does not think he has dedicated his work to the other side of the Americans, but the real face of America <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> Romin Bahrani's movie Laadri de Bischiklet, Germany's Annual Vacation, Roma City Aparata. The Chop Shop reality became a movie, it is more realistic than a documentary, I think Rabin Bahraini films are more realistic than the documentaries. This is a great movie, but do not expect a car charging or shooting. This movie is about the sad life of the world's richest, wealthy country.
