An ordinary young woman from Golf Haun is portrayed with a simple triangle taken in a lover's triangle, she played with love with Walter Matthur, she won the best supporting actress Oscar for 1969. <br /> <br /> The film, however, is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely, have we ever seen him in comedy, and he literally has highlighted his Hill as a dedicated dental nurse who insists on Matthu's plan that he is getting married. <br /> <br /> Matthew and Bergman are so delighted to see each other here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ron Lanze also gave enough support as New Year's Lover.
