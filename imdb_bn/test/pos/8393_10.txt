This was best with the wind. I love this movie. I could see it over again. Scarlett always gets what it wants and does not cost. He tried hard after forgetting Rite but he just did it. She loves her a lot. This is true story of true love. It went with the wind and ended in this movie. The only real way to end this film for true love. Scarlett and Rite must be together again. This is how they ended up with their daughter together. What else can you ask? There is no better ending than this great love story. What else can I say about this great movie?
