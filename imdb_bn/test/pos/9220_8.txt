Um, hello .. Rainbow Bright .. The name alone is hard to accept, as he can be a cousin of Strawberry Shortcake. But when you are a child it is a serious matter. So, this is a brutal, graduate, humiliated girl and she wants that among other things the Rainbow Brights belt, that is, the light of the entire universe, and Rainbow Bright and her friend Chris are bound and determined to stop her. I think this generation of Murky and Lurki had a small role. Maybe they wanted a lot of money <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Snowy, the evil girl has a strong jewel and she gives the channel the ability to take the belt of Rainbow .. imagine? But anyway, Rainbow gets his belt back and gives strength again with "star hole" and Chris and his prism bracelet cut off bad girls' butt, and they also protect the whole world of this process. <br /> <br /> Good success on the temple, surprising on the oddity, and Rainbow Bright and color kids are again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind.
