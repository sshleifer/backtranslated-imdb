I watched this movie a week ago and had to inspire me to come to my friend because this movie got so much bad reviews. Certainly this is not 'human traffic' or 'lock, stock ...' but it is not a flop. I think there are so many big budget movies that have been ignored but this should not be. I guess it sets out to do what it wants - a half hour leave our entertainment and our happy and satisfied feeling. I think that 'mummy' is boring, that I go a lot more and see it. And no, I'm not a teenager. Do not listen to critics, fans of Star Wars. It is very good to see this picture, just look for the fantastic Look De Lacey and Rupert Pantry-Jones. See it!
