This image is a tape, a series of portraits of Rome community woven together by music. Due to the lack of spoken dialogue, it is not a composer's film, and no dialogue is necessary for dialogue structure. Some people might expect a plot line of "customs, dress, and music" in the national jaggraphic story or some central character - do not search it here. <br /> <br /> It's a portrait that colorizes people instead of telling a story, a family of people. Story by story through the plot (Andalusia from India) and / or time (we can not say) No need of description. You get an idea of ​​a delightful people, strong links in strong communities where social interaction is extremely important. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The torture that these people have faced is the tail, and still face-to-face.
