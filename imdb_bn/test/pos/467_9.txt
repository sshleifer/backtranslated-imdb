When Garman was collecting funds, I actually considered investing in this movie. I like most of the script but do not want to end. Gorman was emphasized as was the end. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see the whole movie. I could not act to read the script (and German's instructions) as strong and as it is going on. Two Leeds did an amazing job. They were very credible and this movie is only worth seeing for the performance of these two amazing stars. <br /> <br /> Now, for the hijacker and if you have not seen the movie, please do not read more then need to watch the first movie. (I really want that I could never read the script so I could enjoy the movie after finishing my first hand). <br /> <br /> ------------------- <br /> <br /> <br /> I have two major problems with the movie. First off, and I'm sure when I read the script, I've mentioned that the wife died. When he was dead he would be more credible. As it is, we have this man who 'has been protesting against a woman who left her many years ago.' If she leaves him and she is still in love after this, then she must be seriously confused. But he does not come across in the script. (Why did not he spend all these energy even after the wife who still loves her?) <br /> Plus, if the wife dies, we can actually believe that their love, love rewards, and so believe that the man It has been destroyed in the last stage of being reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, I can not afford what I'm going to do in the end. Believing this treacherous girl, I needed a firm assassination (a prostitute was very na√Øve but trustworthy because of her performance) she did what she did. Character is simply not cold enough. And if he does it from some kind of love or something else then there is not a whole section of the movie / story. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is "Sex, False, and Video Tape." I think it could become popular if Garmon chose to finish this film more credible. <br /> <br /> So watch the movie, enjoy the performance. And up your own mind.
