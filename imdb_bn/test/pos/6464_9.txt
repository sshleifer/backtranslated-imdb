This is an extraordinary movie that deals with the problem of racism in a delicate and balanced way. Great performances are all round but absolutely outstanding by the Sydney Poitier. <br /> <br /> She makes this movie breathing and living. His screenplay of those people who are fighting against discrimination and violence is reflected in the mind. Her performance is forced and subtle and fine at the same time. True to the Oscar's genius, Piketar had to wait many years before (due to his skin color) to be recognized by his Academy of Perfect Talent Academy. <br /> <br /> <br /> Recall, it has become its hallmark as troubled and realistic. She and Poitier incredibly cowards, transforming forces through humanity through courage and friendship. <br /> <br /> The movie is enjoyable and at the same time described the racism in the United States in its deeply haunting. The satire is that it reflects some kind of reality under which pottery works.
