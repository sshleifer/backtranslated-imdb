Bobbyt Shroder played "Mandar by Numbers" starring Sandra Bullock, although it is not particularly compulsory. I am a big fan of Sandra Bullock, and he is not effective here as forensic detective Cassie Mayweather, who is very desired and a broken person too. However, the structure of the story has a sense of intrinsic isolation. It is the throats of two harmless socialists, Richard (Ryan Gusling), who is great, and Justin (Michael Pitt), who is a sympathetic gaik Basically, Richard and Justin kill a young girl, because there is no good work in their school night. They are very smart and very arrogant, which is not usually a bad thing, but it does not work here. Tony Gayatan's script does a great job of describing a confusing murder investigation and it is actually the numbers We have these two punk kids flaunting their superiority, and we just want to take them down. <br /> <br /> This is not a great search on the dark side like the "forward of reversion" of Sheridan about Closer von Bullo. "Number" has interesting changes. The film is not so exciting, but rather Casey's characteristic research. Sandra Bulk Casey's brutality, the fear of letting people stay with him, and balancing his secret past. Bullock brings courage and energy to a tormented character. His partner and type of love interest, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is a tremendous plot than a real character. Although Chaplin is not very commendably taunting thing. Another nice touch is Richard and Justin being involved in a weird sex attraction. The most interesting thing about "number" is peat and gusling. <br /> <br /> There are many entertainment twists and turns throughout the movie. Everything is done very efficiently. I watched the movie almost a week ago, and when I saw it, I loved it a little more than this. However, this is not just inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Brubbet Schroeder are a lot better, and so we deserve.
