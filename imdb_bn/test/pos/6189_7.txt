The slip cell pool (terrorism / patriotic Muslim Americans) tried to swim both sides and it is not very good. <br /> <br /> I have been watching this event for a long time, because I thought it would be very predictable, but after one year in my netflix row, I finally got it forward. <br /> <br /> This event is a secret Muslim person who tries to enter the FBI working for a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The secret agent of the event is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflicts / resolution in his patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally I saw a drama about a Muslim American family living in the United States, but it is a suspicious thing that America's TV channel (cable or network) will never create something that will show Muslims in shining light. <br /> <I'm not a Muslim, but I have many Muslim American friends and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love America. <br /> <br /> The slipper cell comes close to the buzzing of the Muslims, but it focuses on the worse Muslim style. In the first episode, we see an "honor killing", which is a very bad representation of Islam, but in the third episode we see a respected medieval Muslim scholar who shows that true jihad is not necessarily a personal struggle by seeing a viewer <br/> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> A little bit, but it's what America's audience needs to know Much less. <br /> <br /> It is unusual to say that this play is unusual, and the drama is very harmful. If they do this program except Islam's terrorism in America, it can be the first rate.
