Dead Gentlemen Productions considers their budget to put together a film with amazing production value. Anyone who played any role playing game, especially any fantasy RPG (they will play Dangian and Dragon in the film) will love this movie. Brilliant performance around - especially with the dual nature of the policy, playing their players and their character. Anyone who has ever acted in a film film or played a role in this project would appreciate the amount of work and love. This movie (and its preview) is among the fantasy films and roles that play in the blazing sediments - the highest order parody. I only made a couple of minor complaints about the movie, none of which will prevent me from buying DVD as soon as possible (only 6 weeks - I'm counting the day): <br /> <br /> 1. While speaking to Zonana about joining the logo gaming group, she gave him a copy of Dangios and Dragon Players Handbook and said "It will tell you what you need to know." The camera has become too long on the book shot, and the moment looks like a commercial. <br /> <br /> 2. The trick is hilarious, but they are un-socially scattered throughout the film. The last third of the film, after its previous visible and verbal laughter, is constantly slowed down after a barrage, as the story is hugged. Strangely, but the burning Saddles always hit that way along the way. . . And I love that movie too. <br /> <br /> Disposable nature of romantic mistress is a power in the story story. What will be the girlfriend of GM? What will he go back? Or will the three maintain a platonic friendship, deeper by the role-playing camera? (Yes, which seems uncomfortable, but there are a few moments to watch, especially when Kas and Lodge are "made" at the end). But the film spreads within a week: on condition of human relations, these questions can not be answered in the week . Character relationships have been indefinitely excluded, you strike me better than most classic choices to see in most movies, such as the girl gets her prince and they can remove the castle, or the princess sank after three triangle north Atlantin, tedious, and expected hours. The authors really seem to be an acknowledgment of psychology of character, and you can change the course of the characters (both gamers and player's characters), but not suddenly, and incredibly visible. <br /> <br /> I want to hear more knowledge from Brother Silence. "The man standing in the dark ... fluorescent."
