Of course, some boom mikes do not mean anything, does not it? Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and d'Urville Martin really put this together? I am very happy, often in these movies, but I do not know why I wanted to laugh because I laugh at many other things. I'm not saying the movie was bad, but I would say that performing a little more will do wonders. I'm a huge fan of blacksplatting, so I do not think it was awful, but I know that the "human tornado" was much better than that. I think those who can create this movie can postcolor 45 or two later. I mean, it helps to see you again when it does not target boom mikes.
