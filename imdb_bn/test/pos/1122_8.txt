This is a decent effort for a B-movie martial arts worker. Ian Jacqueline, who is a North American cruiser wet kickboxing champion, has led himself in the lead and action scenes. Muscle Matthias Hughes has the opportunity to add more bad personality to his martial arts than many other people in his film, and if you are a fan of Titanic Titans, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renie Griffin is a romantic interest in this movie. He started with the attitude, but soon began to fight with the hero and they made "very barked animals". It's a very stylish fashion. <br /> <br /> American traditions fight scenes are good (no Hong Kong acrobatics here!) Beni with the reality associated with adding "Jet" archives to John Larson (Jacklin) trainer <br /> <br /> < br /> All of these pictures seem to have the most sub-plots in its style to get a story more.
