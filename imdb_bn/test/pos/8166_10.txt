Above all, I want to say that I am not only a native and a native of my native language to comment on movies, but I feel compelled to write about such a movie; Probably as J. Cox, thank you and congratulate the crew and crew for such a bright product. <br /> <br /> I saw "Latter Day" for the first time yesterday. At first I thought it might be similar to the "favorite" movie, which I liked so much for showing a gay priest outside the house. But "Priest", probably due to limited statistical ideological concepts, did not supply the needs of my audience by expressing the identity of my deep audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Presenting a flexible and delightful story, it leads to a happy and emotional end, and still awakens the feeling of God's blessing and hope. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a beautiful gay love story!
