Ghoulies 4 is a pretty ghoulish sequel. The horse looks very different from the first three ghoulies, but still cool. From the first movie of Ghoulies, there are some excellent flashbacks. Jonathan is back in this one again. He was not part 2 or 3 though. Low budget in the movie, but fun to watch. You've got Tony Coxy as a dark whirl and arturo gill. Inside this movie is really the same as the first three good films in the movie. Excellent funny characters in both movies of Ghoulies. Then you got a very hot Alexander! This is a great dark comedy and fun! Ghoulies Cinema enjoys watching any fan Ghoulies 4. DVD is finally coming out this July 2007! Hopefully one day the ghulij third will be a DVD in the United States. I really would like to see a signal from this movie one day. I doubt it will happen though. It is now 2007 and no sign of any sign yet. If there is a series then I hope Jim Winroski will make it. <br /> <br /> I am the fourth one to 9/10
