David Suchet Agatha Christie's Perfect Detective Group, Hercules Pirot. "After the Funeral" produced in 2005. Does anyone who heard David Sweat speak with his own English accent? Does he know that it is a shock, because his utterance like the pirot is so perfect and biological. Suchet Agaga Cristi's book Pirates, and even though I acknowledge love for Peter Ustinov in this role, there is not much that Christian wrote about his script. <br /> <br /> In this episode, the friend of a solicitor of a pirate is asked to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. Journey to the train, describing events after the death of solicitor - will separate a strange expected heir and the person's sister will announce that he was killed. When the Poirot family meets, he disguises adultery, many secret, discover the other desires and murders. <br /> <br /> The story is excellent with a wonderful, detailed illustration of the rich production quality and duration. All played well, especially Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Here, besides Pierre Hestings, his beautiful office, or Miss Lemon, he is effective. <br /> <br /> I had a special opportunity to see David Sucre in "Amadeus" at Broadway. Exciting An actor - when he is playing Piroto, then I can see every pirate.
