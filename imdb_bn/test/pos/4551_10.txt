Peter Seagal's 1995 commercial hit and now the civil-classic 'Tommy Boy' is a ridiculous movie, an ever-ending entertainer. Chris Farley is a talent that we will never forget !!! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story, which is most fun and easy to say. Farley & Spade is a journey that is filled with unnecessary smiles, even the part of Rob Lowe is a great fun. As a kid, I often remember to see 'Tommy Boy'. This is my childhood darling, and it will always be there. Even today it is T.V. When I came in, I was stuck as a die-hard fan. I'm pretty possessive about this film. <br /> <br /> Seagull's Superintendent is super. Chris Farrell died in 1997, but at least he is alive for me. What actors! See his work at 'Tommy Boy', he is very easy. Afterwards, she did a fantastic role in the film 'Berverley Hills Ninja' and 'Almost Heroes', but her work remains as her best date here! Love, Farle! On the other hand, the spade is just as good as before. He is an excellent actor of all respect! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' rules ... this 100 writers from the author!
