Charlie Chaplin's writings, produced and directed, is a great actor for Adolf Hitler, scaring pieces of Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> The Spatial Image of Chaplin Tannya, the dictator Adenod Hinkel and Jewish sailor Hynckel. Hitler's parody brilliant. Anyone who saw Hitler's newspaper newspaper must surely recognize the curiosity's eerie. <br /> <br /> I think the movie started slowly with some common chaplin slang-sticks, which attracted attention from the events of the First World War in the first Jewish sailor. It was never seen before the first confession that after the first 20 minutes I was so surprised that what was the mistake. But the movie takes up steam faster. Some very funny moments and propaganda points have given considerable importance to the Jewish nature against the "Hankel-Ism". At the end of the film, Chaplin's title of this movie is an impressive anti Nazi speech. <br /> <br /> This picture is just as good as Chaplin, though I think Jack's whole thing was stolen, "Bacino Napoleoni" playing dictator of "bacteria". Our first appearance at Oki shows how well he studied his subject - he left Mussolini's arrogance in the background. The scenes of Hankel and Napoleon's discussions about the fate of "Osterlich" cut me into pieces. <br /> <br /> It was a very good movie and was good to see.
