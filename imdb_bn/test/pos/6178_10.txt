Czech WW2 pilot center ?? Old Frantisek, calm piano-game Honna in the childish impulsive karel and background. After the film was opened in 1950, the war ended and the Frontycek and Hanja were imprisoned in the Eastern Monastery Prison. In their Soviet-controlled country, they are 'enemy of the people'. Manja became seriously drunk by her communist countrymen. <br /> <br /> In 1932, many pilots escaped from German-occupied Europe and joined the raid on their way to England. In spite of their high motivation and experience they reluctantly raf and British rigid upper lip face. Finally, they fought vigorously in Britain's war. However, Frantisek and Karel will be strictly tested when their friendship falls for both of the same woman. <br /> <br /> In terms of romantic sub-plot, this Hollywood production is similar to Pearl Harbor. However, the topic of the last fate of the film and the Franciske has been given, treating the treatment of two men in England and the Polish RAF pilot can be seen as a British treatment: They are easily forgotten after the war is over. <<br /> <br /> Also, the film is much less understood than Perl Harbor and characters are fully realized. Dark Blue World also scores scores in terms of its stunning galaxy dogfights, are manufactured using a mixture of ruthlessly modeled, actual exterior-action airy filming and 1969 epic expelled from Brittal War. In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that shocked Pearl Harbor's choice. Highly recommended.
