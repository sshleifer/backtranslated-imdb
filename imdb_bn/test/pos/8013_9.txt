After watching this picture I feel a new sensation. I saw a movie where the main actor played a role that almost challenged Chavy Chase in the role of 'Flech'. These performances do not seem comparable, but both of them effectively provide flawless distribution. Mark Singer is the actor! Singer Jack Ford, 'Divert Gunner', titled 'Aridis', earns the rewards of the living man. Some mutant, helpless pleasure Dorod (!), A Scandinavian runner and perhaps a half-heartfelt endeavor class or even globalization or statement ......... well does not really matter. What about the picture in the dry system that the lion delivers its line, so side-split humor! What is important about this movie is that director Fred O'Ren Ray realizes that serious science-fees rarely work, and it is not good to take yourself seriously when your budget is frustrating. Olin Ray said that everyone involved in this movie was funny and was transferred to this movie. I have dared you to criticize a movie that will portray the world in the future as dark and neon-enlightened and then 'pipes and valves' warehouses. Self-parody is a very redeeming quality. In short, Fred O'Nehen is an ambassador and Mark Singer's lead to the production of independent films, the lead of the perfect B-movie. If only he can create a draft for the equation in Ray Team Thomson, but we have a movie.
