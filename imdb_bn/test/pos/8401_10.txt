My God, it was a fantastic film. When we see it, it moves to "WOW" other place. Roth and Scarlett played wildly by Johann and Timothy. They did a fantastic job to correct the role of our two dear Heros. Everyone! This is a must see ... do not deprive yourself of this movie. If you love to go with the wind you will love this mini series. Go Rhett !!! Go scarlet !!!
