All right, I think we all agree that Michael Jackson is less points. <br /> <br /> and special effects But, please note that this is not a big budget movie, all right? Every film budget, like Harry Potter or Star Wars, does not get as much budget as it gets. <br /> <br /> But I think it was pretty funny. B-? My opinion, your opinion, will not waste time. <br /> <br /> Paradies are always fun, and this is not a big budget because it is not bad. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good movie, if some points are weak. <br /> <br /> This comment helps. ~ Angela
