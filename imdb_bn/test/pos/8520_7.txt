Yes, it is playing the bond again, Shan Connery, when it was known as "Thunderball" in 1965, when the film was alive for the first time, it was alive and participated in any part of it. But Connery is not engaged in a few obsessed strategies from Roger Moore, his friend and more ridiculous heir, if the tongue is so strongly a cheek in the cheek. <br /> <br /> Moore is my favorite bond, but Connery makes a strong case for yourself on this unusual trip. The only serious bond film "Never Say Never Again", produced under the classic Yan Bond series, is a well-deserved return. Soft in the workplace, it is still firm on character and clever dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bond, it's clear, a humiliating man. How many times he has saved the world, his new boss feels a little bit of his fat lifestyle. "Many free radicals, this is your problem ... because lots of red meat, white bread, many martins can eat." "Then I'll cut out the white bread, sir," the forest shouted. <br /> <br /> The first representation of the movie represents the high point performances of the movie, with a bond and an attacker fighting their way through a kitchen, a bedroom, and a laboratory before bonding finally blames their rivals, who are from these free radicals. Without a little help. Threats are often applied to Moore's outsourcing, but mostly with cleverness outside of Moore, although it seems more humorous to send himself to Moore's less arrogant example. <br /> <br /> Was it because he was a good share of gross? Or is it working for less stingy producers? Whatever the screenplay, its style-back style works well, and it is rich and more entertaining than the previous two Ion bond oats, "You Only Live Twice" and "Hiras Forever" <br /> <br /> There was not a good decade for bonds in the 1980s, whether it was Connyor, Moore, or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmth, video games and ugly sports cars are all proven, and Bianca Jagar does not give any benefit to the Sunglasses Claudia Mar√≠a Branduir wearing her first scene. Forget the first impressions. Branduir's main villain, Maximilian Lorgo's role is one of the best in Bond films, Branduir enjoys his character's mentality and Mania. At one point, he allowed his condition to move around inside the room for release of bonds and his dance became attractive to the company engaging between eyes and crazy. <br /> <br /> The best thing in this movie, except for the condoms, bond girls, bond movies are more closely related to personality than bedroom, painter Douglas Sloakome and director Irvin Kishner's rules. Barbara Carrera was nominated for the role of Villaines Fatima Blas for Golden Globe, every bit looked crazy like a largo and even looked at Nicar. She did not finish the whole movie; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A rare beauty of basing, this first role as a concubine of Largo lifted the bond between me. Combines incredible warmth with small weaknesses and many doubt. (Her lips and cheekbones are very sweet, too.) <br /> <br /> This is not a well-made film. It's a wild story, a terrible score and a flat end to imitate a good bond movie. But the Connie has, the strong decision of the film's definitive secret agent is proof, even if he stole the page or two from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is quite entertaining, so I'm not complaining.
