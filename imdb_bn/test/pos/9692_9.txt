First of all, I want to tell most people who do not like these comedies, if you have an open mind, then the movie is not great and is not afraid to smile at some stupid things. <Br/> <br /> This movie is shot only on TV shows, with many small clips compiled in a long movie. Someone who does not even have a dialogue in some scenes and does something unexpected and it's funny! My only negative negative feeling was my popcorn and I was wasting money in this case, during this movie, I could not eat or drink any food I always used to laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, and Viva la left, then watch this movie for your Sake. <br /> <br /> And if you do not like the first movie, or TV show. Do not see it, and do not post a bad review if you see it. Hard Christians who see this and bash it just does not seem to me.
