This movie is one of the most memorable movies I've seen. I recommend it to those who are uncertainly recommend with a Turkish friend. I'm not a very enthusiastic supporter of music documents, but when the law is forbidden to ban a Kurdish woman for a few years from a Turkish singer, the theater is scared. I would give all of this to hear a CD recording of this hunting, gorgeous songs. As well as speaking about the experience of Istanbul, he has interviewed and recorded many artists. Even a month later, I remember the footage of Ayanur music in the oostik auditorium, and I reminded the song and tried to remember the song. This film is with his director Fit Akin and his cosmic city has a great idea of ​​capturing many brilliant words. It will certainly encourage you to visit Istanbul.
