If you like 1993 (boyfriend, science-fiction) cybercrime film "Nemesis", you would love it. A few minutes after the hero of the Alvips Pompaddie came out with a samurai sword. Like "Nemesis" it is a post of apocalyptic material in the future. Both police thrillers, where well-armed heroes can take action against disciplined insurgents, to resolve conspiracies against the impious people. But the matches are similar to that. The dead or surviving obscure mayor tries to keep the public from selling medicines sold. Tenants help by tenant and a cyborg, try to break his suffocating to his subject. After some unsuccessful attempts to return the rebels, he sent his top police to the killing of the rebels. This movie follows the trail of most adventure, but is not afraid of color outside the line.
