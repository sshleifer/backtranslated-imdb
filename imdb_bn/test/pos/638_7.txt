You enjoy the mystery of this movie. Mourina Juddina is a silly illustrator that adds her pride and mystery increases. The appearance of Alec Guinness was beautiful, but did not really add to the movie. I'm not sure whether Ian Richard's endeavor was to try to humor a part of Andy Clark, or he might be just fools. I was cinematography excellent. It is not only with the production quality, but also with the mystery. The bathtub seen in slow speed with water droplets was wonderful. The knife goes down and then it works very well to spend extremely rare part of Andy Clark's meat. I would call the overall good entertainment
