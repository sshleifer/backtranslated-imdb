Lead actor Yuko Tanaka is so fond of "Milkovinine" in a special meditation on Misskumann's memories of some of the 50-something women in his routine list with seemingly impressive intentions. Acting in Nagasaki's beautiful, quiet city, Akira Ogata's incomplete romantic movie, that is, the spontaneous melodrama less than the deliberate spontaneity of her characters, which is not a preference for them, due to a tragic past. <br /> <br /> A middle-aged woman named Tanaka Minako Ob, who, according to the tediousness of the essential world under a vain routine, took it upon herself to supply milk bottles among the hill residents of Nagasaki before moving her work to the supermarket. To build such a house, she is constantly in the house, Kait Takshashi (Itkuku Kishveh), local local employee, whose ultimate sick wife (Akiko Nishina) is taking care of her. Minako and Kaita fell in love with high school, courtesy of an illogical incident about their parents, since then courtesy of different ways. <br /> <br /> His film will never leave Nagasaki before opening with a predecessor of a young Miracova pledge, as Ogata describes, gradually sticking with Minacao and following with the help of Tanco's minimal but highly effective performance - she Whether his aunt (Misko Watnabe) is shouting as soon as she is single, or when she jumps up and downs to the hills Distribution of milk harake numerous steps - such hurdles as he and kayata gradually over several years, which puts them away. This kind of development is not suitable for viewers engaged in fast-moving musical instruments, but for everyone, it is a sincere surrender which is powerful and strongly influenced.
