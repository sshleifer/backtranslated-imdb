This is a tricky and entertaining film of backgammon to choose Jonny Carson's heir to the Tonight Show. However, the final thesis of the film, due to his controversial nature, was ignored by David Letterman's high quality comedy divisions, and this display decreased by a poor J. Leon's throne on television's leading comedy program, which both Leno and Letterman could see for themselves. Strict and simple truth just as the NBC fix says "J Lenny is the most fun person in America". And not David Letterman. Once you realize this, many of the machinations of the film became irrelevant. Finally, by the Letterman fans, the whole movie is selected by a little more than the yeast grapes, which do not like comic only, whose business is known by such things. The final evidence is that, despite the leadership of Lettman's early leadership, Lenno's shows have become consistently popular due to hypotheses arising out of the war for succession, probably tonight, in this way, I think Letterman's demands are inappropriate. Her legal succession robbery
