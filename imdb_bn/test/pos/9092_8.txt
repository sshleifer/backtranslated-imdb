I wanted to write a review for this movie for some time, but now I've only managed to get my ideas for thinking of others. <br /> <br /> I never had the pleasure of watching it on the big screen, the film is shameful, it is often visually stunning, but I've reviewed it several times over the years for the video, it enjoys it every time. This is definitely more than my favorite list of favorite movies and more than just playing Caf√© Bourbon and Kefar Sucreland, my two actors have to keep an eye on. <br /> <br /> I probably appreciate this movie because it appeals to the entertainment of my little closed-heart taste. I like a bit left of my movie center - unpredictable and fresh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The surface layer of the movie was not seen before. They were technically caught, 'Why will light a light under a subway?' Or 'why do medical students pull such stupid stunts?' Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that do not give logical thinking, but if you are willing to suspend unbelief, it may be a very compelling film. <br /> <br /> First, a note about the artistic quality of the movie. Some people complained about the dirty lighting, and the illogical nature of sets - but for me, inventing negotiation techniques, plastic and winter wrap, set of old home unusual settings and dank, topping tunnel, idol, rain and building screen - everyone in this film is a poetic Adds to the smell, a hunting beauty that is about life's dark nature, death and forgiveness Is sought in. <br /> <br /> I'm just two examples; In a lane view, a change in light allows certain elements to come into focus dramatically, then it goes away after returning to normal condition. It's an innovative way to move a moment into 'reality' and works nicely. We see the inner interior of the character's apartments - Clustered consonants of warm wood, bright color, golden light and lingerie, the white void in Nelson is the opposite. Both letters are reflected in themselves. The lack of Nelson objects reflects the lack of knowledge about his past. And his carefully built mask that puts a distance to his companions. His past, we come to learn, one of the chaos and conflicts. He was determined to leave behind in favor of an uncluttered Empty. Unfortunately, the emptiness also reflected his relationship with others, he realized with his personal journey of spontaneity in this movie. <br /> <br /> Flatlines is not your ideal horror movie. This is a common drama or suspense movie. Rather than being more integrated, it is the best component of all the genes involved in a complex, suspicious plot. <br /> <br /> This is an accessory part, and throwing an excellent job of breathing life into their individual characters. Your immediate impression is that the characters are represented by a well-established `stereoType ': female ice queen, little neurotic' healer ', faker and socially aware' excellent people 'etc. However, the film is progressive and the characters have become more brighter, they accept multiple levels and depth. <br /> <br /> Nelson is a character who can not be easily liked - actually he is a bit of a B ** tard, a master manipulator who is definitely another Keep the place of interest above all. Yet, Catherine plays with an indication of insecurity that gives him a specific appeal. As events are revealed, you realize that Nelson's unpleasant personality is mostly a smoke-screen, a protective mask that hides an uncertain and weak young person. <br /> <br /> Nelson's complex personality, writer, director and cast throughout the film, releasing bits and pieces, slowly leads him to greater understanding and sympathy for you. The character started as 'Jarac' becomes important and valuable in its own right - as you learn 'pardon' his previous behavior in the light of new information. Your journey of discovery with Nelson reflects letters moving toward self-intelligence, because they also realize that everyone has the value and everything we do is all that we can do. <br /> <br /> which leads to my final comment. Although many posters have been highlighted on the theme of the death penalty. Some people have touched in what I see as the main point of the movie - the importance of forgiveness, and the need to be aware of what you have to do, because it is' matter. <br /> <br />
