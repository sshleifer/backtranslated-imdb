To visualize the story, I saw this little background today. Go to the movies as I escape, leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". I find it a great movie, not great, but found better. It was my money and my tears were worth :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane was always wonderful, Richard Gere is not an actor. He was his own and his presence was that we always expect. He came with his style in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is a love story that is not always called. It was dirty and had other priorities, but they wanted to stay together and wait for each other. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend it!
