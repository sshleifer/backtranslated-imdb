I recently saw episodes 1-4, and now can not wait for 5 and 6! (I heard that they are coming soon.) The commander's log seems to have become a civilization with the taste of the comedy of Quebec among the crowd of the university and all others. It is obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken to open the script is quite clear. In fact, the simplicity of the show praised me and played more. A master of Bowlsby put-down ... I just want to remember the best for the next use on non-compliant colleagues! Let's just say that if you do not like Commander's logs, I personally will see that your Andy will get additional starks!
