For a feature film, the plot closely followed the history - or at least the historical Gospel. But then Sugars repeatedly illustrated this story very well, otherwise they would not tolerate it. The detailed attention is wonderful, especially anyone who has read the accounts of Sima Kianan in history records. According to Sima Qian, before Jing was unified, Yen's Crown Prince made an attempt on the life of Qiu Shi Huang. Sima Keane is clearly the head of the General Fan and was fired into the bronze column as well as traveling around the map. Although Jing is not described as a stranger in the sword, yet he is a strange fighter of the chain of Chen Kej. Jing is actually the weakest link in this photo. In reality (again, according to Sima Kean), he was a heavy Madina and stopped for a tour of Cuban as long as possible, before the Mujahideen could spend his time spending a good time with Yan's women. . He was a man in a short time and was not waiting for death even though he was willing to accept it. Chen Keizer was afraid of Jing's death, but not his own. He turned classic ruthless killer psychic pacifist. Jung can resurrect alive alive for his love (or only affection) for hundreds of children (even two thousand years of Confucian historians claim that Qian Huang has done it, although he has a legend about Burial of 460 Confounds and then shirk him ) This former killer is enough to kill again. Melodrama is not believable and the end of the character ends up being plain rare. The acting is not shabby here, although given the character is not very interesting. For Lady Zhou, I've heard all the stories, Q Shi Huang, she never came. However, Gong Lee was famous for the Americans (thanks to Zhang Emo) and there should be an interest in love, so he is here. As a militant figure, its structure is often unfortunate as a wood. She is getting very good (in Qiu Ju for example) being fine; Here he only handles the presence. But all of these are trivial compared to Li Zhuigian's extraordinary performance as Jang. Qian Shi Huang is the devil of Milan for us, which is for us: it is acceptable as a fame, but a great person. Quali's achievements have scared all the way throughout the two thousand years, and Lee has highlighted his horrific wishes without his human understanding. Lee's performance is not enough, but the film's offer is grand but photography deliberately shit. It seems ancient. Score enough, though the action is very suitable though moving. Although I once saw it once, I believe that Chen Kyz should give more credits for her camera work than the other critics give her permission. The opening credit is pleasing. If the average of five stars, I gave Lee Judaean's acting and Chen Keez as the actors, writers and directors.
