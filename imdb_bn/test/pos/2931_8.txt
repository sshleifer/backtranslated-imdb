America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their employees, but recently I got bored with it. Cycle 1: Yes I'm happy, Adrian won, I wanted to win him at the beginning <br /> <br /> Cycle 2: Very bad, I think Mercedes deserves it. Cycle 3: I did not like Eva, but I do not like most girls in this cycle <br /> <br /> Cycle 4: Kahlen must win. I do not know what I saw in Naima, but I certainly know what they saw. <br /> <br /> Cycle 5: Like cycle 3, it was not a big cycle. But among all the girls, Nicole as the winner? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I could not fold the shadows of the circle. 8: No, I did not want to win Jaslin. I did not like him. I saw more than the other chakras in the chain, although I did not see much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> Good show, I've seen it many times to like it too: D.
