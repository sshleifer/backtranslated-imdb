My brother put me back in the 70s in Karlin. I always liked his observational humor. In other words, looking at every day and finding humorous questions, "Have you ever tried to put out old waste baskets? You can not do it! They keep bringing you back!" And the question is asked why the word is more acceptable and discusses the word "F" in the private sense. <br /> <br /> However, in the 90's, her staff was less fun, and there was more anger. What she did was a mirror in the face of society and said, 'Look!' At this point, his show was less of a comic show, and more of a gripe session. But to justify all he always made sense to an extraordinary amount. She really thinks you <br /> <br /> Here Karlin was old and new. She could become old and have fun after about the fun of slamming the world situation. Make a perfect sense again. <br /> <br /> This was its best since "jamin" in New York, and it's over. <br /> <br /> I think that 'Whitist' was John Wain or Robert Altman's A Primitive Home Companion, George Curlin's 'It's Bid for Yaya'. A true great Icon is a loving farewell. Love him or hate him, he seems to be remembered.
