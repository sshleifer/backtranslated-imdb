Strangeland seems to be a love / hate relationship with many of its visitors. I personally liked the movie, and everything about it. <br /> <br /> Some locations can be developed on acting, but can be played where filming is added to the environment. In some cases, the dialogue is a bit impressive and dramatic, but in reality, what do you expect at the end of the 90's? After all, D did a tremendous job to believe in what I saw as one of the most horrific thrillers. It can play for fear of age of many ages - adults, parents and children. Every parent is afraid that their kids will be very involved with the chat room and meet strangers from the Internet. And it does not happen * real world. And every child and adult fear is abducted and tortured against their will; That happens in the real world too. <br /> <br /> If you are only aware of sensitive issues like strong violence, visible torture and grave, if you only know * you would like to see * this * movie. If you are not sure if you will entertain this movie, then read as many reviews as you can read, ask people who have watched this movie and are ready to stop the movie at any time.
