I joined IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this photo, but I can sing it. I have never heard of this movie (it is packed so horribly so that why it can be easily seen) but a good friend advised me about it and I was very happy. This is a film a gem. The actors are superb (especially Kathy Bates and Meridith Eaton) and they really look like having a fun time. Surely it was a bit higher up, but I can not remember that for the past two hours I smiled so hard or many times. If you love to laugh, you give it to yourself to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
