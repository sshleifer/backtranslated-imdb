I recently saw the Kuayakan blind spot, where it created a huge crowd and a little bit of bitter discussion. I really admired the story and the visual approach. The action is amazing and loneliness mood movie projects are amazing. These three mischievous heroes have many beauty around that depression. Not just in the desert, but in the town. The boy discovered his friends in the apartment, and then the road with all the wonderful lights of the city on his skateboard was my best scene. You really feel for this guy. I've never heard of actors before but I liked three things. I think they did a horrible job of self-discovery on their journey. Above all, it's a cool cool and suspicious mysterious film. I still carry a lot of images to my mind.
