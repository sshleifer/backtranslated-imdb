A few days ago I saw a video of Paul Thomas Anderson, where he expressed interest in pornography, and how the industry could make a better film, and ultimately, not a genre in the genre and video tapes. Paul Thomas Anderson believes Bert Reynolds in a great way the pornographic character of the acting character. His name is Jack Horner, whose director is the biggest dream to make "real" movies that can make viewers feel exciting with dramatic stories and, as well as, beauty? And with "big cocks and tits" Soon he met Eddie Adams (Mark Waharger), he believes that he has found a new star for his films. And thus began the story of young Adi in the obscene industry. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the people as part of the life of Edd and later we can see them outside the pornographic industry, their daily routine lives. But soon we can see them in pornographic art and after only one party, the story of the new Adi begins, the story of Dirk Degler. They all will get the real success with Dirk as the main star, won a lot of rewards, and Jack will help develop his biggest dream with a series of Dirk's new character Brock Landers. This kind of exploitation is a tremendous success for the film, and for Jack's first "real" films. But here before and end of the "horrible 80s" rock and roll for $ EX, DRGS and Dark and pals But we all know that additional people can destroy a person and a single disconnection can destroy an obscene porn star, and here the film is about their vision of how the film has successfully succeeded and how it has a real bad time with many problems due to the bad looks of their society. Draws A period with porn industry and many excesses. After the disappointment of Dirk, in the music industry, after trying and failing, there is a great continuity that can start entirely with Dirk and his friends. This is a sequence of his first drug treaty with the presence of Alfred Molin, which ends in the world. Funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and pals but if you go back and get back to the Dirk, then back always have a solution, Brock is back. <br /> <br /> I'm not the most referring to the characters in my summary but I must say that everything is amazingly improved. Cast is fantastic with the best performance I have seen on Mark Walberg. Julian Moore has a strong performance in a really moving character; Raleigh, Messi, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman etc. All their characters with memorable, funny and sad moments. Finally, I really liked the amazing cinematic style of the movie in the late 70's and early 80's in the porn industry. I said, "Magnolia" was my favorite of Anderson, but right now, after seeing everything except "Sydney", I can not say that I am loved because I love them all! PS: Somewhere I read that this film is Anderson's "Scholarship Film". So I'm sure if you like "GoodFellas" and "Casino" you'll love it too. I love f * cking "Boogie Knights"!
