Niagara Niagara certainly I did not see the best movie. However, how I felt when watching the film and it felt like to end and I can not describe how I feel about it now. Very few movies have such an impact on me. Whether I like them or not. I see Niagara Niagara as an artist's work. We all see something in it and it can remind us of something or it can awaken fear or funny ... this movie was not the best mood for me. Actually it left me feeling empty. I guess because life under these two people was so empty in many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction was any direction. There were many problems to deal with them and I can guess that to move away from what a happy life might be like. But the way things have really gone really bad. It's a steady decline from the beginning. It was very bad, because it was a great job and I guess we saw someone in some situations that might be similar to those people in the situation. If they have any idea then they may have a better life. But by cleaning it they do not know what to do. So they have heard about the Rumblr star in some places. No real goal They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how they could overcome the life they had been living before. I felt bad but could not stop watching movies. Only good actors can feel so much about me in a movie that I do not want if anyone shares a part. These two performances did a great job at the point you did not see. I am very impressed and want to buy movies when the DVD is available. You know It left me a little feeling like leaving Los Vegas. But again it is in a class of its own. Not a great movie, but worth more than one or two weeks on the right day. If you are a person who is having trouble, I do not suggest seeing it. It may make you sad. It made me depressed and I did not have the condition of these folks. JimmyJoeJetter
