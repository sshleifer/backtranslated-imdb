Ramin Bahrani set up the first scene of Chop Shop, which immediately began to recognize me, where Alle (Alejandro Polanco) and his friends are coming. Two of them reached the souvena and as soon as the doors were closed, they asked whether they could pay attention for a moment, and they sold candy bars or M & M or some of them and then sold them a few times. If you (like I) are at a subway in New York City, at any time, you often do not notice this situation that often happens. Often, people in a subway sell or sell children or some children and talk about something in a page and do not pay them any money. Baharani's focus is not only on children that sell goods for sale at subway roads, but living and being one of the lower classes in America is the case. Immediately after that, in his hands, thoughtful and heartfelt, usually once. <br /> <br /> It is not too long to compare with a pixel or cyclone thief (actually, at least parents and sons have each other), although Bahrani has his purpose in documentary style We care about this character Ali, there is no more than 11 years old and some cars are working in the cleaning factory shop and helping to isolate others, and his sister who is with her from outside the city. But this is not the only reason that we try to care for each other as well as brothers and sisters (more brothers), because you know that a clinic is being fed forcibly. Ali makes the Bahrani story accessible by achieving the target achieved in its condition: Ali and Ishaamara save enough food to buy a used food truck that can manage themselves. <br /> <br /> All are working for Ali, but how Bahrani shows us cruelly is what Ali must do to do this task, even if his boring things are tired of cars or steals at a time at the Sheeha stadium. Is a great moment a purse? A desperate trucker wants sex for a man in the night, and seeing her sister for money on the night, it shows a more serious problem. He does not mention it and does not push it aside, but he always adds some excitement, some Ale wants to protect him. When it adds to the tragedy, Ala finds the real cost of spending food trucks for making profit maker, which is an expense that only connects internally to the fingers. <br /> <br /> Any movie in Queens area was shot as a work of dance-reality (allowing it to call reality), in this way, Alec could look at an orphan in the neighborhood. Virtually all non-professional actors in mechanics and workers and people in the street - Baharani is paying more attention here and now, and so makes the chop shop so quick and hearty. There is no trace of the Mölödram in the movie, just music music coming from Latino music directly from cars and radio. Occasionally Bahrani focuses at a very delicate moment that speaks in the following scenes, such as Awal awakening, but Isharra falls asleep on the night of the night after being witnessed and we think that he probably falls on the bed. She knows awake but can not say a word. Or, in many other scenes, poetic touch that seems stupid, such as when people show how pigeons work, how they work. <br /> <br /> Give it a lot of hope for its main characters, though it is rough and great, as you can expect, and not spray it in a few moments of happiness. It is a nicely shot-handed film, where technicists, such as urban set tones and many movies made in the process, know about the things on the screen and what they are doing and appreciate, but it is never helpless shot or very flashing. The filmmaker has an extraordinary 'real-life' cast (Alle is locked with NYC public school without any experience) and does not know how to break the shot, simultaneously achieve a cruel art by showing what he shows. This is not the city of God or the Pixot; This is its own small composition on a character or character, we will not normally see the second scene in our way in cities like New York (or the first only). If you are not moved by Ale and her daily struggle, I do not know what to do for you.
