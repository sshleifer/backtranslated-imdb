In 1949-50, Hong Kong established a "very splendid thing", and a story about the relationship between a white American journalist Mark Elliott and semi-Chinese semi-European doctor Han Lin. The Match-Race love love story was a bold theme for fifty years and, often, Hollywood tried to brighten a white actress, which seems to be the non-Caucasian women in white color, something that is considered politically wrong today, but then Was acceptable. (Think, for example, the casting of Woody Eva Gardner at Natalie Woody's "Shaw Boat" or "West Side Story") was a way of exploring racist elements in the British colony, which would create less controversy in America. Sunin lost her job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British superiors were dating a white man, for that reason she could not get married because her malicious wife would not divorce him. Sometimes in the case, European colonialism is made of whip boy for America's failure. Imagine the furore that Alabama has made a similar film about a black or mixed race female doctor in the hospital. <br /> <br /> In addition to ethnic issues, the film raises questions about international politics, mentioning both China's ruling militants and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suin was a real person and a well-known author of time; In fact, he was determined to support the Maoist communist rule, but here he is firmly shown as anti-Communist opposition. However, this is not primarily a "issue" film about ethnicity or politics, rather a romance, a good example known as a "woman's picture". In most cases, such films made by male directors were the target of most female audiences. They love and romance-often unhappy romance - from the point of view of women, and leading role was a powerful female character. This genre often plays the role of older actresses than the romance heroes of the genre. Earlier, the examples were usually in monochrome, but usually they used to be, like here, snowy, rich colors. <br /> <br /> Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress was more convinced in the role, however, Jennifer Jones, a very good job as Suyin. I think William Holden is rather unusual than Mark, but it does not matter as Suin's very dominant personality. He is more screened than Mark, and the film examines his family and professional life more than that. Though Jennifer was still very nice, she was in her mid-thirty years, rather older than most romantic heroines of the time. Holden was at the same age, often for a fiftieth year when "the daughter-in-law of girl" often refers to "the older man meets the girl". <br /> <br /> The picture is not particularly deep, but it is well-made with somebody. Attractive photography, especially Hong Kong's own, reflects the growing trend for enemies in place of the studio set. Sometime Hong Kong looks so beautiful; The city's visible mountain scenes carry special meaning, because Suyen and Mark go for a romantic appointment. Overall mood is a mood of ruthless, perpetual romance, atmospheric photography and musical score, one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 7/10
