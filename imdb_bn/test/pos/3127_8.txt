Some Galpokas help a group of Mormons to cross some rough country in the new place. This low-western Western for Ford is unusual in that there is a great lack of it. Johnson gets top-billing, but he's basically a helpful introduction, though he and Kerbery work well together. Instead of providing love interest, Dr Best acting Ford is offered by Dear Bond, playing Mormons leader. Actually, this role helped him play an acting role before his impossible death at the age of 57, at the age of long-term TV Western "Wagon Train". Ford, with beautiful cinematography, considered it one of his favorite movies.
