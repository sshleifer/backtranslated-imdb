The "Five Fingers Death" has begun the fury of the American Kung Fu film, but it seems that it is the first "bad box" in China's Chinatown, New York, as well as bad dubbing and some Americans. I was lucky to see American premiere of "Five Fings of Death" in Times Square, New York. This has turned into an opposite ... the same movie but different audiences. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this image took more serious sound to the audience. It made this movie more credible (heard) by listening to the real voice of the actors. Chinatown Theater has been watching violent Kung Fu films for years (the "Boxer of Shantung" in 1972) killing all of them, so the act of dance and story was the main attraction. The storyline seems fresh so the rival school plot was not overused yet. Every great Kung Fu movie was wonderful, slowly you wanted to get their feel with the famous villains and FFoD also got them. Star, Leigh Low, was a famous actor in Chinese theater. Most Chinese visitors enjoyed this movie. The audience buzz gave me the ultimate satisfaction when leaving this movie. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this action is an action comedy ... probably unconsciously. I have enjoyed it here but for various reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. Since the beginning, the movie makes you laugh. As soon as listeners heard that strange British accent, the Chinese actors turned the film into a violent and proud cartoon. Most American audiences do not see pictures of such a cow in a horror movie that is not in Action Films. Action Sequence blew away viewers. Unfortunately, movie studios have seen that they have enjoyed so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence have become a Kung Fu flick formula. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed seeing this movie with American viewers, but I enjoyed many more in China Town. Some movies may pass the test but FFoD's dubbed version can not be performed. The original "King Boxer" is still enjoyable ... a classic!
