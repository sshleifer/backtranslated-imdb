I think I've got all of these movies. It's really cool music that I can not get out of my head. It has cool looking characters. Really interesting (you know that you will crack in the ground and you will be the fun part of the daily for three weeks). Bad acting, bad CGI, and bad stories (after going to a police robot), it's really cool. You and all your family can see it, meet together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and see it two more times. <br /> <br /> There are so many funky parts, when Cart was there to get the attention of Edison and try to finger him, and then throw a paint ball on it so that they can play paint balls. In that area, I remember my cousins, "Remember it?" I kept them and showed what happened. When the runner ran into the room, it was really a fun part, and Cart was there (just before the war) and Kurt was telling her "strange dream" and how he was "Superman". I love the part that I have seen even after a while, so I do not remember that part. The actor was funny, everything was saying, "I worship you just like God!" To Robot <br /> <br /> While there was some bad thing, it was a great movie. Man, I can not laugh. I was willing to have that movie. );
