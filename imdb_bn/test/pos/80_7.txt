"Good News" is in the city of Circus. The "bad news" bugs are right on the underground house of Banar. When he wakes up, his place hits like an earthquake, when the worker falls to the ground and tears the elephants, etc. <br /> <br /> To be more specific, the lion's cage is just above the bug. Hole Lion feed sniffs, and by the elimination process, it is a rabbit's statistic. The bugs, all the rockets are weird, through its tunnels, winds in the air and in the mouth of the lion. <br /> <br /> I'll tell things for Bbi: he is absolutely bold, at least this cartoon, and for at least 30 seconds. When he comes to his senses, he becomes mad and we fight lion-versus-a rabbit in the other way. Again, the bug encounters the opponent face-to-face, he calls one "Nero", but the lion fierce and the seed have all its wits and some fictitious barbarians to save the animal. <br /> <br /> About half the Gaga is stupid and the other half is fun, but always moving fast, colorful and recommendation is good enough. I mean, every day you can see a lion in a trope or you're dancing!
