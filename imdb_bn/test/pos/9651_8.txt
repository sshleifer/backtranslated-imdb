I am reviewing this reason because the previous review was written by someone who came out of this movie, even without half. Unfortunately, for that he missed a movie of extraordinary beauty. The film started very slowly, in fact, I fell asleep with the friend I was with, awakening her before annoying the audience in front of her stream. Thankfully, the film was created as a love story, drug addiction story, and experimentation in the 60's, young and free. Excellent performance from two leads and a great look in the film that gave it a real pure feeling. Be patient, it's worth waiting like a great movie, and of course a movie that I will wait for review! 8/10
