My work with the only nationwide nonprofit organization, Security on Campus Inc Dedicated to the College Campus Criminal Prevention and Student Awareness, I often see campus violence and 'cover-up' through secret campus. Illustrated in the movie 'Silencing Mary'. In fact, we ask the campus journalists to collect information every month, such as 'Mary' who face similar situations. <br /> <br /> Campus rape scene and then Mary's next Crusade screenplay. The victim's roommate and a student journalist Melissa played very well by Joan Hart, because the justice was done very well and properly researched. <br /> <br /> This is the first television movie that I have ever seen that I have really reflected and involved various complex issues related to rape and other violent crimes involved in our college and university campuses in our country. Although, in 2 hours, these problems will not be solved deeply, but this film comes closer than anyone else.
