Because of the jacket industry in the DVD, I was initially stopped renting this movie. In fact, it was true with my friends, who did not rent it because of the art and emotional image (s), it is a movie that does not have any interest in me (or my friends). But, I rent and saw and was really surprised. <br /> <br /> I agree with another user's comment that this movie is not for everyone because of sexual sensitivity, it is not something I want that kids will watch in the watch (and if they understand it, then it is seriously doubtful ). <br /> <br /> I enjoy this kind of movie through which the personality of the character and they are indeed no meaningless, directly defined in any way Teasers indicate they will turn bad. Acting ... Was it acting? Richie and Jackson have played so well, I did not even drag in this movie or even realized they were acting. The same thing with the story ... may seem a bit remote, but it is very good, very good. This reminds me of Mel Gibson, another film with the team, where the character limitations of each character were psychological or circumstantial, they were very well defined. <br /> <br /> I get a lot of depth with the character in this movie, so everyone should be involved (from cameramen to actor) should be a perfect fit / result. After watching this movie, I talked with a few friends who had a negative view of it like me, so they listened after listening to my comments. They were very good, how good it was. It is very bad that the jacket industry was just as close to it. Now I can see how art is applicable, but I did not listen to this movie before, and the industry was my first impression ... selling and selling of industrial DVD sales. <br /> <br /> These letters were allocated to give an audience like me when they were more in depth and good time absorbing "feeling" for me. I could better believe the flow of good movies, and it did. So, on one side of the jacket industry, I would recommend watching this movie.
