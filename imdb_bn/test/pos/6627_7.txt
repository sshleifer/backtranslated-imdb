Shame, Swedish Swedish film with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and wife named John and Eva. They live on an island working as farmers. A fight is underway and the soldiers started attacking people on the island. Once the fight gets a little diminished, and Eva is arrested as going along the opposite side. More problems arise after the War of Liberation and the film shows how two common people will work in war, life or death position. Guldag Award for Best Actress (The Elove Olman, who played Eva) for Best Foreign Film, Filmfare Award for Best Foreign Film, NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress of the National Board of Film Review and Best Actress, Best Director (Edmerman Bergman) and National Society of Enaesaephasi award for the best film critic award ilma. Good sound instruction from Shem, a good script, Max von Saido (who plays John) and Live Olman (who plays Eva), both good painters and good production design have performed well. Shame, what they can do to survive in a wonderful situation is how people will ever make a good acting and good story. The film has a strong message and a good film. I'm not the reason for this high rating rating because it is not the best composition of some of the other films like Wild Strawberry, The Seventh Seal or Persona, for example, Ingmar Bergman. The film did not have such an impact on me since I thought it was a lack of thoughtful and philosophical conversation of Angamar Bergman. Although one of his best movies is not close, there is a lot like Sheme and it's a good movie. I probably liked it having not seen anything other than other Bergman masterpieces.
