I showed my little nephew early and she liked it (I myself also enjoyed it). There is no need to explain this plot, because this film is the author of the awards writer Carl Hyssen's award winner, the complete truth in favor of the top-selling book. The movie takes the popular book and it's beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (funny people, thanks to Luke Wilson and some new-actors) and layers of Great Music! Now Jimmy Buffet will get the CD! I know when the movie is over, I'm a handful. Overall, it was a big family movie that I felt comfortable taking my small rice. I want to recommend it to anyone and everyone.
