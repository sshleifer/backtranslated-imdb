I liked this movie very much. I have a realistic concept of justice and 'an eye for eye', and this film distracts it frustrating. In Glen Ford Valley, a large proportion of low prices are proposed for his farm; Then a man in his farm beat and shot 'Helps to make his mind about the sale'. When the bird's hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford is reluctant to do anything in the mind, and warns his men not to take anything in their own hands. But, what he's going to do is correct. I knew that when the movie went to Salon, the man was going to set a fire and faced the man (Richard Jakeel, one of my very favorite bad guy's actors who killed his bird); After a gentle exchange of dialogue with him, Glen Ford covered his face and shot him dead. Like a fairly compressive bit, he kills this person, GhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahHahhhhh! In short order, we are treating Ford to burn his farm, so his men are reasonable in stopping the crew from other farms. Then Ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle in the big bad man's farm; Then they show and outbill and burn in the big fancy house ground. Talk about getting even bigger times. Lots of action in this movie There is more to the story than that, but I would recommend only to see the movie. Glenn Ford showed to anyone what could happen when you misunderstood someone and I really enjoyed seeing him judge the old fashioned method.
