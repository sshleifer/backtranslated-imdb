Only after 30 years saw the baby blue Marine again. I still found it a beautiful and romantic movie which is a time lost forever. Now a lot of innocence and purity have been really caught in this small film. Actor is more than an average and Richard Garr's Shell-Hakim Rider is a short version of the marine war hero, who is keenly interested in any film buff or fan fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent works like her main look and "All American" boy. The late Bruno Kibber (who took b as Bill B. Kerby, junior), refuses to return to his "pop", peace-loving, Marine Corps, and returns to his wife. If you are looking for sex, drugs, or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. If you are looking for action and adventure, apply the same to the same. However, if you want to restore a time of seclusion, respect, romance and love to America then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
