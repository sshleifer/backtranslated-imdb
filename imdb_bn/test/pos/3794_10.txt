Very few reviews I can find online in Barnens öö do not really do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway I regretted it almost immediately, but the order has already gone through so I could not cancel it. I'm happy now that I could not. This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I will not summarize the plot, because other critics have already done it. But I would say that I do not understand that it is embarrassing, surprising, strange, clinical, depressed or indecent. It is very unusual, which I think it may seem strange to some people, but critics of other criticisms must reflect their own issues, because I have not seen the movie that I saw. I'm not attracted to boys, so nudity does not seem to be pornographic to me - it's just trying to find a child without any help from the irresponsible adults of his life. And this is not Sweden, Utah, so helpless women are not a big deal. <br /> <br /> But I am not surprised that what this film is positive, its image is that the lost child, the way Odyssey goes through all sorts of strange experiences - and ultimately finding - yourself. It's interesting, perfectly original, and deeply satisfied. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that Barnes has been given three major Guldaga prizes as Best Film, Direction and Actor, but I was completely surprised by the actor who was not Tomas Freak, the child's acting role as Rain is one of the most extraordinary films ever. Should be turned, however, Inghard Heraldwhich is the most important land of the lazy lovers of the soil of Stain Mika performed. I do not understand this, but it's a great movie that does not actually change it.
