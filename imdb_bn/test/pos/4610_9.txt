British magnate Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Green) decided to look for his two best friends disappearing after visiting an evil and powerful man living in Black Casale, Count Carl Von Bruno (Stephen MN). Sir Burton traveled secretly with another identity, because he fought Afridi's Count Von Bruno against Afridi, his two absent friends, and lost a glance in the counting war. When he came to the castle, he was invited to invite him to look for a black forest around mathematics. Meanwhile, he found evidence that counting killed his friends. Later, he and his wife, Countess Elga von Bruno (Rita Corde), love each other and Dr. Maysen (Boris Karloff), in support of Sir Burton, and trying to flee from the foot of Count Count Fone. Bruno "The Black Castle" is a wonderful movie from a romantic time, action, romance, mystery and even horror. The story is gripping, and a great entertainment for any audience. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "And Castello do Powers" ("Fear Castle")
