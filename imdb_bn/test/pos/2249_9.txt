As an Israeli Jewish and a lover of different and independent movies of naturally satirical nature, it always satisfies me to see a movie that draws attention to the Holocaust which is sensitive and respectful, though original and abnormal. I do not read books ?? Or, about that, before listening to the movie, heard about its existence? And so, like some other critics, they can not comment on how they stack up relatively, everything has been enlightened, and I can certainly comment on it. <br /> <br /> A Holocaust film labeled everything though it is helplessly about Holocaust, it must do great injustice. So it will label it as a comedy or travel movie, although it's about a journey and it's extremely fun as it's moving. Everything is light about Jonathan Safaron ?? Eliass Wood played the minimum perfection, in the most impressive dramatic performance I've seen yet, a poker face that does not show anything and reveals all ?? A young American is a Jewish, and an aggrieved collector of family heirs and historical handmade objects, who travels to Nazi to travel to Ukraine to find a woman to save her grandfather. It's also his tour guide through Alex, Ukraine and Alex's grandfather. What is fascinating about these characters is that at the beginning of the film, they look like a comic relief to maintain the boring nature of the wooden character; But both Alex and his grandfather went through fascinating changes throughout the film and turned into at least as important as Jonathan. Indeed, Boris Leskene's serious, self-proclaimed blind grandfather has the best dramatic performance of the film. <br /> <br /> As well as the miraculous nature of the pictures and characters, the beautiful mix of true acoustic music and Russian folk music, the beauty of the landscape and the beauty of the landscape, and the cool contrast between the horror of history, which makes me a powerful and ongoing experience enlightening everything. From Alex and his grandfather, we have a very different and original perspective on this painful issue; Several great films like The Gray Zone and Downfall have already given us the views of the lower-level Nazis, who have been portrayed as being people who are not fully aware of the moral effects of their actions but have been caught. The reality of war Everything has been illuminated with a view of gifts rarely: Alex's view is that a young man born many years after the war, who sees it more than the cold historical truth, who faces himself. Awful his own man ?? And perhaps his own family as well ?? Was able to. Alex's attitude change ?? And his grandfather ?? On behalf of Jonathan, towards Holocaust and in general towards the Jewish people, the film is fascinating and makes an original study in the development of character. <br /> <br /> Everything is enlightened, among the most original and unique films of 2005, Abhishek is a great director for actor Leove Sherbur. This is a highly recommended viewing experience, especially in Holocaust and anyone interested in World War II.
