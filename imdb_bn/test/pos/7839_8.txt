First of all, I want to say that it is a fresh start to see a British drummer which looks up to the end and feels trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart (Ian Hood), judged the role as an advisor to government science, his real and unbelievable views and the future thinking about "real world" science and how he thinks it is either being used or by others Misusing. <br /> <br /> The whole series of casting is not fully maintained, but it seems to be more reliable than its letters. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen gave first-rate performance as Dr. Hood's appointed bodyguard (Rachel Young), she took refreshing for her continuous war with the uninteresting daily visions of science, and Hood. Some of them are fun and memorable moments. <br /> <br /> This series keeps all scientific elements more realistic. I'm more compelling than positive and psychological, which we can use in other fiction or science fiction TV shows. . Although there is considerable disappointment with the series, at the end of each episode, I feel frustrated that they do not seem to stop all aspects of the plot and sometimes open-ended stories. Although it seems that this is still the first series, I am hopeful that we can look back in the near future, where these open-ended stories can finally be given a significant conclusion that they deserve properly. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoy the science-related plot line more slowly, it is an ideal program to see because it always manages to be trustworthy and more importantly.
