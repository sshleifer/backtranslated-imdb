I believe it is difficult that the movie has received so little ratings. It is one of the best comedies to be made rationally, and of course, the best Bollywood comedy of 90. The film did not work very well at the box office and after seeing it people had very different reactions. My guess is that most people had hoped to be an all-out comedy and had a regular movie expectation. If you love the comedy, it must be a must see. And Aamir Khan is outstanding.
