I grew up in New York and the four-year-old came here. I had half-day kindergarten and it was in the evening afternoon on WPIX Channel 11. I just like songs and stories and walk around the house while playing. <br /> <br /> I just saw an episode of the episode on YouTube and for a moment, I remembered how young they were showing. I, of course, stopped when I was in 1st grade because it was before leaving school (there was no VCR or DVR back). I grew up, I could not understand that I saw up to the 11th grade! <br /> <br /> I did not know that there was a DVD and my nephew and nephew were young enough to enjoy this show, but now they're all demographic past, or I'm going to buy them all DVDs. Today's kids show was much better than a lot.
