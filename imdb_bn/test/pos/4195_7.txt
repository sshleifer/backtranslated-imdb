You must remember Mukta and in the second half of the 1960s, how did they understand it properly and how to fully appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no such plot. Basically, it is a crazy, different, unrelated sequence mixed pastiche. But, once you get onto her wavelength once interesting and entertaining her own way. In short, this is a classic, clever idea and good illustrated example of the last 60th experimental film. It has other appropriate ideas in terms of some good songs, some super-Govi cinematography and film technique. <br /> <br /> I can give 7 out of 10 for several reasons. First of all, it was very brave to create an incompatible commercial film that was firmly rooted in both the stars and its producers. If there is a feature film flop in the box office, the results can be terrible for everyone concerned. Secondly, this is mostly creative success. And, finally, as already mentioned, it is unknown, the style is a classic and as such, it is now historically important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Head" is too late for the Monks career. But, again, they would not have been allowed to make it before, because it was basically a very absolute and satirical mockery of their own image. <br /> <br /> The group members obviously knew that after starting the project, the whole Monckage Zagnarnat could only run their race. In a way, it was to be their han song and they all were determined to hang out. They were tired of the high-power corporate games just because of pang-like behavior, which they used to exploit and exploit in the past few years. In short, they "wanted to go out" and they were going to say a few things before they left. <br /> <br /> History has, however, corrected the band. Let the critics make enemies. Minds behind the best of the decade, the most polished and successful pop records. Yes, they had a lot of help. But at the end of the day, they stood in front of the Studio Mix, they took the movies and TV cameras in front and theater concert. They were fun and a little crazy However, unlike some of their contemporaries, they were not threats. You can safely introduce your old aunt to a monkey. <br /> <br /> "Head" probably takes too much credit from Beatles "Hard Day's Night" but it was still almost for those who had another look or small retrophiles for those who had the power to appreciate its significance. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
