Agree that this show was one of the best episodes. For the first time, when I was in Florida Keys, I remember the series well. I saw older VCR tapes which were "keeper" and two came in about eight episodes. I ended up part of the Christmas night part (and the next) watching this show. Singer Banky Bancois - saw his name come up on credit. He came from Anguilla and owned the bar in front of a sea in the name of Duen Preserv. He is featured in the latest Buffet CD / DVD Combo, hosted by Jimmy Buffett's longtime friend and longtime friend of "Ste-In In Paradise" - it tracks # 12 on CD1 and # 8 CDs. One day I would like to see this short series in DVD. Believe me
