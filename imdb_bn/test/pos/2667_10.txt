For those who are frustrated by the length and speed of the film ("For example, why do they see spaceships for docking like 15 minutes?"), Here is a word that you might want to remember: <br /> <br /> Beauty <br /> <br /> Beauty is a low-key concept. Of course, you will often see great photography in the picture. But did you finally see a movie that is purely for beauty? There is a strange belief in cinemagoers that no plots or characters are related to deletion. This is depressing depressing. There is nothing wrong with the creation of a beautiful sequence which has nothing to do with the plot of the film. A director can not show up to show 15-minute spaceships without any reason and it is not illegal or it is not bad to do so. <br /> <br /> '2001' You usually need to look differently than watching movies. It will make you relax You can feel strange and beautiful images without being guilty of a complex plot or detailed characterization. Do not make me wrong, plots and letters are good, but they all have to be and do not end all things. There are different types of movies and you will need to protect your brain regardless of the wavelengths and the enjoyment of safety, cleanness, and prohibited restrictions of daily films. <br /> <br /> "All art is quite meaningless" - Oscar Wilde.
