I saw the Borderline in AMC several years ago. I have been looking for it ever since. It was hunting: visual, textile, passionate. This movie has taken me somewhere like a dream and I do not care about anything. I do not forget the currents flowing in the air. I remember the way I still make my head bent. I feel the expression of my face when I saw it. I did not know what happened after the movie was over, but life was found on that path. It did not bother me. The unreasonable rejection of innocent character hurt me. I face the way, the camera dwelt on them. Looking at the cameras camera one day illuminated eyes. Outline the movie was not real to me in a way. It just explains, lack of color, sharpness which it enters a thief like night of my consciousness. I like this movie. Today I will own it.
