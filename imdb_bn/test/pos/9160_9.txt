Fans of American filmmakers can get annoyed by their pillars through this movie, but that irritability is born of ignorance. Guerrilla suppression operations are always like that. Sit around and wait, get some hooks, get drunk, contract with the wheel and dealer, kick the prisoner around, cover the street businessman's murder by green personal. Then, roaming, two fuel trucks are gone and for 10 minutes, a small-scale weapon with a high-powered instrument gun. Then wait for the way to stop the bridges of the bridges, and then finish the process of killing some civilians. If reality does not work for Western viewers, there are always top guns or rambos (top realistic nap) <br /> <br /> The best part of Afghanistan's ezlamic reality was that all the airlines exclude flares like Confetti. Carter and Reagan Mujahideen had to do this because they had so many missiles. Also, the wave of the Mi-24 was excellent, still better attack than the apocalypse. The sight of dropping and shooting of their missiles was that there was a danger of "death from above" for any person. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that the Soviet era was able to create films of Afghanistan in a year. Their departure, but it took US six years. Afganskiy Ezlum is just as real if you apply it to NATO occupation. Nobody will ever pick guns and take more care for you to shoot. This should watch a movie Westerns. Unfortunately I do not think anybody has ever created an English subtitle; I might have to do something.
