Seasil B. Dimile's adolescents-adolescents led a series of generations and in the early 20th century. She found her perfect leading lady for this provocative piece of Gloria Swanson. Do not change the husband, Swanson plays an indecent housewife, whose wealthy businessman's husband (Eliot Dexter) gives more attention to work than She is mugged with a new lover and is followed by a handsome rouge (Louis Kodi) until she is divorced. Soon the facts are known and husband husband finds that the first husband is negligent as the first. To make matters worse, she has a female codi as well (Julia Faye) discovery. After several conflicts and convenient meetings, the issues are resolved. <br /> <br /> This helped to create a catastrophic blow in 1919 and Gloria Swanson as a star. Although he had just heard this picture at the age of 20, he might be as good as a fool like a fool. She looks great and wears some stunning gowns. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene is 100% Dimile, where Cody enters Swansea with promises of wealth, joy and love. She coos her as she imagines the scene. Pleasure Swanson is a fantastic scene to dance around when people in a violent swinging on a pool dance around. The resources are a view which Swanson is gowned like a Babylonian queen, as the servants bring her chest to her jewels, which together combine. Love is a scene in which she is making a wood olive love in a forest gladden with a pan-like character (Ted Shawn). Pure Decrees but very funny, and Swanson looks great. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Duster is very good, wipes his head and starts working to get his wife back. Cody is a liar and those fake charming as well as cheat. Faye is as funny as another woman - no less called Toodles - who gets her. Sylvia Ashton played Mrs. Hockey. Roth St. Dennis was married to Ted, and they were together with Ground Breing and the influential modern dancer (Denishawn School). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Colorful color-rich entertainment films from different scenes to keep things alive. And after 86 years, many styles of decorations came back.
