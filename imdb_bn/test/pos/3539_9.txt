To read another comment about this fantastic piece of TV drama I forced some little balance. If you want to kill, sign and cereal, and your cop should be British, and many scream, and the beor be bloody and to be a religious slant then this hits each button. Suffering rarely 'gov'ing to scream at the rare height, but otherwise highly rated. Cain Stood is as nice as 'side cop' and guest star also played well, including Edward Woodward and Art Owner. Recommended. (In response to previous comments, although I acknowledge that 'Red' will not run 'normal' because of injury and running, he was only arrested for the murder of his brother, and I'm pretty sure he did not see the boy.)
