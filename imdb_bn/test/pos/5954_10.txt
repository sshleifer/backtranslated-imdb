As French, I'm glad to be laughing at the old stereotype, which is like French, some in the West, some at the spot, and so on ... and more ... I have seen it three times and every time I've discovered new things and laughs in tears. Jane Dusseldeen, Barrenis Bezo, director and all actors, Or Atik, did all the crew excellent work. This movie is funny but it's much more than: It has enough levels. Some critics of intellectualism (due to bravery at the critical stage) because of physical jokes, because you believe in character etc., because it is easily and musically, this is also a success. See if you can.
