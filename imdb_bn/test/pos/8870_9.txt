I did not clearly understand the average rating of these movies! <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, I even waited until finally watching it at the end of the TV <br /> <br /> Here are three excellent characters, excellent characters. Danny Davito played a jewel, with most achievements he also directed. His eloquent ridiculous character was repeatedly written and was spiritually in a completely believable way. There are people like him, the oven was just not on the line. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal's comic syllo and timing ideas were perfect for his role. Her frustration / comedy was interesting and impressive and more ... you can understand her feelings. Actually, it seems difficult to achieve a character from the writers' perspective, finding it to be the perfect actor to stop it is an art itself and both have been achieved here three times. <br /> <br /> Who else could play mother again? There is no one that can play this part so well. There are other styles that you love to see, I was waiting for myself to appear on the screen ... and the rest were not bad, no, no, because the character of the mum was again. It was unusual to see that the line without crossing. <br /> <br /> And what else? A happy ending with new found friendships, no one gets hurt and everyone achieves what they want in life ... until the cheese is a big lotus. <br /> <br /> Bright script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great movie.
