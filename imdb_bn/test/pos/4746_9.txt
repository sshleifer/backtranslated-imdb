Ray Skeda Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who? Seven-ups are one of the better cop films, even today, and McQueen's Bullet and the second place in the Diamond Harry series, which is not bad company. Three things that seem to be making a good cop film: Trustworthy scripts with great acting, great car charging scenes and some heavy steps. The three scenes in this movie and the car's Chase scene are better than Darty Harry. Skyady plays the head of a group of police forces to punish NY's bad boy seven years or more; That's why the name is seven. Overall, the Witch is not far from Harry or Bullet, but the Duri Harry series is much better than all cop films made from the series. 9/10
