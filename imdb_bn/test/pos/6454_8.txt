Last night I saw this movie in the "pre-code" film festival, and I want to tell you that when Gary Cooper changed his head for his initial closeness, the whole audience could get gas. He was that beautiful. <br /> <br /> Cooper's view, this film shows the perfection of artistry, directed by Robin Mamulian. Wonderful visual-fading, creative camera angle, symbolic symbol - Mamoulian is just exploring the media and coming up with innovation. <br /> <br /> It was Sylvia Sidney's first role in Hollywood, just as beautiful as the stage after New York's success, and she dares to be a leading lady in Gary Cooper. He found it much better to see the role of a harder generation than him - so often it seems that he is scared to be hurt by somebody. There are many familiar faces in <br /> <br />. The film, with Wonder Wynne Gibson. The greatest hit is Guy Kibbi, who is well known for playing a chaotic rich person as a great and crafty hit-man. <br /> <br /> These pre-code codes available in VHS or DVD are not nearly enough, so if you can not find a pre-code source near you, try broadcasting Turner Classic Movie for broadcast! Gary Cooper believes that critics were too stupid to have a narrow dialogue rather than "Yep" or "Nap", "Must be considered in the film as well as the performance of the coup as" Ms. Dides Goss to Town "or" Meet John Do ". Anyone who looks good in heaven does not have to be smart as well.
