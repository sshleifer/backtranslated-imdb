Your general movie, but a good one. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie, what he says, what he says. I was surprised to see it because I thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. It was a very good story, great character and a good balance. The favorite part: Perhaps when Billy Bob Rippers is running around shooting his wardrobe
