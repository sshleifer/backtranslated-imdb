I was a guest at the screening of Eddie Monroe on September 30 and was amazed at the story, great acting and gifted instructions. I found it difficult to believe all these talents can be found in an independent film. Viero's strong performance, (Uncle Beni), Sarah, (Jessica Sunis), and Morris, (Eddie Monroe) Supporters were full chalk of colorful and funny characters throwing. This movie reminds me of a movie that will go back in 20 years and discover that it has launched many actors in StarDome. Tom Cruise, Emilio Estez, Patrick Swazi, Ralph McQueau and others can be found like "The Outsiders" Look at Hollywood, there are new stars in the horizon and it is discovered in a small Long Island, independent film "Eddie Monroe". Nice work!
