Roy Anderson's movie 'You, The Living' contains a series of fifty different sketches, snapshots and vintettes set in a Swedish city. Some characters are on screen for only a few seconds, others appear in numerous views and sometimes loitering in the background is seen when another story unfolds. Many scenes are drawn from the fantasies of dreams, nightmares and weird but credible characters to live in this world. It's an impressive outlook: Each scene isolate can be enjoyed, but together they have a strong picture of how it is to humans. <br /> <br /> The first half an hour or more, 'you are alive, glorious fun. Most of the humor centers on the members of the brass band, whose music practice dissatisfied their neighboring apartment block. Comic Highlights, however, are available by track of a dinner party, terrible horror gone. After this sunny role, the film's mood is quite dark. When the dinner party is provoked to be judged for his life, then mixed mix of uncertainty and frustration for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In the subsequent scenes, the characterization of its disease characterization became increasingly apparent. They are in a world where people can not connect with each other, where dreams, nightmares and fantasies are discussed, but where no one can reach for their help, no one can be comforted. 'Anyone loves me' is a disappointed woman and rock guitarist, with unexpected love for Mick, young girl, archivist characters. <br /> <br /> The selfishness influenced by the world of 'you, the living' An elderly professor was declared a huge banquet to answer the boy's phone in exchange for his huge money; A thief brutal executive executive stolen; An arrogant and excited businessman insults a Muslim sailor and receives his favor. At the most harmful moment of the film, a woman in the church describes the long list of human sins because her colleague closed the closing session. <br /> <br /> And yet, for all the dark moments of this movie, sharing 'black one day' indicates the ability to live despite suffering human beings. The soundtrack provided by Bane Anderson (ABBA fame) seems to be unreasonably disgusting, but can make the film even stronger, because the film can keep this human power stable. <br /> <br /> 'You, The Living' is a wonderful visual style. The same washed-out, repeat across pale-green color, and there is a shadow in the nary in sight; This character exhibits exceptional pallid and creates the sensation that people are being bared for life's test. Almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame, as if these photographs are being brought to life. Some programs where the camera is transferred, all are awesome; The contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet creates a surprising contrast with the death of Clockwork scene. At the most intense moments of lasting and frustration, the characters converting visitors by facing the camera directly ?? They know that they are being tested and there are moments for the audience to pour their hearts. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, humane movie.
