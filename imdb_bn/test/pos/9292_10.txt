Australian television and Australian politics need this, people with humor's ideas !!! ABC is good for supporting these guys. This show is based on some Australian Blocus, who knows how to accept Mikey from politicians or other people in the challenge. The boys use Sydney as their base to splash among boys. Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr. Keep an eye for ten questions. Those who perform CNNN to perform this work are the same guys that present. If you enjoy CNNNN and Glasshouse, you would love this show. I am still interested in knowing which stants are real and which is being played perfectly because boys have done some suspicious things ...
