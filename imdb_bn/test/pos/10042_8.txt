This picture of grace preserved its humor. Playing up to the strength of his stars, the Warner Brothers General Castor version released a romantic stroke and an unexpected strain of idealism as a coincidental, shaky, unexpected fingerprint; It was again Robin Hood, and Flin turned into this role. His greatest action pictures used his talent to use for rancor and humorous periods, and this was not an exception. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite the previous deal. Partnership break Strong-minded Libby Castler was tired of playing in the studio for the next films of Flan and played a better role than sweet love interest and seeing this script he specifically asked De Havilland to act so that he might not participate in the trial. In this final collaboration, he is essentially a roaming adventure film, and screen chemistry is revived, which reduces all his remarkable skills - at one time, he and Flann get a chance to develop their characters beyond basic romance. An old married couple, similarly to win the win. <br /> <br /> The Flin / De Havilland pair and the line of comedy have given the film the stability, while one of Flin's Western Western was held in such affection. By the contemporary American public, though not accused by their star - long forgotten. The action scenes are fairly narrow (though, diversifically, the death of an extra fall in film charges) and school barks, schoolboys-fashion, can be the same person fearing our hero. On his first day at West Point, and thus disappointed him throughout his career. It falls on the cast list, but it is very morally convenient. <br /> <br /> However, it is largely irrelevant in a film that is never more than an entertaining part of entertainment. Enriched and encouraged by a sterling group of supporter players (with memorable queen Anthony Quinn like Syauk's leader), Iral Flein suppressed his way through his usual surgical platinum plugging: ridiculously wet appearance, unexpectedly sweet, naughty dazzling, flash point scandal, delightful fellowship And just the high-octane charisma. He is a helpless braggart, but you can not help but like him. And "Garryowen" is much harder to go away without tune, after threading her juntty way through your ears for many days. <br /> <br /> It's one of Flin's permanent hits; It has an amazing amount of good acting in funny, and looks like a film worthy.
