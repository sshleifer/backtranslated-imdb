Excellent storytelling and cinematography Funny, social commentary bite. <br /> <br /> Excellent effect. Well-filmed and acting. <br /> <br /> Parallel steps between current and travel (although very well done) are occasionally too much (about 3 hours) and extra spacetime story flow <br /> <br /> I read the book as a child first, and enjoyed giants and small people - but the book lost me while on floating islands. "Yahoo" land! Well, although the adventure can be like a story of a child, it is actually a very mature story, full of symbolism about England's moral damage, during Jonathan Swift, the author of the novel based on this film.
