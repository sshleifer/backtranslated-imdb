I do not see anything sitting around through the movie list and really want to see it. My hunger is saying, "Broadcast news is something good." That's what I want. With smart ideas and great acting and writing, something smart and fun, and a directional style that does not focus on itself. It might seem to be Hurt's best performance (like me or big chill): But bright, heart is smart, and not sure enough to play an intelligent person - Wink wink - The audience knows - Wink wink - - Hey, I'm not a fool ... It's okay, okay. Hunter's note-perfect, and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Great, great work. <br /> <br />
