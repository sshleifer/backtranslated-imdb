'Opera' (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Souparia) Screenplay: Dario Argante and Franco Ferini (The Church, Lazas, Demons) Photography: Roney Taylor (a chorus line, laziness) Music: Claudio Simane (Fenomena, 'Goblin') <br /> Story: Betty (Kristina Marsillach) Lady Macbeth of a very stylized staging of the Macbeth Opera at Verdi's Macbeth. When it comes to light during BTi, Diva Star breaks her leg before opening at night, when she escapes to Tantrum in a car. Macbeth's famous curse is even more grim and calculated when the body count begins to grow. It seems that Betty got her first fan through her Stanner, who forced him and his eyes to testify to the deadly murder of people around him with the tape needle. Story: 5 of 3 <br /> <br />: It may be difficult to judge sometimes to act in many Italian movies. English, Italian, French, German, Spaniards can sometimes be on the same flicker, because usually they make their local language lip rules and make it hard to judge. I usually cut some slack in their area as a result. Acting: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Guideline: Geiolo Maestro Argentina again helped in the pioneering advancement. 'Opera' shows her at the top of her play with a fine blend of hers, tensions and looks. Direction: 5 of 4 <br /> <br />: It should be one of the best movies in Argentina. Illustrated by Taylor Taylor, 'Opera' combines some stunning and innovative camera-work that keeps the film fast and stern and coming to the eye candy. The camera always seems to think that it is a great shot of the camera that is running around the crowd of opera house at the end of the spiral stairs or the end of the bird's perspective. Visual: 5 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Audio: Praise of screening action with loud as touching his touch from metal musings to Literature (Verdi) from Argentina's collaborative symphony (his various band Goblin, Demonic and Lonely Efforts) (Brian And with a little help from Roger Naw and Bill Wieman) and lent muscle to bloody gleys in the screen. The sound design gives you everything from stabs to guns, screams, and splendid splash 6.1 for every smoke and amusement of Anchor Bay Disk. Audio: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Tech: The edit flows the film and keeps moving nicely. Combined with cameras, the help of editing turns the supernatural dream imagery. The perfect opera house is perfect for presenting a hell of a location and the awful version of Macbeth. Argentina can not finish a review of the film without commenting on the murder. Argentina now delivers characters behind the title of the impressive camouflage sequence, the Crow I-Gawing, and the highlight of a gun explosion film through a keyhole in the eye and the rejoined Argentinian former wife Daria Nicodi. Go to the movie morgue. Invaluable! Tech: 5 5 5 <br /> <br />: A nearly flawless geyollo that suffers from a little unnecessary symptom of Switzerland, which provides all the visual thrills of Argentine fans. <br /> <br /> Overall, 5 of 4
