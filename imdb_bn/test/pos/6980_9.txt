I saw the director's cut version and could be nothing without content. Outstanding Performance (SP Cole Houser, though I was sad about the little space for Claudia Black), the overall, credible plot (in vain), with many visual holes, the fine visual effects and photography, really non-expected twists, build-up characters . This movie is the biggest asset. Combined with style - some may consider this a B-grade effort in movies but I would agree with that. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Vine Diesel but the role of this tough guy in the Reddick can make him better. Can not wait for the Readic Chronicles, it's really a sign of this flick ...! <br /> <br /> 9/10 if you ask me
