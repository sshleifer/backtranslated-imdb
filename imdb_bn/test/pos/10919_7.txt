In and Out Juan Cusack, Tom Seleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kine had a fun comedy with good performances. Kevin Kline's idea of ​​being gay was very interesting. If I were her, then I would like to say that I went to her own wedding to be with her family, friends and her wife. Very rarely will that ever happen. When the voice on the radio was talking to her, she liked me while she was dancing. I said in-in and out was a funny comedy which is very sunny and sunny. It was a suggested comedy and Kevin Kline had a great performance as a gay guy. Trust me that you like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
