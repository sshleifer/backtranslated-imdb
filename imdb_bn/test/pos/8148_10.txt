Latter Days for me was a very moving movie, it showed how the gay community is really tough and humiliated. The film etherizes true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters, the film holds a true depth of compassion for the gay community, as it really talks for gay men / women. Personally, I think it's about high time that homosexuality groups do not bow down to humiliation, only to have good self. The film was much more than an eye-to-eye for me because I could not believe that this world is actually gay gay Even if a child dislikes something in school, they will refer to it as "gay". I really hope that more such films have been made, and they are not labeled as just "gay" movies, but as a love story, I believe that gay directors will stand up for themselves and tell stories through their stories.
