I have never heard of this movie, but I like Bath Laser and Brian Brown and the story sounds interesting, so I think I want to give it a shot. I found it very enjoyable. Heather Ledger plays at the age of 19, who does a painful job and wants to make some serious ducks, so he goes and searches from Brian Brown for gangster work. I do not know the details but things get worse for laser and there is a big problem with Brian Brown. Only good and good from their movies, with a view to laser involved with a pair of robbers of the bank. And lazer's love interest does not forget the beautiful everyday outdoors. I would definitely recommend this movie.
