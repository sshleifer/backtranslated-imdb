I know to include everything in the book, the film could have been several hours long, so I think they did their best to include things that were important and important for the story. I was thinking that Casting was great, who played very well and played Amir and Hassan. And the person who played Amir as an adult! His and father's scenes were particularly touching. I thought the places they used were interesting ... the scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China and a scene in Fremont, CA (graduation scene) was actually shot in San Francisco's Treasure Island. I worked as an additional one on "Kite Runner" and that day, that day they shot the graduation scene. We told Trazer's Island in the morning, when they examined everyone's clothing to ensure their opinion in the late 80's, we took our place among the audience. They shot again and again until they were happy with it. It was great to see the actors closely and see the book's author, who was also a story mentor. I thought this book was nice and I recommend both books and movies. It is a moving story about friendship, love, crime and finally salvation. "There is a way to be good again."
