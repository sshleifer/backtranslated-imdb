Make this short and dotted. This movie was great! I love it I actually picked it up for 3 dollars in VHS in the Hollywood video and saw it about 5 times in the last few weeks. I'm a big Bogart fan and I latched onto this movie. I thought the song was funny and now it has a ring tone on my phone. Robert Sacchi is great and pulls off a good Bogart. His nose is a little bigger, his voice is a bogurt-columbo mix, and he does some strange work, otherwise he was fantastic and the film was astonishing. Nobody could be perfect Bogart but he was great. Remember, Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogert and he is not going to do what he has done. He mentioned many other films and some things that were not part of the genuine bogurt character. However, it is very funny and ridiculous and it has some beautiful women with a beautiful cast. See it and have fun!
