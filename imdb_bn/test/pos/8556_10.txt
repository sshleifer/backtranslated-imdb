I have seen this movie 100 times, never tired. I saw this movie for the first time in the first 7 years, and since then it has left a mark in my memory. This is a wonderful love story that can bring sun to most people even in the most dark periods. I think it's a "must be seen" movie and Anthony Quinn is one of the best performers. I just want the TV channels to send this movie more often. It is a good way to inspire me and surly many others to do that. If I want to act, no actor, it has been Anthony Quinn. The silver screen will never be like him, never like him. The desire that Auntie Quinn was still alive God bless his soul.
