This is a thoughtful film that does not raise the existence of so-called higher class inequalities and those who work for them. Robert Shaw has done an accomplished job of playing the role of a true Chaufiure, Steven Leadbetter, who helped Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) to overcome her emotional depression at the beginning. However, Steven has many mixed feelings about this woman of high-grade. He inevitably falls in love with her, which certainly separates social bounds. <br /> <br /> I did not read anything before, and I saw it only to judge the film. I consider it a very honest story about the realities of everyday living and the conflict of what we can expect or what we expect from and what we can get. It's a subtle drama worth to see again.
