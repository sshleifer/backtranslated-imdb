I've seen this move for the 5th or 6th time and still love it. It still makes me cry and sings and celebrates. <br /> <br /> I often wrote a letter to Boni Hunt how much I love him. David Duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real !!! Mini driver is so natural and honest When my favorite line was dueling, "I miss Elizabeth, but I'm sorry for grace." Oh man I'm just crying about it. Also ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belusei are sooooooooooooooo couple of perfect Chicago area !! I swear to them! I'm sure they are related to them. <br /> <br /> This movie is rolling my three times a year! I want to see it once a week but I was afraid that I would use it too much !!! I always see it when I want to make it a special day !!
