I'm Dead Sales a big, sloppy horror comedy that very seriously refuses to take myself. There are these advantages and errors. The 85 minute film is windy and film is sometimes much fun, sometimes scary, sometimes poor, sometimes three full, but three together, but a lot better than the sum of the part of the part of the film. <br /> <br> In such stories, it is followed by professional grave robber Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monghan). Arthur's partner in crime offender Willie Grimes (Larry Facenden) was cut just for his head and Arthur has one night left before he gets leaked to his head for the same verdict. Arthur claims that he is innocent of the murder, but there are many crimes he is willing to accept to bribe Irish whiskey by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Pearlman). <br /> <br /> A series of poetry poems written by Arthur, a series of horrific maths - a series of diverse stories, which are related to the same type of cast (Arthur and Willie) and similar themes (grave robbery). Like most horrible anthologies, there is no consistent myth, because all myths are true and happening when they contradict each other. <br /> <br /> It probably does not help that I saw this image as a trik in the same night. 'Ray Treat, a terrible math that reduces the traps I sell. Actually, Trick's Treat, which is designed as a mythology, is telling a more consistent, consistent story than the Dead the Dead, intended for a distorted story. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the movie (and I admit that this crazy drama-picking) is a quick way to open history with history and history. Grimes were killed with grillotin. We can stretch a point and say that he killed Scottish Maiden by the precursor of French Guillotine, but Scottish Maiden was abandoned in 1709 and the film was set up several years later due to the mention of Bark and Hare. And in 1829 they were executed for murder. The art became obsolete in the passage of the Robbery Anti-Duty Act (1832), so the film must be taken before it. <br /> <br /> I know that it must be the ultimate character of historical inferiority and we are clearly dealing with the universe where deaths, inhuman and legendary deaths are all possible possible, but to convince the audience firmly to suspend their mistrust The easiest way to anchor an easy way to anchor. Fantasy bounce off And it's not like a tragedy of robbers or body graduates or resurrected (call it your favorite) a boring story <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that the writer's director Glenn McQuit definitely knows history, especially the good bit. For example, when Grimes took Arthur as the first beginner, he correctly explains Arthur that the resurrection does not steal the clothes from the dead, because a corpse is stolen from a dead body, punishable by a small fine, robbery of clothes stolen or potentially even guilty by death Assumed So you will expect Will and Jr. jump over the dead body (and for the rest of the film) at this time, but of course they will not do it. You can blame the director of ignoring your author's script, but the author and the director are not the same person. <br /> <br /> My point is that many nude naked bodies have to be. The movie, my point is that if you are going to bring this trick to the law and make it clear that Wiley and Arthur will follow the law, how much foolish it will be, you have to follow the concept of the ironical conclusion even if it means that Wiley and Arthur are a Will continue chasing a Zambia by burial to tear his clothes and bring them back to the empty coffin They are tried, so that they do not get deported to steal dead bodies, otherwise <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
