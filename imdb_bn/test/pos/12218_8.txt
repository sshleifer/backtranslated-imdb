*** Spinners *** Anything else (or can not do) can be said about it, the Surfers have been wildly prepared. Cinematography is simply stunning (at least speaking) and FX is not a miracle but nothing happens. Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything - and only for everyone (parents, kids, fantasies and / or FX fans). Turn off the third step in the way of creating a bit of JavaScript and black logon with the Gazillas. And acting-based is not a single freak note; Some amazing rocky cast, here's the hard cast. This series of surfers, seems to be somewhere, and, along with his straightforward storyline, by Dean, has taken the audience to the better part of the whole season. Considering all things, a job done very well. I hope it will be revived next season ...
