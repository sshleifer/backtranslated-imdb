This is a good movie, I will not go into any details as other user comments do a good job of care. However, I do not agree with this statement that it is the best work of Eastwood. It is not a firm position based on strong films that he has directed and starred. I want to think that two actresses Patey Mattik and Peggy Dyer in this film sometimes find it interesting to me. Despite good acting, again another film or television show appeared. My curiosity surprised me what happened to these two actresses?
