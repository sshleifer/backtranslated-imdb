Yes If you like a brave movie, check out this movie. This is probably the best Mexico image, because of the excellent custom, disrespectful and amazing soundtracks of Alcohol Allie. Many people 'croakka ??' They do not like it, they think it is very aggressive but they did not understand that it was just a representation of the high reality of Mexican society but similar to all the families of the Third World. I hope Benzamin Kane and Bruno Beecher (who gave another example of his greatness as an actor in this movie) will soon be reunited with a new movie. Just remember how Los Olividados (Luis Bu√±uel) misunderstood during the Liberation War, but now we always consider one of the best movies. Please prepare yourself and see this movie.
