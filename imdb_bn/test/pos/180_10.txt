Here is a movie of courage, determination, heroism, and courage. Plus, it has been set in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful, adventurous, and exciting mix of wonderful, confident, non-nonsense Fiji ... a wonderful role playing. This is one of my favorite movies. This movie will be seen repeatedly and will inspire you and enrich your life without any doubt. Not only is the story wonderful, but the movie has fabulous scenery and music and is nicely directed. This movie is as good as gold!
