This movie was mostly portrayed in Rockport MA, a beautiful city where my mother used to rent a small strainfront and I spent a summer like a lot of children, it's funny and cute. <br /> <br /> I must admit that even though I had a weak spot for this thrilling comedy, I had no desire to see this movie (why not know). I saw the trailers were not attractive, the cast was not attractive and I did not know what would happen to the plot. In the end I found it an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I totally enjoyed myself and acknowledged that this image was one of the most gems of last year. I am very disappointed that just a few people have enjoyed this "movie-ness" and it seems that the audience has been presented with this movie. <br /> <br /> I've read many reviews of this movie, and have to accept a certain level of shock in the usual feud in them. As a gradual student I feel very condemned myself, but it's a beautiful little film that is much better than this.
