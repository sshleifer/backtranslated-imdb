Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson make an exciting and exciting evening of entertainment for the young talent of a new team for the force forced by two highly gifted actors. And I could join that Hal Holbrook shines as a senator. These movies deserve five stars. I give it a ten on your scale. And last perfect. I am always surprised by the power of British actors to master my American accent. I was sure that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what a subtle localale for a mystery than New Orleans! Big easy, also known as Crescent City, enters every scene. As a writer and director, Sebastian Guerrej deserves high praise.
