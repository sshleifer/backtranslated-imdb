With the Neo-Realist movement in Italy, the film's greatest time of all time began in post-war Europe. In the next 2 or 3 decades, New Wave of France draws attention and continually creates bitter skills in Bergman on Scandinavian Island. But in 1971, Lucino Vicconti was geographically known as his miracle * Venece's death *, which is known as the death of the European film *. After the Sixties wounds, great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, usually become tired and pass a torch torch to a new American generation movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film is not exactly the special emotion of Visconti, but it is like a grand synthesis, like the general effort of European filmmakers to achieve aesthetic ideology in films. And to ensure the rest, you will receive any strict action-master without expressing Visconti here. He's not playing the crowd, folks: you go behind him and follow, or you left behind. Pacing is a challenge: slow, but not without emotional weight. The "event" seems to load in a few and far, but with each symbolic significance in sturm-und-drang cosmos. <br /> <br /> We probably will never be in this rare company, Terms: The great writer of the century, who inspired the story of the story (Thomas Standard) (Visconti), who is one of the best actors of the main role (Dirk Bogaard) And in the background, he often ruthlessly rigged, the 5th symphony of Gustav Mahelar Even taking advantage of Maheller's ability to inspire romanticism in the most inferior breasts, Viccantie has changed the original character Aschenche as a writer to a lesser composer from his original personality, even making Bogra look like Mahelar (Gaiki Mush, glasses, mother-in-law, duck like Walking). In Boudard, an actor in the history of the film has probably given the highest performance: this is a mostly silent act, and the actor has to pay a gesture or pay attention - it's a difficult strategy, such as Chaplin or just an animated body. <br /> <br /> There's nothing better than a movie. I will ignore the allegations from the Retlin-Addictors who say that it is too slow, but something more unsatisfied Flashbacks have been wrong and his opponent friend has been misplaced. Flashback fits nicely into the film's theoretical anxiety (i.e., aesthetic perfection: emotion or discipline?), And the suddenness and intensity of these obstacles work for the audience to stay awake. (Of course, some viewers will go to sleep through this movie.) Mahelar's nonstop stream and beautiful, Muran Venice will be nothing more than a beautiful picture; But this movie is actually about anything. And most of what is tragic about it: romantic (capital and more) especially sufferings As a romantic, sorry, Wisconsin knew what he had said. <br /> <br /> [Speaker. . . I guess] if there is nothing else, see * for the opening credit in Porto for its portent of death in Venice. . . And for her unforgettable finish, Bogaard's jet-black hair color with her sweaty, body-head and topping off onto her shiny white face. Meanwhile, the distant distance, the young Tadzio, the objects of the desire of Bogarde's death, stand in the ocean and point towards the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climate sequence is making things intense about the film: love, passion, beauty, loss, end of life at the beginning of another life, and cold death among warm, sunny beauty. * Venice's death is a miracle in the industry. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: Also published on the wikcinti masterpiece * Damned * *, I recommend that you start English subtitles while watching this movie. It is visible in English, but the sound of the DVD seems ugly and there is no Italian conversation during filming. <br /> <br /> <br />
