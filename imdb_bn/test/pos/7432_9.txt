I have a weird FF7 fan, for example I have to play it then sell it (bad mistake) but then buy again (good mistake ... erm) However, yes this picture is very good, very cool fight, music Very well, and you can not falter that CGI. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the film that felt the film was the only thing lacking in the involvement of another character, although it's almost all clouds, although great character, you can beat the beat of a cid and barret. <br /> <br /> But since this image was great in my opinion, and a clock is required. <br /> <br /> give a great film overall and it is 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More movies like this Create and worship you even more!
