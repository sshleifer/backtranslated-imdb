Anyone who enjoyed this series during the first broadcast (I'm back home from school) is now a certain age, so I can only add my feedback to requesters for DVD releases so that our first transmission memories are able to recover. It simply became a piece of history of unremembered TV archives. Since the sixties to seventy years old TV series can be released? Certainly the authorization of the right can not be that difficult. I can quote most lines of Shakespeare from this Iconic series and I think that their scams have swim with them because we tried to cross each other's memories of the text. Peter Dude deserves credit to have the foresight to bring the screen properly. This was certainly public broadcast at its best time. Robert Hardy and Shan Connie have fought with the death - this is from the beginning of the Golden Age of Kittens and BBC Television. Come to the BBC Clear it and please license. March 2009 Finally congratulations to the DVD here and for those who have made it. Picture quality is remarkably good and memory thinking as well as bit per bit. Now those who clamored for it who would buy it and relive those magic moments. <br /> <br /> UK viewers. The series was created by the BBC using British actors in the UK, and it is astonished that the DVD release zone 2 (Europe) is not available on DVD and can only be imported from the United States and played on revised players. It seems that perhaps there is a major right problem, perhaps the market seems to be very small, why did not the world leave the 'Free Zone'? So everyone can enjoy it?
