Definitely for city legend aficionados, Campfire Tales is often an often scary and always fun ride through popular stories. This is a movie that exceeds my (low) expectations. A horror movie that I have never heard or read, was released from the live video (allowed, often presenting us with beautiful surprises, but nowadays it can not be all or nothing with horror films), most of the unknown is a cast. Well, I'll leave you math. <br /> <br /> The picture is an entertaining, suspicious and overall enjoyable experience. The four stories are well-paced and satisfied. The only one I felt was that "pendulum" was a little weak, because it does not easily explain its plots or characters; However, I still loved the story, its atmosphere and the end. My favorite story was "People Can Can Lake Too" - it is not only patable, but rather educational. <br /> <br /> I've discovered Campfire tales, which is a chance among one of the gems of gems, and then everyone recommends it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
