This is the humanitarian and humanitarian of most films I've seen for a long time. The alluring, Susan Sarandon is a noon, team Robins and Susan Sarandon promoted in a movie that does not promote, but does not condemn it. It is a symbol of the film in the best film, and yet the story is fantastic from several real events. <br /> <br /> Which of the more amazing, sordan or pen? It's easy to say which is easier, but it's hard to believe it more difficult. They are just great. <br /> <br /> You may think that all the killers should be killed or you can argue that life without parole is not life and death is more compassionate. Whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you the opportunity to break and reconsider. <br /> <br /> Finally, nobody wants to be silent and reflect. This is a wonderful drama, it gives Catheris, it creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
