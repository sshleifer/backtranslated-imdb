Many horrific fans have complained that the scary has achieved very little progress in the last twenty years. I had the tendency to agree with the streams of Asian films, a trend that was naturally blue. However, it has created some true classic, and a story of two stories, at least for me, stands as an exceptional part of the movie, and is probably the best horror movie for very long time. <br /> <br /> Based on the Korean locales, it tells the sad moments of living with their parents and parents, both mentally challenged sisters. After facing a few problems back home on their first night, they are determined to stay together and deny access to their stepmother in their close relationship. Tensions rise and inevitable snaps. But what happened next is more than one pair of eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the fears become more emotional and quite realistic. In the end, you may need a few moments to remember some of your things, and it can piece together into your own mind, but this is just the scary and mysterious pair that crosses the definition of these styles and make it an instant classic. Seeing once again, only if it does all the work.
