A very different Jerry Lewis film, the famous movies that everyone knows does not like. Lewis has done the hard work of World War II and the National Socialism in Germany, rather than in the obsolete ways. But even more interesting and important, he works in a very non-US. And many things in the world, and especially in the film industry, non-American means more sophisticated, more subtle, more intelligent or easier. That is why the film does not achieve success in the United States, but it is a great success in Europe. <br /> <br /> To everyone, Jerry Lewis has proved in this film that he can do much more than a simple slapstick comedy.
