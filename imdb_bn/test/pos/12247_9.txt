Generally, I'm a comedy guy. I hired in the video store under the comedy, and thought "Albert Brooks! Excellent!" And rent it. It looks like a romantic comedy, and I think that I hate them, and this movie was full psychology of hatred. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a romantic comedy, played by an extraordinary lead and supporting cast (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson) and everything works well in themselves. The script is not real and compelling, as you are watching at night at the news station. It takes your passion and enjoys Hunter and Brooks and hates the heart, which makes some unexpected and fruitless ends, but it shows that you do not need a happy ending to finish a movie, you just need a real end. Everyone got what Not everyone lives well, and it shows Broadcast news. Maybe people do not like the end because it does not end your ideal happiness with romantic comedy ... but it works, it's real, and it's gifted. Broadcast News is a classic of its time and a fine romance movie with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not that much, but it's just a romance that I can remember. <br /> <br /> Broadcast news: 9/10.
