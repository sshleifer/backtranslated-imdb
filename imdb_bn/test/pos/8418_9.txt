I am a Maharashtrian, a teenager living in the 21st century, and it is clear that I am not much in Bollywood, only Marathi films. Yet, when I saw Shawa, it gave me a unique feeling, which was able to create only the most effective films. <br /> <br /> It is like most Indian films, when the film's true and complete impact is seen only in its original language. Many of the film's emotions and money are tied in his Marily's dialogue, which makes it difficult, it can not be effectively translated into English. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A grandfather and a child And it is done in this strong tie-up with justice. "Maza Persa Pan Lakhatat Ek Aakhey" (My Parsao is also one in a million) disagreements. Anyone who is closely related to grandfather - child relationship will be able to relate portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's definitely worth it. This is a movie which has a profound effect on me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
