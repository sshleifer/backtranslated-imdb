I usually feel like a movie / movie kind of movie, but once I saw the trailer for "radio", I could not resist. This is not just a great movie, but it's a great acting. Cuba Gooding Junior James Robert Kennedy, AKA.A. "RAdio." Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy. So a great story, great acting, and for a little comedy, I got 10 out of 10 "radio"!
