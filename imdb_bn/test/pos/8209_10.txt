I love this movie! <br /> <br /> Films and plays fulfill their goals when their social, political, and other issues affect majority. This movie served that purpose. <br /> <br /> I know this plot and who knows what happened to this event. While creating this film, the concepts presented in this flicker were better for the public, but in the strong positions people had already been with my friends. And, I know what they did when they did with Angela Bennett, because they did it to me. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's acting Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. He has portrayed a beautiful, intelligent, and malicious youth, who has the courage, to try to stop his helpless situation, to maintain his integrity and to restore his life and to save those who love him. To lose her self-conceit and to have sexual intercourse with an unidentified person, the old attempt to surrender to the age of attempt to surrender has added a shocking touch of reality. <br /> <br /> Solution of such problems by showing the only real measure of the plot.
