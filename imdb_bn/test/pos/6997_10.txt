I liked this movie very much. It was ruthless without socialism. Vin Diesel brings life to the rickety character and feels good and bad about you on different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw the iron giant and Vinnie is perfect. (Snowmobile - Oh yes, it's known as "Triple-X" or "XXx" - a poor example of his work). He plays the most active hero on Pitch Bla. I do not think Vin is a movie when you might go wrong. Unfortunately, Hollowood could throw him as an adventure worker star star - wrong! I think the script for "XXX" was weak, for which Win could not work with it. <br /> <br /> However, Peach Black is a great Sissy - see it! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
