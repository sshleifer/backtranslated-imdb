Finally, my curiosity and patience were seen to see this controversial film, which is now the first time in the UK to be released from the DVD, more than the awards. Peter Watkins has done the best of his curiosity and technical expertise. This pseudo-documentary is certainly its time before and still horribly relevant and up to date. This image is inspired by the rise of the twentieth century in the United States, when the government increased its legitimate use, violence and persecution, when anti-war movement shows increasingly violent and fundamentalist reaction. In order to deal with both of them, the government has introduced a so-called 'Punishment Park' for providing special training to the mass population and police units of the riots. The accused 'criminals', most of the workers, are imprisoned for years or years in prison, or 'likes' to spend three days in these gardens, where they are punished for their freedom, their death or even in jail. The conditions of the park exceed their worst expectations. This reminds me of the realistic version of a war royal (2000). <br /> <br /> The film's structure is highly effective and feels parallel with the cannibal Holocaust, which is produced almost 10 years later. Both films are created and illustrated in such a way that the viewer is thinking and feeling that he is actually seeing a real documentary and is surprised to see that this is a movie. Both of us face us with the underlying violent nature of mankind, but where the Kunal Holocaust does not raise any critical question about the deep state of the profound meaning (above all, it is a exploitation film in every sense) and the world. <br /> <br /> I I was deeply impressed with how much and so powerful and important films were canceled And may be marginalized for so long, it seems hard to believe. Maybe enough about the authenticity of this issue, how the world's energy structures work. I do not agree with the criticism that Watkins Polarize and Stereotypes, because the film depicts the activists and the protective forces of the framework of legal authority, who actually have such polarity here. If they do not, then there will be no conflict and so there will be no change in our society. Indeed, the clashes between these two groups often take stereotypical forms, whether you put into active workers and organizations in Latin America, Russia or New York City. If these groups are not constant towards this extremism, then active people will become part of the silence of the main parts which complain, but also live in the injustices of the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the children were real workers from LA, most were part of the police force and even some members of the tribunal were part of social and political establishment. The scenes performed in the Improved Court room do not present both the groups before shooting, adding to the spontaneous and invented feelings. Contemporary issues such as suppressing Black Pantha members (one of the black prisons, Bobby Salle of the Critical Revolutionary Critical Revolutionary) and Chicago Seven are considered to be trials. I am expressly and deeply involved with Watkins injustice and his concerns about human rights and growing suppressive measures by governments (now in the name of war in the name of terrorism), do not accept those who do not accept and refuse to become a brain. The Penalties Park is an important film that should still be seen in school and should be seen by those who share these concerns. Perhaps its marginalization could eventually be created for
