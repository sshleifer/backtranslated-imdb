I love this show love love. Whether I am not crazy in the brain or not. I think this program is very fun and entertaining but sometimes the left uncle Vito scared me. So finally I recommend this shot to be the perfect review. And so I really think if you "omg .. what fools" in humor, this show is for you. Looking at the look of the striking people is really interesting and there are many musical guests coming to the left home. Buy this stone for this reason! You have to buy it. Yes And left brother CKY is in the band and they are really good and sometimes come to the show. <br /> <br /> See the show on the bottom line ..
