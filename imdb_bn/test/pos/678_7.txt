Its single set, short cast and easy photography (except for a few brief effects) this movie reminds me of so popular 60-minute playhouses in TV's early few years. However, this mystery on the weak war widow Ida Lupino has become heavy because she tried to confront her semi-psychic handman Robert Ryan before killing his psychoanalyst Robert Ryan. And those who are better off playing the troubled part than actor Ryan. She was not very versatile - her essay comedy is almost painful. But the injured idealism (at the dangerous ground) or the mental pain of this film was not good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When trying to escape, the mystery comes from his ploys to keep him happy. It's a nail-bitter all the way. This is a very subtle "soul" part of the lupine which he was not so good at. Instead, it could be a role much less actress managed well enough. My favorite scene is with Ryan and Bratty's teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan has already been having difficulty with her manhood and what others are saying about her. Then when the whirling turns around and finds Ryan's scrubbing of an attractive face, she starts flirting with her soft sex and getting koja. Sensing problem, Ryan suddenly fends him off - finesse is not his strong case. Insulted, Whiting invaded his manhood by calling his work "women's work". That's it. To that point, he is modest and professional with Lupino, trying to set himself upright. But Whiting hit his raw nerve. Now whisking comes out of the door to be a whisker, to give value to lupinos. It's a riveting scene, done efficiently. However, this is a dozen or so film produced by Lupino and her husband when one of the viewers moved away from this little black-and-white in favor of wide-screen spectacles. very bad. He's a hugely gifted figure on both the back and front of the camera. She has at least one honorary Oscar qualification from a movie industry which she contributes so much.
