Young Eliass Wood and Joseph Magello are outstanding among the great films in this wonderful movie who promised to "take care of their mother" and how they were handled when their new parents began to kill a young boy. Throwing off supporters around the boys as well as the top authentic. The script really gets into a fantastic child's mind and heart. It is hard to believe that wood can grow up to look like something like Hans, but it's nothing new to Hollywood. This is truly the criticism of my only movie.
