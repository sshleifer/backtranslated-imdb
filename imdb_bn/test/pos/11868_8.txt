One night, Berkepe Randy (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewell (Levi Tyler) from her jealous boyfriend Utah (Andrew Dies Clay). She takes Jewel at her home. But Utah returns and Mandy Cooler wants to open Randy safely. Suddenly a shot - Utah dead. Then ... ... I'll stop here saying plots. Want to explain the "wild things" story. What I found so fascinating is that this plot (Stan Seddel, his first and last work - written in his death in July last year ...) was narrated from three perspectives - 3 men fell for Jewel. Each of them sees him from different eyes - such as John Goodman as a detective, who is in love with him for remembering his dead wife <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br />! Liv Tyler - She is a real jeweler. He's burning on the big screen! He played his role as 40th Noor-Thriller. Sweet - but at the same time, he is walking in the calm body and using men for his needs. And, of course, Michael Douglas. How can i forget him Mr. Bourmeister, bongo-playing assassin - he was quite calm <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes there was little for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. Paul Reisier (Randiss cousin Carl Carl) wore his leather clothes for Jewel, then that part started. "YMCA" -that was not so good here ... ... but together, "one night at Mac Cools" is a beautiful COOL picture-parody of the house! <br /> <br /> <br />
