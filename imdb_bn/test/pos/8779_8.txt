I've enjoyed this movie perfectly, which hit Hitcoos in many different ways, it was the first attempt of a plot long ago, which he reproduced later in his career. Perhaps the most amazing thing about it, is how stupid characters are stupid. After being observer, Moore Alper considered "patriotic" as a genuine truck driver for the role of Vonan Glazer as a traveler, an unforgettable travel-free show, and of course, the Auto Kruger as Subhash and the sophisticated villain, all of which were completely scattered by Bob Kumins, but rather harmful of wood (Andrew Davis " Compare Fujiov "to a stunt bridge jumps similar to Harrison Ford ) And the love of Priscilla Lane's heart and subsequent love towards Siming is never credible. <br /> <br /> Another major supporter, of course, must have hit the hitco, who has written the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. Many criticize old films for the lack of realistic effects. I feel like trying to express what the director wants to show with the lack of technology and this is a wonderful achievement. <br /> <br /> This movie is clearly a fascism message, which was created in the second second. First World War, but Hitco is not the most important thing, and emphasis on action is always important. Check out the good evaluation, especially for support roles.
