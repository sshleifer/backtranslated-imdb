This is definitely a religious classic !! <br /> <br /> It's too hard to follow, but again, say a movie like a Jacobs Ladder or even Fight Club. If you want standard rent, I can rent a Care Bear Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want to "see the world differently" then I will ask myself to open with Inigama and that is a movie that we challenge to see and think. <br /> <br /> The key for me is that the film was original and I was asking the whole question. So when I saw some complaints, I would say what the film is for and enjoy.
