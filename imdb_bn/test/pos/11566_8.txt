I used to watch this show as I grew up. When I think about it, I think it's very good. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I remember very well is the opening sequence and theme song. Without that, everyone is ideally cast out. The writing was very strong. Performance was very grade. I hope some networks will bring it back so I can see each episode. Before I wrap this up, I want to say that I always remember this show in my memories, although I have not seen each episode. Now, in conclusion, when some network ever returns it, I hope you catch it before it gets better for a day.
