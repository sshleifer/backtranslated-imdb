Plot speaker !!!! Dr. Bouch (George C. Scott) Head of Medicine at Head NYC Hospital He has left his wife, his children have denied him, he is cruel, and drinks too much and thinks of suicide. Also there is a killer roaming in the hospital. Then he met very strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and fell in love. He wants to run away with him - but can he give up completely old life and start a new one? <br /> <br /> <br /> It represents a suicide character and reports us a hospital full of incomplete overworked nurses and doctors. It's really fun to think (somehow) to think. It does not laugh loud smile - it's very black humor. Also correct the goal of acting - Scott is just great (and nominated to Oscar) here. You see him try to keep his vicinity in a completely crazy condition. The character of Riggs is a bit odd, but its real approach works and he is incredibly beautiful. The script is strong and brutal - but not too much. I think the ball ends up with a situation that it goes upwards - but it's still valuable. If this is done completely, then it is probably impossible to take it. Also find a small bit for Kathryn Helmand and stacked channing and Christopher guests in unknown bits. I personally took this issue seriously. From the what I heard, this bad came back in the 1970s but it is no longer there. Watch it for acting and script. I give it a 7.
