"One True Thing" is a very silent film, which was open review in the fall of 1998 but the light box office was open. This is the weak story of Allen (Rene Zeljager), who is forced to return home to care for an interim sick mother (Merrill Strip), so that his father William Hart can manage his academic division. These terms are only generalized. The power of "One True Things" can make their characters higher on the Hollywood cliche region. <br /> <br /> Strip Kate, the perfect homemaker, has the ability to stir a room with her charm to open her birthday celebrating a heart-warming ceremony. But Allen was never with his mother, and after graduation from Harvard University, there is a certain destiny about him - Alan almost thinks his mother is a simple head of air. On the other hand, he praises his father - who shared a special passion: the author Ellen wrote for an aggressive New York farm, and her last piece is broken by Hurt when it's almost heartwarming, who seems to be very alone. <br /> <br /> Allen's perspective changes and he closes to his mother and is far away from his father. . Hartal maintains excuse when the family needs him the most, and Allen speculates that he has an affair. Meanwhile, he left his desk while spending time working with his mother's "religion" group The Mininn, and learning that his mother is not as weak as the first religion. <br /> <br /> <br /> Very far away, an excellent composition in the study of the character "One True Thing" is very far away. The strip has again turned into a beautiful performance, this time it works with a subtle level that starts slowly but ends with a brilliant lecture on the wedding pledge. Strip achieves his 11th Oscar nomination for this performance. The strike is as firm as the father who carries such a secret that it does not appear until the last moment. But Rene Gelghiger stole this movie. Forget about "Chicago", "Cold Mountain", "Breedgate Jones' Diary" or any other you have seen and rent this movie. He is awesome. While working on the bitter frustration of her character during her parents' comprehension, Jelvis started a realistic screenplay to fight for a young girl to keep her lips when she shouted.
