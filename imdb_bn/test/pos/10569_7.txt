Historical drama is an area where the British can not only beat. So when I'm not very fond of this genre, I usually see it as if it is with British and beautiful actors. <br /> <br /> I've never read anything from Sarah Waters. Of course I must do something. So I really do not have to expect to do this. I heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. While viewing it I found it to be much more interesting than expected. Not saying too much, Plot's twists and watches are unexpected as well well-crafted. Although there was a turn almost somewhere, it took me a minute to get everything straight. <br /> <br /> The production value is good, the actors are very hard and the speed is good, even though I've found it a bit slow in the last half hour. Although it may be, I have problems with movies for a long time after the plot is less or less finished. All though all, this is a fairly enjoyable three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in the historical drama.
