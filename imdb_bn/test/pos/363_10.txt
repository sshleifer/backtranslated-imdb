This movie was fabulous. It's definitely a top 5 hitcov film. Instructions and camera shots are almost flawless (from the point of view of the dog when it shows the boys gradually slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It is very convincing that an innocent person can fall in the trap of him. <br /> <br /> I will mark Bruno as the second most attractive character of Hitco (first of all, first bets). Robert Walker is a very credible maniac drama. He does not overact the part of it (similarly, not to overact its parts in the parcels). Overall, it's a great movie, absolutely for a hitcock fans to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
