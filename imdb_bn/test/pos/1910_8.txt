Dolmeette is a blacksplitting film, good, dolimite and women of Kong Phu Keller, his army, which led to Queen marriage. He struggled using his kungfu ability to return to his club, total experience, Willie Greene and their their devotion. I liked this movie because of the diverse dialogue and the ability to use his ability to preach to Rudy Ray Moore's rhythm.
