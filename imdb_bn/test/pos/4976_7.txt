Being an actor is somewhat predictive for the future, keeping a line in such a film is always interesting. In this case, I repeatedly called Edward G. to Stanwick I was curious about Robinson's statement - "I promised you the Valley", because he discussed only the residents to try to control all the land of Logas. Ten years later, Stannieck will act as the mother tongue of Barcli's family at "The Big Valley". Because I think he may feel old in the previous film. I think all the brilliant gowns and fancy riding parties have a way to find a youthful direction. <br /> <br /> For the top row line, it evaluates Lee Wilkison of John Parish (Glen Ford), a parish of them attacking his bird and after torch in his house, the forces use his knowledge of military techniques to take several Wilkison hands. Very soon put out the mentioned out. I liked how the film discovered its character, as it began with the mathematical calculations with Wade Matlock (Richard Jakeel). The set up for the attack was also a trick driver, in the fight against the two guys in front of the two guys, bad boys oppose the revolving technique. For him, Parish had something to say - "Do not fill the enemy on his condition." <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" is a good title for this movie, and perhaps in its class in the mid-1950s, although today's values ​​do not come near blood, but no one will find it at "Tombstone" or "Open Range", where Bullets will create a nasty flood. But it was attracted by the fine performances from the principals, who sought tremendous betrayal with a sub-plot, which seemed almost terrible because the character of Stanwick was a fraud.
