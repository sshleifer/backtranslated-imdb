I will not say anything about music, because it can be so deep that it can be a very different review, so let's focus on the film ... No doubt, one of the best things of the Forman. <Br / <br /> <br /> General story about love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yeah, an ideal that is even ready to go to the pacifist war ... <br /> <br /> No single fake word , Single mesh character, the story's unique fake feeling, because love, freedom and friendship are not complicated for the film's characters. These things are not something that "everyone can see from a different angle", there is no need to think much about these things ... their love is easy, their friendship is easy, their ideals are common "words" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, - (because he sings in one of the scenes of the movie) and enough to make him happy with his property ... <br /> <br /> Burger ever admits Can not do anything ... and that's right ... if he wants to go to some rich boys in his dirty old dress and huge long hairstyle, he will do it ... if he wants to see his friend just his friend He'll do it ... He never thinks twice ... He just does it. <br /> <br /> How? Why is he so powerful? The answer is simple: because he's free. <br /> <br /> See how the wind makes waves in this movie and you will understand it all, perhaps you'll be free yourself.
