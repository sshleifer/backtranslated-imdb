This sound was a great movie in every sense. It confronts tribalism in a society which is an intrinsic intolerance of intolerance. It criticizes many Indian practices that many think of being oppressors - such as the arrangements for marriage by others, the status and importance of the head, religious hypocrisy, sexuality, women's assessment of their child's ability to make, compulsory ideas, and so on. At the heart of the movie is a sensitive love story that crosses the limits of society that find two titles themselves. The film is well-versed and genuine, mostly against Bollywood flickr, from beginning to end credible. I first saw the major flaws in the film that two lovers naturally do not attract each other to each other, because they feel trapped in a marriage with a passion and death. Reward It can take part in sexual awakening of characters, but most people stuck in the same situation "will not cause homosexuality". From the beginning of the film it seems clear that the two characters are quite upset - when Radha shows Ashsh with her scene at the end of the movie, then she makes it clear that "she died without the desire", and if she had such intention, Fulfilled completely, and when the City did not like her, Sita became very frustrated. In these situations, people do not hate homosexuals - they may seek comfort among others in the same position, but it is not clearly seen in the film that they started from the beginning - completely opposite. Some people are bisexual, it's true, but mostly loses or gay. In the case of women in the film, both of them had anecdotal dispute for husbands. . . If this incident does not happen, then they will naturally find the necessity of expressing their wishes in a relationship that they might not have considered otherwise. The film ignores this. Other bad characters are named after. . . Using names related to various Hindu scriptures, the name Sita and Radha deliberately think of shock and turmoil (in America a picture of America film "Jesus" and another name, "Paul" as a gay fantasy). The film is strong enough to stand on its own and I do not need any such devices in my opinion. At no rate, profitability does not go far away from the movie's power. This is really a very sensitive and powerful story - you will be with you a lot of pictures and letters after leaving the theater.
