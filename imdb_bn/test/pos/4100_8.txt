As a film buff, I have read all the inspirational reviews and funny, satirical comments about this movie (I like Woody Allen's quip "If I can live my life again, I will not make any changes ... Musical reunion of the Lost Horizon"). Therefore, I have never been able to see it without a hilarious dance / set / song etc. Recently I came across a widescreen DVD and it was the first time I saw it for a few years, with a friend who never heard of the movie. He really enjoyed it, and - after trying to block all the negative ancestors, I definitely had the film - so I also do. There is nothing special about Lost Horizon and it is much more enjoyable and visible than other movies in the early 1970's. It's not even camped in particular. There are repetitive and simplicity, rather than some song lyrics, but it's not really clear when you hear them for the first time or the errors are advancing in advance, so you are ready to blame them. The critics who have cast Caste can not sing the melody, the reason for this criticism is different, Levi Woolman, Olivia Hasee and Peter Fin are dubbed (brightly, voice matches their conversations perfectly), and Sally Kellerman is really beautiful and completely Unique singing style. Verbally, Kellerman's Duvet is excellent with Olivia Hase in "Things I Will not Miss". Legendary Hollywood star Charles Bailey should be referring to a brilliant performance as a high lama - and his comments about the destructive of mankind are gently appropriate for today's depleted world. I did not claim for a second that Lost Horizon is a wonderful composition (which I do not miss about it is unclear curiosity, and Bobby Van's question "I am an answer" that can be easily cut), but if you also saw the Lost Horizon No, or have not seen it for a while, try to see without the "Oh boy, laugh at the waves of this trap" attitude, and you will be surprised how enjoyable it really is.
