From the manufacturers of DVDs it got another day. I saw an advertisement in a free magazine when the family was trapped in a hotel, did not hear anything about it. After reading it was pictured on the beach in Belmedy I just had to buy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at what they did with the location of this movie. It has not become a psychological science-like science-fai and survival horror. <br /> <br /> A good story, which was different, had special effects for the budget. It is produced with Â£ 8000. Acting was better than average for low budget film. They were able to edit the entire coastline to feel that they were like the dry desert planet. <br /> <br /> The weapons in this movie were realistic and the animals were as fascinating as the impressive. <br /> <br /> <br /> I will buy a future publication from all these people, perhaps the next worst horror (hint hint) Additional information about the DVD was very informative about the background for the producers, I would like to see shorts included in the next few DVD releases. <br /> <br /> Continue the excellent work
