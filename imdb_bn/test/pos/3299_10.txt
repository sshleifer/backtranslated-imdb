"Boy Next Door" is a funny romp through male neuroscience. In just 15 minutes, the film takes us to a ride that does not match the full-length features. Great performance, excellent camera work and editing --- a classic end to this short start. Travish Davis Kudos for the tension of double duty as both director and star. She is the most fun newbie from Woody Allen. And Richard Mole looks like again. If you think that what he could do was "Bullet", "Night Court" belief, think again. This film of this film highlights the brilliant post of Stephen Garrell. Remember that name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garve is the true current king of the Comedy Comedy.
