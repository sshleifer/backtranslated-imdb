Based on Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time", this amazing film by Erill Morris records the life and work of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. Scientists contribute more, despite its weakened disease, ALS, an active physicist only dreamed. <br /> <br /> This picture was about the age of Hawking, and how he was a poor student recognized bright. He adopted his way through the college and university, where he diagnosed the disease which will eliminate the normal functioning of his body, but allow him to stay alive and think completely. Stephen's mind developed from childhood to the present day, at one point his mother said - when he was pregnant, he would be in a future hospital time Astronomer bought the atlas. Hawking describes himself as a schedule of discovery, when Morris interviews close friends and colleagues, who could be very lucky to become friendly. <br /> <br /> He discovered how he discovered how the universe would expand, like a wide discovery. We also know that they died eventually and now become known as "black drops", if this is the case, then will the universe begin to correct itself until the "big crank" is reached? As Hawking keeps it. And when the universe starts withdrawing, will not the time be "reverse"? During this question, I started thinking that death can not end, perhaps one day will be delayed, and our death will be our rebirth and we will be born to our death. The universe is just a big cycle like everything else. <br /> <br /> This is what Hawking is telling us, everything in the universe itself is recycling itself. It is completely logical and it can surprise your attention to the tens of millions of directions. That's why I love this picture and why it must be seen !!! 11 out of 10 ... Morris never does the same!
