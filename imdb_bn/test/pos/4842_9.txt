At relatively young age, I do not know how bad anti-semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family originally came from. This movie absolutely haunted me I've seen many movies about prejudice, racism, and anti-semitism, but it seems more difficult than me. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best Indie movies I have ever seen .. I had to travel for 45 minutes to see, and it was good. Almost everything was great about the movie. Sometimes it was a little slow, but it really did not bother me because the film was very atmospheric. It happened in the 40's, and it looks like it was really 40s. Acting was fantastic ... William H. Messi was always wonderful, so Laura was Darren, and I was amazingly surprised by the performance of Matloff, playing this deadly anti-Semitim neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
