I do not fully agree with the person who commented about this movie. To me, this story is a growth hormonal disorder, a man trying to show interest in her for love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> there are also. The person who created the happiness to come back has found something important from the giant, which is the love of family and companions. <br /> <br /> and comedy, it looks somewhat sunny in certain parts of the audience. Show <br /> <br /> And I have to admit, it makes me a little tear.
