Hands down, Best drama / comedy show on television. Finding a life story written about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter, and discovering the things she finds out, not only the world but also herself. Lorelie Gilmour (Lorraine Graham) struggled to find ways to have a close relationship with his daughter but managed it in the right direction, through which the show is becoming difficult and difficult. Rory Gilmour (Alexis Blayle) has been caught in a world of books and has begun to discover only boys and their own ideas of rebellion, which is astonishing both of them. This show is one of my favorites, with the help of a great variety of Look Dances (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St James (Melissa McCarthy) and other delightful characters. What makes the show at the top really is still complex, incredible, and malicious writing often uses the reference from the Pink Dynasty to punk culture.
