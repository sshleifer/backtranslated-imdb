Wow, here's another great golf movie. I've enjoyed at least three of the last few years that I really enjoyed, nicely done, beautifully illustrated and inspirational. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Astrology Stroke" and "The Legend of Bagger Vans." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If this was true, then this is the real story. An amateur defeat won all the professionals and the United States Open Golf Tournament is a strangely achievement. I believe this is the only time that has been completed for 100 years. I do not know the fiction needed for the dramatic impact of this movie. I know that I'm planning to read the book, and I know in real life, Francis Wiemet had three strokes lead with only two holes, in contrast to what we saw in the film. <br /> <br /> Whatever. The victory of Francis Wyomate on golf legend Harry Warden and Teddy Ray It's a wonderful story and the filmmakers did a great job here to present it. This is not just for golf fans; This is a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, many of them are golf golf only but there are subplots like the relationship between their father and Ummah and there is a beautiful young girl who is accompanied by actor-director-director Bill Paxton. Perhaps interested in her. It's a touchy story to give someone a chance to have a baby. The film also deals with the ghosts of the track to come from the wrong side of the track and tries to create it in an eleistist's sport which it was both European and American. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As the Steven Dillane such as Ouimet Warden winner of Shiite La Bauf. For those who do not know, Warden is like his day's Tiger Woods, even more impossible. In the film, Warden is portrayed as a warm, nice person; A real man Another major competitor, Ra (Stephen Marcus) is shown as a innocent nasty guy. <br /> <br /> The fourth main character of this golf story is the most captivating person in the film: the fifth-grade boy who opens Oumet's food. He came with a lot of humor and curiosity for the movie (Josh Fleetter). <br /> <br /> If all this - with a huge disaster against two powerful professors, coming down to a playoff and a final hole - it was not true, you would think, "Oh, man, so who can believe this?" This true-life story makes fun of finally being captured in movies. Like another sports film of 2005 - "Syndrome Man" - there is another extraordinary movie that came to the award when it was ignored. I do not think it won the best movie awards ... just the heart of their audience.
