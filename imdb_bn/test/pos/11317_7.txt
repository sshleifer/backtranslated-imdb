The film is partly a thriller and partly appearing publicly by the views of politicians, terrorists and of course sufferers during the announcement of public service. This smart drama reading is aware of pollution and survival disorder during this period, when viewers are encouraged to disbelieve guardians and be afraid of attackers in the event of the crisis being operated. Originally the BBC broadcast film makes the suspect susceptible to official preparation. The performance is accurate, though horrible, though understated. Spotlight is a start, a provocative start that leads to a big discussion, but it works according to my opinion, provides the right thrills and creates the audience logic and asks yourself questions.
