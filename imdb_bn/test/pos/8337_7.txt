") <br /> <br /> There's a Yankee doodle playing in his grandfather's house. Have you noticed that this tune plays the same role as Doris Day's "Best of the Best" by Hetcock's "Very Knowing Person" (1956)? And this grandfather who finally is the most brave person in the family. So old he does not even tell you his age, but his country is proud and gangster's hateful blackmail. <br /> <br /> A good film by Wellman.
