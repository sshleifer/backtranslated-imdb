Whenever I want to describe my feelings about this movie (and signals) the words make me fail ... what's wrong with this? Certainly ... starting with "subsidiaries", which did not have enough effect for special effects. So why can I glorify these movies ??? For the mass of the mass consumer, who have more depth than quality, more cheap fun than the depth, "blade" (this is not a capital letter), "Underworld", "Dakula 2000", "Drookula 3000" and popcorn press and There are good movies for drinking some cox ... On the other hand, how mistresses make the maximum effort towards the claims of mistress fans In what is the Romanian vampire himself, the story is set transasiliyaya (visible on the location of scenes is more credible), and the atmosphere for any "action-packed" Orchestral music is based on the Chase or not expensive. RADU itself is the source of the atmosphere ... how it should be like a vampire and how it should behave! Add a breathtaking dark fort with dark entrances in Romania, it includes some common vampiric elements (such as vampires flying on the shadows of the wall shadows) and your art works! In short, if you like me, you are fascinated with the vampire and feel that their appearance and setting should also be terrible and dark, there is no better place to look than in the Gulf movie ... or in vampire journals, bright spins are extinguished ...
