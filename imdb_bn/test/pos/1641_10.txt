It was a really dark and dark episode. Fantastic execution, wonderful acting and atmospheric instruction, 'Ice' is one of my favorite episodes. It seems quite realistic to me, 'Pusar' 'Grootesake' 'Waitord' 'and' Home '(it's pretty good in the dark environment of my case), their paranoia, their growing anger and their growing anger are fully executed by the actors. However, after a few hours of 'I saw' I had a problem that: it was small! I wanted more! <br /> <br /> Overall, what's 98% of all X files in 'Ice'? Excellent performance, intense story writing, great guidance. All work <br /> <br /> 10's 10
