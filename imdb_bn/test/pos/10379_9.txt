Why do some people complain about the comedy about this movie and at the same time very unreal. It was realistic, of course there was not much comedy. I do not think a comedy will force you to laugh out loud. Many fine humorous, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank were just pictured in a dreamlike character. In real life, there are many people whose facial expressions do not change much, so it was quite right to observe him. The end was quite unreal, I want to say, but happy. It's a light-hearted movie that is a feeling-good finish. I like it Actually, like it. A serious part was to Kruger Schwedt, and I'm not happy they did not see what happened there. He showed quite clearly how he showed when he came back.
