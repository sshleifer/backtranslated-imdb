* Spoiler alert !! If you do not want movie spiders, please do not read !! * <br /> <br /> I'm planning to watch this movie in the last weekend, but it makes me unable to finish my plans. So I and my friend have planned to see it after school today. Boy, we are glad we do At the beginning of the film, at the beginning of the film, Charlie Crocker [Mark Hallberg], Steve Frazelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, known as "Napster" [Seth Grein], after you get the nickname], handsome rob [Jason Statham], left ear Deaf], and John Broser [Donald Switterland]) 32 A brutal plan to steal gold bricks. It leads to the whole opening, which is good within 10 to 15 minutes, and includes a boat chase, which opens the film right. When driving their van van away, Steve Fridgeley activated the group, gold theft, and John Bridger, who killed most of the party (retired) leader. After one year, Fast Fawood, where Stella Brasher (Charlize Theron), the daughter of the daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers. Charlie Crocker (who was indirectly responsible for the death of his father, called him to retire for Heist) said that he found Steve (who has gone in secret) and wanted to return to him for what he did. The first was reduced but later agreed, and in the history of Los Angeles, for the purpose of creating the best traffic jam in the history of the game, the mechanic wrench is combined with the help of G Frank (Frankie G). This is a perfect mix of action with fun bits thrown across the movie. Seth Greene's character created an ongoing joke about Lyle, making Napster and how Sean Fanning (who created a Kymo) stole it while falling asleep, and finally Lyle would answer only the restoration as "Napster". There is also a funny line from Seth's film, which goes "He said in an interview that he called it Napster because it described his hair as it was a claw, he said that when he was stealing, he was silent! The beginning and the last sequence of pure genius , And everything fits perfectly in. With the movie, I can think of the only negative thing that is played by Edward Norton He was not a big, tough bad guy, he was acting and he performed the minimum minuscule (for example, he was forced to make this movie due to contractual obligations), but the problem with that film is the only real sudden The movie is still enjoyable, and I certainly recommend watching it. And if you are not interested in the real movie, then comedy Mikate visited Seth Green to shine. He's in. Rating: **** out of *****
