"Man of the Year" Tom Dubbs (Robin Williams) is the story of a political comedian (John Stewart or Stephen Colbert), which has its own television show. He speaks about all kinds of things in his words, but his main focus is political issues which he expresses very much about. One day in his show, a fan from the audience should imagine that the US should run Dobbs. After the episode of the episode, millions of people expressed their views on opting for Dubbas to be a great candidate for the President of the United States to create various applications. A few weeks later, Dubbs decides to win the President and the President and win the election. Alanorro Green (Laura Linnni) seems to have everything running according to her plan, and there is some debate about her position. A fun but serious political thriller ensues ?? <br /> <br /> Anyone walking in this movie to see this cute comedy will surely be disappointed. I'm always wondering how some people are confusing their marketing campaigns when their movie marketers are confused. "Man of the Year" is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because posters, online advertisements from trailers, see everything as a comedy and think. I really want to say that 1/3 movie is funny, and the rest are closed as a political thriller, which makes good arguments and lets the audience think. If this film is being marketed then I would be surprised to wonder, because this picture shows serious problems between her comedy routine. <br /> <br /> But enough about marketing, leaving yourself in the film. <<br /> I really like "Man of the Year" though I was hoping to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. I have many things to give credit to this movie, which is the film's work of switching between comedy and dramas, though it seems a bit strange at first. I really think that after filming you out of the film, the film can be a political thriller than a comedy that you feel comfortable with. Some can not believe that they are watching a comedy and ultimately they are not trying to say what the film is trying to say, but for those people, they can not blame the marketers for advertising this film. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" discusses many things and seems very strong opinion. Talking to Tom Dobbs, he said things needed to be said and not about their candy coating. I also think of the whole political concubine, although most critics seem to have hurt the film again due to misguided marketing. Computerization The idea of ​​voting has spread over the past few years and with all the problems, the problem has been solved in the computer's film. There are also big business controls on voting. Also get the tackle. <br /> <br /> As far as acting goes, I think everyone involved has done well. Robin Williams has the opportunity to become funny at the same time playing Tom Dobbs. Some have said that Williams preferred her welcome as a comedian but I personally still think she is funny and she is also a good actor. It's probably one of the few events though we see him go from behind to fun and I think it works well. Also in a decent film, Lewis is looking forward to a black co-star. He again likes Black when he appears on "The Daily Show" and stands, but he was terrible in most of the movies. This was a good film for him because I think his political opinion has been adapted to the story, which is trying to reveal director Barry Levinson. Laura Linna is a fine addition to the cast and again proves that she is a very good actress, and in the end, both Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblom did a great job by handing out these roles to them. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" was written and directed by Bari Levinson, who brought us such films as "Rain Man", "Good Morning Vietnam" and "Wag the Dog". Levinson did a fine job writing and managing the film. As I said I know many critics did not like the full political thrill of the film, but I think it has been nicely fits. It was actually nice to see the mainstream movie that lets me think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a good job with this picture. <br /> <br /> Finally, do not expect to see this movie that this ad is selling to you. It smiles but at the same time it runs more as a political drama. The marketing campaign guides you to believe it is not stupid or stupid. I really like this picture that this movie is not a common Hollywood movie. It also tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and at least worked for me. I like the fact that this film does not solve any problems and it is not a common Hollywood end. I was trying to finish rather than go, but surprisingly I did not finish the way I thought. This is a movie that will allow you to laugh but allow you to think and wonder about what will happen after a few minutes. I think it's a bad movie that will be hit by bad marketing.
