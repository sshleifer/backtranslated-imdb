Here he hates George Hazard (James Reid), who considers the hostile enemy, Yankee's answer, but with whom he closely ties. Soon, the dangers from southern areas and north became friends despite the risky era of civil war. Family, friendship, and nation were doing the right thing at the time of separation, otherwise it was the heart's heart with soap operas and romance.

Actor. Villand is there in Cairo and interesting to see them. It is not a historical event, it is a historical fiction and fully dramatic entertainment. But it ended up Cliffhanger and got beautiful cinematography, clothing and position. It's like watching an epic film, which has been running with the wind for a long time with war scenes! The script may be a bad time and the performances may not be good despite good castings. Swayze Terri Garber hams it up as well but some performance, beautiful and strong Madeline really good performance such as Kirstie Eli, James Reid (as George Hazard) and Leslie Ann Downes They set and shot in the southern position. The music is great and it is a good feeling movie that we root for the good son and see Vilhen's plan and finally they fall. All fans of civil war films and jack novels will see it. It is available on DVD and VHS.
