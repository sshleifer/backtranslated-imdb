Hey, this Ralph Westhoff knows a lot about people! We have five minutes to talk about nine women and nine men, every person who is taking part in a speed dating event. A good idea to make a movie out of this conversation. Even better: it works very well! The conversation is diverse, original and authentic, every person is perfectly characterized, something unusual that sounds like in German films: Remember all these years, we were suffering from stupid zeitgeist comedyies as "workholic" for the German. <br /> <br /> <br /> But now it's time for young German directors to do their own work and simultaneously funny and intelligent and simultaneously Dossier films have brought the risk of creating. The time of "Shoppen" is also good, although it mainly represents the dialog, but it tensions and interest. After a while, you are actually interested in seeing how this person and the woman will do. Some of the participants meet for two later, showing fun of interacting with their "real life". Of course, the film has some flaws: it is not very cinematic (but such a movie?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but it is all limited. The most important thing about this movie: we have some extraordinary good actors here. Imagine this: all of them are still unknown here in Germany (most are obtained from Munich or Bavarian theater scene). But I predict that 18 major actors, at least 11 movies and TV shows will become very familiar. It's great to see many fresh and talented faces at the same time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Remember to consolidate its "flower garden", you can conquer this woman's heart with this woman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you open your mouth, you can not help but feel laughing. Listen to how he declares "asshole" and the pink shirt calls the man "Bishcheral"! <br /> <br /> Felix Helmman: From the "Bishcherle" fun to the top. The inconvenient truth is that there are a lot of guys around. His face reminds me of the Weber of the Floor of "SportFrende Stylar". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This woman has everything: love, hope, disappointment, beauty. Her "You Want Children" scene is a classic. A great actress we can hear again, there is no doubt. <br /> <br /> <br /> David boy, is this man harmed now? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in "Sideways". I hope I do not act like this. Julia Koschitz: "looking good" woman in the circle. Julia used to play in my village theater, Cudo! I think he will come in a lot of TV series. <br /> <br /> Martyn Boot: The revolutionary man finally holds the most current and most popular women. Do you want to share a taxi with this guy? <br /> <br /> Catherine von Steinberg: She played a great role in "Tortt" last year. This movie has less of its trans-like performance. Look at her beautiful face and hear her dirty smile. The best scenes related to the film are related to her. <br /> <br /> Mathias Bundsu: I write "write" all of these - going back to school. I'm sure whether or not the hot blonde got her allergic reaction due to her cat. Such as chicken Matthias' screenplay is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Madinah Katin: My mother-in-law of my ex-girlfriend was the same speaker as her. On the day I met him, that was the only day of my life, I needed peace here, so bad memories. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: "Excellent and Great People" in Circle. Limpins has a humorous talent that is better than the so-called "Comedians" on TV. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wagner: The victim of the "flower gardens" metaphor of Sebastian. Lisa's face is full of fun and tragic, her story makes me feel good and sad at the same time, <br /> <br /> Olavour Burgin: "Good at the circle" Feeling "man. Eventually he was arrested by Julia. These two really fit together. I think he will come in a lot of TV series. <br /> <br /> Julia Hinz: "cute, conventional" woman. I hope he will not be underestimated: Julia's face is seriously injured in a serious change from the helpless! <br /> <br /> Stephen Jinnner: "The son of nature" likes to eat, eat? And good sex See the body language between him and hot blonde! Anja Clown: "The girl of the marriage" is in some good moments, but pray for forgiveness, failing to play drunk on screen (like most actors). <br /> <br /> Christian Puffle: Playing arrogant and narcissistic folk. The actor does not believe the owner of two art-house movies in Munich. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tanja Shlif revolves around her daughter. I'm sure many male visitors can go for it. I heard he can play a dramatic role, so I'm weird
