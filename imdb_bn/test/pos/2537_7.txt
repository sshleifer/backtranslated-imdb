This park is no stroke. I saw it came out, and it was not guts to see it again. You will not see more horrific devastating or depressed movies. I felt I have been severely beaten. What kind of world are we living in when we are treated badly by rubbish? This is our world, what we created, which we have allowed to happen. And I want to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible for it. Babino made this movie to wake us, pushed us to the core, and he succeeded. When we see graphic results of such behavior, how can we be cruel, or denigrating, or neglecting our children? He is pointing out to all of us the worst of our society and all of us to do this to the Almighty. And if you do not do anything every day to counter it, you are part of the problem. I'm not a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the condition of my soul.
