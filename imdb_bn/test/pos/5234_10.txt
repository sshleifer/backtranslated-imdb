I do not expect so much old films that are so fascinating in the West of 1930. Their covered wagons are surprised by their ugly credibility, facing the dangers and dangers of the West Frontier's scenes, storms and muds, river crossings, Indian attacks and all kinds of trials. Most movies are taken out and the movie has real epic feelings about it. Actors must have had the same experience as the original pioneers, and the results are surprising. Wagons, dresses, looks every single story and looks right. The letter is simple but credible, a straightforward story, that travels like Wagon Train to its destination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of his first roles in John Wine is the slim and young, leading scouts of Wagons, and he has done a fine job as idealistic young bordering. He has gone against the terrible extraordinary three villains, such as Ian Keith, a gambler gambler, Charles Stevens as a Mexican sidekick, and a Tieran Power, a senior, growing, beer-like trap. Power beard, snarling, life is bigger than both illustrations are ridiculous and menacing. I keep him portrayed with a bandanna, gold fitting earrings and black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder, he grunts and becomes different threats and humiliation. His character can be easily transferred to a pirate ship without any problems. She stole almost the entire picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In his part, long-time lover with indifference, which led to his firmness. The results are quite funny and are finally happy to see them together at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenes are amazing, beyond the real ones, the wagons and the bows down the arches below the ropes. The Indians who are obviously not real actors, and do not makeup white actors, appear as both friends and enemies and are treated with their dignity. Wayne's character is a complimentary group of young boys that Indians are his friends, who taught him everything about living in the desert. <br /> <br /> The big cat is called a genius by a gifted cast. Sailor This is likely to be seen to be very naive to many modern viewers, but there is a perfect dignity about it which never lets it be fanciful. There is a great deal of deliberate humor, one of which is the anger of the pioneers, who can shout aloud loudly with a loud voice. He has been interrupted by his cauliflower specimens about planting his ownership of cats and very practical imitation of the realistic cat, because it would be crazy to look at the annoyance for the invisible creatures. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended Western fans and lovers of general movies. This is a classic film for really age.
