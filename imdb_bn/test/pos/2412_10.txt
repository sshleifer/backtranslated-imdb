Next Karate Kid, in my opinion, a wonderful martial arts flick. I thought Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hillary Swann) looked good in their main dress. To me, Ned (Michael Cavalri) was a real fault. He got the Julie with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Bolls) because it was. If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Iranside) was a pure ******! Because he was a very tough man who would not tolerate wrong. My favorite part was the prom and showdown between Julie and Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I like the martial arts flickr or recommend this memorable hit to all of Hilary Swan's fans.
