Each role has been played to the smallest and played with the barbarians. <br /> <br /> Do not go beyond the wrong way Malone will never go wrong. Her two co-stars have her equal in this film. Ryan Gosling could be the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein gives date to his best performance. This is a thought and conversation provocative film that teens and young adults should be seen by. You will think about this film for the day and talk about it. Highly recommended.
