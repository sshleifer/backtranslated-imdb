I was able to preview this movie through UCL's pre-screening program, and tell me: this movie is awesome !!!! I have seen many movies, but some people laugh me so deeply or later I will talk about this movie. Before watching the movie I was respected for Tennessee D, and now I'm about to talk about them MAD. After the release on September 14, I must definitely buy their album and see the movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were looking to watch this movie, then stop it! The price of movie tickets at this time is extremely valuable, because you definitely have to laugh while the whole thing laughs. <br /> <br /> Besides the comedy, the magnificent and divine music flowing from KG guitars Jeb's voice inspiration is amazing. The audience left such a fool that this beautiful ridiculous and amazing riffs could be made with such ridiculous (and comedic) songs. If there is nothing other than music, then this film is worth the admission price. <br /> <br /> With the traditional "D" history and almost all aspects of the Hallmark, with a wonderful compilation story Taini, new songs, sunny comedy, and some fantastic awesome chemo, this movie places there with the best! See it !!
