I saw the 1973 film Lost Horizons and read most of the reviews for this movie. I had many opportunities to improve on this move, but I was looking for something different than those who were looking for perfect songs with the perfect song and the best performance, and this film gave me this. I saw this movie as a critic, but a person is looking for a little hope, a little joy, some of my daily life, and I got it. You may be singing and acting critically, but I do not look at when I go to a movie. I want a little release from my daily life, a little while where I can sit back and imagine a better life, where people love others and help others. It is embarrassing that we can not enjoy a movie which it tells us and it leaves like a English teacher to read the fifth grade. This can be very simple, but really, it will not be nice.
