Jean-Pierre Melville is a director who has recently met me (I have seen Bob L'Flamboo and Le Samorie fully realized), but Le Scycal Rouge (Red Red Circle, which supposedly has Buddhism in a word) I have realized that I am quite Seeing time and exploiting the criminal film, as I have seen several times. Although his film is in dialogue, it is essentially keeping the film scenes in line with the plot. Be careful to emphasize the patterns of movement or character in me, even in seemingly visible scenes / sequences. Melville has fulfilled his story, and he was careful to take his time while doing this (it may seem annoying at some point, but it seems to be a work because he emphasizes a little more emphasis on the character / environment weight on the plot). <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the four main players: Alain Dillon Corey (just getting released from prison, planning a new hest), Zion Maria Vault as Vientel (fleeing from the hand of the hand-held custody), fate By completing the Kori), Yeans Montand Jansen (elderly person with arms, with many years of experience, friends of Vogel), and on Myaterira re baribhila like (an experienced investigator, who was in search of Vogel and on her toes with internal issues). Each of these actors is part with their precision, isolation, and each of them indicates the viewers who have their own moments that their personality might be in addition to criminals and police. The sequence of the Haystel gives little hint, for example, when a woman passes a whomever closes the statue of Vogel, or how does Jansen take out a flask and only has a quarrel with the content (and what is the dream of this man? Even the enthusiasm of interest in even a woman's involvement in Corey's movement involving a photograph. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to absorption and calming, and with skill it has to be done efficiently (cinematographer Henry Deke, Editing, and Archie Demerson's musical scores), the charm that the screen people have, their nature and How to be the ideal of ideals French is not a movie missed by new wave enthusiasts, and modern day crime films may take up to 140 minutes to consume melville's atmosphere. A civilized piece of film making that still regarded as one of my favorite all time.
