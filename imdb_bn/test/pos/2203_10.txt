Although video technology may be the date, this classic musical game in DVD is now the best version of Sanday's most important and polished work on Broadway. If you never see the swine sticks, then you will buy this DVD. I saw this production at Kennedy Center in Washington in November 1980 - and "Marder She Writes" Angela Lansbury has fallen in love with the former. Then, I tried to find out any and all of their works: Movie: "Harvey Girls," "Pictures of Darien Gray," "Manchurian Candidate"; CD: "Mom," "Dear World," and "Gypsy"; And many more The rest of the cast, is shameless. All in all, this wonderful DVD gives us the definite version of Sondheim's Opera!
