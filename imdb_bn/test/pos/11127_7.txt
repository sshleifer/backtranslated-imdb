It is not difficult to find if you are superb, beautiful cast and a story which is not difficult to understand with a movie; FAME for you <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that I like; Some smile at you, others make you thinkful. I think the edit is amazing, really fast and often fun. The Shari'a, maybe there is more possibilities in the whole thing, all the stories are on the surface; Maybe a little more involved in characters. But I do not care, because the real stars ... <br /> ... Musical scenes! My favorite one: hot-lunch-jam order. The piece is very raw, fanquai and portrayed in a special way (handcuff-style "music-hell-breaking-loose"), it's just electrifying! In today's music-clips, I miss this raw power; Probably the same power that I probably found in Metallers "Roses", all the footage of the concert. It is assumed to be "wild" which is happening to something "real" and it is not perfect; Have to take. So, FAME is a great nostalgia-trip where synthesizers where heavy and walking values ​​are not available. I recommend it once a year; Not sure for everyone.
