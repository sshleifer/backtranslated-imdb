This is a film about passion. The emotions it appears are mainly misdirected even for leading people. But this film has incredible power: it shows us that we believe that can be contaminated by ambiguity and can lead us or others to do destructive things. Moreover, those who try to get rid of emotions (see studio inspection doctors) also make self-destruct at risk. <br /> <br /> The message from this world around the world will be heard often
