True car love True love Love like crazy Beautiful love Ugly love. Dirty love Sad love Happiness love Foolish love Smart love Gorgeous love Foolish love. Love love love Mini Moore realizes that a man who depends on what he really needs, believe in him and make him crazy. Of course, when this guy comes, he tries to escape, but Cummer, a stupid fool, he believes in him, he trusts him so he is going to fight for him against him. I want to be like seymour moskowitz. I want to be that kind of man. Failure to fear is frightened but willing to love without fail. That's a kind of heroes. That's my hero ... and Mini Moore is my kind of woman. Long live cassavetes and all its lovely bunch!
