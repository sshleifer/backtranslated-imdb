A piece of silver thirty pieces and a kiss for fate. This one was another completely unexpected gem. Generally, I'm not even a mystery / thriller fan. This satisfied 100 minutes have more twists than a boardwalk prot zel. It has a heady romantic romance, memorable of "body heat" in multiple ways; It's police and crime; Political conspiracies and soap only a dash of the day. It has only touched the right to serious violence that any professional "according to the number" crime must be used in the work. Emma Thompson, (FBI AIIC), played her role with grace and humor and got my vote for the best fake South Act by Limyay. Alan Rikman, (local police), who always believes in stealing shows, is not nice but respectful. They work as well as a pair. Many plots are wrong guides which never leave the control and re-connect the spontaneously at the end of the movie. And who is this awesome woman, Carlo Gagino? I want him to bear my children. Karla, if you're there, then have lunch
