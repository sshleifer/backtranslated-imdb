I must admit that I had low expectations in this movie. But I was surprised to see it, interesting and funny. This is not an entertainment thriller and such a horror film. It was a moment that my hair was standing! Even better, there were very funny, occasionally violent, ridiculous moments in the movie (you know I'm talking about). There are some great special effects (and humor and special effects are not different). <br /> <br /> Acting, complete, very well - generally a horror film better than a budget. Many of the lead (Jackie), in particular, and small, supporting roles (lawyers, couples living next to couple, pizza people) have performed well. If not, the film did not interest me and I lost my faith in the story. This is a good, attractive low budget thriller and definitely a rental price!
