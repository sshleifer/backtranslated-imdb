I have the opportunity to capture this independent movie and the plot was affected by it despite the lack of tension. Acting was very good by everyone involved. Amy Madinon is a convicted stakeholder, who is tired, still well-established and determined to create the condition of her little girl. Yet, in this process, she ignored her older sister, who is keen to play with her sibling-syndrome brothers and live in the world of fleeing. <br /> <br /> The men of the film are very strong in their secondary role. Christopher Lloyd plays a very different role, why does he show us these versatility. He is a teacher dedicated to his career and literature research, yet hungry for a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan have made a very good connection to their scene together, but neither they know anything from their friendship. Their vague departure is not bright, but an acting lesson for aspiring actors. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, it's fun to see Fred Savage. <br /> <br /> You can say why it was based on a game of movies, it is probably very good at the stage. On the screen, it is not particularly exciting, but it is very thoughtful and powerful in its important issues.
