Many comments made by others have been very informative and I joined the call for the release of 1959 film and the release of the base. <br /> <br /> At my early age I've joined a record club and this album was one of the free ones I selected for joining. I knew I was dubbed some voice, but only Robert McFerrin was acknowledged on the album. Recently my daughter bought a CD from Austria, I think. Quality is excellent, so why do I know that it was found in Europe by CBS Records, Inc., when there was no fate in the local store. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have never seen the film but have pleaded with the local video stores to get it for years. Now I know why it was not found. <br /> <br /> I add my voice to others who consult with the heirs of property and rights and they agree to release it, but they think that it is incomplete - the beauty of music and stories has reached many of us who otherwise experience Will not profit. <br /> <br /> Trudy
