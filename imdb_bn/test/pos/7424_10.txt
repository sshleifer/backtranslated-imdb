I enjoyed "Happy Ever Of Ever", but was absolutely hypnotized by "Terry and June". When Annie Lucy moved, the emphasis on the relationship between middle-class English couple between Terry and June, aloud louder loudly aloud aloud loudly aloud <br /> <br /> There were alternate comedy era in the 1980s, but they were favorite decades - and Terry and June certainly would be useful for more traditional taste. And me - and I was a huge fan of "The Young Ones"! Each week, Terry got into a stupid situation and pulled himself into June and usually ended up getting bail on him. It seems like the start date - it was a different world, but the fun of watching the trend of the 1980s, such as the 1982 CD Radio Story (in which the CB radio was legal in England in November 1982), which was followed by Terry in prison. His car! I have been watching the DVD show recently, and I still think they are awesome! Liked by the elite elites - shiny classes, but a huge hit with the public! Excellent!
