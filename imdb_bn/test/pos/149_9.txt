Chan-Uk Park, you have to hand it over to the man. In my eyes, he is not just a bright director, but a bright director who can turn his hands in any way and often refreshes a little, but still be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Thirsty story is really a vampire story Fast and loose plays with some of that subgenre's "rules". Kang-hai played Father Sang-Haiyan, who unselfishly donated himself to a research program and then unselfishly cured the disease that he was trying to treat, died, and returned. All thanks to the blood he was transfused with. One of the five hundred to survive is one, he recognizes him and becomes a celebrity and he needs to become normal. Normal, however, now it can become very hot under the collar to jump on a great distance, without blood, and to get the sun rays to reach its skin. As long as he lived with a difficult family unit in his childhood, and while hiding his new strange life style, he grabbed his complex complex triangle and took further dark thoughts and gave a slogan under a mere shield. He can lead man to the animal near the animal. <br /> <br /> In a series of interestingly, the film in the park is more intuitive and more real to me (to use the example on the right), and in reality our approach with which our approach influenced me is easily realized and old since We've seen it for many years that other vampire movies can be restored as well. It is awful, melodrama and comedy mix, strength of faith, power over life and death, thoughts like immortality wolf, etc. <br /> <br /> Some people complain that this trend-bleaching system weakens the film but I personally It has been seen that it was a lively, entertaining and always enjoyable movie, a beautiful center as a repressive pastor Excellent changes from Cast, supporting with the help of performance and any weak links. Many characters move through the range of emotions and become the love and the nuances of the pastor, especially the young girl (played by Ok-Win Kim) who love the pastor. The fans of "The Tale-Tall Heart" (watch and learn) fans of Asian movies (and especially the park) and Poe should blow it out, this is an exciting movie that can take everything from a person and is always hard to entertain Manages to do less than that. <br /> <br /> If you want: Kornis, AKA Cemetery Man in Delmitte Delmo, near Dark.
