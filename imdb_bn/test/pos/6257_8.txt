* Small Spolar * <br /> <br /> The house is not scary, but it is unclear. It's an interesting 'little' story with well-played and wonderful special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> The basic plot: The little girl blames strange things in her family's new home and plays with her friends in the playhouse. <br /> <br /> The film does not waste time running, though the end may be more involved. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to the expected / humiliated Horns, but I want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller who recommends it.
