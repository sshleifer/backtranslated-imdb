I think skateboarding was a rebirth in the 70's. I begged my parents mother for a second hand skateboard from a friend to the money. It was complete with a piece of junk, earth wheels and everything. I remember reading Skunkboard Magazine and the Dogtown crew are both fully influenced and completely scared. Skating did not become a way of life for me, but in some ways it was a part of my life, whether using a transport board or using a bunch of friends at school. <br /> <br /> This photo is a brilliant documentary about the real birth of modern day skating. Seeing this crucible, it was in vertical lifestyles by turning the skating from flat boring hobby, it slacked me for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is astonishing that enough footage of this era still exists for this movie, and thank God for it. The footage is bright. This gave me a sense of watching an old booster keton movie: Then I saw a few tricks, since Keaton has seen countless times in many movies, but when you go back and watch the first person to run that technique, Surprisingly, they were not the first to use it successfully, but they lived through it Bong thinks it is common. This picture gave me the feeling. Yes, I saw a man before school at the pool, but discovering first-person skating pools and finally discovering the techniques of modern skating, such as facing a Keaton's room, a window standing safely in the frame. This is a surveillance that can be seen very bright, until it has never been tried before, but since almost everyone has tried. <br /> <br /> This image is beautiful and incredible to look at. Soundtrack I've never heard of one of the best movies. This is a film that will appeal to people that they do not like skating or not. I talked to some of my friends who were sitting with this movie after a huge protest of their neighbors, and they all said that their lovers have become sweet after the end of the movie and they liked what they did. <br /> <br /> For the previous comment on this board that complained about the film very congratulating, I think it is an unfair discrimination. I saw these guys get excited about their past. They created something that affected their sport and it changed forever. They have right to stomach behind them. What they like to do is they are they. Most of these boys / girls do not achieve lifetime achievement, Tony Huq enjoys today, but such success has not been found on skaters. Of course, they had some success, but more importantly, they were able to live as they love, and we finally see, surfing, skate or doing work on almost all surf / scale. Art. How many of us can say that we have saved our life and broke all the rules and succeeded in what we love to do? They could My hat stopped Dougathon and Z-Boys for themselves and for the change of Scatterboard forever to the world.
