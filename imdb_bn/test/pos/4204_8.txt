I'm not expecting a big deal from this movie, so when I saw it and it seems to be most significant I was glad. Due to its significantity, due to its appeal, John Garfield's appeal and appeal to his star, <br /> <br /> <br /> A boxing star named Garfield Jack, who is ready for the assassination, He will go on the run, and end up in the stick with Gloria Dickson and Dead and Kids. Here is the opportunity to get rid of, will the past be caught with him? Garfield was ahead of his colleagues in the actor. Even before the word 'method' the brand never shouted 'Stella!' He brings 'natural' on screen. His soil quality and amazing acting talent dominated this production. Also interesting is his role as a boxer that shadow the role of 'Golden Boy' he so strictly wanted greed on screen. The garfield type looks and goes as distance as a boxer, proof of its acting value. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of Anne Sheridan, a small role here as Jack's trampy girl Goldie. I've never thought a lot of Sheridan, but I like her here. He plays Garfield well. Dickson's performance is a little tired and he does not share good chemistry with Garfield. Dead and Kids are here, and Garfield seems to be their natural statue (even more than Cagney's). Cloud rain is corrupt, and he shows a role in many scenes uncomfortable. Curious, he was always such a reliable actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He complimentally maintains a wonderful atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A very good film that gets more attention 8/10
