I played well because it only gave it a seven. And of course that means I'm Wilkins. The other two princes were "decent". But the characters themselves ... What was so bad about the world that the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I did not see him like Martinez Emily Watson. On the other hand, there was a disgraceful quarrel at the Bill Bill which I was praying to meet the most cruel and lasting death. Who am i kidding Tom Wilkins is not all after Paul Bettany. So Emily Watson's (Anne) character saw him on the earth ???? He acknowledged himself that he was mostly in his treatment. Why would he want to stay in the same town like him, to say something of the same "room" <br /> <br /> I saw some other reviews, one person said, "crying till the end" James 'Tragedy. ??? What a tragedy? What, do you find someone like amusing those bill bullets which mean losing an imbecile ??? !!! Give us a break
