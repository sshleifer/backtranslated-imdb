But this is also mini and stomach! Yes, it does not look like a lot of Captain's stomach, but it is! Mickey and Mini are the best characters, both of them very sweet and customizable. Interestingly, Moni is more than a woman and less than today than Mika. Pitt is still the same old average, but he looks a little different. <br /> <br /> On this famous mountain, a little steamboat, Mickey, minis and some sided letters are lots of fun and annoying. Even in their first appearance, three main characters are very advanced. <br /> <br /> I like this episode, although overall I like Mickey Mouse in future. I like animations, steamboat and music themes, cute gags - and of course, Mickey and Mini! <br /> <br /> Like many primitive cartoons, it was very random, Walt came with a very basic plot and it was added along with "gear". A parrot side is also very annoying and rather unnecessary. This thing I do not like about it. Another interesting part of this episode is that a color version has not been created (or if I have never heard of it)! <br /> <br /> Anyone who enjoys Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy it.
