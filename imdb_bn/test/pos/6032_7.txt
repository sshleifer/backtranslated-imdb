Attaching self-admissions slasers means that it is very rare that I get the chance to review a big budget movie with credible cast. Draw the Identity as well as the successful box office of James Mangold; Scrum Trilogy again did not enter a big name by putting the name of Wes Krave on the Hollywood map. Mark Malone's The Last Stop Why? A mystery thriller with blatant slasher overtones, immediately plot me to With a decent lineup with an interesting soundtrack to find space for Adam Beach and Jurgen Prokovo and Rose Anderson's Garden, I must admit that the initial symptoms were very positive for this clustrophobic character. The best of my knowledge is only three snow-bound slashes, unless you can fit the daemon in the division. The first part of the ice and the dry bone was the blade of the drunken devil, then the Lisa-ironing cheese-festoon which followed the glowing and joyous Shridari fourteen years later. <br /> <br /> An extreme time frost, the state warrior Jason (Adam Beach) wanders through the snow to reach a remote building in the Colorado Mountains. His job is to inform the guest that the road is closed and they must have more than one night till the road is cleared through dangerous situations. This news can not work well with suspicious clusters, of which there are two cousins ​​(Calm Keith Renny and Peter Fleming), a truck driver who does not really want to wander around (William S Taylor), a painful couple lovers (Winston Reckert and Emmy Adamsson ) And Jason's ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). Motor owners (Jurgen Prokov and P. Lynn Johnson) are not very happy to see the news, but they provide rooms for the unstable guest and try to calm the situation. Take a turn for things bad when Jason finds a bag full of cash to steal a blast body and lie in the snow behind the cafe. Like a chapter in the mystery of Agaga Christie, people start to die in the hands of a masked attacker who thinks they want to claim money. With so much scary characters to choose a way to get out of the criminal scene, try to stop Jasson again before killing him? <br /> <br /> A good mystery needs at least some of the incognito suspects, everyone has a credible purpose, no one can escape from a remote location and help a lovely hero to keep the signals open. Fortunately, The Last Stop provides every essential element of a thriller that provides equal images of its image and low stupidity. The film closes nicely because the suspect's personality can cause clash of clustrophobic environments that cause tensions in runtime. Each character expresses its characters to attract something suspicious and enhances the emergence of the merry who can not easily guess Malaysia's requirements. Actually, I've seen the movie again to show myself again, if I miss the first time I get up on any indication. Unfortunately, when crazy peak seikoya perceives that a comic book advertises like bad people, The Last Stop loses immense credibility. Thankfully, all the unexpected and brightly arranged plot twists are not lost at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Two plots can be matched with an excellent detection that is almost invariable. James Mangald's efforts will be mainly due to John Cusack's star billing and the best ever reliable Ray Liverter. Meanwhile Adam Adam did a great deal of leadership, although Jurgen Prokov, Amy Adamson and Bright Column Keith Renny provided some credible support. Rose McGowan works proudly in this role as he can every day, and Winston Reckart completely starts well before the final episode of the film is fully excited. If you see it for some deadly killers, you'll be disappointed. Balaklava-wearing cyclops only pop up once and others are off-screen. But as I said earlier, Malone's guided talent means that this mystery is not too far from boiling and you can forgive some mistakes because the positive aspects only win. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes there is a boxer in the negative, but overall this emerging Hollywood genius is a difficult example. If you like identity, then try it out?
