This movie is a love story set in the background of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my DVD asp and it has seen it many times. After the story was over, I was happy that he came back and I was proud to become a doctor and fulfill his father's dream. He honored his father, boyfriend-husband, and his boyfriend. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have a happy ending. Along with the story of love, I thought how a beautiful, calm and peaceful island was affected by the war, and it has come to me that people of real destruction can live on their people ... the government decides, but people suffer. Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for her daughter when she had a regular dream. I saw a scene where he was complaining about not getting dowry and I liked the scene where both lived through an earthquake. They were alive.
