Wonderful, malicious, funny and completely compelling, the film contains a little familiar reality: a student who is studying in the Erasmus program. The start is great, as the story stops, of course it has some lows in the middle and the story sometimes moves away from the main character, but the audience will not be disturbed - the film is young, fresh and light-hearted, although I do not agree with the concept that when you Erasmus and you will not return to the universe when you come back. But that's just me. The movie is deep, and very light at the same time. Cool and recommendable.
