Perhaps these viewers are frustrated by the fact that many people who think deeply about life can save their lives. I want to hint here that "remote" is not an art-house film, but one of the best art-house movies. I have seen that from all art-house movies, "remote" really stands as a shining piece of gold. It is not saying that cinematography and human emotions in this film exceeded Turkey's Nostalgia. A commentator thinks that this is right, there is a lack of sex in foreign films, a diverse, general feature, surprisingly "remote" and lacking in well. The most remarkable thing about "the remote" is that it is the descriptions of our lives which we usually ignore and capture rich extract of our existence, which are often burned according to the perspective of our commercial world and visible extraordinary. Fortunately, there is nothing extra to the "remote" viewers, and what we see on the screen is a sign of human beings.
