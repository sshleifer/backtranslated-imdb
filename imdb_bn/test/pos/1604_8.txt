Spoilers are included <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the movie of Thomas Mann's Lucino Viccanti is visually spectacular, if not philosophically, it is loyal to its source (Brighton Opera offers a more reliable reading of the Apollonian / Dionysian struggle which consolidates the well-known author). This is one of the most beautiful movies to be made. <br /> <br /> In the Wisconsin edition, more emphasis is placed on the physical aspects of the story. Venice is not looking more beautiful and alluring, more decadent and effete. If you read the novel, it is like coming back to life in the descriptions of pages. Dirk Bogarde gives an outstanding performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very little dialogue, he expresses his heartfelt desire to be bitter, passionate, and finally, through facial expressions. Bjorn Andresen, the young actress, Tadizio, cast the beautiful object of Aschench's wish. He plays part with very facial expression and gesture. Tadzio is the story's main protagonist, so this role will be worthy of any actor's motivation and desire for inspiration in the role. Visconti, with his incredible eyes for beauty, knew what he was doing. And based on Gustav Mahler, a writer changes Asenbach, and then uses Maheller's music, especially Adagio from the 5th Symphony, another bright stroke. Although I used to read Manna's story before the film, Mahela's song and the death of Venice will always be associated with my mind. Hunting images displayed throughout the picture, especially after the death of Asenbak's beach on the beach, will move slowly in the Taziji Sea. <br /> <br /> One day the visual splendors to be released in the DVD wide screen format will be completely restored to us.
