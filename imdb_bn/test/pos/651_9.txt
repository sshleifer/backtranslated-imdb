When I was young, I used to watch this movie again. I love it Although I have not seen it recently, I'm sure today will enjoy the same. This is a very light-hearted movie that is sure to laugh at anyone. The situation with each letter was so funny and fantastic! I especially liked the girl traveling with her mud ash (who ended up taking them off the highway after the explosion), robbery and noon. A lot of these nice humorous styles are missed this day. Also, this film proves that actor Paul Cinan (dynasty / day of our lifetime) was closed at a great start. I recommend it to someone lucky enough to have them in their local video store.
