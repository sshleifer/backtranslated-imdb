It's not a great movie that helps cast especially (especially kids) to carry along this extremely tragic and enduring plot, which is filled with a clean clich√©. In the mid-50s, the decision to make a poor family, mother drunk, alcoholic father, 10 children (including 1 epilepsy) and a terrible decision. It is very easy to see and the performance of some children continues without getting sick or gain. And a little Frank and Warren steal the show for me and steal me with the last scene until I see it. A great rainy afternoon movie all I recommend. Only those with heart hardness may fail to move by it. Sophie Choice is equivalent to a par, but a good TV movie !!!
