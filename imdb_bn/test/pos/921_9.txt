This is a series continuation with Juliet Bounch in the same wonderful film Blueue as an excellent star. Besides, he has a Camo appearance here in Rouge, at the very end, for one another. But this picture is really sad, although very red and very sweet, a real winner. Sometimes the main heroine starring the great Irene Jakob, is a successful picture / fashion model. He took his dark friend Mike, a dark, active life by his terrifying relationship with England. Through some lucky opportunities, he is friendly with the elderly judge, who spends his neighbor listening to personal telephone conversations. The story begins to play more and we see him in court, often publicly condemned for his entertainment. He is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his intelligent dog's rita and his dog, and around them who surround them. We have been witness to a young lawyer and his lady happy couples break, and their quarrel has also been revealed by the telephone scandal ... but the film is not about this either. It is mostly about loneliness and deep rifts between people around and around. When he went to England in a boat, as a fellow passenger with the lawyer, as well as before mentioned that the actress played down, the ship sank and we saw the judge's scary face when he tried to guess if he survived the guess. She, and still we feel very heavy in the heart. Mr Kislowski managed to paint a grand, delicate story about the unity, misunderstanding, confidentiality and pain. Deep, dark personal pain is lost and lonely. Bright film
