From the late 70's to the end of the 80's, I was a bright chipmun fan. When this movie comes out it will be seen. And after seeing it, I went right over and bought it! The film is fantastic, I brought it to the animated action and the music is great (yes, I bought the soundtrack in the CD ...) Everyone is a recommended video to watch and enjoy!
