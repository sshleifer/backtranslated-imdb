I think that there is a lot of promise from Rupert Greene's role through which everyone recognizes him. Although I never heard of this movie before, when it only appeared on TV listings, I switched to the channel immediately. I'm so happy that I did! <br /> <br /> I have read from other critics that they are not usually about age stories; I'm quite quite the other side I'm always one of those who are coming! I was 12 years old, now 52 years old, and probably I will continue for 92 years. When the age comes, there is a sudden realization of the possibility that any other day will come. The suddenness of perception, its perimeter, sometimes thrown into our disarray. If we try to shelter our superb service from us, then yes, I can see how the age is coming to an end. But if we only make ourselves dust, and remain firm in the new direction we have invented, but we are suddenly in new ways, and we were just alive as we were alive, only strong, bright and I daresay, more interesting <br /> <br /> So what was this movie? This age was coming round all the way to the street; The young Ben, his father, Father Robert, and of course the Dame Evey ... all turned into astonishing. Actually Mr. Finkam, do not you? Everyone, I suspect, in spite of the fact, despite his extraordinary scope, the film provides the last events. One is left with the feeling that the way he is walking will run exactly the same way, with only a different supporting cast. <br /> <br /> So a nice movie that could not possibly be made in America, which is undoubtedly depressing to think, but thanks to God is the constant supply of elsewhere that we can see. I really sincerely recommend this movie, unless you think it's functioning through its parts which are very familiar to all of us, and green through the rest of it.
