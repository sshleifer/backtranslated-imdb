Somewhere the main attraction here is the fantastic performance of Natalie Portman. He gave a lot of much appreciated mental depth to his rather grateful character. Susan Sarandan, a fine actress, suitable for mother pictures. I thought chemistry was believable in the two stars, a chemistry that could be better with more involved scripts. I'm not saying that the script is bad by any means, I mean it seems to be occasionally unused. I do not think it was Script writer's fault. The film suffers from being prolonged, and is sometimes focused in a long view. With beautiful appearance of pictures, some good aspects and excellent performances. All in all, watchable course, but probably more for an older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar.
