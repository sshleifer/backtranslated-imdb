This movie was so cool! I saw some of my friends on Friday night. During the first credit rolling, we found that Liongate Films made this film. They made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was completely gay! We saw this, we cry. We thought it would be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The film was not only good than Wolf Creek (which is not really hard), it is one of the greatest horror films ever seen in a long time! They really released themselves with this movie. It was superb, smart, and scary, which is a horror horror film combination. Kahn is good as Jacob's good night, and Christina Biddle, Samantha Nobel and Luke Pagla did a great job as part of a group of criminals to clean the old total. There was some visible scenario in it and you actually felt sorry for some people of death. After all, a great horror movie is seen on Friday or Saturday night with friends and friends. Do not just see it in a hotel.
