Like most other critics I really enjoyed this TV miniser. While recording it in 1989, my grandfather - a big fan of mystery and war movies, I did not see it. I think it was shown in my grandfather's cabin at night, and I was completely a story! It has a very playful plot and drama, romance, and a good mix of spy. I have seen many movies set during the WWII time, but there is no one with such a twist! Fortunately, I was able to make VHS copy of the film several years ago. I have seen it several times since then and I still enjoy it. I want to get rid of this movie from DVD. It would be much easier to see with the section.
