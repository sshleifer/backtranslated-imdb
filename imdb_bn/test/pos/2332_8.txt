Starred: Chess Grammar, Rob Schender, Lorraine Holly, Rip Torne, is a classic family favorite. That's at least for most members of my family One of us mentions this movie rolling our eyes and thinks, "what a stupid movie." I'm not that person though. I still find this movie extremely funny. Last night I did not see it again that nobody saw it, and for the first time I laughed at this. It's still very interesting to me. <br /> <br /> A black sheep navy Captain Tom Dodge (grammar) in the navy. He is a man who plays golf in a sub-way, while leaving a ball in a golf course he crosses it. He is a man who will get drunk, pass and hang up with hangover and tattoo his dog. He is not a person who wants to manage a sub-command. <br /> <br /> But at the end of the dodge line. He applied for the command of his sub-continent, and he does not get any sub-titles at this time, but he leads a desk job, that is, it is for the Navy. Admiral decided to give him his own boat, but they did not give him a new nuclear substitute. They give him an ancient ruins of World War II, a diesel sub. His mission was to clean him and take him out of the Atlantic for the war wars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Discuss with it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war. Some countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya are still selling Delile Sabes to the real world. What would happen if Winlono asked if some of the diesel sub-captains came to the states and tried to run a nuclear operation in a base. Will they do it Most of Dodge and Admiralty do not think so, but Winslow definitely want to know, so why did he create this fight game? Dodge's mission is to go beyond the stinging sea, then try to avoid the United States nuclear navy and blow up the American navy. In the final battle, of course. <br /> <br /> So, the deeper the plot is, the deeper it is. This is not a plot-driven movie. This is a stupid movie that is just a big cheat. It makes fun of yourself and you are not expected to take it seriously. If you are looking for a good smile on Friday night, I would like to ask you to check it out. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is 3 out of 4 (see a look)
