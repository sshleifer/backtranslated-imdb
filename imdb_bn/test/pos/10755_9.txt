Harold Lloyd is often neglected about being an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keton, Lloyd did not have backgrounds / music backgrounds and he was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to work; And he discovered he had a knee for fun acting - the first feature, then in the shorts. He has made a name for himself "Lonsome Lucas", Chaplin Fake; Lloyd found his strength in "the character of glasses" which made him all American boys instead of miracles, and his movies became the best produced in a silent era. <br /> <br /> She had achieved a reputation in some shorts, a "daredevil", and maintained it in some of her best movies ("End of protection", "For Heaven's Sake", "Girl Lamy"). He was more popular than Chaplin or Keaton in the mid-twentieth century, and he became very rich before the word emerged. <br /> <br /> The first sound movies are often mischief. To get the most from their "sound", many movies were used in much more conversation. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's performance skills were made for silence two decades later. She was not a bad voice; Its high pitch fit its "glasses" character. And the film's legendary disqualification was not the disaster in its sound film. Nonetheless, silent films were raised in higher industries (especially Lloyds, which did not work in the budget and were well-formed); Movies had to learn to walk again with the presentation of Tokyo and they took some wrong steps. <br /> <br /> Although he tried to take the time and hugged the word, Lloyd's best bit of his initial (extra-talk) conversation was still visual - such as "Movie Crazy" where he wanders in a gold car It seems, but actually "hit a journey" on his bicycle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She was wrong, as in her "Fit first". ("Security Last", his best film and one, Lloyd was removed in the box as "Derdevil Comic", he climbed a determined young man. "The end of protection" was a natural structure standing next to the structure based on his character He was clearly frightened, but his fear was linked to laughter. "Fit first", he accidentally built an uncertain building- Reached scaling position; from his humorous tone of help to humor. His character was the desire to save his throat - the correct statement of possible 1930s, but not ridiculous). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd has not been disturbed like the past; He embraced the sound and tried to change his film, moving in different directions, growing and changing with the industry. When "Fit First" fails, he leaves the brave business and taunts the conversation industry, "Movie Crazy". Before embossing his place in the history of the film with glasses, he had to move through many films as "Lonsome Luk", as he tried to give direction to the sound film before using the word "The Catspo". <br /> <br /> She is a missionary son born in China, "The Katsup", who was elected unjustly elected mayor for corrupt political interest. When he finds the truth, he decides to clean the city himself. Only in his first fifty years, Lloyd can still play an intense young man. However, "The Catspop" was another box office failure, and Lloyd created three more films, including "The Milk Way". Among his main competitors, Chaplin was still in his silent movie and Keaton was mismanaged hopelessly. "The Catspa" and "The Milk Way" Lloyd may either get a short comedy title at a young age, or think that its primary word has given the viewer the suspicion after the lungs. <br /> <br /> Although Lloyd's character has misused the film about the way to clean the city, it is appropriate for it. From the days of "shorts" Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the final episode of "The Catspop" has again achieved it in an amazing way; It seems terrible until the curiosity is released, and then comes the smile. <br /> <br /> As a product of its time, "Cato" is charming and fun. A well-written sound comedy, played well by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, the peculiar blend of drama and curiosity makes it almost like a Frank Cappra or Preston Sturges comedy.
