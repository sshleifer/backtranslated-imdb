All right, I'll confess that inward cartoons made by Lonnie Tunes are quite offensive and I understand why Warner Brothers have expelled them from their market. Today it is seen, huge-looting and very stereotyped ink is not politically correct. However, the cartoons were well-made and it is shameful that they were offered some kind of explanatory suggestions (such as a release with Leonard Maltin), recently published in DVDs with the wrong politically incorrect Donald Duck cartoons). In other words, throwing cartoons completely forget our history. Plus, Inky, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are out - especially on the Internet. <br /> <br /> This Inky cartoon is hunting us with a little hero. Initially, he was walking behind a pretty little catalyst, but then suddenly happened to the lion - a lion that was happy for his dinner. However, through all these, a strange Minhah is seen repeatedly ... and finally you'll see why this bird is so important for the story. <br /> <br /> Beautiful, beautiful and cute. I like the cartoon. Plus, I'm glad to show them to extremely harmful liberal friends that they can see their disobedient fit or heart attack. Fun loads, folks!
