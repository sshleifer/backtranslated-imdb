The first shot of Renna Warner Fasibindor during the mainstream recognition of businessmen of four seasons In a helpless career for only fifteen years, he was able to create a wonderful body work in movies and theater as actor and creative producer, actor and director. Although the film can not appeal to many audiences, the film offers many offers. The storyline is fairly straightforward. Due to mental and financial problems, a person is separated from his upper middle class family, and unable to control his lower spiral. The business of the four seasons is shot with a cruel devotion in the elegant details, and each set is very carefully designed and made. Each object set is thought to be painstakingly arranged so that emotional texture inducement. Many religious images and icons decorate the walls of various rooms and speak with Hans's insistence on the spiritual meaning or direction of his life. There was a lot of thought about how the motions and colors were played against the plays and how they worked. Several times during the filming, I froz the beauty of the shots of Beauty Beauty's wonderful frame. I flushed this film, and the print was almost flawless and someone else did the same. Fasibinder often recruits his actor in the "Anti-Natural" style. He does everything he can to stop the reaction of the actors in normal or communicative manner, and it creates a rather gross effect. However, by doing this, he has almost 'Hyper-Reality' in the story Rather than presenting Mundodram, the actor forces the viewer to face differently due to lack of militancy. Fasibindor's movie deliberately prevents connecting with viewers' letters easily. Justice and suffering You're always out there. This will be an isolated experience for many, but I found it a unique and satisfying artistic courage.
