This is one of the nine shortest animated disks, "Animatics." This is my favorite Artwork is amazing. Black and white, some fine textures perfectly capture the mood that the segment is attempting to film. The story is tight, and the final film is silent truth. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've given animate to a "7", but this particular segment is eligible for "10".
