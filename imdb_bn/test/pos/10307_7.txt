The film's subject is ruthless and very real. It happened. Some of the directors and scripts taken by the author can debate artistic freedoms. Does the film make the tick - nothing else. After the original Phulan, I saw the film for the first time, fired in New Delhi and served for many years as an elected MP in India. However, he was not the first untouchable elected to Parliament, some critics said. The so-called "untouchable" has been elected for several decades for decades in the Indian Parliament. <br /> <br /> While director Shekhar Kapoor is a hero in many India, because he has produced commercially acclaimed international films - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and "Mr. India"), a tolerant quid movie that shows Indian audience ) And --- Oscar nominated for Elizabeth, I did not give her a place as the top scorer of India's film director Dr. He failed in every division as a director, perhaps he was successful in getting some of his performances from the actors. His idea of ​​using the tune of Fateh Ali Khan's music in the early music of the film, <br /> <br />, his image is not available in golden, shiny, charm. <br /> <br /> Perhaps its single main achievement of the "Bandit Queen"'s extraordinary soundtrack. And possibly gang racking during the rape sequence. Otherwise, the film looked like western spaghetti with sexuality and violence, and the music of music decreased with them. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a better living Indian film director who creates international quality realistic movies - you do not see learning of Kapoor films; Subsequently, the later works of Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen, Girish Karnad and Muzaffar Ali's "Umrao Jahan". It is unfortunate that the directors did not have any financial support that Kapoor had to give them and their films to international audiences. For example, Sen. "Oka Ore spoken" made in Telugu, or Munshi love "Satgati" based on Satyajit Ray's "Saffat" based on the Moon's "Kafaan" is more complete, like an intelligent audience of intelligent people on the state of the untouchables. Sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence, but only advised them. Of course, Sen's nuggets did not make the title, they were crying because of Kapoor's efforts. <br /> <br /> For Kapoor's achievements, he used his limited talent and modest wealth in the art of expressing and filming in the Mumbai film industry so that the audience could see his product outside the house. I would like to greet Kapoor for that endeavor. But "Bandit Queen" is a great thing that a managed director is waiting to deal with.
