The girls in the village are a mother, who was a daughter at the age of 16. Now the daughter is 16 (1 in season) and they live like sisters. Share everything, rely on one another. <br /> <br /> I like the Gilmore Girls, but I'm not sure why. Lorlie (Lauren Graham), a mother and Rory (short for Laurelai, starring Alexis Blayle), both are very beautiful women, they are both fun and they are charming in their own way. There are some funny supporter characters such as Lock (Scott Patterson). He and Lorlie love each other, but they do not really do any work. They have their little moments. There are some other helpful characters, most of them are very funny, and they have won touching moments. <br /> <br /> What I think is that I am an adult through relationships that are becoming a little mother and daughter. The dialogue between them is fast, sharp, fun and sometimes touched. They are beautiful in the band. Gilmour's girls try you so well.
