Exsturgement film is a "pod" system about which a virtual video game is almost virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged while trying to kill the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Until it is repaired, many years spent in development and 38 million dollars will be wasted. But the only way to repair the game is to actually go to the game with the person that he can believe (Jude Law). This movie was quite good, but it was not really like it until the film was too late. The best thing about this image was the twists on the left side. The price is definitely worth seeing. 7/10
