This picture is awesome! Documentary Watching Fear? Cancel your collapse and see the little story of the data. You will not believe how you enjoy this delicate piece of film making. I want to say that it's even almost all Vietnam War Films, including the Apocalypse Now This is a real story, it's a personal story, the story of flying love, the dream of being a pilot and nightmares to shoot down from the enemy's area. Everyone is shot in the "come back" style - on the basis of the position, Harzg asked questions, theater responded to their memorable German-English pronunciation, and recalled what had happened 25 years ago. This is the part I have repeatedly told friends: After coming out of the US Navy's plane, Dieter Vietkong becomes a legend. In the dark for the greater part of the day, he is dragging the bare foot to miles and miles through the southeastern Asian jungle. Tortured, insulted, indecent, hungry and covered by infectious wounds, they reach a small, friendly village to spend the night. The next morning, after walking for a few hours in the morning, the detector discovered that someone stole his ring from his wedding ring. Yes, that's it. He can not take longer. He starts crying, as a result of complete fatigue. Vietcong people wondered about the reaction. Managed to explain what happened to the data. Immediately, the group started searching the person that stole the village and stole the ring. They find out the man, woke his fingers and returned the ring to the diatre. This movie is full of boggling and wonderful situations. Extra cultural differences between East and West conflict, unknown fears (such as America, on the one hand, standing in America, on the other, Asian jungle and its hidden mystery) can refer to the whole film. Back problem? Because you were sitting at the edge of your seat for two hours and did not notice.
