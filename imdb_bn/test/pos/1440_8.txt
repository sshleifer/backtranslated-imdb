"The Man With the Golden Arms" Classic 1950's entertainment from the opening theme crashes There is no stupidity here, Frank returns home from the prison with an ape on his back and returns to the old surroundings, where the old Scamabag is still hidden. This is a story of his dark ride with his emotional baggage intact. All of a performance is overripe a bit, but that is part of the fun of watching. Darren McGuin and Arnold Sting are unforgettable, and almost steals the show. According to me and submissive, the two best chairman of the "Manchurian Candidate" board. Do not miss one of them.
