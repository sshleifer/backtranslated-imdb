"Alice Foundation" is the greatest movie of all time ever, which nobody ever heard of! I was amazed to hear it, and although I did it all sex, no plot, and just stupid, but in fact, it was really good. They say, all indie films suck, but this one, and "Napoleonic Dynamite" did not suck. I asked my friend, before I did this, I saw it, and he said that Elise has these three ways, and you see this nudity, but not three ways that I think, and there is no small nudity. There is a point in the movie, and it taught me not to believe hitchhikers. I finally liked, they got a little dolphin in Alice, on the way to Florida. I totally recommend watching this movie.
