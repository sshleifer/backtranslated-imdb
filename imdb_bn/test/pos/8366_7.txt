Dude is an incognito hairdresser and weird young Bedjinger, who has exposed the cheap books to survive from a stall in an indoor market. He will not see anything common with the Wear, the middle age, the intellectual, the Zhang - and yet both of them roamed in a restaurant together and discussed the murder of Pro's and Con (probably the Chinese title is translated as 'talk it over' Well done). If it makes a beautiful kind of pedestrian, do not be confused: this film is very innovative in its plot and mostly with breakscreen motion (though the speed is very badly flagged in the end). <br /> <br /> You will be surprised if you only play worthy historical plays such as Red Lantern and Shanghai Trial, or its recent martial arts epic, Hero and House of Flying Daughters; In fact, you will be surprised by the other movies you have seen, surprisingly surprising - this is his most original, most playful, most experimental work far and away. It ended in a brief budget of about two weeks, almost completely on Beijing's position (and using a lot of common grounding in small support grounds - the director himself was a passing cami), and mostly hand-held camera, a junky, hyper-kinetic style One million miles away from the elegant customism of his best known movies. <br /> <br /> Well, I live in Beijing, so I enjoy all the extraordinary little details of everyday life that I am accredited and satisfied (although it was shot in 97 and things here are changing so fast) I really believe that this film can be appreciated by anyone. I saw it because I have a lot more Chinese 'comedy', a movie club that the sub-headline versions of recent Chinese movies almost exclusively show curtains for external visitors; And the audience could cry alone crying only one. Some non-Chinese audiences may be slightly weird, somewhat uncomfortable, because it includes some violence and, after the annoying opening, the romantic comedy of off, somewhat dark converts between its second half. This is very interesting, however <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See this movie - to prove that a humorous idea from China There are translations that can be translated into other cultures, for the proof that Jhang Imo is far away, much more than a single hat Tony and ...... and for a thoroughly good time.
