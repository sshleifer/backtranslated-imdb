Most Toronto is a dark, mysterious journey set on the street behind NG, which considers the viewer a young man and woman (Verne and Sarah), each of them is a past and a catastrophic event. Fine dialogue and first-rate welding make this silly move, in search of the girl, to make a silent journey to find money behind the words of her life. In his collaboration, other than enthusiastic, male friends, the two of them can reach the end of their quest, but the money is paid with it. The film does not want to answer all its mysteries, but it does a great job at several plot twists.
