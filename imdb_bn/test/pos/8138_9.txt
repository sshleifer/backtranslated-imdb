This small film is willing to focus on a subject known as socialist Sanskrit Shock. The film represents the condition of the average Roman in Romania in democratic Romania, who finds that life and problems are not different from the communist times and if you want something you have to bribe it. So, our main character is fired after a long time, he needs to get around 50 and similar jobs, but the only thing available is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> I think you have to stay in Romania so it seems that this movie may be true and tragic.
