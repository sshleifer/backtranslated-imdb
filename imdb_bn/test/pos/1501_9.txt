In the late 1940s there was a short film series titled "Flickr Flashbacks", which played quotes of silent plays such as Mary Pickford and Blance Mitt, to laugh. Scratchy clips of oldest old films were rearranged, very fast projected and an overlay of jungle music and link clips was given. The attitude expressed through this cruel behavior was mostly consistent with the Hollywood scene in the mid-century: The silent film was good for a hockey, Florida, a little embarrassing and chocolate. In the 1950's, this attitude gradually started to change for several reasons. The James Aze 1949 essay of Silent Shoes for Life Magazine was a matter, but television played an important role in the recovery of silent movies. Of course, television networks sometimes handle elements like "Flickr Flashbacks" people, but respect the higher-ton series such as "Silentes, Please". Another milestone was the compilation of Robert Yangston's feature, the golden breakthrough feature, which proved to be a surprise hit during the liberation war in the theater at the end of 1957. I do not know whether Charles Chaplin was aware of his achievements in the film or box office of Yangon, but this time he made his three best short comedies, A.DGG LIFE, Shield Arms (both made in 1918) Decided to release a theatrical re-release and PILGRIM (created in 1922 and released the following year). These three films do three good works because of the reverses in plot, theme and settings. In addition, Chaplin's stock company has three known faces, many of whom play multiple roles in each short time. During the release, the films have not been publicly revealed for more than thirty years, so Chaplin was probably concerned about maintaining his fame with new generation filmmakers, especially his best work was seen on television very rarely. Unfortunately, Chaplin apparently went very quickly to the speed of the old silent projection, so the decision was made to "print out", meaning each other frame was printed twice. Maybe he wanted to avoid the 'Flickr flashbacks' look, but it was not the best way to go about it. Although the aesthetic did not say, the results were terrible and the film flow was actually demolished, however, Chaplin's review was released in theaters in 1959, and it was a version that moved to the video and commercially made available by Playhouse Video in the 1980s. . I bought the VHS copy of the film at that time and was very disappointed with the blurring of films, stop-and-start women. <br /> <br /> It is special pleasure to restore the collection of Chaplin's Dapl Shepard (Originally produced for laser-disc format) is a huge improvement in the PlayHouse video version. In most cases, the projection speed has been fixed. "Expanded printing" has gone at any time, although the action sometimes pulls a bit. For example: Eden and Charlie's painful dancing at Green Lantern Cafe is seen in a dual life, Eden's bare arms are visually obscure; On the other hand, during the TRAND scene of the SHold ARMS, when Charlie was released from duty only, for a few moments it gradually came slowly gradually, gradually and slowly, gradually, it gradually came gradually. Finally, the quality of the films themselves are excellent considering the age of movies <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: REVUE starts with the rare behind scenes taken in Chaplin Studio. It includes a clearly-staged, jockey rehearsal session where Chaplin starred in a small actor Loyal Underwood and his dressing table, and played the role of prodigy. In this scene Chaplin's description was quickly distributed with clip. Chaplin has composed a new musical score for compilation, and in my opinion, his theme for the REVUE rank, his theme for pieces used during the sequence of cafes, especially in a Disease Life. The only song written for Pilgrim, a pseudo-singing "Cowboy number" song called "Mont Monroe" (song sounds like a genre), a song called Bound for Texas, is confusing, unknown and out of place, otherwise the rest, the music Perfect for work and environment. <br /> <br /> It seems that the image of Chaplin Revue has been published, which means long-standing suspense Asa, they are meant to be seen all along has been presented in this classic comedy. In this form, with the rank REVUE Chaplin is the most durable and usable functions.
