H.O.T.S. It once proved that the film industry is "f-off" in sensors and they create movies anyway! In today's world, this movie will be "Top" and "Extremely", it's a velvet place anywhere behind the screen. Although, BestBuy had several copies on their $ 5.99 rack (if someone wanted to get a copy)! The film was brilliant in its own way, it mixed humorously in a T & A movie loaded by Playboy players! Contrary to most skin flicks, it was a plot. Anyway, why do you get HIV Do not want to see it <br /> <br /> HOTS A college movie that reminds me of the revenge of Nader's film, it takes a "average population" team and keeps them against their elite prepaid, which most people can not stand! The only difference is that "the natives" got a better shot in this movie! I have noticed that there are some people who will lose this movie and I do not know! Obviously it is not intended to break the barrier to Oscar winning or film. If you are looking for that, then critics go watch watch for you ever! You must realize this fact that this movie was a fun plot, honest acting (mostly described), and many girls are getting naked! H.O.T.S. You have one of those movies which stop your mind from modern day problems and daily pressures, and instead, have a smile and a good time! If you are looking for a funny college-based movie that has enough skin to straighten a pink Miata, then you really need H.O.T.S. Should check out!
