This is the first eighty thousand original! Mall, credit card machine, food, punk hair color, soundtrack ... I love this movie. This sweet, intelligent Romeo and Juliet tin flick immediately addictive. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. He has nominated his actors like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check out the sex-and-real geniuses victory. Soundtrack for Valley girl- great If you can find a copy of the film, buy it! It's hard to print out and come.
