L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy, and it is honest, realistic, and refreshed. Not a comedy or a play, but very interesting is a part of the film about this particular group, but ordinary young men like to share an apartment for a year in Barcelona. Beautiful photo with a beautiful soundtrack. If you are older, this movie should bring a flood of good memories. If you are young, learn by this example.
