When I saw the preview of this movie, I began to think about myself, "Here's another mobile TV movie that is written about thinking and complexity of a soap opera", but when I saw it, I was surprised. Tiffani-Amber Thesan is big (and proves that she really will be given a chance) A woman who falls in love and marries a man (now and again Eric's close), but begins to lose faith when the rape begins in her community. . At first, he was blinded by his assertion that he was innocent and his love for him, but over time he was going to be suspicious of him. <br /> <br /> It seems like another set of troubles to set up melodramatic TV-movie, it's actually better than that, because the characters are well-played by thesisen and closing, and the movie script is more complicated and intelligent than you. Let it happen. These are not just letters or cardboard letters that exist only for real, three-dimensional people as well as plots, and we really care for them ourselves. And the movie is smart enough to give it an exciting, the top of the story without having to look at mobile phone views, mind clips or cheap melodrama. Instead, we will share in the internal contradictions and fears of the main character, and a realistic illustration of how they can be solved and able to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A look, so please. Its production values ​​are not at the very top (this is a TV movie, but after all), but if you can see it later, there is a wonderful story to enjoy.
