Mickey Rooney (as MI Taylor) flows along the road flowing along a young man's destructive road, where he meets 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (as Velvet Brown) - he adores the horse, but he has a sad history with animals. Mrs. Rooney's horse-sense with Mr. Taylor! He took him home, and got him boarding with his family and his family. They are very well supported by Anne Rover and Donald Crisp (as Mr. and Mrs Brown). Bourge Jenkins and Angela Lansbury Taylor's disturbed siblings. <br /> <br /> The plot of "national velvet" is impossible for a fault; For example, Taylor's journey to Taylor's journey in the "Big Race" led to a great deal of leadership (but perhaps more credible on paper). Still, the connection to the horses' letters, and the character of Miss Revi√©r is beautifully captured. The role played by Rooney and Taylor is excellent; Rooney's fading is a balance between "baby star" and Taylor's bright new "baby star", which adds depth to their characteristic character. <br /> <br /> Better instruction from Rooney and Taylor's excellent performances, photography, and editing from Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith, and Robert Karne. A feeling classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (12/14/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Ana Revir
