I have read some reviews of the movie and found the idea that it was not good in the previous Kart installment. Although my favorite still Karate Kid II, I think this fourth installment of the movie series was compatible with others and there were some important lessons to share. In contrast to previous versions, in which the student is a female teenager, who, instead of a male child, takes some different path. Maggie finds it a little more challenging, but it is grown on the occasion. The plot twists are credible and predictable. I found a little dimension to bad guys, but these vulnerabilities are present in all installments in different degrees. The camera work is impressive and timely in some beautiful scenes. Jane brain is both unstable and charming. Jane monks add some comedies and lighters to narrative flow. I liked the "Zen Bowling" scenes, which is a fierce reflection of a more serious before the gene arrow scene. The level of the movie is like a good TV series. The selected music for the background is very good, especially with the Little River band "listening to your heart". Movies are valuable to learn and learn to teach. They feel faithful to Kart's soul and take care to not glorify the part of the war. After all, I've enjoyed it.
