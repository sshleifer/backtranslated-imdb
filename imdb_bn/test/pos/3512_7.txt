I was lucky enough to watch the "Horror Classic" DVD version of this movie, it was mysteriously removed 4 films from DVD and replaced with something else. The film's picture and sound quality itself were a nightmare in that version. However, the version that deluxe more than one with DVD treatments. The special edition is mentioned in Brad Fidel's interview section on DVD. He first mentioned that he was so hurt about this picture. Music is being used at this moment of inactivity in the film, but leaving the silent activities moments, thus giving a strong feeling of horror scenes. The problem of this reconciliation carries additional film scores used to fill these deliberate spaces in the scoop. Fiedel complained and it is clear that Philaric music did not have him. The video really did a lot of work for the videodrome, like Howard Shore. I am sorry that I also have to be a major fan of the film and the two have to be involved. <br /> <br /> This film led to adding some interesting realistic elements to the general horror film. A group of friends go over a mountain heir. On the mountains they are confronted with a family with a wonderful secret. The movie moved along a great speed. Actually I have seen it, 45 minutes before the campers really make a mistake, I look at myself and am looking up. <br /> <br /> The horror classic version is filled with many spaces, there are no scores with horror scenes that this movie is intelligent and I have sometimes seen the best of most of the slash movies. Director Jeff Lieberman has created some unique horror films before this time, which makes it very different from mainstream and simultaneously mainstream. It boots a good fun film with amazing acting performance. The new Spiffed-Up DVD version is a rental price, now the classic version of the collector item is the price, now the price of the OOP find.
