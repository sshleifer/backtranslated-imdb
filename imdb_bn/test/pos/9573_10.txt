As a moderate midway between "a great wind" and "a great wind," "decorating the best", a dog show and different dogs represent different people to participate in friends. Some are weird, some crazy, and otherwise, but they're all good movies. Director Christopher is particularly interested in the guest Leslie Hernan Paper, trying to promote his dog. Eugene Levi, Parker Pc, Michael McQueen, Catherine Owara and Bob Balan have done a great job (I can not imagine that at least one Christopher is not in the guest film, anyone who did not join the dog show, this movie is their main exposure. Look.
