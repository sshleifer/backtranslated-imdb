For me, the best and most memorable movies are often the first ones I do not know. The American movie is just a perfect example of such a jewel. One evening watching TV, I saw the only and best review in the drop - thanks, I've lived permanently for practical behavior. American Movie Unforgettable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "ORCHARD", I believe) is a documentary, a very clear and charismatic Wisconsin boy, he struggles to write, fight straight and produce, struggling to produce a small, low-budget horror movie "Midwestern" Which makes In Mark we discovered a young man filled with contrast. His appearance is a classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, left-fluff strainer, heavy metal styling of '80, mullet hair etc. Etc. Mark Marx on camera, love, film and American way. As soon as the film was released, it was sadly obvious that Mark's discipline and lack of excessive water steadfastly blocked his creative efforts. The American movie is filled with a charming watch, sunny moments and vivid characters. Among them, Main Mark's loving friend Mike Shank, a soft spoken reformist stoner, who won an addiction to scratching cards, is now dependent on soda pop. I absolutely love American movie. It creates genuine sympathy between the audience and the original characters, and is happy to not feel absorbing. I would sincerely recommend it to anyone.
