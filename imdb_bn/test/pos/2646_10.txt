In 1968, Stanley Kubrick created Arthur C. Clarke's best-known work on this historical film. It was an early attempt to combine with a scientific fiction movie scientific information. His style of making movies is still fresh and intact. <br /> <br /> I have seen this image half a dozen times and there is also VHS copy of the film in my library. The CS3 class made me look for another movie with another perspective: HL and what is she thinking? <br /> <br /> I again enjoyed watching the movie and in the second phase of the movie I tried to concentrate in the HL dialogue. . In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bomman and Dr. Frank Poul is eating food in front of two TV monitors beside them and HAL's round red glass dome is in between. In the TV report, HLT was known as the new generation of supercomputers in the HL 9000 series on January 12, 2012. In the interview HL Spaceship fully responds as a humble working machine trying to complete the mission. <br /> <br /> Another scene, Dave Hanter, Dr. Kambel and Dr. Those who are sketching Cumminski are in the hibernation sleeping HLs are eager to see those sketches and raise questionable questions about the mission's mission on Thursday. Her quiet and monotone voice makes him listen more carefully to the audience. <br /> <br /> In the next few scenes, we will see how HAL has killed the astronaut one by one and took power. His awareness enables him to try to save his life. When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and does not listen to HL, the most memorable line in this step is: 'I'm sorry Dave, I'm scared that I can not do this. 'In the middle of the most important interaction between humans and machines, HL's voice can conjure both solid and dirty in the same monotone. <br /> <br /> Dave has returned to the ship, his fellow astronauts have lost, and decided to disintegrate HL's major brain cells. HL uses its final apologies for not breaking Dave. HAL urges him to stop and correct himself. These are their famous lines, when Dave is isolating one module after another: <br /> <br /> 'Dave, what do you think you are doing? <br /> <br /> Dave? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Am I really bothered about this very bad decision? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the audience: <br /> < br /> is my mind going ?? I can feel it <br /> <br /> 'Can I sing a song for you? <br /> <br /> <br /> Dave has placed the final module and HL is singing his song 'Daisy': <</ br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
