I first saw this afternoon on TV in the 80's. I think I was like 9. (Nowadays a violent horror film on regular television). However, I saw it a few years later and it seems, it's a really good, scary flash. I think why this may be the reason for the disappearance is that the **** does not follow Friday 13 seconds. But this is a film that takes the original idea and it is even better. Although it is a murderer in the wooden membrane of Friday, it is even more common with the original Texas Censo genocide. It is such that the film creates a certain atmosphere and horror, even in the light of day. And the killers feel more threatened than on Friday. There is a good amount of mystery. I have been released from DVD at the end of July and now I suggest you see it.
