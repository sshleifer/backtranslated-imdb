There is a word to say to the person holding the life force: Thank you, sir! Lifeforce joins Star Trek's big budget scientist Pump: Fanatas' closes it with Motion Pictures and T-TS with the cheapest thriller movies and some of it's real pic hangers .. And above all, this is actually a good movie! It makes me wonder if anyone supports the mainstream film, which is a car for hot cock, which produces a nude on the screen for one and a half hours. God bless you, all of you who were involved. <br /> <br /> Steve RailSacob (Helter Scatter) starred Colonel Carlson, American Commander of the International Space mission sent to investigate Halley's comet. Carlsen's crew found an exotic vessel inside the comet, and within it they found three nude people in the suspended animation - two and a hot (Mathilada May). Well, to make a long story short, they are "space vampires" ... naked "space vampires." Without the colonelblues, they trashed the crew, who decided that the hot chick was released from his Lucas display case because his brain controlled the fluids under his control and said that it was the right thing to do. Col. A shivering pod wings it back to our big blue force. Meanwhile, in another space shuttle crew, his ship found floating dead and returned three deadly survivors of Living Dead Martins to London. And when people start swimming in pork and all of them are generally started to get 'very quick to get out quickly'. <br /> <br /> The British SAS inadequate Colonel Kine (Peter Firth) with Carlson to track our naked cutie - having one hell while those guys left and right off sucking. Carlsen has discovered that Vampires have a mental link with him, which can keep an eye on him, that the ultimate goal of blowing his goal is to and the umbrella of him and his pals, which distorts people's energy. Will they succeed? Small Speaker: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. Can I say but "wow"? This damn movie really works. I can not believe that they got real British actors like Aubar Morris (a Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or some such title) that appeared in this movie. All the actors are good The direction shines well and is really on the verge of end where we see the fantastic debris of London. Special effects are no slouch. For the year 1985, the film goes fx as far as possible. All effects are fairly impressive and there's a wide range of talent to display in beautiful scenes with antioxed ronics, makeup effects, lighting ceremony, and some nice old modeling and matte paintings - very nicely done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The makers of the movie have really made sure all the bases were covered and the end result is a surprisingly funny thing that does not let you run because the proceedings look very good. Real solid entertainment here: 10 1/2 out of 10
