I highly enjoyed this program. It has been written very well, with fine-acting and cute visual aspect. <br /> <br /> This is a very authentic and honest, refreshing, rather than a definite presentation on the use of drug and television. Unacceptable - one of the best television shows of recent years, and winning all the scales for Channel 4. <br /> <br /> 9/10
