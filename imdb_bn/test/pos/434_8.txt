Like the classic Hollywood musical, the plot is just an excuse. A French music hall (with a song from Edith Peef) and the wonderful 10 plus minutes can be can be seen for interested fans. The film's dance is usually not like the canon which is usually passed. <br /> <br /> Some people can ignore the technikolar dress and bright light, but it gives you a clear view of some great costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Consider the love letter from Gene Ronor that he grew up in Paris. Certainly for a film of Gene Rannore who does not like his serious film or who does not like his Hollywood productions <br /> <br />
