As a part of the Soviet film series of local film archives, I have seen this movie many years ago (with another photo of Shepitko film wings). But Shepitko's film, as far as I can say, never made a video or DVD in the United States. Wonderful movies with a no-nonsense ideology, including great black and white photography, mesmerizing guides and actors are so deep in their roles that you give them no sense or just a performance. Although details of Russian occupation (and cooperation) over the occupation of Russian resistance are very telling, the story is timeless. Two Russian birds in Germany are retained, and interrogation examines their integrity and courage. I suspect why the DVD is not published by the Russians (here comes the rebel) is suspected that Jewish intellectuals (and not difficult Russian peasants) both favor those who oppose threats and temptations, go to his death secluded, and set a heroic example for the villagers.
