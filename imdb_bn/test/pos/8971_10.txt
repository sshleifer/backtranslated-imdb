A wonderful example of how Charlie Wilson's fight should make the film. This movie is the highest quality and is perfectly thrown. Tom Hans plays the lead and provides an exceptional performance. In addition, Tom Hans is acclaimed by the incredible acting ability of the incredible Philip Simmur Hoffman. I saw him in a role that he did not fully fit. <br /> <br /> The image is diverse, intelligent, and well written. Julia Roberts also acted in this film, but easily shadowed by the other two leads. <br /> <br /> I rated this image 10/10 and I am happy to recommend this movie to anyone interested in quality movies.
