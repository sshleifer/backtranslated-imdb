I saw this before the 'Buba Ho-Tape' at the Fantasia Film Festival of Montreal. Everything about it is hot-tipping (or completely bursting) Time Burton. I enjoyed it, yet it is highly derivative. The visual effects given to my most impressive shoes-strings budget were of the quality. The set design and props were inventive and original, though the script was definitely not.
