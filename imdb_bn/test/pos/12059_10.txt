I have not seen this fun for a long time in Fox, and the wait was worth it. There is something for the children of the ceremony that I can relate to each episode and even my father should sit and watch it. This is a ceremony that does not silence children for all ages. It's still standing but like the next level. The thing that everyone speaks is the stuff that everyone says and everyone who works. It's stuff we all think, but the presentation is a good round way. For the first time I saw the show that it was not in Fox, and after some episodes was allowed to stay in the air, from Kyle's boyfriend's choices from Hilary's lover's choices, it is good with the watch's worth.
