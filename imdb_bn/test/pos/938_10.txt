It is almost impossible for me to sit and write a sound review of three colors: Without the people except the ideas that have been discovered by Christophe Kislovsky on this fascinating triangle in the previous two entries. The more I look at them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more I can get their theme: we are more connected to each other, which we want to think of ourselves, and whatever it takes, To set. In Blue, Juliet Binh played a sad widow, whose plan to save her life without the past relationship was unexpectedly seen with her. In White, one of the cruel acts provokes improbable friendship between two people, who want to bring the criminals justice and full circle to the conflict. And now, in Red, all elements of fate and objectionable events apply themselves to a young Genevieve model meeting and to the retired judge's meeting, who have the habit of attempting in others' lives. <br /> <br /> This young girl has been nicknamed: Valentine (an enlightened Irene Jacob), who has made this point about her and laughs openly while working on the runway. He is not without some things: he has a boyfriend, invisible, who always wanted to know what he is doing, he has a brother who hurts him and he refuses the progress of his photographer. For a huge billboard. While driving, he beat the dog and returned to healthcare, but when he took him to a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trinitant), he did not want him. He said, "I do not want anything," he says coldly, and blue elements suddenly manifest themselves as this arrogant man, who lives in anonymity and clear, free-floating freedom, supervises obscure people. The male version of Juliet Binoch's character in Valentine's first release - he said that he could only express regret for his fear of going away, but an opportunity event has returned to his place, and here he has revealed who he is <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Keep it off Word of possibility Like Valentine, he won the jackpot on the shoulder of a grocery store, his life of chance and his life in August. He is a girlfriend who has telephone report providers about weather. One of them must be an old judge. She knows more about her than August, and she never met her. Like God, or Prospero, he is slowly creating a storm that will break the wall of this present state and bring the new meaning of the expression "we meet again." This parallelism between old and young judges makes Lal so beautiful and outgoing, because in reality the time is actually much more liquid than we would like to consider. There are people who we can meet in life that if we were born at the same time frame, then many things would be different. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is the woman whom she did not fulfill - the opportunity or not - and whether she knows whether she is trying to amend, so why is she at great risk to reveal her surveillance and become a social outcast. But it does not end. An old woman is walking in a big junk container in many of the three films. While Julie did not see him (and could not help him in any way), and Curl paused to the fresh ideas from his public humiliation, "someone is worse than me," Valentin is his helper. Blame it if needed, and Kisłowski even applied it here in a small character. <br /> <br /> Now, RED is much more than a story. Valentine, Old Judge, August, even Rita Dogs: This story is not a story bound to the story. An American version will destroy the ideas and opportunities to commercialize and end up even an idiot. Red is so vulnerable to a linear, defined plot that any thing can happen to any of these people, and there is no important element in the place at the right moment of the possibility of closing this story in such directions. <Br /> <br /> The theme of sexual violence is to add an idea of ​​characters that mirror each other despite the time frame or location. Among these three films, it also has an important and character defined element: In Blue, Julie's husband had a daughter's daughter and she betrayed Olivier when he became clear that he was mentally dead. In White, Dominique Brotte sees Barodot's billboard consortium when he or she has heard his or her sexual cry (which becomes an important device in Red). In the red-in-love story of the old judge, love and betrayal is rebuilt. And all this time, the image of Valentine's billboard suddenly came upon them, that Rita, dog valentine's car hit, what would happen at the same time, carries seven dogs, renewed life for the six big players of this complex triangle. Care and love Why i say six You will see movies and surprises.
