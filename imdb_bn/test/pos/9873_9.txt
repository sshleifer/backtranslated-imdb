This movie is quite good, but my favorite film of the series after the origin of the producer's cut-off producer is not good. The story of the jammy is handled differently, while death scenes are 10 times better, there are more footprints in the style staff of Michael Staffing, Jamie and his child. There is also an alternative which is better and better. Why do not they release this version, I have no damned need. If you can find this version, see it.
