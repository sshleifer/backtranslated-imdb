Pictures of blind spot are great. The film is a little too far, but the action attracts you completely. Finally all of what you can think of is credit high-point. The lead actors have the most incredible screen appearance. The story is heart-wrenching. The score of the film is nicely understated. Fully moving in its own strong way. Do not have your standard MailDramatic Cuing. Moments like Transs add poetic resonance to shocking statements and great visual writings. Hope you get a chance to see these pictures. It has entered some dark areas but you could see nothing but white light.
