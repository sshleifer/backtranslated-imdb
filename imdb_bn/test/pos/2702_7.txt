Whenever I hear the voice of Karen Carpenter, the 70's blues have an old familiar feeling. What he did was a hugely beautiful and mature voice. Cynthia Gibbs is a good thing to throw in the title role, however, I think Karen Allen has a better choice. This is a teaser movie that also performs Karen and Richard's professional career, as well as works well with Karen and her personal struggle for the disease. Recording sessions in Harper Albert Studio are done very nicely. However Karen Carpenter came out, she was very special and brought great pleasure to her fans and music lovers. Even if you are not a fan of the carpenter, it is a wonderful story that reflects a great talent that can reflect the pressure of society.
