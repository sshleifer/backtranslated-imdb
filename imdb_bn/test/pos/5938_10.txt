If you enjoy a TV series, Diagnosis Murderer, then you will like 101 of the Murray. Again in the assassination Dick Van Dike looks great. If we are lucky, it will start a TV series or at least a series of movies. <br /> <br /> This film must have played some great and notable actors. However, it does not feel like a "face" movie. This is really a story that led you to forget about their fame on the screen. <br /> <br /> I finally guess, and in the end I was very surprised to wonder it again! This must be seen for a mystery buff or Dick Van Dyke lover!
