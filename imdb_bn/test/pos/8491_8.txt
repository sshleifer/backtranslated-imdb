Jamie Fox's famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles makes a delicate job in disguise. In film credits, it shows both Charles and the character of both good and bad for his choice of both personal and professional. <br /> <br /> It's a sticky showing film which lets you feel rich in the time of the story which happened. It does not look good, it sounds good I just wish there were more music here. When it is inserted, it is fabulous but it is not enough. <br /> <br /> At least, for the purpose of review, the story was true, I was frustrated and frustrated with Charles, because the story has some memorable impressions, because I am writing this 16 months after seeing it. The main impressions are: <br /> <br /> - Ray's extraordinary talent and her resurgence and her ability to take musical instruments, such as "country" for a short time, is going on. The man puts his confidence in himself, but it does not come as arrogant about him. It was also memorable to show him his heroin addiction - with no help! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, how did the verdict easily get through this photo? And he was disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. One sad commentary was that his child was more disturbed than his wife, who was betrayed by her child, to lose her Little League Games, but her father was a member of her singing group. <br /> <br> My negative negative with the filmmakers was its blame on the problem of an early childhood, accidental death of his brother. The tragedy that worked as an adult for all mistakes of the ray, is another example of a culture that people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. Note: There is an extended version of DVD but the word that it is so badly edited that it is not viewable, so stuck with the "theater version".
