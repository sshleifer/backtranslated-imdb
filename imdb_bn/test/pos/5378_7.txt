I decided to watch this movie when I'm going to see and I'm not surprised that it's just a very well made horror movie which was the best of 1970's seratom The film is of course low budget and it is a wonderful example which creates a movie story and style cool, not special effects! Strath Martin is the best actor of all time and he has played a rare role here, and this picture came from Martin's best friend. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore Jones and Moore also helped to create this film. TV veteran Charles Betman star and "Enter Dragon" beauty Ahna Capri is her girlfriend. Kapri is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and she is very nice to see! The film does a great job of staying with the story and does not end well with a Fony feeling and I really like the way to finish the film. Great atmosphere, interesting stories and well-managed by Bernard McEveety. The top notch of Martins performance also as he did not hold back and really throws himself in the role of the dock. Good and intrinsic film!
