Why is that good? Because it is the truth of comic dark outlook. Because imagery is inventor and unlike the first, these are the real moments of fear and way. The first is Jack Nicholson's Shatik, too much Prince Music, and a weird "romance". Here, there are three instead of a villain. Not Robert Wu, and the leading lady is more than just a beautiful face. In fact, Pfeiffer attracts this film # 1. His conversion runs the theme running, teetering on sanity and madness, good and evil ends. He became really horrific. Clothing and makeup are excellent. Danny Davito's Penguin is inspired and painful, not just a nuts. His circus gang passes are an element of Comic Relief (as well as a monster duck). Max Shrek is the only character that I tossed, a fantastic businessman as Hamen Hammies. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit and a perfect mix of sound and sinic songs ("Face to Face") is one of the best songs, musicians, and film soundtracks. At least the camps of the film, claiming second and third views, like Macbro, Pander no, and an amusement park park. Bravo Team Burton and Cast!
