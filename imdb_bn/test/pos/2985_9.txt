I'm sure the United States does not know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they will not talk about what they do not know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not hypocrite like the United States. The only one where sex consent is granted among the teens is illegal United States and Islamic countries. For example, the age of consent in France is 15 14. In Brazil, it is 12 in Spain. Therefore, during the production 16-year-old teenage actors are not doing anything illegal. Nudity is not considered a big deal in almost all civilized countries. And only a fetus could consider children temptation as a teenager's love.
