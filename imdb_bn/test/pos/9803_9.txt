This movie was an impressive piece of cinema that shows the dark aspects of childhood and the small things of Tom Hank's shape. Using a very cryptic story, they were able to give you an idea that Tom Hans's character as a child really happened. And when the flying machine-like scenes never happened, it helped to deny how deny could help to tell the truth. Of all the good conscience, I am 9 out of 10, can not reduce great performance from all actors, and many may not understand the mysterious end where his father killed the father and Tom Hans has added a versatile story about a flying machine, Despite having "fly" with his brother, he still has turtles, little details, to pay a little attention. Really, a beautiful part of the movie, and every actor deserves recognition for her.
