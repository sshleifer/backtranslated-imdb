I have great memories of watching "Robin of Sherwood" on TV as a small child (but I think Michael Preeud's episodes are only seen for some reason). And recently my brother bought the newly released DVD Box in the whole series. It was awesome to see again, and it's the best of Robin Hood's film and TV series. Cast is superb, and the locations mixed with Claudad's music add this very special feeling. Personally I think Prade is the best of Robin, but Jason Connery is a great choice for the series to continue. Ray Winston, Nicholas Grace and Robert Adi have played a great role as their Will Scarlett, Nottingham Sheriff and Gisberg Guy. It is a sad fact that the fourth season has never been created, and I have heard that the writer Richard Carpenter planned to create a feature film after the series events. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) finally married Marion (Judy Trott), or maybe he could resurrect Hunter Loxley (Prade) Robin, and he might take revenge against the sheriff. As previously mentioned; If the producer of "Robin Hood: Prince of Chives" is smart, they will get a cast from "Robert of Sherwood", and made this series a series of series. Ray Winston DVD puts it in Bonnmatetry, but it would be great to see Sun Connery's "Robin and Marion" just like the old men. Who knows, maybe we'll get more of this perfect interpretation of future legends. In any case, we can now see our favorite series again!
