This is a film that is much more enjoyable than the rating of 7. In many ways, it's like the version of Dallas's Valley of 50 - Welsi's excessive overcrowdance and obscenity made some lightening for visitors in 1952. Like this next movie, both are young women who are fast track for success - though it is the publication world instead of the entertainment industry (though Broadway's desire is among the best among the best of all). <br /> <br /> Hope this movie starts, Lanz is coming to work on his first day. He has given the responsibility of Hard-A-Nels Boss, Joan Crowford, who has played his first supporting role for decades. Despite how dirty Crofford looks, Lanz does this task - it is determined not to give up. And, over time, he quickly moved from editor to editor. At the same time, two of his new roommates also tried to move the place - at one stage and by a relationship with a wealthy player. Like Dallas's Valley, all of them are up and down (mostly down), but at the end of the movie there is some hope that some of them will make it - hurt and deadly. <br /> <br /> In this picture, men mostly dry. The only person who played Stefan Boyd is Hope Lodge who neglected him for a former lover. Bhadralo character actor Brian Ehhar and others played, because they are sexist, and finally understand how Crawford has become so bitter and nasty. <br /> <br /> This picture is all - adultery, marriage, miscarriage, etc. And of course there is an artistic win. However, thanks to the excellent production standards and a juicy script, watch this one watch the fun. Just do not hope Shakespeare !!
