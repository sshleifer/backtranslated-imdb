I saw this movie in Dallas Magnolia Theater a few days ago. Punk! Everyone involved in the movie and everything has added its vulgarity. Of course, music is good. But the film itself kept the entire punky trend. Even a grandmother and school teacher (I) can appreciate the artists who are able to turn their artists into reality (well, reality, film). The film brings up a number of young filmmakers and shows "why" of their anger because of clearly and cleverly not giving green light to the end of Waldo's film. (More) The happy girl has given good humor, leaving a tragedy and leaving a tragedy (but understandable) is a wonderful vacation of anger. Love Stew, though. And make sure to see / read the credit - they're icing on the cake!
