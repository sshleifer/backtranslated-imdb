This razzo "Fatty" comedy is best remembered for Katy his young debut, which began with split with the Vaudville Act for the first time in his family, his film debut. Buster gets a significant portion of this picture and it's fairly funny enough. A very good example of a very cheerful and old fashnade slopstick created "by the Butcher", although it seems to have come in a short period of two-rail comedy when filmmakers still imagine in the one-rail section. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film Is held in a general store, and as the Butcher boy in Abackle's title. For the sake of many possibilities for the quick physical humor of the general store supplier, it shows an excuse and an awakening as 300-pounds acrobat, which shows its ineffective skeptic routines, its efficiency, efficiency and grace in its effectiveness. Raise them to a different level. A moving push is slipping a big slaughter knife to him so that it spins correctly in the right position stuck on his cutting board and I am still surprised that Arbil really thinks it every time. Along with her graduation, she also looked at her scale and wondered why her body was so much radioactive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apart from the strange and almost helpless half-smiles, his stupid attitude and physical language recognizes him as quickly as we can. Even at the end there is a flat-hat hat with trademarks - it was destroyed for the first time with the rumble. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film comes into more situation-based comedy and Arabland and in dragging infiltrate into the boarding school of girlfriend of her rival Al-St John the Groom Fatty. Most of the humor usually comes from the tranquil vision of trying to drag these two strange fellows into spiritual and mysterious ways and "get girls". Buster is very much in this section, but most of the time, standing on the Katwa, helps St. John. <br /> <br /> Interesting interest in curiosity, it is a well-received comedy which just gets duplicated and is going for it.
