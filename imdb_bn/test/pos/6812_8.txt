It was much better than this expectation, the film unknown to professionalism compared to other budgets of this type of budget. The script was good but at the slightest beginnings, the performance was wonderful from everyone, including Lorenzo, and you always expect good quality from the skydars and buys. Well done as well as the action and the action is good especially in a class of car liner and crash. These are an emergence of all other B-movie thrillers, and it does not depend on budget nudity or chase foot flow for the functionality of the script, it must be the price of the rental.
