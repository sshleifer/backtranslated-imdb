I was born in Beijing, China and went to the United States at the age of 9. Later, I went to Beijing several times and I liked it every time. Many of the things I love about Beijing are that they come to the city and entertainers. "If you have something to say, say it nicely" (which more accurately translates "You Hau Hao Hao Shuo") captures Beijing's feeling of joy and genuinely. I think you lived and understood for the most earnings from this movie of Beijing and its people, even though you can enjoy it. <br /> <br />> The story is not complicated, deliberately playful, and captivating. I will release it myself and without any comment you will not say a lot. Every description of wall paintings, decorations, streets and restaurants seems like a home. (Zhang Imo probably shoots everything "position") but more importantly, the characters - our "hero", girl, kindly but unfortunate "laptop man", and night club owners are all Beijing and beloved in their distinct ways. Their conversations really capture the essence of each character. The story, mostly conducted by the conversation and conversation (save the bright buffoon at the end) is playful and always interesting. <br /> <br />> Now I'm 21. My dad and I love this movie. We are always surprised by the power of Zhang Emo to transform the ordinary people into believable screen characters and in extraordinary circumstances in everyday life. <br /> <br /> "Keep calm" - different. extremely happy. Meaningful
