This episode makes Al Gore fun. I'm sure it pisses off a few liberals. This thing makes the South Park fun, like Simpson. If you like a politician that you like, then you may feel better to have fun and take the shot very seriously. With that being said this year's delightful and best one. Al Gorge is filming fun, Cartman's project has been terribly wrong and results will make you laughing laughing. This is basically what you want from an episode in a South Park and it's easily one of my favorites. I will not comment much on the plot because I do not want to give anything.
