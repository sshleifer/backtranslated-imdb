Love is not shown in the high priest, deep love and sadness, but the process of love and salvation is the beauty of human nature (or animal?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And Fayle's love is not infamous, but the vampire-like accountant is responsible for the death. He did not go deep into a lost paradise, but he decided to leave the man alone. Fragile, but lovely Femme Fatale! This film seems to me suffering from humans and animals, which is far away from the priests and salvation. Also i think about love Adam was not so responsible for Eve, but Adam (priest), lost in purple, strong and responsible for lifting evacuation from the world of animals. Another symphonic poem from Adam and Eve, Paradise Lost
