I write this review after the hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a big loss, and I wrote about 2001: A Space Odyssey, because I think it's a crab film, for which it will be remembered most. It is not just a picture, it does not revolutionize science fiction, but the ideas of movies can be changed. It is likely inspired by America's first art film 'George' and George Lucas and countless other writers and directors. <br /> <br /> In addition to its visual majesty, the film is the reason of so much discussion and analysis because many people have so many different interpretations. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-authors, had a vision, but we are not really found out what's going on with their mind. Of course, the skinny of the 'message' will take on future technology to humanity and we will make our way to our alertness. The end of 2001 is expected, a revival version of our rebirth in the world's star-studded flight. Many of them are meaningless, but intelligent artists can understand. <br /> <br /> Although 2001 there is no evil, dark humor. Stringjivov or Clockwork Orange, or strong, bright letters that fill their previous works like Glory or SputterCaas, I still think that he would like to remember most for it. If anything, HAL will be its most memorable character, dangerous, killer, and artificial. It was still half-decade made in Hollywood at a time when Hollywood is still slowing down the shameless musical and only waking up New Wave of French and Italian movies. Kubrick is a maverick director who created great movie for her own post, own time, and everyone else. Its lack will be felt.
