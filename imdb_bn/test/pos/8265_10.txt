I am very lucky that I have a good quality copy of VHS in DVD so I can see it again over again. Characters played so well I can not find fault with any aspect of welding. OK, so there are some differences from the book, but the old clich√© in love makes all the conquering so strongly portrayed that it makes no difference. The reality of living in rural rural areas in the first century of the 1st century is that it is in contrast to the beautiful seasons of summer, rather than the summer season, and it reflects in different letters from love of Kestor's love to the male rapist Father. A story that changed my life.
