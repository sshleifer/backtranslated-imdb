Jazz Singer is one of several films about late 1940s and Jewish experience in the United States. In addition to Crossfire (1947) and Gentlemen's Agreement (1947) which faced anti-Semitism, they were usually a musical-theater background. The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Singings Angan (1949), The Eddie Duchin Story (1951), The Eddie Canter Story (1953), The Beni Goodman Story (1956) and Margarie Morningstar (1958). The leading actors of these "Jewish" films are always played by non-Jews. For example, Larry Park starred as a non-Jew, starring Al Jolson and Gene Kelly Manger's Morningstar Neil Airman. This castle is probably done to make the Jewish theme palpable to a predominantly non-Jewish audience. Jazz Singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a religious Catholic and Peggy Lee was not a Jew, although he was a non-practicing Jew in the film. When the source of his background is saying, "I did not have sorrow since I left home" before joining the family's food at Golding. <br /> <br /> The boy left his job only after showing the work on Cantor in Korea. Whether his conflicts should be a canter, a family tradition or musical theater should be a singer. His theater choice leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> There is much more than this picture. This image was created after the Rosenberg trial, during McCarthy Vuitton and Hollywood blacklist. Therefore, in this film the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens and <br /> <br /> Americans are very impressive. The singer will play baseball rather than practice. Cantor's friends are also talking about baseball. In fact, one major league umpire among them. Sagan himself asked to visit Washington and in the year 1790. Therefore, Jews are represented as part of American society and as Pasteel. None of this photo has Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee has appeared in a number of feature films. In this picture you see him as a "lover" and "one of the historical things" amazing. Danny Thomas is quite credible and he is very good part and singing. Comedy routine may have left Yes, the picture is amazing and emotional but it is good to see. I enjoyed it very much.
