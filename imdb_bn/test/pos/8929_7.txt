"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pipp Anderson, a depressed and extremely cruel young man who lives in his unsuccessful upper / middle-class family and on the street in Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he recently received a cassette tapes and player from his grandmother's 18th birthday memorial, while serving with the British army in France, trying to help a seriously wounded comrade. Germans After listening to the pipes tape (Ian McKenne provided the voice of his grandfather), we saw scenes describing the flashback as well, along with the daily scenes of Pip's life, as well as the latest flashbacks being filled in the dark, why the pumps leave. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Homosexual and directly treated equally), and some Ibhabana new actors (especially Paul and Brendan phlyacara ayathani and Pip as his grandfather 18) from the mental and physical demands of the role-commendable effort. Alan Cummins has had a significant change as a piper who tried to help the pipe and played a small supporter in the direction of Tha Gill ("Queen As Folk"). Complicated stories - directing his DVD commentary in his own words - means to run a "brittle emotion" which pushes the pipe towards its break, and it must be done. My only criticism is that the overall effect is too much "surprising" or realistic identification for the audience, in the artificial, supportive dialogue (and the end) is very converted and expected, and some scenes need to be supervised to reduce the mild response. I recommend it, with 7 points out of 10, with extra points for a significant effort.
