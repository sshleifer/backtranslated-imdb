Normally I tried to avoid Barbie movies, but it was absolutely amazing. Kudos over the voice of graphics and characters. It's all well flowing. This wonderful story is a great spin off to others, but the price of the purchase is good! I do not have kids, but kids have found kids (with boys) and it likes additional features on DVD. I do not know why so much is rated, but for kids, especially your Barbie lovin '8 year old loves this. It is not as direct and predictable as most of the movies. This "child" film has excellent morality and shows teamwork. It's no vow, romance bit (if you can find out your old old figure) and beautiful script. Thats why I give ten!
