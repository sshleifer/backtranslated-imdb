It is one of the most successful debut films for any director, without any doubt. The film is only about 90 minutes long, but it is meant to tell everything about life and death. Not too much, and dialogue is short, but the movie flows fully and demands your attention because of the fantastic natural feeling that is running everything. Perform perfection by Lead, and even some supporter characters get a strong mental view. To this day the modern audience will lose some of the film, but that is what everyone will see. Freely and honest, it is equal to ozurous works. <br /> <br /> Drag my title, it's perfect!
