"Doctor Torture a Dcling" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I saw my share. It's a little confusing to call a giallo because it's not really a common murder mystery. This is a direct horror movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Setting is perfect: an old Italian village. Music is ridiculously perfect. The end is real and original <br /> <br /> After seeing "Do not torture a ducking" you are really surprised that the next staff of Phulchi is closed. I liked all his things, but he strayed. Maybe he thought that he had already done it ... because he hit the ball with this film. <br /> <br /> Anyone who thinks this image is the owner of the Dario Argentino Gyolo genre. Fuji beats him with this one. <br /> <br /> 10 kids have 10.
