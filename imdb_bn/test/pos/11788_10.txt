Ah yes work was a great one. Many women did not get the shape, but many teenage children did a great job. I'm not saying that the show was not suitable for the family in any way, but if you check other producers from the show producer you will find more mature themes in his works which are excellent Most of the viewers were looking at the ceremony, men and women likewise shared all the good information and a wonderful surprise. Girls were perfect, and beautiful, the show would be a classic and syndication well. The show should still be on, because it does not have much choice in when it comes to health and beauty.
