All the congregation congregation of the final film in the famous cycle of the famous classic horror story Count Dracula (an intense, DAPER JOHN CARADIN), called himself Baron Latos, Dr. Asked by Adelman (Onoslaw Stevens) to cure her suffering. Naturally, it's just a ruse. Then, coincidentally, Larry Talbot (Lone Chaney), the lawyer "The Wolf Man", looks and certainly he wants to * really cure. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the monsters get the same screen time. Frankenstein Monitor (Glen Strange) is thrown only to include universal monsters. Stock footage and library music are used here again. The film spends a little more time with Dakulla's story, though Caradine gives an impressive, egotistic performance in the role of mathematics. This photo is mainly a showcase for Stevens, who goes through the cycle of his tragic character and performs an excellent job. Women are beautiful, and I would say that I like Jane Adams as a brilliant nurse - who are un-backed. <br /> <br /> This must not be completely without involving villagers. <br /> <br /> In the competition, professionally created chiller is only for my taste, these are not really scary, but regardless for entertainment. This is a respectable series entry overall. <br /> <br /> 7/10
