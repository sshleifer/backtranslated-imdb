This is all my time as my favorite movie. It is the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever; It was a shipment of Star Wars that just made it all well. <br /> <br /> I love slapstick. Meet with Marx Bhai or Three Stuggs Star Wars. Writing is fun. The effect is a hoot. Free association that guarantees all kinds of exit from the left field. (I almost wet my pants while accosted Wookie's monster princess.) <br /> <br /> Space ball was a lot more movie, but it was about 15 minutes good material, and after I felt the robbery turned out, most of the turn turned to be admired That's like buying a burger. Despite about 15 minutes long, the hardware wars will be eligible for a feature price, IMO.
