Jennifer Egan's novel was brought to a screen by Canadian director Adam Brooks, which sounds a bad suggestion based on some comments from contributors on the forums, but in reality it is much better than credibility. <Br /> <br /> This is the story of two sisters, who love each other. Faith, strong leadership and happy-lucky Hoppy girl, under her wing, takes her younger sibling, Phoebe. Phoebe definitely loves faith; The elderly decides to follow her boyfriend Wolf in Europe on a summer holiday from Berkeley, she promises that she will send a post card every day to Phoebe. Believe that until the cards stop closing and one night, after a few hours the family gets a phone call to inform them. Faith has died in treacherous circumstances. <br /> <br /> Faab can not forget the faith. Because of that, a few years later, he decided to accept the same route took the big sister. He accepted the cards from faith and went from Amsterdam to each and every place and then went to Paris and he wanted to end the trip to Portugal, where faith was his impossible death. <br /> <br /> In Paris, hook up with Phoebe Wolf, who has not yet been a hippie and lives with her girlfriend. Wolf tried to persuade Phoebe to abandon his tour and return home; He forgot that Wolf took the key to solving the mystery, and when he was going to Portugal, he discovered that when he found a picture that clearly explained the version of Wolf, Phoebe. He was guilty and, against the will of his girlfriend, decided to take Fa'b to the city where faith died. The story changes at this moment and we go back to the flashbacks that believe in Europe and what happened on its final day. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "Invisible Circus" is the principals' performance, something that Mr Crooke has to take credit for. Cameron Diaz's horoscope is surprising, since faith can choose light comedy parts, when he is able to do good drama as the right director. Jordan Bruster is seen as an old FOB and has made remarkable contribution to the film. A stunning beauty with the looks that he seems to have a naturality for acting. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and he is able to make more serious plays. Sweet Camila Bell plays very firmly in the foam. Bleth Danner is seen as the mother of the girls. <br /> <br /> European locations have been photographed gloriously by Henry Brahman. This film has been improved with the original song musical score of Nick Layered-Close and Petra Haden. Elizabeth Kling edited with great elegance. Finally, this image looks great on Adam Brooks because he gave the correct voice to the adaptation of the novel and got the reward for doing the right thing for him.
