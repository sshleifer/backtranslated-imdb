During the phase of a big martial arts movie, it bought back a while. Although it is certainly not the best, I love to make such films, and it was a lot to entertain me. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, I always realize the fact that when he officially lacks martial arts training, he usually provides the performance of more effective fighting. She has a good beard. This movie has given him a good, heroic role, and although he did not kick in some other films such as a donkey, he himself took it very well. Charry Chung and Chau Yun Fats are very beautiful, especially Chou Yun Fat takes on his bad boy except his trademark gun. She could not be a great warrior but she's okay. Eddie Co is a bad guy as before, he has operated the same villain in many other movies and it's just as cool as normal. I do not think the name of a friend who is very good at playing wife, but he is also in a meginifishant butcher. Although not as good as other films of the war era, Postman struggles with many imagination, quality painters, and nicely playful environments for the war. There are some very nifty scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mix of Hong Kong talent coming together all the best effects. After all, I would recommend it to Kung Fu and the general Hong Kong action fans. It may not be stylized classic like Shadow Brothers films, or as a delight to be Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's rock-solid entertainment.
