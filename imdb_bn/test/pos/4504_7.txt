Which film can be dependent on the book on which it depends? Answer: Answer "yes" rather than the trial of Khaled Hossain's 2003 sale of a huge dealer's sale in 2003. Like many, I was inspired by this book, an impressive first attempt by Afghan-American writer / physician. Clearly, director Mark Foster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and screenwriter David Beniof ("troye"), who paid careful attention to the most notable story of the film's 127-minute running time story. Yet the continuous tapestry of heartbreaking events in Hussaini's novels has often been fantastic and fragmented, because Ford and Beniof are sincerely trying to make a real effort to get the full opportunity of the story in time limitations. Hassini part of the challenge How literary works are carefully used literally, then-and-now uses parallel work, which is basically a three story, a technique that can be transformed on the screen. However, filmmakers make the most important things, especially giving viewers an intimate view of a hidden culture, which was previously reported through the CNN News Report, by translating letters from the Afghan language into Persian bilingual and emotionally capturing To ensure authenticity. Complex narrative entanglements. The first part of this movie was set up in Afghanistan and the end of the Taliban in the year 1978 before the Soviet invasion. Focused on the relationship between father Amir, father of a wealthy businessman and son of his father's son, Fakta Hasan. Connected by their mutual love running the kites, thick as two thieves until a unfortunate event separates them unexpectedly. Nirvana is found in his father naturally, it is not found that Amir was convicted for not rescuing Hasan from the unpredictable work conducted by three of the local bandits. Forster raises racial tensions between Hazara and Pashtun, especially in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> In the 1979 attack by Soviet soldiers, Amir and Baba escaped to America, where the story raises their stories nine years later. Internal outskirts of Fremont, California, Afghanistan. Dad is working on a gas station and a Polish market kiosk is managed. Amir will show a local Afghan girl and get married. Vanif's treatment gives the shortage of helpful characters like Aamir's wife, Saraa, and most critically, the actor is depicted as a neutral young man by throwing himself down towards his self-esteem. The final chapter comes forward twelve years where after the release of his first book Amir, the Taliban-Afghanistan returned to Afghanistan to rescue Hasan's son from the Taliban. As a true mystery and horrible verses, the fear and surprise of this part of the story came back to hate Amir during his journey. <br /> <br /> British actress Khalid Abdullah (chief hijacker "United 93") plays a role of Amir as an ameer, challenging role, shame on him, and ultimately reducing self-worth. Other professional actors will share well - Shaun Tib (current "Iron Man" savior Tony Stark's savior Yinsen) Babi's business partner Rahim Khan, who keeps the key of truth; Autosta Leni calmly influences Swia; And best of all, the Iranian actor Homayun Ershadi who brought pride and dignity to his father. Three young non-professionals were appointed from Kabul's school system to play the role of child, and all are pretty good. Zakariya Ibrahimi was upset over the difficult part of the young Aamir, and Ali Denise Bakhtiar Hassan's murderer son was so angry as Sohrab. But it is unfortunate that Ahmad Khan Mahmudzada, who faces the moon, especially in the devastating cinnamon-scalding scene, will break your heart as a young man. Equal performance of young actor Vitorio de Six's classic "bicycle thief" <br /> <br /> The technical aspects have been done well, especially the Roberto Schaifer's clean cinematography (the options of Western China firmly in Afghanistan), the evolutionary scores of Alberto Iglesias and even CGI effects show kites on unfinished flight. The 2008 DVD has a strong set of additional clusters, with Forster, Hossevin and Benfic's insightful commentary, although some of their conversations seem to be compelling. There are two features - the first is the 14-minute "Kite Runner's Word", which focuses on the connections of Hussein to the development of stories and novels, and the second is a 25-minute "Cute Runner image", look at a more standard behind-the-scenes production.
