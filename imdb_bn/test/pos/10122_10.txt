Since films often go away, I have to say that this year I saw one of the most influential films. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Junior give outstanding performance to allow the audience to miss different emotions and really feel for the characters. Occasionally there is a movie that does not depend on special effects, but the characters of the story can touch the hearts of many people. I wish Hollywood will produce more caliber in these caliber.
