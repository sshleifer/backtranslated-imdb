After all - I never see a Swedish movie, and in fact, in my life I see a Swedish movie in the movie! Nonetheless, I believe this is one of the best Swedish movies! Thriller and comedy combination is overwhelming, and sometimes you will not even get scared or just can not laugh! An author about this plot, who wants to go to Germany after World War II, and want to help at the beginning of the Germans. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is a bad idea. What a weird blur! And the poor Robert Gastfusson - the wounded soldier - always get the way ... a lot !!! But he still got his great mood. A positive guy. Robert Gastfusan has done some less awesome movies over the past few years, and it's really a relief. He is great in this movie. After all - this is one of the best Swedish films of all time and Peter Dale has done a great job! Congratulations!
