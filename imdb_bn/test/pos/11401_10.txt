Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and compulsory 70-second pornographic industry includes Eddie Adams, Ur Dirk Digler (Mark Wahlberg), six year sex, drugs and disco. His career interview with pornographer Jack Horner (Bart Reynolds) started his career as the seratom adult actor of that time. Dirk's character was a real-life actor, John Holmes, who was famous for being "well-established", like Dark. Dark primary success is found. <br /> <br /> The main themes of Boogie Night are a clear subject of a movie about this genre; Pornography, drugs, sex, treason, violence, and music. Police with pornography themes with some control on boogie knight. It is not overplayed and sex scenes are surprisingly short, but when the screen is mentally clear. <br /> <br /> Movie cocaine is heavily abused, and the film's settings, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of that time, which takes the movie completely. However, Boogie Knight does not promote cocaine, because there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses. For example, at Jack's party, they found a girl who has recently and graphically aborted; The blood poured from his nose and he started to fit in a senseless. Before this scene, the film was quite enthusiastic and ridiculous, but from this point it predicted darkness. <br /> <br /> The music scenes are brilliantly executed from the disco scenes performed exquisitely. Dirk and singing out dancer in his new music career. The soundtrack is very nice, composed of tunes from passion, LL, Beach Age and unforgettable sound experience. The standout view of the whole movie comes to music; Dean, Redding Rothchild (John C. Raley) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) go to the house of drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) to earn some quick cash from selling phoenix, but Christianity of Night Rangers playing the background, incredibly Increases intensity in the scene, proving that music can cause more depth in a scenario. Boogie Night is filled with such scenes, which make the movie even more beautiful. <br /> <br /> Standout performance at Boogie Knights is Lovely Reynolds intelligent, yet Moody, as film director. In the scene where he attacked a young man to open his movies, it was a complete shock for the audience, because before this moment he was quite gentle and content. Other notable performances are Julian Moore, Heather Graham's beautiful rollergirl, John C. Raleigh and Mark Wahlberg, who gave her career performance. <br /> <br /> Boogie Night is also a wonderful original movie using. The theme is impressed in its own sharp and realistic way. Anderson's view has captured these characters completely when something does not seem to be wrong, or at least until the 80's. Then, the events are really dark, and the first part of the film has all signs of identifiable characters and situations gone. However, this film does not reduce the proposed high-level entertainment entertainment. <br /> <br /> Boogie Knights was not a box office success, only Â£ 2 million in the UK earned the movie. But this film is not the director's concerns. Anderson is not his popularity, which also expresses clear between his three other films, Hard At, Magnolia, and Punch-drunk love. I would suggest this film to anyone who enjoys a simple and full range of principles in the wonderful and dynamical situations, because at the end of this movie you will understand that Boogie Night is a common morality story, but that you will be in mind after watching it. Boogie Night is a sudden, ridiculous, devastating and both visual and hearingable outstanding.
