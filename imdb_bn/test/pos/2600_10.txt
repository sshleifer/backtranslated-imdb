Rabbit Fire's "Hunting Trilogy" (1951), Robit Seasoning (1952), and post! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) Chuck Jones-Michael Multis' co-operation should be considered as the high water mark in the comedy. They are rarely mentioned in the list of "greatest" or "most important" cartoons in animation history, but the list of the latest cartoons they will ever see. Michael Maltie never received credits from directors such as Jails, Frelong, or Avery, but his conversations and situations created Warner Bros. cartoons and these three made especially some finishers.
