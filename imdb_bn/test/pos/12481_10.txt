One of the best pictures I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvette is fantastic. He really 'met' his part, and this is surprising. He is such a good actor that you can not think of anyone else to take part in it. <br /> <br /> And both Suzie Delayar and Bernard Blair both used to be as a standard French man, trying to protect themselves in the conflict with murder ... <br /> <br /> The story is exciting and well-made. You can feel the Paris environment for that time (which until 1930-40), in two wars ... the club, the oldest building, the neighbor. <br /> <br /> A great movie that contributes to contributing to all these things.
