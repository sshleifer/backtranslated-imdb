Giant Robot is the most popular Japanese TV serial on Indian TV. It was the target of children and we saw a robot for the first time in our life. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children have seen a machine for the first time outside school textbooks. <br /> <br /> The serial is an adult organization showing a child in an evil battle. No doubt, many of us have watched giant robots for our own robots, and watching our computers in the same way as a stopgap system. <br /> <br /> This show also illustrates ideal adults, (Jerry, Johnny's friend, friend and Unicon Chief mentions Ajumah). We respect Japanese progress and still see Japan as the ideal Asian nation. <br /> <br /> BTW, there was no satellite TV channel in India and most of the public-owned broadcaster did not show Disney Cartoons. . I guess that like the monster robot the child got the cereal praise. Nowadays there are Pokemon but they are not so interesting as giant robots.
