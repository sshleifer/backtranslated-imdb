I saw the second hitcotch film and the second hitcotch movie in the list, the first one was the rap, which I really enjoyed. There was more room to roam Sabotu's hikko free, and there was a room in the room for the plantation. I have not enjoyed so much like a rop, but it does not seem to be a bad film, it seems like an average flick which can be anything else. <br /> <br /> It seems like a movie in Hitcoos, as a break in its serious ones. As a thriller, I think it might be in my seat or in the lead role running around the United States. The final outcome of the movie really feels the opportunity to raise the tension. The sound design is almost non-existent. You can listen to their dialogue and some of their surroundings, but important things are missing, different from slites, different from each and every different, different and different. There is no doubt deliberately, yet there is a lack of mental punch that we want from such a scene. Then it immediately leaves you empty just inside. <br /> <br /> The film should not be remembered that it should be done, they are almost universally migrated from space, but it seems more limited. The script seems to be very high and finds more ways to move the plot. <br /> <br /> There is a performance but nothing is amazing. Everyone scripts the word on their page drama. The relationship between the two leadership is weak and requires more work. One standing out Otto Kr√ºger, who has stomach down the rich, ego, evil person. <br /> <br /> Finally, I wanted more from this. I understand this is one of the least exciting films of Hitako, but I was good at seeing it. I can encourage it, not just enthusiast.
