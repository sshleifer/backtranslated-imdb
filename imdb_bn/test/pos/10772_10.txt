When the movie comes, I can not easily distinguish between shit, pure shit and excellence. I believe this movie is a perfect masterpiece and it's hard to enjoy for more than 90 minutes. This movie ran in Sloan compared to Mystic River and Harry Potter 3, and I was still able to write my seat. For me, erog bogosiyan had that passion in his performance. It is extremely difficult to pull such a stunt and to make any positive impact from it. Bogosia probably copied the most difficult single-man performance of modern movies. Until the end of the film, I had no respect for Bogosia. The minute before the measurement, the whole single movie was a bending point, it turned to me. This guy hit so low that he knew he could never recover from him. Congratulations to the performance of corporate boys. His whispered prose became slimmer even in golf fearing his head. It has come to me that personal integrity and hypocrisy are not important in the corporate world even on talk radio. Some of the stones might have pushed the uber-liberal agenda but it got my attention that the actual movie and production. Oliver Stone Moody is a minor master. The film's final third, I probably saw the best light and film in a movie. In the fifteenth century prison, the stone gradually feels DJ booths like five-intelligent cells. Apparently, it seems that Bogosian's only friend is a black foam that absorbs his routine Vitriol. He does not speak and speak back to it. It considers its tragic metaphor which he handed over to their success. Stone and Bogosian made a stunning movie of a wall and a man trapped in self-prison. This man is limited to his own volume and he can escape it. The scene that helped me to understand her voice was when she was reluctant to return to her ex-wife. He loved his own prison outside the world. Each story has a conflict and all the conflicts it came down most easily: People vs. myself 'Talk Radio' presents this conflict in an intelligent, gripping, and artistic fashion. There is no hidden message in this movie and an enthusiastic visitor should expect the progress of events. I just go back and my mind grasped by this film and I like it. It is unhelded, invisible, and it will not get its due recognition. Let's hope this is because gems can be found and then hidden. It's a jewel because I found it in the local Wal-Mart Store DVD. For 5.50 dollars, I was valued for half an hour for the excavation. I and I got more than the price of my money. This is one of the best movies ever made and it's worth only for ten reasons. Ten reasons to give ten scores. <br /> <br /> my gems are here!
