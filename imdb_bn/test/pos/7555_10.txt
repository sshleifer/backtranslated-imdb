A wonderful movie about humans Originally shown in the theater when I saw the first four friends and I've seen it so many times. If I do not see this on TV, I will be meeting with friends and renting it. Unintentionally, I saw this movie, it's enjoyable. It is related to adults from childhood in the 50's and 60's. It is very interesting and touching, the first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - to work with the whole 60's. It can be quite dramatic. If you enjoy the movie about people, this is certainly worth a while.
