You do not know what was the bug juice or bug juice, it's a children's reality show about real kids living in the summer camp. Bug Russe is the exhibition that drives me to the camp. It confronts romance, friendship, fights, your fears, and struggles to stay away from home for 2 months. This is a wonderful event that is no longer shown on TV. Regular, but weird non-low. The show was not dull and always attracted my attention. It's really nice that never seen before going to the summer camp. Plus Disney has done a really good job to pick up showcases because one wants to watch only one week's show in a camp. The camp length is perfect for this show and the environment where they were fantastic. Where they camped in the United States, they provided unique activities for each campers. It was really an amazing, unscripted show.
