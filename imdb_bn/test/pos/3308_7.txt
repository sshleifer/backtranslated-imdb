A very enjoyable screen version of Ronana Jaffe's best selling pot-boiler version (and, naturally, love) of a group of women involved in one type of New York publishing business. There are all sexual off-screen, except for the freshness of the prototype of "Freein Three Coins In Fountain" and "Sex and the City", directed by Gene Negosco. <br /> <br /> The bright young female talent of the day, (Hope Lange, Deene Baker, Suzie Parker, Martha Heir) has performed nicely, while Joan Crowford has popped up as editor Rani Beech, who could possibly eat Miranda Presti from Meryl Strip. And spit her out; She stole movies with absolutely no effort. Among the men, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jardan, (if it was not Rosanne Brazi, it was Louis Zerden), Robert Evans (before deciding, wisely, before leaving the camera) and Brian Ehren You have more errors in display than being available in your average Londreset, but if you like me, you enjoy a "painful housewife", you probably would like it if you did not mention the carri brand and the company. A very guilty pleasure.
