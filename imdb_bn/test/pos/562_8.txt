Anyone looking for a episode of "law and order" or "CSI" should look elsewhere because the police's most basic element or forensics work is completely ignored. <br /> <br /> A murder place, and all the police took possession of a 15-year-old boy off the street and he was the only witness - to take a 65-year-old man - and tell who this guy did? Sure, the old man thought that the kid was guilty of behind the car. Remember that he looked nothing like the actual murderer and was completely dressed differently. He must be shrunk, reverse his age for 5-10 years and changed clothes. <br /> <br /> Police have made absolutely no effort - and they accept it! No forensic evidence was based on any evidence, they did not question any other witness, and they destroyed a 15-year-old confession. <br /> <br /> The most tragic thing about this appealing appearance of this criminal justice system is that it happened right down the road in Florida Jacksonville. Everyone started to talk about "south justice" now
