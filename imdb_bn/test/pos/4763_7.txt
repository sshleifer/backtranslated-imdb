I could play this kind of filmographic descent. Please pay attention, because I had this appearance. In 1967, Peter Yeats, an ex-auto racer, operated the English copper "Ruby", the most exciting part of which carries on the streets of London, where golfers are playing kids and all of it below. This is a success. One year later, Yeats stealing the "Bullet" by Steve McCullum, I mean, McQueen, another more spectacular car with San Francisco Hills moving down and down, the dumbfoundethe sound engine sounds like the dual clutching , Full race cam, duplicate, barley-cylinder engines, 40 feet hoods, supercharged, superduparcharges, and full of five horseshoe full shields The. Several shots of McQueen's Gum-Chewing Wijes are trying to break another car from the highway, though they shotguns in another car. Phipip d'Autónim backstage Bill Hopkins runs criminal vehicles. <br /> <br /> After a year or two, feeling good things, Bill Friedkin ordered "French connection", among them a commando police car (Gene Hackman) and a taller New York City train. Hackman's many shots of damaged faces, such as he hates a deadly vehicle through the street. Phipip d'Autónim backstage Follow academy awards. <br /> <br /> Sensing a good thing, one year or two years brought us "Seven Compatibility", which has a Chase behind a car powered by Roy Skider, which has many shots in the face of Skydiver's curse. He tried to break another car, which was driven by Bill Hopkins, off the road, even though the criminal car is sure to carry, it carries a shotgun-trenting passenger. There is no mountain in New York City, it just shocks, but they are still sharp enough at a few feet high. Running cars are playing a dozen kids which screeches near a corner and a dash down the street. Shouting kids shots when they break the jute and zoom the car. But once not enough. Children will return to the road immediately and repeat the rear to drive a skidder car. <br /> <br /> I once was a witness to high speed search in the Philadelphia street. Criminals and policemen roam around the streets on a 25-mile street in both streets, coming to Rolling Stops in every stop sign and red light - this is very slow than the film. <br /> <br /> Talking about this movie, it's really great. "Robbery" and "bullets" were cool. Everyone dressed nicely But New York movies are dirty. There are rubbish everywhere and covered with subway car graffiti. Brick buildings and bit-ups are replaced by empty brick buildings that are broken down into empty spaces or in industrial-size refrigerators for dumps. <br /> <br /> acting is very good. Roy Scheider Whipat looks smooth. Other actors have been made for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is absolutely unfamiliar, engaging. What is the best thing about this movie that the New York City is almost indifferent to human barbarism and ambition? A funeral, Limo drivers stand around with their collars, butts hanging from their mouths, kicked them together in the cold feet, completely disturbed running the ceremony. The film wants us to believe that Seven Ups is an elite group of untouchable policemen who do not interfere with the work and sell it here. They always threaten to do something immoral or illegal - hitting the victim from a suspect or physically injured in hospital and helpless hood - but they always manage to avoid it. (If they actually do this, their character will become lifelong and hesitant and we want to achieve the hero and fame of our biblical nature.) If you have seen it earlier then it is very enjoyable, and you can very well be one or the other of its previous incarnations .
