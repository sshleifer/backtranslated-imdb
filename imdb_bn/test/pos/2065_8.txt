Not a box office success; No one really knows why. It can only fail due to its title. It seems that you need two headlines - "Die Hard", "Lethal Weapon", "Hard Weapon", "Die Lethal" etc. - "Long Kiss Goodnight" you'll find anywhere in order to attract enough people to the unarmed crowd. But once Ronnie Harlin made a good action movie. A large part of its causes is the fact that Central character, Samtha, earns our affection and interest. When he becomes Charlie again, we are broken: We must all want to eliminate Charlie, the bad guy, and all of it. But we do not want to lose him to contact Samantha - even though we love Charlie. Geena Davis allowed her significant charm to both her central character in half. Samuel L. Jackson plays the second puzzle for a change. It turns out it's good. That was a compliment. <br /> <br /> "Mite Hard" is impressive from anything in the series, but if I'd been more condemned "it's not surprising that it did well" but I really do not think that way; It's wonderful that it's not good.
