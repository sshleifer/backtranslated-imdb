In spite of some abundant position of Fronte Mikil√≠gio and some of the Spardial Energetic Music, this movie is often not a stage of similar effort similar to that of Joe Doa Amato during the crash. The original book "Emmanuelle: The Joy of a Woman" was directed by Emmanuel Arresan and played a minor role in the film, which shows pornographic little too little Annie Bell in most strange sex situations. The performer of Jambiee El Cleaver, her boyfriend actually inspires him to sleep after his sleep, and even after his two marriages! Or Maria Gerini drops as a professor, so usually she gets married to two women, one of which is Arsan herself. Despite having a few sunny lines of commitment and dialogue, "Do you see me naked?" ... "I can see you better nude!", The film shambles with dramatic up-to-the-less startling end. Like D'Amato's EMANULELE and the latest Kanibalals, the main character is in search of lost tribe, but you do not expect that there is no violence in this movie and it does not have sex. Just a lot of nudity and silly conversations. I could not help but found some gratitude for this little movie, only if the film is for fully concrete logic.
