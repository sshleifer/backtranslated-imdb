It's the best of its live action cartoon in Disneyland! College student Dester Riley (Kurt Russell) Bamling develops a mysterious liquid invisible formula that makes objects invisible and helps in saving cash strapped college. More tests reveal that it works amazingly well on humans too! Riley's wonderful invention takes some ridiculously new twists when a gang is notorious, the infamous AJ. Led. Arno (Caesar Romero) steals the form and tries to use it for less legal action. Excellent special effects and a fleeting story make this vivid film a textbook case of the college comedy! I like this movie! This movie has always filled me with wonder and joy. A beautiful little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. There is more violence or sex and absolutely no oath, it creates a movie that parents can meet with their children. Medveval has a series of films of urt Russel in college. Terrorists are a delicious little series set before a healthy America, when people value more honesty than cash! I highly recommend this movie!
