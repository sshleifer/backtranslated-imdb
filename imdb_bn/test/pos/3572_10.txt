Bluff I really think this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> Basic is a different type of Colombian movie. Sunny and the actors use so much funds to listen to local expressions. It looks like a different face. Bogota and I think it is very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we have to show it to the world director Felipe Martinez, the first film and I'm really excited about this movie as a film director. Without the start of the career, I will not. <br /> <br /> We need to support the Colombian film industry, because it's a great start to movies and other good movies.
