I must admit, I did not expect this to be as good as this. I'm Samuel L. I do not expect Jackson to play the slides and sing the blue. <br /> <br /> This is a frequent work in Beaver County PE movie. They advertise movies in lobby, seeing that you are all excited and then frustrated by not showing it. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for Jackson and Richie and even former ex-actor N Snyder (Timberlake), for at least one week. But, at that time, if I think it is correctly shown on the M3 3 screen (or another type of blockbuster). <br /> <br /> This movie, like the Blues Brothers and Crossroads, is all about the mysterious and legendary blues music. Passion, and hard times. Religion and gender Past hell hounds Release I mean go see many elements in the blues to do it. <br /> <br /> It was almost a good all around. Of course, many people do not see it because it does not have pirate or swing spiders. But it's Samuel L. Jackson ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Describe in "T". <Br> <br /> Great and intrinsic, but since that is not all good ones?
