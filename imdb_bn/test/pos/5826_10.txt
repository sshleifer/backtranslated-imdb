This show is one thing you would ever want from a prison drama. Finally there are twists and all the way till the season. The characters are very powerful, and it gives the power to show a lot. Seeing the show, not only for the prisoners, but also for prison staff. At this show, the acting actor of the prisoners did a very good job by portraying a prisoner. If you prefer law and order or criminal law, then there are many actors from the show present in those shows. The only problem with oz is that it was not long enough. This show can not be old, but it can be easy for ten seasons. Even after the end of the season, I found myself watching a DVD at the Oz. This show is one of the best television shows. Do not be fooled, see oz.
