After watching the first season DVD, I can say that I can not believe this shot in the "green-headed" NBC. It's different for what's currently saved in vogue for lost. Those X-Filess missed may be eligible heirs. Not as enigmatic as mysterious or intense, I find it to be more entertaining overall. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to make such extended stories. I mean that if it does not meet together with most of the elements, kids can become a drill. But they are anywhere and I think Cast is very nice, sharp for writing, positioning and first rate offers, and special effects are very good for a television budget. Make sure that it is reasonable, but it is not as stupid as it is to insult your intelligence. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it is a famous scientific drama for the whole family. I want to be a classic with long run like X-Files, but I already suggest getting a DVD if you miss it as I did for the first time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what does this do?
