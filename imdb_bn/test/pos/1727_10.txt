As soon as the credit is rolled on Saturday night, you can remember it in the air that the doctor is most definitely back! <br /> <br /> Christopher Eikelston met Billy Piper, who saw those historical moments. <br /> <br /> With this new series it brings together elements which lack the previous version of the show. Immediately, the doctor and his partner were dismissed from the old series, as well as the doctor actually got in love with a partner and got his love for coming back. Yet we know that as a last of Season 2, the doctor will remain lonely forever, he can not stay with colleague forever. Seeing those moments, your eyes are filled with tears as the doctor said that his only friend was told his last farewell, he was well written and acted. <br /> <br /> This show proves that it can live like this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once Christopher Eccelston describes the show as ... "A lifetime journey."
