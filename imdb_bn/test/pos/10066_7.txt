Madonna again failed again once again! Who Has That Girl After A Year After the Wonderful Fall of Shangai after the War of Liberation and after finding successful Susan after successful celeb films. He chose to play it in order to forget the flop in the previous movie, and not suspect that this may be a flop next. This film received a bad recognition by American critics and audiences, when it was a success in Europe. Madonna said that "Some people do not want to be successful as both a pop star and a movie star." The soundtrack album, which he sings four songs, sells well and hits title-track solely around the world. The script was quite weak due to the fact that Madonna failed as an actress. Boots are not so bad, especially those who like 80's: It's a ramaklaw, trash, colorful and colorful action movie! At the end, it is very fun to see.
