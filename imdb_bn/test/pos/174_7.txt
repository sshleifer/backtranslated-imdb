I can not believe that I've mentioned this title by almost eighty thousand horrible fixes and I'm definitely not going to join all my fellow critics because 'Bloody Birthday' is looking terrible. On the contrary, I've enjoyed it a lot and I was pleasantly pleasantly surprised by offering it with delightful twists and twists. Do not mention this movie as 'another 80 slash' because the victims here are probably unlikely, and so the killers We introduced three crew-searching youths who were born during the solar eclipse. At this moment, they were distributed, the planet Saturn was blocked by both sun and moon, for this reason, the children seem to be inward and without conscience. It really started to show near their tenth birthday as they were brutally murdered. <br /> <br /> Guess, this thing is to eliminate the incredibility, even if it is a little objectionable? Unlike many other horror films of this period, it tries to bring at least something original and fantastic. For once, the kids are good at acting and the entire film has a terrific atmosphere and tropical music. The murders are frustrating and imaginary, and they are always lazy to show appreciation by angel-facing kids. I do not know who hired 3 kids but they did a good job. Especially memorable girl and kid with glasses. Silent images of the heartless triangle remind you of classic highlights, such as 'The Deadend Village', 'The Buddy Beed' and 'The King of the Day of the Dead'. This image is not as close to as memorable as these milestones, but it will not be too much fun and a terrible lover to be sorry to see this. <br /> <br /> Bloody birthday Ed Hunt was written and directed. Especially in the movie, not the greatest genius, but a delightful laugh, who provided us with a very entertaining cheesfost like 'The Brain' and 'Starshit Invincibility'. If all this is still not enough to satisfy you, bloody birthday has many nudity. And not just any nudity, but a brutal dance-performance by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and Joe Panini, then keep your eyes open for the completely unexplained chemo as the TV series 'Jake and the Fatman' star. See it !!
