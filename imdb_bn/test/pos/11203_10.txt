After the fall of the Yasilakam (north of Turkey in the north of Turkey) in the mid-90s, observers could have realized this recent perspective in the most meaningful Turkish film industry, which is controversial on the works of former photographer Nuri Bilze Sillen. << br /> <br /> Following the third feature director and the similar themes and tricks of Urz, he has created a triangle with two previous images (the Kasaba and May Clouds). The film found a commercial photographer, Mahmud, who lived alone in a small Istanbul apartment, sometimes with his Bruce, married lover. Yusuf, his nephew, closed a factory and left his house after the loss of his work. Because he is with the Mahmud, he never looks at work in town, drinking in the café and observing feminist women. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie has been translated as "Remote," and the picture is nicely illustrated. The words are each possible; His physical distance from Yusuf's house, his emotional distance from the world around Mahmud and the generational distance between the two men. <br /> <br /> Silen films have very little drama, instead of allowing full and rich characters to be developed from inside. Strictly frames, static shots. He acted as director, producer, writer, cinematographer and co-editor and gave many roles to friends and family. A limited, intuitive system of filmmakers can probably handle difficult movies to connect with intruders for most viewers, which makes sure that humanity is even more impressive. <br /> <br /> A better cinematic than the ceylon playwright, the princess from the past masters of cinema languages ​​like traditional, ozu and tarkovsky accepted the kingdom. After seeing the excuse, I can remember something better for the task.
