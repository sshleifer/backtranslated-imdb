I just saw it for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe around 20. In some ways, it was better than me ... On the other hand, it was much worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> Overall, there is music. It's just plain horror. The movie only has 5 songs, most of them use more than once. Early songs are shrieked by a chorus of annoying children, and Disco Y title track is performed by Rick Dees. It's not worse than that. Even background music is terrible, with many other annoying tune themes repeat it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The author just gave him all the funny lines. Or maybe he's that cool - turning a weak script into comic genius. The best part is the announcement of his surreal PA. ("Lobster ... get out of here ... you are a danger!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < When she gets the girl, it is commendable. (She is not hotly hot, but she will automatically add to one of the inferior girls For example, see two references to movie "Retaliation of the Nader"). <br /> <br /> And when the plot seems ... well, it would be amazing if they did not have a clich√© when it was made, even though it was the first summer camp movie. Not at least - to go back to "The Paint Trap" - it's definitely a movie that has created its own genre. Actually I was surprised that there was no talent show scene ... " The Summer Summit "totally disreputed the summer-sybil style, I just pulled everything out of the Matballs. (I expected to convert one of the half-expected public works into one with a chip," Mr Show's "epic Camp-Olympiad spoof" Monk Academy " Thanks for that) <br /> <br /> However, this one seems like the comedy in the late 70's / 80's. Going a little bit disappear - it is not a cable staple, and of course there is no culture of compliance kyadasyaka or Animal House. I'm glad to catch today's showtime - and at high definition! Of course, it is quite awesome in spots, but you can do something even worse in the 70's / 80's comedy. And again, Murray is a gifted.
