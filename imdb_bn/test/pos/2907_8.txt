This "Ten Commandments" came before "The Land of Pharaoh" "Ben Hur" and it has been abandoned today. How Inappropriate! Based on the great novel of Mick Waltree, it is not cheap! The novel of Walteri was so huge that it could only be a minisan (it is expected that it will be done for some time). Waltheri, whose message is largely unchanged in Christianity (one of his books "secret of the kingdom" (the first part) was held after the death of Christ in the Holy Land). <br /> <br /> The "Egyptian" Christendom emerges from monotheism a long time ago: Pharaoh (Wildlife) is a kind of Messiah who dedicates his life because he knows that the real world is not material world: He is good for evil Requested! And there are his disciples, who will eventually be martyred (see the scene when Simmons and other worshipers of the sun are visually stunning, look for some pagan ballet). On the other hand, their influence on the new religion of priests means population, and that is why they look for a strong man (mature) who can lead the army against the Hittites and against their dangerous patriots. Other religions, or non-religions, we say, Sinha (Purod) who believes in two hours a long time (the sequence of sands is absolutely exciting and raises a good movie on the average mobile phone !!) <br /> <br /> Another interesting aspect is: The film looks like a bright melodrama. Only PlayerPlay (especially Farro's sister's (Terni) predicts "Ten Commandments" within two weeks), but the greatness of cinematography: Viviani cartridge talks about a baudelier's environment, blue and gold in her book, especially prostitution (Darvie) In the scene involving water, considering its reflection in supreme narcissism. Around the hero, all the letters appear, disappear, and appear again, but when they appear again, they follow their path and all the subcultures meet with rich skill. Also, as in "modern" Melendramas often this phenomenon occurs, a long flashback is made by two small sequences, which is a memorable person shown by Sinha. <br /> <br /> This was a wonderful sword and sandal, which had strong influence in Europe, not in America. In Poland, where Georgie Kauerrovych conducted a spellbinding "Pharaoh" (1966), which owed a lot to Cartis
