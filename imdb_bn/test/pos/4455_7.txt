Set a poor working class in the city and around the mountains of rural Italy, it's a story of crazy. The landscape may be quite beautiful, but there is madness here, the secret behind the mask of a person who seems normal to the outside. This person killed a little child. <br /> <br /> Style and tone This picture is similar to those of Dario Argento's famous Italian gielles, the impressive ridiculous horror films that make Argentine films look even better. Nevertheless, Visual Cineplex's view of Phulchi's "Door Torture at Dcling" has some interesting compositions and light. Lightning and thunderstorm on a rainy night increase an increasing mystery, where "ducklings" are in a single weakening. <br /> <br /> Goth is a little more at one end. But this is no slasher film. Undergirds in a valid theme story And that theme is the madness that can take many unexpected forms, not just those people's erroneous confusion of fetuses or black magic practitioners. <br /> <br /> If viewers do not guess, red deer provides an enormous puzzle solution, an agenda of the director. Do not dismiss anyone who does not seem suspicious. Wave at the end provides good misdirection. However, at a stage in the middle, a line of dialogue can be added to make the relationship between two letters, one of which is the killer. The film ends in a beautiful MountainPort with flick winds in the background. We have clearly seen flashbacks and got insight into the killer's psychology. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about the film's widescreen screening projection. But background music is functional, and at least initially spontaneously awakened from jazz, indigenous Italian songs. Actually average, though in some cases, it is overdone a bit. <br /> <br /> Although Argentina's giallos are not visually brilliant, "A Duckling Do not Trouble" Yet a fine film, that is a thriller and a whodunit puzzle enough to appeal to most spectators who love the thriller and the mystery of the murders, is enough.
