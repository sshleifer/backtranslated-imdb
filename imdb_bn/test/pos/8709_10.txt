This is my favorite time all about one of the cheap, corny, Vampire B movies. <br /> <br /> Kevin Klein Underwear Models ... Oh, I mean, Stephan the good vampire, Vampiric Royalty comes back to Translionia to climb the throne, but there are other plans for manicure-crashed and eternally brother-in-law. By killing his father Vampire King, Radu has now attracted his attention to Stephan, Stefan's new pioneer friend Michelle and his two beautiful friends and Almighty Bloodstones. <br /> <br /> Okay, the scene is beautiful, and it should be for transit to transit-fricken-vania. Actress shakes no great and heroin Vampire Stefan is about as charming as a frozen fireplace poker, but who care? The only reason to watch this movie, and its name is Radu! He has a physical respect for Nasafratur and the best line in his film, people who speak a drunken voice of a man who tricks up a cigarette of ten packs of days a day. The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the movie, because Radu is slowly selecting the camera and showing its stains, opening the face to see the world. I hunt myself and laugh at her perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sick. Questioned taste in utterly men, I highly recommend this film to Vampire enthusiasts. It's real, it's funny, and I've seen it for a long time in the best vampires ... it's a bit tricky, tragic, far more fun than a screaming narcotics, which these days are horribly graciously curtains please. He enjoys suffering and does not forgive. She should be a vampire.
