In 2005 Rotoram FilmFlash, I saw Dell Ammar at La Concepcion, where I saw it as the first of ten pictures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> From the first shot, you know the movie is going to be something special. Beautiful cinematography thought of what I could do with the camera. The music is similar to the complementary visuals of images, such as visual and stylish architecture. <br /> <br /> Tito played the role of Sariko Tita. He went wrong to live in a hotel in a tax expert. Every week, he brings a suitcase to a bank and plays the story around it. <br /> <br /> He is always controlled and does not show any emotion to almost anyone; Count and looks well-dressed. Those who have no importance to him have the habit of ignoring. For example, Sofia (Olivia Magnani acted very nicely), who lives as a berdeide at the hotel. Although he was working in the hotel for two years, he did not congratulate him, even if he congratulated him. One day he was confronted with this and the next day he sat in a bar instead of his usual place. The story really starts from here, and in love, sacrifice and mafia can be published in a strong story. <br /> <br /> I will not loot the rest of the picture. If you like stylish movies from David Lynch, The Godfather, then see this movie. If you are not an action-buff then do not see it.
