This evening I got an invitation to join the premier of the United Kingdom of Endorious Busters! I had a lot of hope in watching the trailer but there was a string of self-motivated films (I can be honest, my selfishness is the middle name of her tarantino) <br /> <br /> She pulled the cat out of the bag with this one Was there. The film is rich with interesting conversations, performance timed comedy, including the brutal murder dash. <br /> <br /> The crown of this movie is glorious though with Christopher Waltz, whose errors or errors are not available. Despite most "theatrical" (not a good sound), he managed to create genuine tension between the audience. He definitely deserves his prize at the ear and is heading any title for an Oscar !!!! Hope to see something again!
