CG's changed world and cartoon animation etc etc, Faeries were at least a warm welcome by me. I think it is important to show such movies once in a while, to save them and to help us remember the realities of the cartoon and the fun coming from the original place. People Graphics and Stuff But Hey Why It Was Boring Talking About! It would be annoying to see that everyone and their mothers are making these days like every new film artwork. Call me old fashion but I like it. It's a wonderful story about the occult creatures and people and it really needs all from their audience to visualize them all.
