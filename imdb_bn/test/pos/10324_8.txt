Clyde Brookman borrowed from the beginning of this brief from Booster Keaton's "Seven Chancesis", recently revived as "Benchalar". Basically, there is a 24-hour time for Birster to get married for a large amount of money. In this version, the musical teacher professor shapes only 7 hours (after all, it's a short!). Because of the story and wonderful routines, it is one of the lesser shorts. (The telephone booth scene with More and The Champs, Remembrance of Laurel and Hardy's "Birth Marks" and Marcus Brothers's famous statue scene in "Knight at the Opera" - here the boys hold themselves in their routine change). I'm not a huge studs fan, but a 30-minute short comedy student should be mentioned as one of the best shorts.
