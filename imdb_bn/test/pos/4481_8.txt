I recently stumbled across a TV showing "Passion ...." (missed the open scene). Ms Currier appreciated for having the vision and courage to bring such a weird de Balzac story on the screen. I cast the whole for their part in producing such a thorough fine motion picture and appreciate the crew. It must be shooting cruel many scenes in the desert. And I can not understand how his coach leopard coaxed such fine "performance" from Simona. (This ad remembers other suspicious boldness, "nude love"). Why is this picture more well-known? I hope to find it on video.
