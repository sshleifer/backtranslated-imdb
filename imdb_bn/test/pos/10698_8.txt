I have always been fascinated by Nijistustud, who will know that it is more than beyond. "Ninja III", it's funny, funny and playful. A ninja gets shot by the police, and uses his soul to revenge. The victim, a lovely young girl named Christie (Luciana Diki). She falls for the police who involved in shooting. Luv out of love scene where she pours V8 over her body! One of Japan's surveillance in Japan, known as Yamada (Show Kosugi) came to America not only to save Christ, but brought Ninja to the grave. Just because he put Yamada's left eye out with a shuriken (star cast). The war scene was nice. When I fall on the plywood when Yamada, I like the part, and she divided her legs. And when he was caught, he told Officer Christie everything was fine. Thumb rules: Not under a ninja guess. He carried out other police forces without killing them. And he did his thing without worry. Of course, the Charterie tried to put Nina in her place to use an instrument to take revenge. It's great for a good movie, martial arts buffs. 3 of 5 stars!
