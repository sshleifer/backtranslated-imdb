Maybe people are not like having a devil around more than God. Maybe we want a safety net because of that; There is a mistake to blame the devil for pain and trouble on earth. There is so much trouble spreading in the public that you do not have to face grief in the face of everyone you are passing. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; He knows that everything will not be okay, and maybe someone can help the world to avoid their hardships, so that the risk that they want for them is the one who wants to love him. For the credit writer / director Matthew Ryan Hog ​​to create a good prose, two sub-caste families have been going through a good and bad path. Just about all A and B lists looked at Cast Cast's cast and shows that the material is really attached to its audience. Emotions do not need to be worn on the lining of existing one. Sometimes what we want to do is end the suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brought a vague performance on her table that her character holds the emotion of Leland's emotion. She is a very enthusiastic and intelligent young man, cut through life bs, accepting what she sees and taking bad with good. The film is a catalyst for souls influenced by Leander's terrible events by killing his mentally challenged brother of his ex-girlfriend. In the misery of this sadness, he knows the whole thing that he is going to know, he is going to stop the pain that is everywhere, but young Ryan faced Pollard. Almost immediately he realizes that he made a mistake, maybe playing God is not something he can do in the world. Whether this fact is to be true will be debated as the events of murder started a discipline discipline, which eventually resulted in the flexibility of the people of life, eventually the meaning of the lives of many people. This boy has opened their eyes both sad and regenerated. <br /> <br /> With the haunting ballads by former Sunny Day Real Estate Frontman Jeremy Enigk, in the movie, the life of the two families goes through a journey of small vignettes after the tragedy. Pretty cool with a few mention specifications For anyone who embraces most of the movies, Chris Klein works well with most of the same material, but with the evolution of one of the motivated people. It is similar to his success in the election, his laziness is used when properly used in the right part and I want to see if the director will allow him to expand his talent and sink his teeth into something more important. Jona Malone is also effective with the same effect, she is playing the role of frustrated young people, such as Donny Darko and Life House of Life; Don Cheadle is a stalwart of professionalism, he gives us a different on compassionate therapist from one in our Manik; And Martin Donovan is a great, sad father trying to keep his witt together and finally realized that he would be able to keep his family apart as well. Also, it is very nice to see the beautiful Sherylin Fenke in a very small but important role. <br /> <br /> When the tragedy hits, everyone bands together. Liland clearly indicates that you see men and women around them seeing pain and trouble seeing others and panic, but after a few days everything becomes normal. Chadell's character has further enhanced the optimistic outlook that at least we look for a glimpse of the true nature, to help people and to be good at each other, will be shot only tragically, "at least we do during the tragedy." Perhaps we do not want to think that we are in good nature because it thinks we are always good, and when bad, it must be. By being defective we allow ourselves to be resurrected and retry. Leland's mistakes allow her to see the love of her closest people as well as to open the eyes of others and not let them look at them from any other side. They can not pay attention to others' sadness when they first have to travel with themselves. Hog has composed such an illustration and a real effective part of filmmaking is hoping that much more will come.
