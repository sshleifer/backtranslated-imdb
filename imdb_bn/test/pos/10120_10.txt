I just got a place to watch "radio". I have not seen such an inspirational story in a long time. My kids are 8 to 5 years old and I want to take them so that they can "feel like" messages like me - you do not judge for the difference between people to find the best among them and love them for them. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris both deserve the Academy Awards for this film. I do not know why we can not get more such movies instead of junk in the daily theater.
