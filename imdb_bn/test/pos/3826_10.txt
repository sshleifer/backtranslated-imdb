I see the original external limit in the original time, when the first broadcast occurs and the entire original series is replayed and completed on DVD later. I find more than a restoration of the new external limit of the old repetition episode, as some teenage commentators have suggested. <br /> <br /> Just two (2) years of original series with seven (7) year programs, producers and authors must have added significant new original stories and philosophical lines of the much more ongoing and well-produced (cable) TV series. . Plots are intelligent, sometimes scary and scientific concepts of unknown possibilities of upcoming future are correct. <br /> <br /> While Hollywood's most prominent producers and directors unknowingly saw sci-fi as a deviation from Harrar and fantasy, the series comes back to the source of science fiction in their potentially dangerous near-term realizations of the new technology's logical, moral and philosophical context. This series is very good and is unique to the current generation's mentally challenging "Shoot-Up" video game giant. It has brain, history, a message and good entertainment. It's an infinite series without an unbelievable teenager-it's all imagination. Hurry! <br /> <br /> Now, instead of just six poor teaser discs, only MGM can be available to release the entire New Outright Limit series in DVD and only available for the first season.
