This image is based on the book based on my theory of the film: "You've read the book; Now check out the movie," If you are looking for a good book, try the movie you like, because it will be 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I was released initially at the National Theater in Eugene City and I liked it very much that I was waiting to see it again. This is a perfect match of my favorite actor, John Viet's inspirational competition, which was created by my favorite book, "Water Is Wide," Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any better education aspirations and movies about the unstable challenges of life. Two small caves: <br /> (1) The video suffers from pan-scan and is eligible for a letterbox version. (2) The name of the title book should be restored, it is a reference to the most sensitive, spiritual songs ever written
