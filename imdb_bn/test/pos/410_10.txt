Although it closes as a B movie, it is actually a first-class comedy that is well written and played. The well known Wally Benton Red Scolton is well known as Fox as the radio scant. An Rutherford Wally Perfect as Carroll Lambert's Fiance Conrad Veidt leads a very good cast gang of criminals. I have read an account in this movie which says that Vincent Minley has managed the film, until he changed his name to S. Sibleon Simon, who directed the three directors of Fox. This is a very entertaining film when the imagination is encouraged. So if you have one, put on your black and white bias, sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy. It was Red's first acting role. Take notes during the last episode of the reference of 'War of the World's Broadcast' by Osborne Wales.
