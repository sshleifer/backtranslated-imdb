I once saw this image once more. In fact, El Podrino is one of the best films I have seen many times. <br /> <br /> One big story Jennifer Tilly, Fay Duaneway, Brad Darf, and Damian Chapa who really liked it. A true star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard that the film was shot under $ 2 million. I saw shots for 33 million photos which can not compare with quality and production prices. <br /> <br /> Why do not you offer Damian Chapa and more pictures !!! Excellent work !!!!!!!!!! I can not wait to see the series, and I hope it has the same job. <br /> <br /> <br /> Like the big stars in the 40s and 50s of the film, they are sick to see these miraculous actors like Ben Stiller, when there are such talents There is something to show. A great movie. <br /> <br /> you have to go to buy something but el padrin !!!
