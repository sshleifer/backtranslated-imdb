I know that other users should not comment on comments, but I would say that many negative reviews were already very much about the Manhattan project and they got annoyed with what they left. (From his book, 'Smoking in Bid', it seems to be a real screenplay by Bruce Robinson.) But I knew very little before watching the film, however, and it was found in the writing. Dwight Schultz is absolutely mesmeric as Oppenheimer - a truly magnetic, charismatic presence, an inspiring piece of welding which makes me wonder why he is not given good roles and more prominent parts. John Cusack and Paul Newman are always as excellent. One could quibble with the choice of different scripts or aspects, but as it is extremely intense and horrible during the time and overall I have five stars out of it five.
