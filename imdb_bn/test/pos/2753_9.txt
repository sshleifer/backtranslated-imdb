The show is great. No words to describe it. Wonderful music Incredible dance The editors could not loot it, because they were not bad *, but the show was really * good *. <br /> <br /> Editors are mandatory cut, you can not see a scene more than 15 seconds without a scene. It's okay to show different angles, but those people are working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives and they will remind you how many cameras are in every five seconds ... They jump with one camera, then cut it in the middle, and the other Show the rest in the corner. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a must for dance and music lovers.
