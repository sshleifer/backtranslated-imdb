I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, but missed the last one. I bought the DVD to watch the whole movie, and I'm happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A little mother and her two daughters enter into a house, inherit the husband from the house, who died from an illness. It runs very well, but three women makes it well. Teen daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) is warned about the zombies to come at night by a local boy. She ignores him, but he has a lovely friend, he joins his team. Meanwhile, the little girl (Clo Grace Mourtage) made her an old girl named Marie as a friend. In 1913 Mary and some children died in a mine while working as child labor. Now they are junky, they attack anyone who is not bloody and killed. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by JS. Carnon, whose earlier films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadozone (1990), I did not like the two films. For this reason, I was surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. The film deliberately paced, which I liked. It helps you find key characters, most of which are preferred. At least child zombies have been used by George Rome's classic night of the Living Dead in 1968. Still, I found the tool-user child zombie with this movie. It seems that Cardon finally found the right script and cast. Only smoker smoking, drinking alcohol, and the carrot rattling scenes in the parking car was boring to me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " ) Be present.
