The Wicked Little thing was really a good movie. I would say in some parts that it seemed really incredible and others thought that the characters did not have enough thinking in their actions, but overall it was exciting and entertaining. I do not understand why this film rating is so low. Or do not I understand why all the Dirk Horrorfest movie ratings are so low. These are people of B-movie, nothing else. They give great entertainment and most of them do not have many errors. This is definitely a look, because you will not be frustrated with the results. Wicked small things are one of the best 1 yearly official harrowfest movies and compared to many other films in the series, this is the best one.
