Human poet performs without a poetic test dialogue. Anti-heroes created a contraction in order to protect themselves from the Band of Man ManGround, which once was harmed by the destruction of civilization, its survival from the ruins of the city. There he crossed the bands with The Brent, who was passionately played by "Professional" and "Mission: Impossible" fame by Gene Reno. Man is rescued by a crazy old talent who lived in a castle of his own design. Using their wits, Man and the old talent are capable of helping Birt and his companion, but they realize that it is only a matter of time before it becomes compatible with their defense, so they make a break for it. This is a strictly different story of strenuous struggle for life with wonderful action scenes and cute humor. Among all the films like "Radar Warrior", "Omega Man", and even "Ultimate Warrior" (even knife-knife-fighter like Yule Brainner), "Le Darin's Combat" is the most beautifully written. The copy of the video is hard-to-doodle, I will pay for one of my left eyeballs. If this movie is a resurgence in your local art house, I sincerely recommend that you can break any article to be able to see it.
