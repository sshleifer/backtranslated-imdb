Although it was only a movie less than forty minutes, it is always the best directed and acting story I have ever seen. It takes less than 45 minutes, which is not more than 90 movies. <br /> <br /> It is a story about two brothers, one 18 and 10 other stories. They come from a poor farm family in the Mississippi region. Both are caught in war and the conflict of duty contradicts the family. <br /> <br /> This brings tears to my eyes, especially the whole film is so well directed and directed, and it tells the story of many people where the war and the rest of the war left behind. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie completely as far as recommend!
