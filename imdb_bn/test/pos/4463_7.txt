I did not know what I expected when I rent this widescreen DVD. I knew it was followed by a ritual but I saw many of the director's next work, although the delightful glory was also quite infinite. Do not waste the accident, in fact, a linear story and a mystery which almost kept me guessing at the end. And after all said and done, it was a truly uncertain and terrifying experience. A major warning: I've heard the original soundtrack and read subtitles in English rather than non-communal dubbing.
