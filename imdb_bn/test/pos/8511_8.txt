Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak sound track, it is much more common than its competition, "Octopussy." Never Say Never Again A Thunderbolt updated and upgraded version (Konarai's lowest popular bond flick). NSNA is rich with intelligent dialogue, intelligence, memorandum, sex appeal, and the best and most trusted bad boy in the whole bond series. In addition, the NSNA features an extremely talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedy fans will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as "Mr Bean." I will not have any trade of Moore Pictures for this one. But the previous Connie / Bond effort (except "Thunderball") is higher. <br /> <br />
