First of all, tell me that although I usually realize the work of Mike Judge, I have just fallen down to the office space, the Hill King, and Bevis and Batthead. I usually like a more intelligent comedy, and there is respect for Idrisi. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The future of the world's Bevis and Battheid's views, basics and intellectual abilities is a chaos structure, dirty, semi-mad Max semi-blade runner society, where every trailer-trash person Imagination becomes realistic, even with an average intellect, a person is accused of threatening and speaking gay, and comes with the mentality of the crowd. And incredibly funny in this world. Yes, it is clear that the officials of Carl Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Friedrichs will be scared in their respective values ​​in 2505. <br /> <br /> There were some missed opportunities with movies, and there was a relation between the passengers - another average intelligent woman who was worried about the punishment of her boyfriend (pump) - could have been stronger; There is chemistry. And does not seem to be more women in the future. <br /> <br /> I go with a nap on my face, but the experience is a little better than memories. So, it's like my popcorn movie, and it's fun to review videos. Recommended! Having FYI through credit for an additional scene
