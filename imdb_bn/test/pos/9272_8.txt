Do you remember Greg Bogie? This show was started on an independent film channel, but it became a completely bright sitcom in Fox. My cousin and I thought it was pretty funny, taking TV-PG material out of the steadfast idea of ​​dolls. Dogs beat into the same universe, where pupils live in the same world as humans, and act like us and take their own life. If you do not manage to handle it, do not be bothered to see PW, because this show is a 4 puppet profile which has come out of the good girls of society through the misuse of drugs, fondness and violent flogging ends at only half- There is a lot of violence, sex, and bad language (so it will never reach the US network TV). As the socio-political dolls were not enough, this incident made Canada more annoying (BTU, the government paid for it), and I think an American television audience would like to demand more such kind of cable TV sheets. I do not know where you can get it from outside the satellite TV in the US, but I will try to give it to you. Really interesting thing. (It carries comedy network in Canada)
