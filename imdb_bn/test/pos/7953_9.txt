I really appreciate what won the rust before his death. Everything. I want to say that his love for love is selfless. If he chooses the Rim, then it will be good for him. But Day-Rim will take more time to recover his death. Of course he does not want to let it happen. He did the film, he decided to give up. So it was a temporary pain for the-rim. <br /> <br /> Compare, my life without me is very different. Their behavior shows big differences between Eastern culture and Western culture. I can not say that well. Each one may have the right to choose. That's up to you completely Life is equal to everyone. We can live only once. If you think this is suitable for you, then a choice is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The movie can not really be an excuse to refuse the film. Calm down You will find more from the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean movies I have ever seen. 9/10
