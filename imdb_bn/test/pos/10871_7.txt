A young teacher from Elba Island, Martino, a wonderful teacher, Messro Fontanelli, has been created to talk about her own person and what she thinks, something that hurts her in school where we can meet her first because she is teaching revolutionary ideology . Due to the arrival of the most influential men in the 19th century European history, this island is a frenzy. Napoleon is coming into exile, not just a high point in his life. <br /> <br /> As soon as you become surprised, Mapino has been nominated to go with Napoleon, who wrote his memoirs and needed help for his project. The young man comes from the sea business family. His brother and sister wanted him to continue the commercial operation, but Martino decided to place his place in Elba because he tried to kill Napoleon. After trying to judge his mentor Fontanelle, he was shot dead and a firing squad was shot dead. <br /> <br /> Martino has found his comfort with the beautiful Boroness Emilia, who is a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the abducted emperor, a different kind of people emerge. Napoleon is seen as a more humane person, who really enjoys the Martino Company, the young are not skeptical about planning their own plans. Unfortunately, Martino is not able to utilize his design because Napoleon's mind has other plans. <br /> <br /> Director of "Caterina v In City", Paulo Veerzi, shows his initial commitment is still why. Mr Veerjee also collaborated with the screen, which was based on the novel Ernesto Ferrero. The director shows that he is also better with such a philosophy as well as close proximity. Cinematographer Alessandro Pacey did a great job with the pictures he was able to get. <br /> <br /> Elio Jermano, a young Italian actor is the best thing about the movie. He is playing against more experienced players, but he persuades us to firmly believe that he is trying to judge for an idealistic young man who thinks that it is a great cause. Great Daniel O'Toole is bigger than a person, who hopes from his interpretation that he is more humble than Napoleon. Monica is interested in Baluchi Martino, but she has nothing to do. Omano played Antonio Fontanai.
