It was very funny, even if it eventually fell far away. Do not go overboard with respect after Hitkoc - Oven (Danny Davito) was lucky, he was "unknown to the train" playing in the local movies, so the movie was flat out that you had the inspiration to say. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very funny but a little sad.
