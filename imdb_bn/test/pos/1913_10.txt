Dolmite, for me, an object of my deepest affection. It got everything: Dalmite torn his fist with a group of cart-fight prostitutes, Will Green (director Martin Pete), high pump and 100 gallons of demallion-print cap. Moore's unique comedy rap, actually toast, the hip hop's roots. No wonder Dr Dre mentioned "dlmeight" 3 times in his classic album "The Chronicle".

Style director D'Urville Martin should be given credit for style, who is a film director who does not pay attention to the surroundings of Film Fan Circles (I have found his copy and Fred Williamson's films from the beginning for 70 years and can not find them. br /> <br /> Many people really fall down in this movie and tell it is really bad, and it's true that you give up You can see that the boom microscopes are visible everywhere (see DP Nicholas Joseph von Sternberg, for which I thought it was a very initial attempt), there is a lot going on for this movie, there is no number, no other movie.
