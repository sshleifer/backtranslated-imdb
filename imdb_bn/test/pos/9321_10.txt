I enjoyed this film very much. I found it very entertaining for me that I think that it has taken hold of the romanticism of the observance of the Irish American culture of the century. There are no messages. There is no violence and no extra sex, only 1947 style entertainment and Dennis Morgan had the opportunity to sing some nice songs. A really good movie
