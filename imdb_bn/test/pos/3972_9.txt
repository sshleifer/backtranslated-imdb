Bruce Mighty and Lear Leer Manufacturers! The film took some time from the beginning, at least for me to see that it was a run-of-America America pie flick. But it was a bit different - a fun-loving Slake who finished high school and created O'Neun College, according to which it runs. As you can expect, there are many parties and hot girls in the bayinisne, but this movie has tried more than your average teenager on Flickr. Architects Janes (Justin Long) encourages his students / colleagues to learn through the freedom of expression and eventually 'push them towards the system.' Humor was varied which I liked. All cast delivers fantastic performance - rent this one with a friend, it's a bloody crack!
