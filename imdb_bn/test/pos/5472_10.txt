Those who have commented before this movie and hope to see it again, I hope you did. It was broadcast on today's Lifetime movie network (November 28, 2014). I'm subscribing to the dishes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The light, editing, and dialogue contributed greatly to the film, and both Hershey and Pieterson cast both sensual, bold and intuitive characters for both roles. Screen play was nice, as well as supporting cast. <br /> <br /> I do not know in advance, I was based on the truth on the story, and now I know that I have to wake it up as Santa Fe is a hop, skip and jump from Tuxson. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the theme of the construction of the stairs and the person who designed and made it (who was he an angel?). But storylines, and it's a lot of plots, how it happened that affected you most. You must definitely get a strong sense that God was in each detail of this entire drama of His play in heaven. Seeing the movie for you, you know what I mean. I will not waste a minute for those who do not have you ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
