Jack Frost 2, Perhaps the most fascinating movie of my life. The film's full title, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of Mutant Killer Snowman. The horror movie fans that have a taste for the story line of the camp, will be delighted to see this. These pictures were direct videos, and good reasons. Here's why: Acting, so cruel, and so terrible, that it can cry one. The main character did not have any personality, and the actor's bad performance made it all bad. The screenplay was also casualties. Each character always says a Chess line, and add sugar line to bad choreography, then you have some bad. Secondly, the line of the story is not really impressive, but it has been forgiven because of the film's direct video. The director, and author of a killer snowman concept, might have turned into some cooler, but they did not. They have lots of plot holes in the story. Initially, coffee hit a fish tank with a cup of melted Jack Frost. Scientists tried to restore his life, but they could not. Once the coffee cup falls in the tank, Jack Frost is fully restored. Now he is anti-freeze defense. In the first part of Jack Frost, the main character DNA mixed with anti-fridge used to kill Jack Frost. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is very much. So, here's my point. They say that Samsung's DNA combined with Jack Frost. However, scientists had some saliva in a cup, so when it fell into the tank, the scientists would have met DNA Jack Frost. Another thing, special effects were not very good. Good points here: Jack Frost 2 has many blood, which seems quite realistic. Although this image is faulty in hell, it is still entertaining. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. The first one was good though. 10 out of 7
