I got Monster Man in the box set of three films, where I wanted the other two, but it was still very nice time with it. It mixed horror and comedy with the rational effect, as Eric Jongman's Gekkyi lead, Justin Ucherich's love and his interest in love, he is referred to as his perfect creator as Aum Brooks. The film is fairly predictable and ideas from a host of other movies, but some of the great hug throws down the jokes. Of course it does not measure up to classic poor comedy, but it's still good.
