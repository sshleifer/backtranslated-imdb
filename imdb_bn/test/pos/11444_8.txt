I saw "Demons of Night 2" first seen "Demons of Night". Unfortunately, my old blockbuster thinks it was a good idea to sigail, but no first. Lonnie, is not it? Now, I think all the horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and if you want Cheesecake Facotory (or you prefer a private restaurant), you can not only help when you want cheap things. <br /> <br /> There are all of the Demons in the night: your innocent, sexy, dog-decked rule, your tokens go by black guy, is not surprisingly killed. You slutty girl, you slutty guy, you are bold girl or guy, punch ball, delicious settings of a spooky house, bad acting, and a lot of unnecessary nudity. Is this stuff great? I mean, I know deeply in movies that it was bad, but it was good for horror films. Awesome fans should enjoy and dig! <br /> <br /> 8/10
