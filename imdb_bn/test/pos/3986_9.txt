This is a brilliant film. The story begins with Romania, where Billy Crystal plays as an agent that can do anything to anyone. Here is a funny scene, where Crystal is a child, and talks to his father, who becomes roe to eat pork (you know filmfills that it is the parody of the Crystal religion). He mainly scouts a talent, and he is trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding a terrible crew of the whole film, he accidentally fell into a small river. He believes in death, some huge hands come to reach him. He later seems to be in heaven. He did not find that he did, but that he was in a monastery. The believer in God saved him, he became a monk who wanted to save him. Later he found 7 feet 7 in the person, he was the perfect villain he carried (he also read Shakespeare!). See the film and find out the rest!
