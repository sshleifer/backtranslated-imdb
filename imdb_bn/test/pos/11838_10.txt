Marin Davies's curiosity and genius. Due to the great acting of this album, this 1931 comedy has become better with every philosophy. Smith plays a serious old man who gathers her raised child (as a rake from her younger days) in her growing year. An American (Davis), an English (18 years old Reyland) and one Italian (Nina Quarter). There is some surprise to move Plot with Davis to Falling Ralph Forbes. <br /> <br /> Davis and Smith are surprisingly and very sensitive together. Davis works in some dances and makes a few "big" entrances. And of course Davis is just pretty fantastic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hollywell, Smith was nominated in 1931 when he supported the Oscars Award. She is just wonderful in this gem.
