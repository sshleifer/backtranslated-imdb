This lesser known movie from Roy Thins (from television invisors), I actually consider a lost gem. It was created at a time where the story was more important to special effects (though the effect is fairly good for its time). One scientist thinks there is another Earth in the Earth's surface directly behind the Sun. Since the sun always blocking it from us, we can not see it from the earth. Roy Thins has been chosen to go to the mission of this world. I do not want to say the rest of the plot because it will release the rest of the movie. Let's just talk about some real surprises. <br /> <br /> This movie is a British and an actor-like British flavor which was in a TV series such as Eganzar.
