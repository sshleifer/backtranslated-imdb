The last horrible asterix movie, and for that reason we only got Swiss German version of the movies, here I went to see it with a lot of horror ... unclear, I was happy to discover ^ ____ ^ <br /> <br /> This movie is fun and Modern, good gog in it, a good animation, an impressive character interaction, a good voice cast (Note: I only Swiss German Ner can talk!) In addition to the daughter of the Vikings without a father (his name is great, although it is not very inspired voice actress) <br /> <br /> I especially character jastaphariksa (gaudariksa in French, in German grutabharniksa) liked. In form ...). She is a very funny photo of a mollycoddled, urban teenager; But he is very fond of, despite the teenage approach ... the interaction between XD Asterix and Obelix and their young charges is spontaneous and thoroughly entertaining. <br /> <br /> It should not be compared with old movies, because it is a different ... which is not surprisingly bad. On the other hand. When they tried to modernize the last time (twelve years ago), they blew it completely. However, this picture proves that it can be corrected ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I came out of the theater ... always a good sign ^ _ ~
