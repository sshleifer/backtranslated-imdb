"With all the sorrows in the world, how do we get drunk?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A beautiful aerial view of a big city with a fleet of air bombers; A felt ethnic slur reaction An irate irritant cut a road through a trader's pond hair; After a failed magic technique, after dreaming of dragging into an electric chair, a teacher breaks down in front of the class in his grade school because his husband calls him Hag. This and almost fifty other vintetts that fiercely frustrate with disappointment and delightfully enthusiastic people, Roy Anderson's You, the Living, are critically acclaimed from its first feature, if there are commercially unsuccessful songs on the second floor. <br /> <br /> You are filled with fictional set pieces of the same type, like live songs, full of black humor, real situation, and weird color. Although less and less focused than his earlier work, Anderson's unconscious style remains constant with his fixed camera, stereoscopic background and detail in detail. If there is a theme that is related to sketches together, then our time on earth is limited and "tomorrow is the next day", so let's treat each other kindly.

Although there are no series of descriptive threads, the themes of greed and despair appear on several sketches. Among these threads, the first two indifferent persons and their little dogs are sitting on a park park bench, no person understands or loves them, yet they ignore comforting and reassured words of humans. <br /> <br /> Heavy malice mixture. An executive luncheon seems like a man calls on the phone to say that the workers do not appreciate the quality and appreciate the money and how wonderful it can be to buy it as a fine wine. When he did not look, however, a man quietly picked up his pattern from his jacket on his back of the table on the adjoining table. Although Anderson's disagreement is sometimes not very well hidden, you are living in an underlying humanism which shows compassion for the human condition. This is a warning story that we have seen in the world of hugging people, but we have warned that the poet has taken precautions in Guayyah, if we open the film, then "you live, on your pleasant warm bed, Lath ice cold wave You will loot your fleeing foot.
