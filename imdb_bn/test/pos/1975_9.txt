It was a great movie, I'll compare it to The Game Movie. You can stop flashing and can not go ... your brain has been removed and reduced (not excited) and put it behind your head. Do not plan after this movie, it will take time to think about what happened to you. <br /> <br /> Do not come to this movie with lots of special effects on the matrix style, the effects of these films come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you and do not let the film go full-time . Great acting, great plot ... very enjoyable movie, I can not say enough. Also very original plot, I never thought that lots of twists and ideas. The surprise suddenly gets surprised and surprises you, what is the truth? Is this really ending? Good end, saying that it's bad ... just to leave you wonderful, and a little frazzled. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
