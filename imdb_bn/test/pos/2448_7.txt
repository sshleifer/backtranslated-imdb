Jeremy's parents Bob (Martin Shane) and Morin (Kathy Betts) are clearly a problem both in fighting with their son's viewpoint and rejecting Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is uncertain to be beside. But there can be no neutrality after dinner. <br /> <br /> We will never be able to fully compete with the Vietnam War, but this movie can probably help us to understand how it has affected it. Many people Emilio Estevez certainly works to point out a good job. Also starring Karine Nemek and Karla Gagino.
