This picture is awesome in how unsuitable. This is the real story of a woman and a person and a happiness in the brutal, intelligent life of a housewife and "houseman" It can be a couple, a family, any town ... but this makes the story so dynamic. It touches each of us and lets us know and love us, or remind ourselves. I laughed, I started crying, I could not think of it ... and what else can you ask from a film? Especially a documentary. This is a great movie and a great movie which I recommend to documentary, stories about family like you, love story, life, parents, loss, expectation, soul searching, passion, travel around life and find your way. .
