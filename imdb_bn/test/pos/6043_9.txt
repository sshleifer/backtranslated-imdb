Misfit employs personal Owens test drill instructor Sgt Moore's (Jack Webb) skills. No explosion or bleeding or hip soundtrack or sex. It is placed in the Paris Island SC boot camp of the USMC and most of the lid is actually Marine. A lot of memorable one-liners, and "dedicated ..." of closing credits are intense. With such strong male and female characters, this movie could be made in today's touch-torn world.
