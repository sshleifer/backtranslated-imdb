Most other critics agree, 'After finner' this adaptation is really good. Always one of my favorite Poirot stories I was worried that it might be related to '. Well, it was a little bit but just a little bit and the results were perfectly entertaining. David Suchet continues to be very precise as Pirot and (as mentioned by others) Monica Dolan, another star of the show, who could not recover like Miss Gilchrist. I really enjoyed the Fiona Glasscote, who had a spot like the Rosemund Shane cut, but really, casting was quite inefficient! <br /> <br /> In the final fifteen minutes, a single point is closed for adapters that have not been able to prevent a growing number of publications. The business was a little unnecessary on the Will and House Functions, although I do not think how the family structure of Abenithi's family was strong (the family tree is really complex in the book). At the very moment when the murderer is revealed, it is really done extraordinary and I get very late, when they all leave Anderby, they are quite touched. This is really one of the very poirot series.
