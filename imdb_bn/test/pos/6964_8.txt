OK, so Ghoulies 4 types are bad. And it does not even even have it in ghoulies. And acting is bad. The story is stupid. But I do not forget to mention how funny this picture is. It's so much fun to camp so much, and so ridiculous to enjoy it. There are only 2 horses in the film and they do not seem to be related to Gawli in another film. But they are quite funny. And the fun thing is, that Jonathon Graves return for this one. If you first saw, he was a character that was. In my opinion, it is better than the first. There are some classic scenery and some classic lines, which is a grocery store. "Attention Shoppers!" See this if you enjoy bad movies It's so good to be so bad. And I repeatedly mentioned Alan Woods?
