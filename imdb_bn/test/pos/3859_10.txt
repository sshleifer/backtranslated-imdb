Like a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old mother, I enjoy Aristocats. This is a movie which is not a bipartisher, not an oath, like a hake or a darn, a guardian who is not a functional idiot, and a crotch-scamming or flutulence joke, which is not so popular in this "best" children's movie. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. Love story is quite romantic The kids are adorable, and various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is not easy and overwhelming or confusing. Characters are well-cast well. I love to hear the elegant voice of Eva Gabor, and many more well-known characters from childhood also fit well. It really is a movie about love, tolerance, good behavior, and loyalty. Who does not want their kids to open this standard? This is a movie that I do not see over over, unlike Happy Feet, where I could not see the whole thing once because it was very annoying. I will move towards producing more movies like this one in production companies.
