<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> "This movie" is a dark comedy of women's power over men, and how a group of people can realize different realities. It has been told from three different perspectives of the same story, and when we tell the story, we try to reveal more about what actually happened, which nobody really knows. "<br /> <br /> Zabort's first debut by director of" One Night at McClus ", an award-winning commercial and music video director, who began to make small films at the age of eight. Commercial and Music Video Directors I always get nervous when active on the side. We want this generation to have other ads or music videos for their TVs with their needs. I have seen so many examples of creating opinions that prevent Zwart's tendency. He has caught a specific ridiculous fact of "Macaulay's One Night at MacTool" from the complex screenplay, discovered by Stan Seddel, even though it is often a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> " In one night on MacCull, "three men share their different experiences especially about beautiful young ones. In some ways, this movie" America Beauty ", but among others, it separates a world. <br /> <br />" It starts at one night of McCullum "Each of the three explains to their audience. Randy (Matt Dillon), a local bar The tender, and his cousin, Carl (Paul Reisar), is a lawyer who lives permanently until the place closes. Detective Dahiling (John Goodman), when a woman in Salon appears to be seriously fatal of a deadly boyfriend crime scene called Jewel Tillar. Randy is the first to see him, as if a person behaves unkindly. She has stood for her, and before you can say SEXY, they have strong sex and she continues with her. Initially, Randie reluctant: "Gender and violence, one night? It's a little more." But who can cut a jewel like a jacket <br /> <br /> The jail has changed everyone's lives of three. For dehyding the detective, after the death of his wife, he drove her out of the grief hole. For Carl, he forgot him for his loving family and the nice small suburbs. For Randy, he ignited both positive and negative things, then prompted him to end a deadly man named Burmester (Michael Douglas) in his fraudulent way. <br /> <br /> This movie is related to talking about three different chronicles - even the costume of Jewel, even the story. Dehling see Jewel as a beautiful, mesmerizing gift from God. Carl shows the jewel as two sexy legs and lots of shoes. Randy is uncertain to make her, otherwise an awkward awakening, somewhere in the road of life. The most impressive element in this movie is Jewel herself, however, deliciously always played with the lovely Levi Tiller ("Armageddon"). He is not really interested in men, but what they can give him. His intentions are all very simple, not really wrong or bad; She is only a young lady who has learned at a young age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty. <br /> <br /> There are lots of fun with pictures. Interestingly, from his violent comedy showdown, "McCul's One Night" took advantage of most of his fun ideas, from an entertaining cast. The film makes it more fun, which is how the views of the three differ. Actors have a lot of fun with their character too. Goodman is oddly weird; Reiser fits quite well in her weird, squirmy part; Douglas is stubborn and mysterious in the film's most amazing performance. Dylan has given the arrogant personality of her character, although Randy is not an incredible person; Liv Tyler is fantastic. He injects Jewel with the perfect amount of tantalizing pride and charisma intelligence. She is "American Beauty." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It is a creative, genuine, and sexy production. We are often caught in the twin framework, but it is a natural reaction of a film that deliberately interferes with different corners in a single story. The movie ends on a note of both black and comedy. This is one of the tricks that happens to be a serious incident in a ridiculous incident; For example, the black comedy. Most of the films in this genre are very black or very unpredictable. "McCul's One Night" actually works a few things. <br /> <br />
