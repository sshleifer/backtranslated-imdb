Depending on the real facts, "Reverse Edge" is a movie, which is mostly in the style of David Lynch, a group of teenage boys, who are aware of the murder by one of their friends, but no one does it for a long time. Time. With the top genuine photo of Crispin Glover and Dennis Hooper, we are able to forgive the mean performance by everyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> This image is a small boy team (Joseo John Miller), a doll close to a dumping vehicle (murder # 1). The team began to cry aloud loudly and loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly began to cry. Samson finally shows the body of his friends. Not only because of the killings but also the scary, Jamai (Dani Dots), their friends. Despite all this, no one goes to the police. You can think of this unreal, but what happened in this real story. If you are familiar with the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006), then you know that the same thing happened there too. Through this, Leny (Crispin Glover) is working to keep Samson safe, although none of them, including Samson, thinks about protecting from his loss. When the time comes, we learn that Fack (Dennis Hooper), a middle-aged friend of thirteen-year-old drugs, has already killed a woman (murder # 3). From here on, Samson and his friends start to stop a bit and finally everything is revealed, but not the way you expect it. <br /> <br /> In this picture we learn about three murders, each one different reason, a different reaction, and a different effect on those involved. When the team threw the doll from her little sister, we are not aware of her motive. However, we do not see small sister's reaction. When his mother consoles him, he cries and screams. Later, his older brother, Matt (Keanu Raves), helped him keep a cross in his puppet's memory. Jummy's killing is intimidating (without Samson, the whole situation is indifferent, and Lane asked why he did this because he said, "he was talking."), But they did not sob or scream, escape and Try to forget what happened, take their lives. In the case of Fake, he did not kill his girlfriend from hatred. We do not know why he killed him, but we see that Fack is not proud of his accomplishments. She is so sorry that she is sorry, and that her love her. From here we see different ways that we may be affected by death. In this film, it is easy for us to identify with teenagers, because they do not think, or how they feel about the death of their friend. Similarly, we do not know how to feel, listen to the audience, because we do not know jammy. We are obviously sad by death and realize that Shimson should be arrested, but we do not feel strongly like a person. <br /> <br /> There are many similarities between "river banks" and "twin peaks". (1990-1991), especially the overall feeling of the film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch are thinking about "River's Edge" while creating their series. Finally, Team Hunter gave instructions on three episodes of "Twin Pix". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Worried, there is an intense character in Lane that seems to be speedy. If you have seen the Crispin Glover in a film, you know that he can supply a line like another. It is always a treat to see it perform. Dennis Hooper, one of the great performers of "Reverse Edge". The character of Hyper, the character of "Blue Velvet" in the Daily Lynch, reminds me of Frank Booth's more nostril and more humorous version, a mortgage dealer mortgagee, who has one leg and one swollen sex doll "(1986) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
