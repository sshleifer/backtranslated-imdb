When it was shown at the Seattle Int'l Film Festival I was the only person standing and clapping and cheering. The rest of the crowd was left or silent. This is a well-liked short film that reaches deeply in the reality of humanity in a young gay man. It's about a real man; And do not play insipid hyper-buffed muscular "gay paositive" that passes for obscene gay movies (and why contemporary gay genre movies are so so stupid). This movie is an intense passion and great tragedy. Acting and guidance and cinematography are fantastic; It keeps all the film clastrophobic and tense and enthusiastic. Do not miss it if you can find it.
