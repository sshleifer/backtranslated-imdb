"Alone among us" is clearly one of the first season seasons. Although the story is somewhat confusing, it creates many mysteries, which are supported by the obscure synthesizer-powered soundtracks. This is usually an "Alien body attack" scenario, but ultimately a bad intention (my assistant chief engineer Singh's death was an accident for me). The two representative species provide a recreational frame (finally make up the best) eventually adding a little black laugh to the series (the final scene). Patrick Stewart evidently came out of a bit of his pickered character and discovered some new terrains that are performing data by presenting Sherlock Holmes as the classic one. Special effects also convincecing and the director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first person to try to compensate Trois due to lack of acting ability by improving his appearance. She looks beautiful in some scenes and improves her appearance a lot in her dress. Pickard's "playing scene" in the bridge gives him a little wind of the "War of Zedi" of Star Wars (which is a personal impression but I smile). <br /> <br /> Some of the games are playing in the light of the characters (simulating at night) and the first moving camera, while coming back from Picard, he is entering the transporter room in the cloud ... Excellent job. Glossy, creating continuous dialogue through different scenes (Toni's Hypnosis Report) really well-designed TNG episode impressions. The first one, where Wesley Crusha looks almost even tolerant ... <br /> <br /> The end is somewhat confusing, just as the producer time was about to end. The "P for Picard" is a little far fetched and its return is much easier, but it can go along with a lot of powerful moments to offer this episode ...
