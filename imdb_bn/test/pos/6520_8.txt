Dan Daily gives a hearty and colorful performance as the great DG Dean. His management of character is very true and the taste of Dean's background and limited education. Around the corner of DG Dins, the Central Films gained fame and their casual visit was too much for her grief as well as the injury she chose to ignore. Joanna Droo has portrayed his wife nicely, who lowered the girl to the world's standards, who loved and supported the ballplayer, who quickly rose to the "drawing height". As an athlete, D'vi's next career illustration is honest and unexpected, reflecting his poor education and his problems arising from both color and language in the air. Dizzy was quite a character and had daily breathing life into his story with commendable skill. If you enjoy this movie, I recommend the comedy of "Cod of Left Field" (1953), where daily dramas have been idolized by his little boy (Billy Chapin). Daily again fleshes a ballplayer in a completely satisfying manner. I sincerely recommend St. Louis's pride to baseball fans everywhere.
