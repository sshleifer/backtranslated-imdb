Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although this film can not be close to the quality of the TV show, it is still very funny and has some serious misconceptions! I saw Ali Zeey for the first time when I saw the material from the show. I think he is one of the best comedy characters of all time. Here are Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise with this picture is that they actually got some serious actors (Dance and Gamble) for it. To take this opportunity, I will respect them well. I have nothing bad to say about this movie, it's very funny. Very baby, but hey, so what? <br /> <br /> Another word is Mr. Giacale, please! <br /> <br /> **** *****
