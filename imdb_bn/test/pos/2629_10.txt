At least thirty years ago I saw this movie, and this is my greatest fan ever! This is not a classic - confusing plot, extraordinary character, mysterious and shocking packing ends (all set against the fantastic Monterey / Big Sur coastback retreat). Roy Thinens illustrates her true identity and portrayed the impressive character Johnny Brant of becoming more mysterious. Acting is great and trustworthy; Visitors are caught in the web which develops between the working spouse, the humiliated wife and the alluring newborn (the Thinins of the Brant). I searched a copy for years to buy - I think TV movies are not released on video, unfortunately. Great movie, you can find it, see it.
