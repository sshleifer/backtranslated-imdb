I like this movie but then again I'm a big craneberg fan. If you have not seen the movie of David Crownberg, then this is not a good place to start. Scanner, fly, rabid will work for it before starting it and then videodrome before verifying it. This must be one step beyond its seratom and interactive game phenomenon. <br /> <br /> In this game, players join their spine and add a biotechnology game pad through Jack and enter the game. Directly through their nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more without story and plot, but it is enough that it is a game in which you will not forget. It is full of cranberries' slim body work, dark-eyed scenes that are crowded by a great actor, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Will Duff, they find the situation very seriously. This person can illustrate the game and then what it can do to win it. There is no shortage of imagination or parts of his other films where you shrink the seat, but you do not look like you're in the automobile accident. If you like any of the movies mentioned above go all the way and get this one.
