Du Riefiff Chase Les Hammes is a great film that studies criminal minds and lets viewers better understand criminals who are not different from ordinary people like us. No director Jules Dasin shows that the criminal has a family and they care a lot for them. That is why they observe strict standards of honor. For them a family not only consists of wife, ownership and children, but also includes unexpected contacts and close friends. It is hard to believe that, in any case, Jils Dashin is not trying to glorify crime in his film because the rififfs make it clear that the crime never pays. It shows that all kinds of bad actions lead to harm to people. In addition to his philosophical positions, the riffef is valued for his technical expertise. One of the most brilliant sequences in the film about safe breaks, it would be difficult to believe in a criminal mind that their plan is in fine precision. There is no courage to make a copy of this scene in Hollywood.
