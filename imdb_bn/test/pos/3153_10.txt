I have broken my brain for another movie which reminds me of this. I could not really come up with one. I think this is because most of the movies taken on this issue (war, peace, violence) are in a specific documentary style. There are some terrific issues, all of them are well known to America's TM, I'm sure, but they are intended to bring your psychological response to the surface through informative and intellectual way. This DVD may seem more intelligent in some ways but it's not really that. It is a philosopher, perhaps, but it is a piece of music which bypasses the information modes and moves straight to the same place. It does not make you think but sometimes you even know why. You are just taking a wave somewhere on the feeling. When you see it, notice how well it is done together. It may not be for everyone, but it is for everyone who looks for a rare cinematic creation.
