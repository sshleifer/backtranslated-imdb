I'm not going for many "heist" comedies, and not for actors, when it was made, and when I did not say it first (only a few years later), I would not care about it. It's almost like "hopping" (though it is certainly less less serious comedy) - the mafia figure leads to his own abduction, rather it moves from one side to another. Of course, Rackel Welch did not play Duneave with a sharp character in the hatching, but it does not make any sexist film - he is playing really a stock character, almost his version of "Mole"! But, I was totally favorable - the first film I ever saw with him, and at the time I saw it, you can not see any of his posters. I think Robert Wagner was not really correct that the group's completely preferred or disadvantaged leader, such as Edward G. Robinson (naturally) and Vitoria de Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who is always driven to be fun.
