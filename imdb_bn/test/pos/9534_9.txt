It is enjoyable to watch random movies at random, that is, no one will ever hope or not know where the next epic movie will appear. Recently, the stapled classics I see have been shaped like "Raging Baul" or "Lost Ark Riders", but at this time my VCR took me away from the modern facilities and I was directly directed to Lionel Jefferies "The Railway in front of the Children". Children, a mysterious incident with their father, being transferred to England's open ground and finally trains only A skillfully managed film about the award received by waving in the first place. At first glance, this unexpectedly easy child movie does not seem optimistic because it has lost VHS rareness for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film one understands that it is simply More than the movie "Railway children" was created at such a time When purity is not just saying "no", when the family is meant to be everything and where adventure is ready for you around every railway track. It is much more than a comfortable movie, it is amazing cinematic tactic, it is a regular audience Keeps the screen together with inappropriate questions and to follow along with this 110-minute journey Keeps three perfect partners. "Railway Children" is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by family and film relatives alike. <br /> <br /> There are so many moments in the "Railway Children" that transform from mediator to excellence? One must have our three children; Bobby, Phyllis, and Peter. Modern films assure us that these three children can not provide enough dark, laughing and insight into the world around them, but Jeffrey's children prove otherwise. From intelligent spoken lines (both acting and script), for the sincere kindness and dedication of this little village, the final meeting of the train will stop all the way; These children are a big story ahead of only children, they are leading us with a reality, passion, provocation, and invisible by today's children. This small VHS has more imagination than being a film witness for years. In other movies, it was seen that Bobby's birthday scene was a favorite scene directed with generality. Jeffrey's way of filling him with guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing, our scenes kept our mind excited as well as with each scene. Another scene to attract my attention was when the children worked for the gift of Perseus, asking a person to give a gift, Jefferies simply said to her, "No, I will not." I do not like purse. " Children's reaction ridiculous ?? Giving moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout the round. Illustrated in the 1970s, this small feature gives a real smile to most modern comedies. It is a creative film that combines great dances and aspects. <br /> <br /> To say, as much as I liked this picture, it was not perfect. Jeffrey did a great job to guess what happened to our father, but the incident seemed to have happened, the children were kept in the dark and it suddenly solved themselves. Father could get more detailed information, strengthen his character, and give our children more opportunities to respond. Also, this movie has a scene, it is one of the grand scenes in the English countryside, which can only breathe, but seeing a little more you will see the car in the background. It shines me, but does not get much confused from the overall picture. This movie is rarely missed today, and weird, it seems that the British are only the goppons of its production. Movies like "Love, Actually" or "Dickie Vicker" show power and tension for community towns, where everyone knows everyone and we are not afraid to be neighbors. Is it more than a theme that American visitors can have more? Rather than knowing more about what is happening outside, instead of living outside of your own event <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the "children of railway". When I put it in the first VHS player, I did not know what I knew, but Jeffrey on the express train from the inaugural train set Perce's birthday proves that she can easily manage the child's friendly story. It was outstanding for the child actors to feel like real characters, lowering adults and to include children like adults. This is a movie which can be seen as a powerful alternative to Disney releases. Friendship of the constantly happening theme, mercy to strangers, and forgiveness and power through apologies to TV blasts. "Railway Children" is more than just a kids film; This is a feature that will be the main of the modern audience philosophy. It does not just give a great visual display for the English countryside, but it teaches (and shows) how big life will be to emphasize imagination and courage, instead of fighting against a CGI bad guy. <br /> <br /> Grade: **** Â½ out *****
