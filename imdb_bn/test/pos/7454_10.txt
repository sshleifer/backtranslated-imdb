"Duckman" is a great show. When I saw the 10-year-old and after school I returned home and started Comedy Central. I saw a cartoon called "Docmán" and I love it !! It's such a fun and cool show This is Klaski-Sipō, who is a great creator of cartoons. They have animated some of my favorite shows, such as "The Simpsons" and "Ragratts". <br /> <br /> I have seen many episodes of this show and I think they are all fun and sweet. Voice actors have done a great job in character voices. <br /> <br /> I want comedy Central to bring this critique back to "Critics" and "Dilbert". <br /> <br /> But it's a great comedy central show. Great work, Klasky-Csupo!
