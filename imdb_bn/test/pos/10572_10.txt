I recently saw this movie and fell in love with it. I like stories and actors. It's a little bit of everything. I was completely accepted by unfolding the story. It has many surprises along the way. I highly recommend it. Actually, I love so much that I bought the book and bought the book. I think I had to read it to praise the industry for writing in the back of the film. I was sure that I did not miss anything in the book, but dropped it from the movie. I recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is considerable difference in the book, especially in the second phase. It has become my favorite movie. I am now Sarah Waters and Yale Cassidy Fan !!
