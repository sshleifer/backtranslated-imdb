With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton leaned towards an important priority of American film: A continuation of Blockbuster. Three years after the most successful film of the year, "Batman" (1989), here comes the hero of Gotham City for the pleasure of many viewers here. Like his predecessor, "Batman Returns" enjoyed a great commercial success. Tim Burton again came back to Batman because it is believed that his enemy Zakir's next victory did little to improve Gotham City's image. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist, and here, the second word is composed by Max Shrek (Christopher Walken) and Penguin (Danny De Vito). The two crew interested in controlling Gotham City is going to make life difficult for Batman. <br/> Tim Burton has still done a lot of work in the scene and it seems that he tried to correct the first movie error. This means that the director has given way to fight better than the first cricketer. But he does not neglect his main character psychology for all that. In the 1989 film, Burton focused on Bruce Wayne / Batman's psychology, here it is a penguin that might be interested in him. The director tried to make him, very well, DeVito played with a vague character. On one hand, he has fulfilled the bad intention (quoted previously) but on the other hand, he is looking at his past and wants to be considered as a real man. <br /> <br /> "Batman Returns" is displayed as crazier than its predecessor, especially with cast. I think of Michael Pfeiffer who offers brave and strong performance as Catwoman. Also, when I write this review, it reminds me that a new version of Catwoman is currently in the movie. But bad reviews have been given (3 out of 10 in IMDB!), Sure that their actor will fall in disgrace in favor of Hell Berry Pfeiffer. Finally, this film is the best of 1992 and it is able to develop Team Burton's extraordinary style. We are still weird and find her taste for Gothic. Regarding other Batman adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. "Batman Forward" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not any good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was shooting at the beginning of Batman's story and was released next year. Does it match Team Burton's work?
