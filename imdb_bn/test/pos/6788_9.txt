My family watched over this movie. Even our 3 year old loves it. I like "love" in the movie. An infant is being given an opportunity ... absolutely voluntary greetings for some unconditional recognition. The movie gives a sense of luck and victory. Another aspect of the movie that made it attractive is the personality of Velvet's brothers and sisters. Bird lover Bug lover Boy lover! Very cute and happy movie. There is one thing, but it's annoying about. Mrs. Brown often sees Mr Brown as stupid or stupid. He, sometimes, comes as it knows all, and he is not as a dimwit, which he does. To put in such a beautiful story is very bad. Yet, we will enjoy this wonderful, old movie!
