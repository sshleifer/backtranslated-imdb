I'm talking about the series with young and stupid people, talking about their "problems", all about self-centered, annoying and absolutely annoying (popular: Dawson Creek; Beverly Hills; etc). "Hack" is a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, a trustworthy man with real problems (thanks !!) and a new air breathing with very good history. I love it !! I hope the "hack" will last for a long time, because it's a great television series for the people growing up for a change.
