Above all, there is a detective story: "Legitimate Defense" by Belgian Stenisse Andr√© Steyn, whose "I killed the A121" was transferred to the screen in 1942 with Culzat Pierre Fressen and the same actress Susie Delayer. About the adaptation of the closure for both films. The 1942 film was fantastic, but the "detective story" was kept aside, why is it being complained? As "Queen of Arms", Clujot was now in a new stage of his brilliant career. After becoming "le-crabie" and blacklisted, he used to say much more than simple hooddunts. Steiman originally complained about the end of poor detective, which I would not disclose, but Cluj has focused on his characters in social characters. Psychology, and he did not blame the non-Agatha Christi puzzle. In this way he became the true predecessor of Cloud Chabal, who always came closer to him than Alfred Hitchcock, whom he loved so much. Suzie Delayer has a great screen presence and she chooses the song she really greets (she was also a singer) "Evil boy Trolla". Bernard Blair, like before, is the gesture and the difference in terms of performance, and he really closes it. The two characters are particularly attractive and annoying: the first, the striped, the photographer: He depicts the pictures of the ladies model and the fine touch of Cluj, he has introduced us as a lesbian. Of course, the word was never called in 1947?) The police chief (Fantastic Louis Jouvette) told him: "You and me, we are not lucky with women." The portrait of this police is very detailed: we learn a lot about him, not necessarily with the Delier / Blair Plot: He is a widow, with a son, and especially geometry that issues problems in school. So we can deeply find all the letters. The most important announcement of the French film after the war.
