We are all and have played Sokom and GTA and race etc. But none of them can stand up to GE007. The game itself is great. I have literally burned out my N64 playing this great game, along with Zelda OOT. This game alone created the essential mold for all the modern cast. That's great on top multi players. Story mode itself is worth a hundred times and more playing. This is a great game for your board and you just want to shoot some people and there is an endless unlock. (Cheats, Aztec, Egyptian, God knows how many multiplayer cherries, and three problems, as well as the famous '007' difficulties are our modern game cool but when you sit and play this game you will get a certain feeling that some games and new shooting games online With skill we rarely see two of these deaths match-style and when we are not as good as these games, You become bored of the story, the endless mysteries, and take advantage of glitches and found the Easter eggs. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the greatest shooting games.
