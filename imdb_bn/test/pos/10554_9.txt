My father's hero is sweet, funny and cute. Gerard Depardieu Andrey, a divorced father, who took his 14-year-old daughter Nicole (Catherine Higel) to the Caribbean for a vacation. There he met his daughter named Ben, Dalton James. André is her boyfriend and her father is in prison for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and she ran with her pump. Everyone on the island is soon under the impression that Andrea is a child mullah. André in both relations. One with Isabella (Emma Thompson, who made a cameo at the end of the film) and Diana (Faith Prince from Spin City). My father received a lot of fun moments. When he is playing talent and everyone wants to play him, he plays "Thanksgiving for the little girls" from Gigi. Everyone hates and leaves. My father is not eligible for Hero 5.1. I think it's a 9.0.
