I'm surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this TV. Film ... As far as I'm aware, the series itself, followed by a huge, was similar to critics pundits and real people, a person appreciated it. However, I will tell you directly that if you are like me, you are not hungry for police police plays, you will love the "Prime Soul" series "The Lost Child" tennison, heroin. Founding male police, getting a relatively strong position in the police sequence across the series, in its presence, with hard work, cruelty and low talent for police work. She, essentially, is an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and certainly no people hate. Unfortunately his relationships are affected by the evil hour, which demands his career and he has never married, so when he thinks of being pregnant with his last relationship, he has to face the choice of his mother and risks his entire police job, Let alone progress in the future, or having an abortion - which he opts for. This abortion is never bigger in the upcoming drama - it is dealt with very efficiently, less than a few minutes, the amazing scripting economy and performance - but it is always there, as a reflection of the great efforts of tennis to find another "lost children" - a kidnapping victim - Before it's too late. The story takes a lot of twists and turns before the wonderful ending, and an impressive, similarly, plot and characters (though I have found a lot of villains in a lot), the police, and especially the tennisians themselves, is not always the series, which is realistic. , That miracle underworld must do the unexpected task, or the favorite thing to do <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More movies in Syria, however, he has always played the role of tennis, the series itself acts as an "act of evidence" - such as the Dick Wolf's American "law and order" - whoever comes there, everyone can go to forever. As my sincere hope.
