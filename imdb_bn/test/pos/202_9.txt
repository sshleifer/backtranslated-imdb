In Moscow, young couple Veronica (T. Samoslavova) and Boris (Alexey Bottlov) fall in love with each other deeply. With the Second World War, the Boris volunteers were sent in the army and sent before Veronica's birthday the day and there was no chance of them to say goodbye to each other. Waiting for the news from Boris, Berice's cousin Mark (A.Surin) Veronica was raped and they married each other. However, Veronica does not forget Boris, and is waiting for him. <br /> <br /> "Liteat Junurvali" is an impressive and heartfelt romance during the war. The direction is excellent and using the ellipses along with the stories, in the capital when the capital is raped by the Veronica Mark. The camera-work is amazing, with amazing, sophisticated aircraft and angles and long journeys. Verronika scenes in the middle of the tanks, or visible on the train station with many structures. The great movie is highlighted by the DVD retrieved pictures. T. Samoslovako is an extremely beautiful face, and has a touch and sensitive performance. The last scene made another big example of an anti-war film. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Quando Bomba Sigonhas" ("Fly Star while")
