After the death of White CEO, this film, created at the height of the Black Power Movement, depicts City Corporation's chief executive officer African-American Putney Swape (Arnold Johnson). (The white executives can not define everyone who hates each other and who can succeed. Previous CEO). Once in power, he decided to launch it in a militant organization. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Robert Doney did this, but he did it! "Putin Swape" is the ultimate test of America's power structure. This is something that seems to come out of Richard's love mind. This is a comedy classic in every sense of the word. A real masterpiece extremely happy.
