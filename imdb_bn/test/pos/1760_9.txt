Flasher's Leslie Karbagger is an excellent book full of Flasher's full animation unit in Florida and a complete story about the next ejection of the paramount. <br /> <br /> The city of buggy to town did not destroy the credit of animation pioneers with the paramount, though it often said so, and it was a favorite version of Paramount's story. According to Karbagar, big studios wanted to get their mites in animation studio and completely removed the image of the annoying brothers. Mr. Bugs just give them pretext to do this. - The tragic end of a great playful, innovative chapter in American animation. <br /> <br /> I wanted to comment that the film was originally started on December 4, 1941, in New Delhi on 7 December. It was probably closed, however, this strategy was successfully enough for hacking in terms of national mood. But another part of this annoying little picture legend was that it died because of the tragedy of the theater, Dumbo (released on October 23, 1941) at the same time is still trading on acute holidays. I did not complete the research in the number of box office, but I would say that the presence of Dumbo co-operative in the theater is probably Mr. Bugs have been affected. The film was high during this time, and the successful film could be strong in the theater for months. - These are generally short runs, some unimaginable in fast-to-DVD days.
