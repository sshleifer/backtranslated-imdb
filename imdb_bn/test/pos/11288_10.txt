I would like to publish this review that I really have no idea about "purple". I really know that God killed himself at the beginning, then Mother emptied the Earth, who came forward to control himself with the semen of God. Then he got a son. The rest is quite intelligent, and you have to explain it in your own way. <br /> <br /> How do I like to explain this movie; God Himself killed himself in the beginning of the scientific revolution, when people started questioning the doctrines imposed by the Church, such as the geological aspect of the universe, etc. Mother Earth began to think of herself for the people and refused the church "This is because God said" Opinion Tribal folks were in the church lashing over them, trying to apply the force of Christianity down their throats. I'm not sure the son of the world matches all these things. Mother earth and tribal people started to fight against her, so she might represent somebody's independence or something of that influence. <br /> <br /> What does the final part of this movie mean? . The meaning of the motherland and the world's son divided by rape, rape, and mortar and pastel may mean money, but here the film is fun; You can explain in any way you want. It does not have to be a precise meaning, you can pretend your mind. Sometimes you do not even know what you are looking for because it is shot in a strange corner or it is very vague. <br /> <br /> The only one who disappointed me was that I really hope terrible film. I was thinking that I will call the "seven days" warning immediately via phone. I got pleasantly different. It was not all terrible, but it stirred my imagination. Trying to explain the film's cryptic message was a creative challenge. There were actually many scenes that were beautiful. After birth, mother's mother comes to mind the final shot of earth and forest path. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say that I enjoyed this picture perfectly. It's the most abstract movie I've ever seen, but that's not a bad thing.
