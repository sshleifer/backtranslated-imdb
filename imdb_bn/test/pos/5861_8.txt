"Counting by Count" Rank Gosling and Michael Pitt starred like two rebel high schools of perfect kill material to withdraw their isolated self-respect. The heroic thorn drama on their plan as Sandra Bullock Ditt. Cassie Mayweather. This is not near the mystery of traditional finger-guided murder because this image has exposed the killers to us (bathing and peat). Instead, the film focuses attention on their killing and focuses on what they have to do to kill them perfect. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < This is centralizing the causes behind violent killings, although it will bother you with your cool dialogue (especially from curious boys), but it does not fully invent their innovation in the cause of the killings. Writing characters are handsome to you rich child Richard (Ryan Gosling) and the intelligent but socially awful Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they respect each other and even express their views on the name of the classmate Lisa (Agnes Braukner), but they close down the school and assist in a program that escapes the release of the killings mind. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story involving the boys seems exciting, but it also gets pushed into the background of a hypocrite in connection with the detectors. The maiders (bullies) who felt their murder were due to discrimination (hence the gorgeous appearance of glossing) and undefined characteristics, but it is managed to manage properly. Initially, audiences may hate headlines and Casey's character without being very helpful. He showed influence and control over his junior partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Although he tried to reason with him, he knew that this is a war that he certainly would not win. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This side-story has no part in this film because it does not offer anything with the original plot (boys' assassination). It also provides some development of Bullock's character in the film, but it is only semi-skilled work and not very full. If they had stories with scary students, I would have liked it. Perfect crime foil, creative schemes for their boys lie with their playful proofs and are right in front of them to get out of possible life negotiations in prison. <br /> <br /> Despite the looted sub-plot and the "real murderer" that is not endless, "Murdier by Numbers" gives a strong performance through a great cast. Sandra Bullock tries to shift her sincere pain to a more positive light, which was firmly convinced as bald police. Ben Chaplin demonstrates his power, which is a young detective who tries every way to understand his partner and is able to stop torturing him occasionally. But the smugglers of the scene are Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling's two satans. They keep you in their seat waiting for what they're going to do next. The chemistry of boys "meritorious Mr. Ripley" makes Matt Damon-Jude Law a memorable one.
