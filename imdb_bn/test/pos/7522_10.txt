Anyone who has spent time in the hospital or medical facility, he has appreciated this movie. The plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from the beginning to the end. Acting fantastic George C Scott is a bright doctor but husband of a class A failure, father. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol in the 1960s and 1970s (The Avengers), protects herself from her. The surrounding slopes are fantastic and the dialogue is quite entertaining. I think I enjoyed the 4th, 5th movie to watch. Or 6th. Since the time I caught a lot of conversation that interplay and character interplay. Good and worth seeing again. You just do not want to check in a nearby hospital in the near future.
