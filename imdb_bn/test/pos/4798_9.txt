This movie is an interesting example of telling the story of Luis Bonuil. This is a comedy which is not a comedy and is a social drama that is not social drama. Although I do not think it was particularly fun, it made me laugh. Also, you can not take Bonuel very seriously, the film thinks about religion and its importance in some people's lives. Bunuwel tells the story of a Catholic priest, like someone else was not loyal to his beliefs and the audience was told that what would happen if the priest's disobedience was promised to serve others. Naturally, Bunuel's mission is Catholicism, but I do not think he tried to laugh at the church, as he often did. At least I did not accept this organization as fun. I think in today's modern society, he is trying to create an interesting point about how religion can be relieved. Because the belief in yourself is not bad, but people can always undermine the idea. On one hand, I think it's one of the most tricky things of Bunuela. Fantastic as Francisco Ronald the priest. Certainly, one of the best filmmakers movies.
