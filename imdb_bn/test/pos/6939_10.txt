In 1973, Reggie Whithers said that the government was elected for three years, until Liberals were determined to force labor to vote until they were defeated. If you ask me, it is described in the documentary, but anyone who works properly fails to accept Australian Liberal Party's self-service and expensive tactics. The series itself, though I was a poor Whitlam in Max Phips, his voice was very ghostly. Also, the main political players on both sides should have been used more, although it may be a reflection of budgetary barriers from time to time. Yet, I recommend it with caution.
