One VV Brit Rome-less, if you can get your hand in a copy. Quirky and often surprisingly, this is Brady's film best (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is far the funniest), although it has a unique charm. The story of the good story has been slaughtered on some dead ends but most of the new plots are on the higher page. You know how it will end from the beginning, but when it comes, it's honest and very open, a realistic and credible ending, at the beginning of the end, enjoyable and give me more if you want.
