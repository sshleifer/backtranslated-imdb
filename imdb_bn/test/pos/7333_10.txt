This is one of a very few movies with awesome acting, wonderful story lines and suitable for watching. It's about change in life Happiness is found when one tells the truth to himself. It is about taking on myself and others. It's about life's challenge. It's about coming to the word with reality. It's about courage. It's about love Their role in the actress is very true. The actresses had very good chemistry among actresses in each other. The movie is the key to this movie. It is rare to see an independent movie like this. Someone can say that the film crew had to work harder during the film's creation. I want to watch more movies from this producer / writer. Watch the movie, you like it.
