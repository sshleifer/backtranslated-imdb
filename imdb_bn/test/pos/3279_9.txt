Thanks to Mario Van Pibles for not just telling the existence of black cowboys, but a compulsory story that was easy to follow. <br /> <br /> Plots, backdrop, music and genius were all top notchs. You used so much African-American artists to tell the story of the black cowboy. Billy Zane was good at this movie. Did he ever play a good guy? <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to expand their thinking. It's a great movie and I've enjoyed the privilege of seeing it. Hopefully, you will feel the same.
