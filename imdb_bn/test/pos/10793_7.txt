I want to be interested in movies that love to overcome the barriers to censorship and express how they want to express. Barry's Eric Bogosian's character is like Howard Starren, but more intelligent. The character itself is very impressive. As an Oliver Stone film, I guess I was more expected. Picture sags a bit of time while working third. Plus, it is quite clear that "Talk Radio" is based on a game with its long dialogue scenes. But overall, the film works. Bogosian is great for leadership, and he wrote the film based on the film he wrote. If you want to check out one of Stone's larger movies, I better recommend checking out "JFK" or "Salvador". This is not his best work, yet a good movie.
