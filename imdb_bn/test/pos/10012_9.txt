My wife is a mental health therapist and we saw it from the beginning to the end. I usually can not stand people and chick flicks, but this movie is incredible. If you want to see it for someone who is going through this kind of struggle but this is a movie for you. I saw it and I felt sorry for myself and others like him. <br /> *** *** Spiler *** Plus, all the people of the movie, including the psychological organization, make real people more real in real life. <br /> <br> Nobody will see mental health profession!
