It is a very entertaining drama hymn with a nice cast. Garfield is a great criminal who is hiding from the police that the modli crew is dead and kidnapped. The most notable of these are Billy Holop, who is a very busy moments. Gloria Dixon, who lives in a house in real life, died at a very young age, is strong and very attractive as sister of Haloops and one of the early scenes of Anne Sheridan on the edge of the stardom, a knockout. Robson is very funny as a vicious old granny, but Cloud Reneces here proves that the wrong actor (who is thinking of throwing him in New York as a tough cop)? Burberry Berkeley proves that he was a good director with or without a musical number. The film comes in a tremendous pace and the order of the water tower is very mysterious and well illustrated. Finish has been adopted, and the plot is not surprising or original, but I still find it a very enjoyable experience.
