The Black Day Blue Night was actually better modern silent. Three youths pray from their respective living in a middle of a desert, on a road trip (like most modern silent). A woman sees that her husband is cheating on her and after finding her in a hotel room, she starts her head down and starts again. Curiously, she travels with her husband's ownership, who is forgiving that Slabberg did not tell her to marry her. And together, while driving during the wave rains, they hid a third, very mysterious youngster and hiding it secretly. Although they are sticky and free and suspicious of each other, the police have identified their death suspects. <br /> <br /> Black Day Blue Knight starts immediately with the collision and throws it into one of the best tweets with most of its twists in order to lead a confusion of one's character in front of each other, to a very extraordinary finish. That is to say, the film starts with the clash of action immediately and once you solve the story, you immediately enter another base of the plot, expressing something more than your expectations before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, some visitors wrote that the end is a little confusing and somewhat downgraded. If the killer is not expecting you immediately and once released, instead of being a little confusing, a harmful flashback reveals the purpose of solving the mystery. But actually, there is a finale out there, which I think is the most interesting of the movie. Because modern silent people always involve a circle of criminal suspects, almost always blaming them all, this is a section that always involves money. And in this way the question is always in these movies - how much money are you willing to go for? <br /> <br /> If you like this genre of modern film silent, I am the Red Rock West (also the jetty Walsh in the desert and some are on the blast)!
