There is nothing new anywhere but nothing new here, but both of the main actors have made it valuable by seeing the excellent performance. For Sarandon and Portman to find a better life, a mother and daughter who moved from rural Wisconsin to senior Beverly Hills, California. The original conflict came from the fact that Natalie lived with her friends and family in Wisconsin, and she felt that she was forced to go to California with her natural mother. Although spoilers are true, although the whole film is frustrating predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially the Natalie Portman have performed such performance that they often consider the material to be new. There is no cover anywhere but there is no new place cover, but there is a rare quality to make extra use interesting again. Also, in this movie, several times heartfelt facial expression can be seen, when Natalie portmantean faces her mother leaving him on the road and throwing the car in a distance. Especially notable, the documentary's mother also became an actress, as well as a very credible performance from Shawl Hautosi, one of Natalina's close intimate cousins. His death is often a tragedy seen in such movies, but the rest of the film creates such weaknesses. Not great, but there is certainly an appearance value of anywhere but here.
