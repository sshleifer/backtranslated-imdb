I checked the soldiers and soldiers (not just pilots) in 1932 after fleeing from Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion and fought against them abroad, our heroes and great men in our history. Director of the Academy Award winner "Koala" (1996), this film is a tribute to these men. This is the first major screen film about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers from "Negasty Jajdesi" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, beautiful music etc. The film is about half of English and some actress Britannia. But the greatest thing about this movie is that it exists pure. It is a great opportunity to show all the people around the world (and to many people in the Czech Republic ...) that the role of Chesslawk worldwide is not only an affiliate country, but an active member of the affiliate operations. <br /> <br /> The leading characters are old and wise Frantisek and young Karel. They have been gathered from Czechoslovakia, they are flying in the same squadron and they fall in love with the same woman ... maybe it's a cliche, but fortunately the story is not so aggressive and there is a good balance with other scenes (with great dogfights). I do not want to compare "dark blue world" with "Pearl Harbor", some would prefer PH and someone would like DBW. But if you like the end of the happy, but the DWW is not for you. So, I think this is a very good movie for everyone who likes these stories and very good movies, who want to know about this section of the Czechoslovakian history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " ..
