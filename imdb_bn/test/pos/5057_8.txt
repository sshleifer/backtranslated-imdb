This is a great tribute to anyone who has gone through this kind of pain and pain. Acting was not the best, but I would admit it, but it was enthusiastic about its message, except for any such attorney or some kind of trial that sent people to prison, cruel and abnormal. Even Saddam had a severe trial against them, so why not every suspect is justified or fair trial or justified in the first place? I'm stopping the movie, but I think it's a good idea to think about this sick, broken concept of government. The story of the story and backstory movie was a great mystery. The whole movie, I was trying to connect the girl with a plot and it finally made it very clear. There was no doubt that the command was incredible, but the one thing that I cared was not that much emphasis was on the interest of the character of Reese Witherspoon and fighting with the ideology that he had taken, many players. Otherwise it was actually quite entertaining and in most cases I played it for two hours.
