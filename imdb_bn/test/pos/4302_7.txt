This is a well-directed Colombo episode, with some good character, but the story does not know enough about interest and it is not seen in people as well as in a Colombo movie. His uncle was also killed for plotting this killer. It seems quite simple and well thought out. Perhaps the film did not really take itself seriously, because the atmosphere of the film is mostly the light. At least when compared to different Columbu movies. <br /> <br /> For example, the film highlights mostly humorous relief, which mostly comes from Colombo character. It makes an enjoyable one to enjoy the movie, but it gives you a feeling of overdoding over it, it is not compatible with most other Colombian movies. <br /> <br /> letter is good and it helps Martin Landau in a double role. It still sounds funny how he was still very young like a young man, for example, a person like Peter Falkle did not make any changes in the years, he just became gray. Among the others, this film features Julie Niemer, who is best known for playing Catwoman in the "Life of the Batman" series, it is still funny that he is moving like Catwoman in this movie, deliberately or is it his way of acting? <br /> <br /> It's an enjoyable and good to watch the Colombo film but it might make you feel better that it was a great idea with a good idea script. <br /> <br /> 7/10
