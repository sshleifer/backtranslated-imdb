In fact, the only way to understand and relate the characters of this movie is to experience your own situation. To many people, this picture is almost a mock-biography, snapshot of our life one weekend. (I did about 85 percent of the film in this movie and saw 15 percent more, usually the same weekend) for my and others I know that it is good to see the film again because apart from some pictures of people's memories and the nights which we feel like patch and blues, this The film is a part of our generation "Studio 54", a piece to add to our scrapbooks and laugh . Personally I've enjoyed those days, but it is very nice to see this movie and "I remember ........." Thanks to Justin, thanks to this shocking life on a weekend of my life.
