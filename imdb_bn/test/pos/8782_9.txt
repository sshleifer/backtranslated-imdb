Ah, hitchcock! It is not hard to find the film of Hitachi until it disappears after the Beads (1963) and prove the point of the sutteeu. For many years, praising most of this director's work, I could probably lead from Priscilla Lane and Robert Siemens' lack of interest. After seeing this again in Film Streetscape, I was familiar with the Statue of Liberty Climax but I mistakenly assumed that its story could not hold my interest. I was wrong! The bad guy Sabotu and the Good Guy encounter a scam in the wrongly acclaimed heroes by cooking the suspicious plot on the right, and zooming through a series of more opportunities and narrow escape. All of the known Hitkocian elements have: innocent person wrongly accused an offense; People do not seem to be like they; Dramatic or unlikely location that is played in suspicious scenes (an airplane hangar, a farm, a bridge that throws herself into a handcuffed hero to flee the police, a devotee's charity ball in a palace palace, a top-floor summer, and finally the Statue of Liberty Its torch). <br /> <br /> Sunny in the backing of the whole players, the first of the WW2's Vintage social comment, in the warmth of the people, where people find it in people's trouble. Lend a hand to help a fellow human, not getting anything back ?? In short, the main part of Hitkoc was always a basic humanity, but tremendously trends - an exciting cast of players' support, mainly like the Slide Villain of Otto Kruger George Sanders (his Broadway credits included male leadership of the male quad). And all say it) and the lady named Norman Lloyd not to mention the saboteur, Alma Krueger ?? No relation to auto ?? As a distinguished society donor involved in the fifth column conspiracy (Claude Renees' mother's note in her character's forecasts). Priscilla Lane does a fine job with a solid role. We can not tell whether or not we believe Hero to be innocent or guilty for his early scenes, and he feels that he is not fully coming from his side until the case is delayed. No one can confirm whether his acting is wrong, or can not be sure whether it will be in uncertainty, but the development of the plot is so fast, funny and clever that we do not care about what he thinks. <br /> <> There is no touch with the hits of Brahmaputra which have nothing to do with the plot. Lane character break twice to get changes for a quarter ?? Once again give her kidnapper back to an ice cream soda and make a call from the phone booth again. Someone's idea of ​​why these scenes have been inserted, perhaps considering the movie more realistic and thus enhancing credibility and suspicion? Or does the listener give him a moment to catch his breath? Are some characters on top ?? Miraculous truck drivers, unimportant types of faith and faith blind people cunningly maintain forest cabin, philosophy of political philosophy, spots "human skeleton" and other members of the circus caravan who hide the character from their followers.
