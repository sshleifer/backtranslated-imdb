Oooohoh people were satisfied that I did not miss this. I did not particularly like a particular recent movie I wanted to post this review as this episode. It pays the true respect to the game DOOM. Its plot is different, and the characters must be set in a completely different universe (perhaps in the universe of the universe), but it seems that motion, references and position are perfect. And for all the original dive fans heard the door open and close to the effect of the sound, it was icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Please do check out this one, all doctors and dual fans alike. This is a jewel!
