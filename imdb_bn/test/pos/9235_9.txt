This movie proves that you do not need a Hollywood budget to have some fun to show. How stuck with me was able to unite the crew from different places with a promise because they believed it. I think those who make less budget films may be related to some scenes such as actors who can not get this line, being disturbed by the police, and most crew disappeared after the first week. Anyone crossing the cross country and spent long time was spending money saying this for a lot. After selling Stueware's personal property, use your own money, and trash his house to create the movie. I was a little surprised and wondered how much his wife might have visited. All good work
