So far Miguel Bardem's career is one of the most horrific of recent Spanish movies. She did nothing ... until now. "Inacoots" has been pretty surprised: this is a serious movie, a great cast and a very entertaining film, a serious movie. <br /> <br /> The Rubbing Art, What Is It "Inkoots" David Mamet's "Game House" and a lot of similar stuff are a film. There are thousands of twists in the script, and a story where it does not seem to be. <br /> <br /> The weakest point in the latest Burdem movie can be so American language, which seems to be a bit of an irrelevant character. Especially in Victoria Abril She is a hell of the actress, but "incautos" shows little emphasis on something). Ernesto Alterio is not bad, but his father is not half as good ... and what is Luppe? Well, that man. <br /> <br /> Short: A good movie. Miguel has never been the best ever. I hope this is the start of a new study in its career. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
