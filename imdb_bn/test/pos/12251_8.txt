This is a love story set against the fall of television news. Three main stars, William Hart, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, created a love triangle while working on the Washington Bureau of a TV network. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Be a star. Jane (Hunter) producer who acknowledged that Tom is a lack of intellectuals to become genuine journalists, but only for him. Oran Altman (Brooks), a journalist who shares his belief in psychical criteria who truly love him. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter was nominated for Best Actress Academy Award, but Cher (Monstrak!) was lost. This Hunter's film. Its character Jane, smart ruthless and fully driven. She is too neurotic. Its performance is perfect. Just watch his face when he watched the interview of a radio victim of Tom's tape. <br/> William Hart's performance is less favorable. He is well aware of a man that he is Hibbos and fraud, but with sufficient expertise he is informed that his rise will be supported by people like Jane. He gave very little to the accounting person. <br /> <br /> This picture comments on commercial pressures in celebrity, journalism, honesty and media media, which is the last row. It has been predicted that the news will be down, due to commercial pressure, it will gradually decrease. Think about this: This movie was released before the end of the Cold War and before the launch of reality TV. Nevertheless, the news predicted reduction. Paris Hilton was a big news story released from prison! To see how much of this movie is predictable, just look at your evening news and note set, graphics and presenters. Tom Greenik and his clones are good and true!
