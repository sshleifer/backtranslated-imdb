I am surprised at the questions and questions raised in this documentary review here, especially because they are really interesting questions. Of course, those who can be best known for it will be film makers. However, I think I can highlight some of the issues that I think, which I think, the purpose of the film, what it is and what it is trying to reveal. What's the message after all? Very prone to hinting, I would say that the filmmakers have an intention. They are trying to tell a story, extract its meaning and get across a point. Keeping this in mind, we can shoot many critical points, especially for those who are trying to show the filmmakers really, against the expectations of the people. Reasons for violence and violence? The film is not about that. Is it "Brazilian audience not enlightened" about Brazilian Fawlaus? Well, who wanted to do this? Afro reggae this or with whose help? It does not matter in this context. Is not the film enough woman for your taste? It's not about equality or feminism. Every little detail about Anderson's life, mother, son, family and all aspects of the movement and activities of the Afrogeny movement? Well, it does not matter because it does not matter. There can be a story before it can not be a film, there are only so many lengths. The authors are looking at everything to look at everything, they instead have to make a 6-month TV series. If you expect all of these, you take the film to the wrong path. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually about two people who started a movement. Two people full of ideals. Two people thirsty for change. Two people are trying to do something about all the wrongdoings around them. The person who went below the rock and wanted to get back Finding the purpose of life, building inspiration from suffering, changing luck and becoming something else than what they are going to happen - criminals and drug dealers. This is not about the success and hope of the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although it is an integral part of which is always surrounded by letters. Unexpectedly and without any reason, the film focuses much more on Anderson's course in life's problems. That is why they faced Anderson's accident when they shot this picture. I'm not sure about this, but they can even consider the ending of the film seriously, which loses all efforts to spend. But Anderson wanted to move forward. And so they suddenly took the risk of maintaining a movie with an identity crisis, obviously considering the change, but earned the opportunity to show someone facing such a devastating incident. It's very clear for visitors to start about AfroReggae and find out about that wind in Anderson. It is very unique in this sense (story line transfer). Maybe their only sin does not clearly express it, which can initially fulfill the expectations that are incomplete. <br /> <br /> As the importance or section of Anderson, I do not want to say that everyone wants to change the world, complete all the violence, feed all the hungry, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be known as Mother Teresa, or other famous personalities Known as. Like anyone else, trying to transform his own hard life, raising the problem of the children, dealing with permanent injuries or the disease, and even managing the bill, inspiring and attracting is much easier. Month end To understand the film, you should try to understand the fact that you have to go behind the past to engage in drug and crime, be prepared for it and not let others go to the same annoying path. Although you can criticize the way you choose to do this, you can not deny their motives by suspecting the ideology of the method. Also, there may be an idea of ​​Anderson or a particular person, partly to do something with this picture that the filmmakers have become very involved in the life of their character. Being friends with them as much as possible There is no way that the entire film can not be printed with Anderson's more favorable illumination. If a dear friend is paralyzed in an accident, it is not just a fact, you make a big deal from it. And this is not necessarily bad. They are not so much that they use it as "selected person", as much as they try to show them as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration with greater length. Do not conclude that this document is for the view of poverty and the reality of the crime, and much more, look for an inspirational story. <br /> <br /> Nike-Ad-Like? Just amazing and professionally created by me and is not affected or frustrated by the film's motives. Kalpamadadi? If you want to guess on its credentials as a documentary, but why is it not supposed to cause feedback and inspiration? Trying to improve the lives of people through music and dance - what are they trying to do - romanticize their own reality? Forgive me, but only ordinary events show what journalists do and you can watch it on TV every night. <br /> <br /> If I want to be a filmmaker, my first movie will also be this great.
