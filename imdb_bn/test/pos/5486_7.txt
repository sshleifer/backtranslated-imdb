'In the Line of Fire' tells the story of a former President's bodyguard and psychology between former government assassins. Secret Service Agent / Bodyguard (Eastwood) Defense and Killer (Malkovich) are on the charge. The reward? President's Live. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... how many times have I seen it on TV and recently bought it on DVD. Yet, this is not a great movie. The plot is very slim way and it is thick rudderless attempt to thicken thick. The whole love story is not very appreciated and the way they have brought an extra character in the story, it is only able to stop it offensive or insulting less intelligent viewers. Although I think these mistakes can not be forgiven, I can easily see Mr. Malkovic in their extraordinary performance. I always think of him as a great actor, but in this film he really is in the fire. There's a reason he's got an Academy Award nomination. Ren Rousseau and Clint Eastwood are fine, but I do not think their performance is memorable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not a nice piece, but John Malkovich is really awesome and I do not think anyone can enjoy his performance. Watch really worth ...
