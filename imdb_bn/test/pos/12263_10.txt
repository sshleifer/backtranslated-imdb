I say sadly because now if you see this film then you realize how low our media - all the warning signs of this movie <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I think the last James Brooks movie, but others may disagree. It's a rich character (which is as trustworthy), great acting, great writing, and even though the music got a little chess, I like it too. <br /> <br /> William's heart was never good. Holly Hunter is stunning And Albert Brooks goes away with each of his scenes - the human triangle is beautifully drawn and compelling, and the whole film is on its important and important issues and how it is being compromised slowly in our country. <br /> <br /> Watch this really fun and horrible evening network.
