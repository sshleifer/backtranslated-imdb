Seth McFarlen is a true genius. <br /> <br /> There is no meaningful comment for those who think of their offending social or cultural issues, they can create 'crime' only, a program that has been created for them is diverse, culturally sharp and neutral. Look at this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter (Stem cells coming out of the lab): How long have I been there? // Guard: Five minutes. // Peter: Why are not we paying this? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
