A very unique movie in the work of Wagon Master John Ford. Mainly because it is based on John Ford himself written story, the story described by Frank Nugent and the son of the director ?? Patrick Ford and transformed into a platclave and due to the director's personal opinion, Wagon Master told John Ford, "I was closer to what I wanted to achieve", nothing to say, but Ford once recognized Lindsay Anderson, his beloved still my Darling Clementine and none else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wonderful cast deliver its best, you do not have any big star other than most 'Fordian' of all actors ?? Ben Johnson. Very shiny small letters, who provide a compulsory comic relief, and the wagon master blow horny lions (Jane Darwell) into their shot, but many like Giggs inspired. Stagecoach, my Darling Charmetin, Fort Apechy and he wore a yellow ribbon, after that, with John Ford's fifth end, but at least not in the legendary monument Valley. <br /> <br /> The film starts with two friends, Trophy Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Wines (Harry Carey Junior) who are being appointed as a wagon master or guide for a caravan of Magnus Busy, who move on to the Silver Valley, For a promised land. They told two beautiful women on their way. Join Loxley Hall (Allan Mobile), who supposedly called his wife and daughter and actors themselves.
