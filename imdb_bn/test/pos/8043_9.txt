How to create a great international thriller is a strict, disciplined, and well-known old school version. A CIA campaigner and his Israeli opponent, Amos (Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi", "Sexy"), is known as "Carlos the Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "without limitless", "Space Cowboys") Beast ") is a great naval officer, Annebele Ramirez (Eden Quinn," Heart of Music "), Carlos, and is a real Carlos of KGB using bold plots. To use ya, he suggested to the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belonged to the queen here, who himself here (a dual role). Director Christian Duguie and cineographer David Franco gave Hitcochian-like suspense and another great resource for the film with the world's best sights.
