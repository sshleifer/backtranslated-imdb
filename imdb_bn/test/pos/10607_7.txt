If you have ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know that they are more than most movies because of multiple songs and dance routines (mostly over five minutes). Fortunately, this has a low lyrics and dance routines and "quality" fits into the length of the movie. Do not make me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but go ahead with songs and dances. I bought this DVD because I'm Ian Boehan Fan. Although his role was not as large, his screen time was still there. And his character was much different than his other role. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good movie. Like most Bollywood movies, at least one debate / conflict of traditional Indian culture. But true love over calamity was victorious and happy ending was all there.
