This image is not your ideal Hollywood, even though Piking is so bad, I often get away from movies as frustrated. However, this little low budget jewel is thoroughly loving and enjoyable and of course a champion. The actors are diverse like their character, the Buffalo setting is charming (a beautiful city), and the story is shining. Uncertain violence, gender and lack of "f" words are at least frustrating! Take the kids, get grandmother, break from Hollywood! I out of 10 out of it 10!
