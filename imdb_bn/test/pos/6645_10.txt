The first story is not so easy that many critics insisted, it is actually a very complicated story, like other Bergman films that focus more attention on character research. We have two main characters in Scamman, but we have been thrown in the middle of the war, we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open for any resolution. It creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful. With the publication of the story, we have become familiar with many characters, which become the symbol of humanity in both dark and colorful aspects. An example of our neutral followers for the trial of the innocent war criminals, who is a violent doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole movie, dangerous people who try to make the best of catastrophe, the incident (character of the Bj√∂rnstadr), the innocent child, the unnamed figures often Boat has turned into animals Second Each of them is seen by John (von Saido) and Eva (Uleman) eyes, their characters are more restricted to other Beginn films (N Passion) and this is just the reason that the story is important here, external events have the power to change the human nature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is: the meaning of art and meaning of life, the next is nothing more than a game that includes all the plays. But what about war? And especially annihilating ones of XX'th century. In Persona, the only real passion of Uleman's character when he was a victim of the Vietnam War, he became a human torch. That idea in Skammen is to expand a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of the war. An unnamed region of an unnamed region (we only consider it to be voluntary), two groups fighting the same language, fighting an unreasonable war. John and Eve dreamed to catch in the middle of two but their dreams are woven into a sort of counterpoint. John initially did not respond to an idealist, to respond positively to the world and to discuss the wishes of his wife. In the end, he became a fundamentally different personality, unreasonable killings, strong will, cruelty (show careful surveillance in the boat. The frustration of the simplicity of this law). On the other hand, Eva constantly touches with reality and eventually she is fully suffused in her own incomplete dreams. <br /> <br /> The whole movie from a technical perspective delivers its message very effective way. Bergman keeps the cameras in the car with actors as well as the actors, or they have extreme bondage behind the actor. Nykvist handles a remarkable control of the camera, there are some great "hides hide" effects that are all very good to think "real". When the enemies are captured by the soldiers, the shots are remarkably documentary-like. The screenplay is minimalist but the story is quite complex for that matter. Indeed, the whole film is discriminatory, it is an intensity that is directed and directed against the coolness and lack of emotional involvement. Nothing here is melodramatic, there is no condolence, no hope and no clear release. But, ultimately, like the dream of ULMAN, it is so beautiful that it can not help but be surprised at it ... it was not so nice that it was so awful!
