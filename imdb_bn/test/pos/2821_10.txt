I shot this movie I am very proud of this movie. This is a great experience which shows on screen. Hafdan Hessie was a great associate who was an aspect and when we were filming, we were able to capture the film properly. The set is amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team created sets that do not fit just the letters, they work well in film shooting, which move the walls and walls from one set to another. Each character has a wonderful stress, which makes for a great story. I feel like all actors have given excellent performance. I disagree with some of the other comments that were not good at acting. Check it out and decide for yourself.
