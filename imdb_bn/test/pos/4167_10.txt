A wonderful cartoon in the same league like Batman: TAS and similar to it, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently I was able to meet again, a great voice from Tim Curry, Richard Mall, Tony Jae, and Maurice La Mama. Different roles. Rob Paulson's only curiosity seemed too old for the title character, but the story was not a great deal that was not great and the whole thing was the last time of the loop twist. Some people say that it was a cop-out, but I refreshed it in a number of series, which simply left hanging things. Hopefully one day they will keep this series in the DVD, unfortunately it came at a time when the DVD was not yet applicable and the cartoon was probably selling a particular toy, which I could never appeal to after the entertainment cartoon.
