This is the best movie you can ever see, but it is still very refreshing. Of course, it has errors, it's a disappointment moment and at the same time it's different from all the words you use and it's interesting that only French can give it to you. When you see opening, the best artist can recognize a little from Amelie. I can give 7 out of 10 but if you are tired of normal bore, you can rent video vouchers.
