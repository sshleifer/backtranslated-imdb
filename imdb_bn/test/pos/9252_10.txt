This movie was not good compared to all the final halts of H-Lots. But it was better than any movie for TV! <br /> <br /> I see the "Top 250" that only a small screen movie has made it: Greenchurch has stolen Christmas. I think it's time to increase the group. <br /> <br /> I will admit that there were many shows in the original series which was better than that, but I do not think so. I could only enter the Baltimore homemaker squad!
