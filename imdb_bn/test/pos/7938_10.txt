Alexander Nevsky is a series of fantastic sequences from the fascinating and fantastic sequence of the comic operas which ended from the ending victorious Cantata. The story was held in 1242 Prince Alexander Nevski (Nikolai Cherkassov) defeats Tutononic Knight in the Battle of the Thing Thing Ice. <br /> <br /> This picture is a great historian sponsor, which uses director Sergei Eisenstein in a fantastic battle sequence, instead of using his natural inventions, inventively pictorial, and climaxes. Several film scenes, including Doctor JHibhado (1965), Mulan (1998), and King Arthur (2004), are strongly influenced by the Battle of Lake Piapas. Because of the changed political winds, Alexander Nevsky was abstained from circulation, and then perhaps the most influential Soviet-created historical film was added.
