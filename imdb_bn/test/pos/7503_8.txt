George C. Scott gives this padby Chyphsky script as well as his wonderful and funny wonderful play. Diana Rig is attractive and quite complicated young girl. The film is going through tragedy and chaos with a horrific consequence in a 60th Century New York hospital. Bernard Hughes is always a delightful (great stage actor). <br /> <br /> Out of 10 best performance = George C Scott. Chiazsczyk suffered a major blow when he defeated Vanessa Redgrave in the 1978 Oscars, but he was a good writer. Works a real ensemble imagination, down the small role. Won the best scripts in this Oscars and Scott was nominated. He wanted to win this year instead of Pattinson for that (which he was also brilliant). Find out this!
