This is a great German slash, which is often quite suspicious and creative with a lot of fun stories and strong performance. All the characters are cool, and Benno FÃ¼rmann is as great as the Cyco Slayer, plus Franka Potente gives a fantastic performance as the lead lead. It took a while to go, but it was not boring, and it had some good death scenes, as well as the music is surprisingly obscure. I was lucky enough to get Subtitle version instead of Dabbed, and I think all the characters were quite likable, plus it was very good and written. It has some really good plot twists too, and the effect is done very well, plus the end is great. Especially doubtful in the final, and Frank Potent had the perfect casting choice in my opinion, plus I did not die Ardash Sharshing-Sohre (David) very quickly, because he was a really great character. Actually I was uncomfortable in a few moments but well, and I must say that the film has all the praise and the camouflage of the platform, but it is not enough to prevent the film. This is a great German slash, it's often quite suspicious and creative, with a fun story and strong performance, I highly recommend it! Directions are great! Stefan Ruzowitzky does a great job! Excellent camera work, very good angles, great close ups (see open sex scenes), do a great job in adding obscure atmosphere and work only to keep the film at very fast speed. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of blood and beef. We cut cadavers open, lots of very serious surgery scenes, lots of bloody stabbings, still conscious when people are dissected, cut finger, self mutilation, gittings, bloody slit throat, showing many wicked frozen bodies, lots of blood and more <br / > <br /> Acting is very difficult! Franka Potente was pretty desired as the lead lead, while being cold under pressure, the eyes were easy, weak, and we were able to care for his character, the only time he seemed to enjoy, while he was raising some bad conversations here and there, But that was not often, he was wonderful! Beno Fermaine was as nice as a psycho killer, he was just struggling, and surprisingly, he really gave me the cripps, and was an effective killer! Anna Luos played her role very well, like a smart crack, I dug her. Sebastian Blomberg was great as Kasper here, he was quite liked, and had a mysterious character, chemistry with his pants, and finally there was a great twist involved with him. Holger Speckhahn Idiot Phil was as well and his work was good. Just like Professor Graubback of Truth Buddha Like David, Ever Schjringer-Sohri was a great man, he had a great character and I hope he will not die soon. The rest of the cast fined. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this great German slash! *** 1/2 out 5
