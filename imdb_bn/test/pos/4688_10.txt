Hi, I have to tell you there are some wrong information about the series. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later there were some other writers but they only worked on a few episodes. <br /> <br /> The first series that made the first series (I think the whole series was 1) was Ian Sharpe who created the unique look of Robin. Sherwood. <br /> <br /> Clandad actually saw some elements and they read scraps. I certainly know this reason because Richard Corpent told about it in a condom in England last year. <br /> <br /> I think this is an excellent compilation of television-entertainment, because it contains great characters and cast, good costumes and great stories. Still one of the best TV series for me!
