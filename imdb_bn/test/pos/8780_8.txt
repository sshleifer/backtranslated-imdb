Many familiar hitcodes (earlier and later films) and this time they are mixed with a delightful, but rarely mysterious piece of entertainment. You can tell that Dorothy Parker's handwritten the script, the most memorable scene is that the dialogue of hero simming with the blind man and the face of it with the comparisons of circus people. The famous climax in the Statue of Liberty is a bit heavy-it seems to be in line with today's standards, compared to the other end of the fictional finale (e.g. Blackmail, Northwest North).
