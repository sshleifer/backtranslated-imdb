I saw this movie in Santa Monica on August 23 and it remained with me. I would like to thank Harry for the mysterious, brilliant, filmmakers to dig into the life story. And also to show human error and failure in Nilsson. Good and bad, up and down, and thanks to that wonderful BBC footage released. This film is a great exhibition of Nilsson's music, which is really well-established throughout the film. I recommend this movie to someone who likes a good documentary, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the music scene of the 70's. Some critics wrote on the East Knut It Cool website that they saw the best movie cinema at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and I believe. The film is full of informative, funny, sad, touching, and awesome music. It's a success on all levels. Really, really good.
