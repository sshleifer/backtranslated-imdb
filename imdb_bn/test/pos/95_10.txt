Animated shorts just will not get much better than this wonderful Canadian film. This small feature is decreasing with Canadian references, and so, this film is probably the most appreciated by the Canadians. But the original story is universal, and the author is lovingly called by Rach Carrier. This is a sunny story that I know for a while, and I was fortunate enough to see it recently, so I would like to write a sincere recommendation for it only. It's a wonderful composition and you must of course see if it's Canadian.
