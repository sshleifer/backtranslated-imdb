This short paramount was the first short story published by the famous studio and it had several of the studio, which shows direct involvement with Popeye's enemies, mostly Japanese. Although Warner Bros., in Disney and some other studios, often portrayed as Germany's foil, focused most of Japanese's attention on the efforts of famous studios. It is quite understandable to give Pearl Harbor and the Pope's navy. This is an average short. For Britain, 'Rain, White A' Blue and Spin Ach was better. But it is still valuable. Recommended.
