The best romantic comedy I've seen in the year Ben Steiller or Adam Sandler does not have silence as the top Hollywood staff, and much less Syrape than Hein Grant's epic. Julian Nicholson and J. Mauer have been fully cast and provided professional performance as easily as those who decided to spend a little time to sow their sexual oats before both the wedding. For the sake of laughter it concocted a nice combination of the feelings and humorous action of the writer and director instead of playing it. Nicholson is just as fantastic as a temptation and Mohar did a great job, who unwittingly entered the game, but soon he enjoyed his Fluffs a little more. We see plenty of supporting letters to span the plot nicely without confusing the original story. Andy Ritter (sincere friend) and Helen Slaughter (annoying single mom) are especially good. It has enough money and mental complexity to do far more than an ideal boy girl farce. Actually, just a little better penning and a little bit of the top ten comedy to overtake this movie.
