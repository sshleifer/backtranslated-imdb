When I went to see this documentary in the Communist Block musicals, then I expect something completely submerged like the Communist "Cop Rock". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And yet, one of the surprises of "East Side Story" is that some of the presentations actually were committed. In the mid-1950s, the East German effort "wants to sing, My Wife wants to sing", whose title refers to, Unhappy Housefruh wants to start singing on the objection of her traditionally considered husband. Another truly interesting movie in Eastern Germany was known as "Midnight Revue". In film-in-the-film, producers ruined their own creative disaster with a group story of filmmakers, under the party's order to create musical instruments brutally. (On-screen filmmakers get a musical number to avoid the very memorable "very hot" vowel of 1957 film "Silk Stockings". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br />, but it's still a lot of fun to see. (Find the dedication given by the person who made it possible.)
