This is not your ideal Indian film. There is some great sense of humanity, and the characters are quite realistic. There is great dynamism in correlation, and there are a lot of characters in crime, sorrow, emotion, a sense of difference. Seeing it, the level of 5000 years and the weight of the history of a social existence of the Vilemam civilization is felt. The final scene of an elephant walking in rural areas was such that there was a great footnote to an ancient civilization, and yet, human relationships are still preserved and observed. Two interviews with DVD watched, directors and main actresses are very interesting. This picture is astonishing to learn good (or not) shown in India (... but maybe not very surprised). Artistic authoritarian of rural society has gradually lost and his heirs were not selected by the younger generation, because some of the old musicians of the film are no longer alive. Great Film
