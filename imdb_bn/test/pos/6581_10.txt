I saw it with subtitles in DVD, which became frustrating due to the length of the film. But I had riveted it all. I was fascinated by the characters and always despite the subtitles, engrossed in the story, a convent of the film's ability. It's an amazing piece of work. It's always on my list of ten favorite movies. In the last 20 years, I have seen that this is the best foreign movie I would like to know the whole story behind this picture. It must have taken a very long time and used hundreds of locations. It can be used in some hardcore scenes (on a total room TV) Unfortunately some people may not be able to see it, but if you do not feel like it, you will be removed deeply by all stories in this story!
