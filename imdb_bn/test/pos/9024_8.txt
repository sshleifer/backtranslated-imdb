This is a great movie for pure entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. It's enjoyable, and a vaguely portable movie. <br /> <br /> A little about the movie, but still the annoying thing is that we do not know why Justin and Tea break. Well, the first relationships do not work for one reason or another, but they seem to be less or less like a beautiful couple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
