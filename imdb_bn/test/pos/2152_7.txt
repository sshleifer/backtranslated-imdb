Biodoke, on account of a friend's account, spent the last 15 years in a mission of costly self-destruction in his short life, according to the intellectual singer / songwriter. He died at the age of 52 after the lasting persecution of alcohol, cigarette, marijana and cocaine, brutal partitioning and extreme abuses of his vocal instruments, he lost his weight and died of cardiovascular disease (he believed that he was a friend to <br/> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Power of his generation; (2) Successful, after several years of effort In the case of praise of the industry - a decent recording contract with a Grammy, an Oscar, Top Label, and at least two star albums - 'Nilsson Schmilsson' (original), and 'Touch of Schmillson's Tight' (standard); and (3) too Happy married (for the third time), he started worshiping a beautiful young family. <br /> <br /> The power of the film begins with the fullness of his account in Nilsson's life. These, including the use of subtle archive film footage and still a lot of Nilsson, the editors of the sudden movement of a particular work. We talked about his intimate relationships with John Lennon and later, Rango Star (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). <br /> <br /> It is more interesting to talk about, often the documentary's weakest aspect. Here are some wonderful stories about Nielsen, such as Perry Boatkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Denzel, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idel, Rick Gerard, Randy Newman, Van Die Park, Jimmy Web and Robin Williams? Many are unreasonably funny, others are deeply compassionate - and express their deep affection for everyone. Equally part of interviews with informative and moving Nilsson's wives ?? Annie and Una, her son Zach, and cousin Doug Hoffer. The best set of heads I can think of in a biodegradation. <br /> <br /> The biggest shortfall in the film is that it is the Nilson music crowd. His greatest hits are even shortened, even with "With You You", about 8 times short lived. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for this, the film will not last two whole hours. Some head shots can be lost, and we hear at least the song, and perhaps one or two, "One" or an Oscar winning cover of "Awesome Conversation". "Nilson's psychological mystique of filmmakers and his music is not enough attention. My grade: 7.5 / 10 (low B +) (NWFI's Relay Music Series, seen on 01/07/07)
