This is probably one of my darling, although I have the first one and have seen damn, legacy, and vs Demonic kits. The only better than this is Prime Minister Dr. The curse series is the worst one, the first one, and then its legacy. I recommend seeing this and vs dt people Those who say this stinks are wrong, so wrong, the story is well written and it is a sweet movie. It may be as fearing when watching even small kids in a classic movie and watching others. Well this is my review, you can call me JeepDak (It's easy to know where it comes from: 101 Dalmatians series, you can see it at 4:00 AM in Toon Disney). Oh and no smile, I'm a guy, you better see my reviews at the best times. Why do you want to know? I am 1 Suggestion Word: Mental Food, Arriouwuo! I agree with you to Madar-1, but why people like others are more thrilling than the fear, and because the doll is made to show the squire. Also, you can call me jipadak.
