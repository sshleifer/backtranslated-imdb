The story in this film is fairly impossible B grade stuff, but the script called a vague person for leadership, and Peter Lor had the meaning in 1940. And like Peter Island's owner, Stephen Dennel, he is in his biggest prison in Christie, who joins his custody to work on the diamond mine on the island of the prisoners. After the arrival, Parole discovered that he is my staff servant, who can be beaten or killed on the back of the dungeon. <br /> <br /> Just two things seem worse than slaves; Dennel's wife, Monkey. The monkey tipped him so much that his violence towards him could lead to the sole flesh of slaves. <br /> <br /> Here, Lou Lou's role is perfect, and in the fashion of art-power showcases the screen. Although the script is not Casablanca Calib, the edit is very hard and there is no visual view. This is a very watchable story, but I'm not sure what to fill in this movie. Very short for a small issue, and very short for a feature length film, I'm sure the market was in the theater how it was. <br /> <br /> I'm TCM in the first night for the first time / first time this morning. Lorre fans do not want to miss this one if they do not meet it.
