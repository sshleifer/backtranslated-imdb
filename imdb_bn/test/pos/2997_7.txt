I grabbed this flick at the end of a tape used to capture an image, I really wanted to see again. I saw the name of Rackle Welch in the first round, I decided to watch it. It was really humorous and had taken me back to "Weibo Machines", which Houston was spreading in the mid-sixties, similar to the current Austin Power Stuff. Oh acting was not fantastic, there was no plot, but it was valuable. There were some lovely scenes, though Miss Welch made it the most beautiful. Tape it to get you the chance and look at it when you absolutely have nothing else to do. This is not a snooze, but if you want more, you will not be rolling in it.
