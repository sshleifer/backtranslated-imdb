This new installment of the children's play series was not a scary scene, but as bright as a witness, many lively jokes gave him finger, "strange f-king doll" and many references to the series: "You can kill me but I'll come back. Come on. " The title of the movie was probably thought before the script and it was written around. This series is completely different from all other movies. This is not even the central character Andy even for everyone. Chaki seems to interfere in character from another movie, so that a soap opera is about two girls together to get married. A cool broad death scene involving broken glass and water drilling everywhere. The film is very fun, very funny, and contains Jerry Springer's pop culture references from Martha Stewart. Do not see this one before you see the other three. It will actually destroy it from the first terrible effect. Lots of guilty fun and plenty of silliness. <br /> <br />
