Quite simply, when I saw this on a movie theater, I made a lizard and I began to tremble in my ears; Although the eyes are open, they are always elaborately simple, fresh, yet incredibly sophisticated, exciting and fantastical. <br /> <br /> This is probably East Totoro, in terms of age range of viewers. The plot works due to the pure heart of 5 years, who pay attention to what they want and consideration in their pursuit. They live in a world that is full of disrespect and the cultural education of 'guess' everything. Although most critics can ignore the movie due to the lack of 'critics' or 'plot' films (although it is still there), it must certainly take care of the film. Very often our judgment is impeded by our own limitations of movie and cultural standing. Like most of Myasaki's film, everyone is absolutely unique but perfect Miyasaki Ponyo may occasionally feel so unique and fresh, it may seem foreign like it. The experience of watching <br /> <br /> provides a wonderful change from the product of all generic children, which is usually the kind of adult populations (such as their human critics, like Eddie Murphy in animals / charts). It is perhaps the old old fashioned hand-drawn cells It is still comforting to know that this digital era works so incredibly where Toystory / WallE / Shrek / Cars are generally victorious. So it seems nostalgic at the same time that the film feels shameless, how old is the totoro and jungle book age. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < This is a big sad thing for Wall-E to win it on the Oscars, and it will probably be this year. Yet it can be fairly inappropriate to compare with 2 media, because it is really telegraphy and the story that is won by the end of the day. Myasaki's true master for this
