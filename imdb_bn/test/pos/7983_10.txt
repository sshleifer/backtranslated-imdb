Batman Returns is more Gothic and somber than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. Also, the scenery is more intense, and the whole environment is so tragic along with the soul-cool music so protected by the talented Danny Elfman. However, I did not like to like the idea that Penguin is against a giant, comic book, where he is a man. Even if he looks like a monster, he looks good that he has a human dignity, and I'm sorry for him when I saw his late parents' grave. But still, he was actually a dangerous villain, and he needed to stop him. <br /> <br /> Michael Cutton made "Tour de Force" with his return as a dark knight, and during this time he was the strongest main batman. Sometimes it is not difficult to understand why Batman has called the public ... <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer was very sexy and orderly in his role, and as a female villain / criminal, he acted as a cat dressed up as a cat. Actually, actors did a great job with Batman Returns, which made it a successful film. <br /> <br /> If you like Batman, check out its awesome style, because it's all dark night-friendly lovers for hard-core. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
