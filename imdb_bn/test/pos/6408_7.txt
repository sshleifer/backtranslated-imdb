Compared to this, Tarkovsky is a speed fqq. Compared to <br /> <br />, Bell Tutor MTV Compared to <br /> <br />, the movie "Russian Ark" is a roller coaster ride. <br /> <br /> I've only described three moody experiences I know, and it keeps them all the top. But that's not saying it's bad. On the contrary, I really like it. But it was a joke. <br /> <br /> I will not describe the plot, because you can easily find it elsewhere. Plot INSANE is not saying. It is one of the most creative and bizarre ideas from "Being John Malkovich". I believe the fascinating plot is the main reason I stopped (also, was ridiculous, very rarely, we can see artists in the film). <br /> <br /> Here we see a wonderful reverse, ideal. Most movies contain small plot and small elements; Yet they are 90 minutes full of many images to keep us invited. But "The Hole" has 100% plots / themes which are too much for the eyes to open. In this context, I think it is like reading a novel word of pain, like the real intellectual experience, such as Thackeray's Vanity Fair (which I will not be able to finish!). <br /> <br /> <br /> Extra attention span, I think you really like this picture. Despite the speed of its anarchy, it is very creative and fantastic. It's like Jav-Pierre Junkett's Quadius and a thrust, dusty camera lens. Good luck
