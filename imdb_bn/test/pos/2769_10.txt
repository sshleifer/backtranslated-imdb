I like this movie. And the Disney Channel is ridiculous to play again. I think they should definitely put some cheer in the air at least one night so that we can record it !!! But if anyone does not know where I'll get ?? Email me cristin6891@aim.com If you know where I can find this movie, then email me. Online, or anywhere I told my kids about this movie and I think they deserve it too. Now all these Disney movies are fake and annoying. I need to return to Susie's question !! It was a great movie and great actor and I did not see why it was removed from the wind. If everyone loves this film then why it was blown away from the wind. Take into account my comment with other comments made in this movie. Thank you, your day is good.
