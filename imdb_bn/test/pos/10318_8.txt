A short of three stages, featuring this shame. I have seen everyone involved with Shame, this is my favorite acting in Stuig's short voice. The basic plot is that Shamp must be married at 6 o'clock, if he is half-million dollar heir, then the rich uncle leaves him with his wishes. So Shem set herself to get a bride out but than expected it would find a difficult road, until they did not know the meaning of her legacy. The best bits include Shape Shewing, Sheung and more in the telephone booths and piano as compared to Larry Sheem's voice-training session. Shamp is also wrong as Casin Basil, and its results give delightful evidence.
