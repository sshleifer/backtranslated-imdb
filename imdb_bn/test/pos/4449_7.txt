First of all I want to say that I am a huge Lucio Flachi and Dario Argentine fan. Although I did not see all their movies completely, I really enjoyed almost everybody I've seen. I really like the gielles and I think Argentina was the master of this genre after seeing the films "General" and "Phenomena". But seeing the "New York Ripper" of Phulchi, I came to know that he could do well in his graphic zombie film and even go beyond Argentina. I love flowers, and yes I love Gora, but I think this picture, though it has more advanced plots and letters than other movies, but none of its best. I do not like it, it can be confusing at the end, especially. And we do not suspect one suspect, another person, and another from another, even a little annoying little girl, I think it's too far gone. I know, the geyellers can finally guess you and find the killer to be very hard, but this film plays a bit more with our mind. But when I die, I like the scene, I think it did a great job and gave me cool. Acting is very nice and photography is great. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a bad movie, I think Lucio Floris has made a better film than this, and I think its best is "Beyond", a very different movie but more atmospheric and visual experiences. <br /> <br /> I do not torture a 7 "one robbery out of 10" <br /> <br /> <br />
