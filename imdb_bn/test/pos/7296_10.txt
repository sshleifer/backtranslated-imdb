<br /> <br /> When I was unexpectedly hired for one thousand rupees, I thought I was for a entertaining King Lear story and certainly Michelle Pfeffer was in, so what could be wrong? <br /> <br /> <br /> Very fast, however, I realized that this story was one thousand other things on the one side. I started crying and could not stop till the end of the film. Thanks to Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, we have such a wonderful fine and compassionate movie! Thanks, for throwing and illustrating characters with such depth and humility! <br /> <br /> I recognized angry kids; Forget sister and sister sister I recognized the abusive husband and why he was there and then father, oh father ... all acted great. I recognized myself and this film was an eye-opener, a relief, the opportunity to face my own truth, and finally the opportunity to do something about it. I really hope thousands of acres will have the same effect in something else. <br /> <br /> Because I did not understand why this image is fighting against the wilds - they did not fight each one. Everything else - I saw it the second time. Then I found that if someone did not do the same story, then it would be very easy to miss the deep binding between fearful fears and fears and sisters operated by him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Give a rat's ass (my French pardon) about how to extend the story of King Lear. I know that I can tell the truth: this movie has changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, you can and can differentiate. <br /> <br />
