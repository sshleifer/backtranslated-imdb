Steimboat Wiley Mickey was not the first cartoon to present the mouse. The first movie to be played in America was "Planet Crazy". "Plain Crazy" was released in silent film format, on 15 May 1928 in Hollywood California. "Stambot Willie" was released on 18 October 1928 as a sound film (it was released as a silent film on July 29, 1928). Thus Mickey's first sound film "Steamboat .." was created but not the first film for small American mice. Although many game shows used questions: "What was Mickey Mouse's first appearance?" True answer is not "plane crazy" "Steamboat Willie". These dates may be IMDB checkout under "Release Date".
