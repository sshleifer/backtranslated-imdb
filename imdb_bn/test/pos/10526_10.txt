Unfortunately, these basic mixes and laughs are kept from film fans because it's been running in Columbia Vaults for all eternity. Its shame may be Jack Strart's most powerful film and it features a malicious script of a young Terrence owner, and his two lead Stasi Keatch and the fully available performance of Frederick Forrest, who live in the crime, so that they can get money to open a seafood restaurant. Many standout scenes include interrogation by bathtub and electric razors, and a aborted building as a intense shootout as it is being broken by a debris ball!
