Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without many fanfare, however, so often a movie that can come along with honest, fun, entertaining and memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has tested the time for mixing four elements. This picture is followed by three friends (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") for the first time in sex and genuine love rogues. At the same time, they can learn the value of strict education and true friendship. We follow the disappointing romantic gary (main character) in his enthusiasm to win his dream girl, which ultimately leads him to an uncertain road with a wonderful turn. If you are not lucky enough to see this movie yet, watch it all the way ... with some memorable 80 songs spread throughout the film so that everything can move at a pace. L.A.V. Truly an original movie, a rareness in its genre.
