If you ignore the plot many times it is a ridiculous and delightful lonely Tune Cartoon cartoon. Animation is wonderful, background is so detailed and very indecent color. Writing razors are sharp, and vision gags are especially brilliantly when Daffy is being continually blown up in her head. I really love the arguments in Daffy and Bug, and that bugs win everytime. I love that when Daffy is really greedy and weird funny that he likes it. He is Manik when I like him but he is very great fun here. The bug is still its charming and rascally self, and even Elmer Elmer is funny. In short, this is absolutely brilliant, and indeed my personal favorite of Hunting Trilogy for mere entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
