After being a fan of Old Doctor Hu and after midterm Fox, I expressed doubts about this new series of Doctor Who. Although I gave it a chance, and I'm very happy. Yes, some episodes are not as bright as others, but they are all enjoyable, and yes, Existon's Doctor was far but far from any ... Eccleston's Doctor Only Has Well About Me His performance is sometimes ridiculous, on the other hand, dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> This, and Rose Piper as a daily creates a cut above the rest of the series (Chemel Kadureo is pretty as a Rose MOM), and a depth of this series is not present before. This series is incredibly strong, especially considering its Sci-Fi. I mean, who said that you've always been sorry or even crying for Dalake, how many times we were in the history of the roses, father of the father, emergency doctor and 'you were nice ... so was I the final statement? Whether I advise anyone, whether it is a doctor or even a TV drama fan to buy this set of DVDs, it's really "awesome!" Now, with just the last series, only 4 episodes (and waiting for the new cyberman) I would like to say that David Tenant's doctor is not good at all, of course you can disagree, but I do not think his doctor The mental moments that the series has seen are capable. I also remember that in my opinion this series was not good at the end, but Sarah Jane and K9's return to a wonderful episode, true gem. This series is not good, just good as well. <br /> <br /> Whether you like it or not, and if you like tenant or eccleston, the doctor has returned and he is here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as many "Fantastic!" As a doctor! -
