Controversial, Donald E. Westlake is the most enjoyable and William H. Messi's co-authored novel "A Travesty" * Trustworthy for the story, film star calls Messi a helpless man who, after trying to engage in sudden death, goes far beyond his head. Costar Adam Armin and James Cromwell in the role of good supporter. The film's power breaks through a complex diagonal-after-abstract storyline and performance, especially by Messi, regularly and joyfully, through the fourth wall, and it goes away every time. A good story with a lot of dark smile, this has kept me in a lot of detail since it came three times a week. Look at your critical faculties and a loud, bipartisan "wheeeeee!" Ready to emit.
