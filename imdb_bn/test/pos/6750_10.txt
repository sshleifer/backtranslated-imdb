I think this movie has been as good as possible. With just 4 months and $ 52,000 budget - I was surprised it was not bad. If you do not care about CGI or special effects then this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie was not well prepared (I'm sure it could be but you can try only good for 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting. <br /> <br /> When I say this film is good, do not trust me because I can find 1933 King Kong better <br /> <br /> I must admit that I did not see the whole movie ... I could move here and there a few minutes faster ...
