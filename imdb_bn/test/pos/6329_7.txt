Bergman and the comedy did not quite go together. Its some comedy so naff wince you around. This picture has a weird moments of nifty - the last 30 seconds of Nadir, but it's a beautiful (fun funny) piece, completely enjoyable throughout life. Bergman carries a few of his usual suspects who perform well. There is a great view on the train between David, Marian and an unknown salesman who can stay in memory. Among the elements of the wedding, some of the more general, disciplined Bergman, but instead of dark mood it is Bergman in a light. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moments and has a 90-minute minute price. If you want to read for Bergman, then there is no classic one and the place will not start.
