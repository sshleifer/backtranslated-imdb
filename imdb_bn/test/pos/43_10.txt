Best, Lacavana Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, great casting, great music, this is a film that is so good that when it's over it takes more than 90 minutes. I will w3atch this one time. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that keeps you from the beginning and twists and slammers emotionally to you. Cast their role is uncommon without the smallest indication of being uncorfortable. You've got the idea that you're actually accepting it. Set, dress and duration music have been given great care. The relationship between the characters we are meeting is both simple and complicated, just like the movie, but Mr. Markerston's steady performance is so strong that before the movie ends we have met the wonderful mistakes. Unlike "Nani" alone, injustice will be done to anybody, because our great gentleman actors have a lot of performance: <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright, Jimmy Smiths, Terrence Howard and Delray Lindo But it's Marcus Franklin, Messi Gray and Mrs. Markerson, which makes it a great experience. <br /> <br /> This movie comes at a fast pace and it is short by nowadays, but this is not a question of any of your best movies. Are going to see this year. If you like a piece of good times that will challenge you emotionally, make your heart happy, and tapping your feet at the same time, it's a movie for you. I have shown this to many friends and they all want my copy, all say, the movie is good. Check it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Dance-1, Amsterdam Holland
