<br /> <br /> Fourteen minutes of the most fun minute of celluloid. This little parody is at least part of the Stans Warsaw Saga Phantom Menace, and if you ask me more entertainment then. Hardware warfare was the first of the long lines of SW Spofel, which nowadays constitutes their own sub-genre. I hate to describe it too much - it's so small that the court is just about the whole thing. Many of the most popular and known aspects of Star Wars are enough to make fun of them. Household appliances like the Taster and Vacuum Cleaner portray spaceships and robots, the Princess Ani-Dyoid character replaces the famous hair instead of the braided hair, and uses the actual bread rolls on her head, and the Fluke Starbaker is more than the Darker than its original. Possible Arnie Fossilus is a crazy boy-of-hawk-he is now the source of the episode, The Apocalypse is now Spuf.
