This film is important for those interested in Western history because it uses pure tricks in its production. <br /> <br /> Wagon Train scenes are especially pure; As far as I know, it has only scenes that sometimes portray river crossing techniques in Bluffs. Horse and vault should be reduced to the level of the river and will be descended by ropes and jackfruit. The scene was such that I could see repeatedly trying to feel like what the crossings were ... and the first tourists gave time and time again while crossing the country. <br /> <br /> On one side of melodrama, this photo is authentic as the dress and style as they come and valued for viewing that alone.
