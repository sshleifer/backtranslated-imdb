I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has to blame, everyone is real. The hero of any papers or cold, omnipotent, know all the characters. <br /> <br /> Many people will complain about morality here to read the audience and James, despite his cheating on him, will maintain his love for him, but I will. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, once he started breaking, he was confused and made many mistakes. But in real life, when you achieve independence, you can make mistakes (especially at the beginning). <br /> <br /> Was he really ungrateful? may be. But we must remember that he is walking with his feet for the first time. He knows that James is a good man after all, maybe a little harder, serious and work-focused; But he felt the desire to live a life like himself. <br /> <br /> Will he blame more than that? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />) Bullet bite and wait, hope for better. He began to understand that he was exactly what his (his marriage) was right (his marriage) was a control game run by his wife. <br /> <br /> This is not a story that is of higher mental and uncertain nature (that is, natural Clichy Latin American or Italian jealous boys), it is a story of both men and women using both the heart and the brain. <br /> <br /> It can be very painful, but if you really love a person (women or people) and if you are not a terrific troubled nature you can forgive her cheating and let her go. Unless you are an envy, prehistoric, crime's emotions, individual and mentally unstable person. <br /> <br /> is a really good movie. The last scene, when James - happened despite everything - is actually running with Anna at the train station: He is free and he understands what means freedom for a person. <br /> <br /> Guido
