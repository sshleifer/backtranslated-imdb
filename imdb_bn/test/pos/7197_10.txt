I've read every adventure of atastic and obelisks at least 5 times and I'm very fond of "Les Nulls" and "Les Rubbins des Bows" and also a Jemel fan. And so I hope so much from this movie ... and I finally got satisfied. Unlike the first adaptation of Asterix's first adaptation at the Big Screen (Asterix and Obelix Contat Caesar), which did not have a real success in addition to the presence of Latitia Castor, it actually contained the comic's soul (and we got the beautiful Monica Baluchi). In the first film, the director tried to be very realistic about the timing of this story and killed the whole soul that makes Attersford laughable. All these dresses, conversations and everything are similar to those of Gosini and Woodrow ... More, this is really the real story about what we are going to get, but Alin Chabat has given us. At the end a few surprises. I really enjoyed that movie, and each time when the first sign of annoyance starts appearing, Jameel comes and laughs laughing. This movie is a big mix of all the humor I really like and even if it is very mixed, I can not like it. So, if you like Asterix and "Nulle part Ailleurs" (a nightly show and a French mix of SNL), you would like to see these movies, but this movie is a favorite of all the young talent.
