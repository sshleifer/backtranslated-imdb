OK, it can not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. In fact, there is little "sophistication" in it. It's coral, teenager, irrational, stupid ... and absolutely sunny. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in Britain. Create some ridiculous antics with the guests, when they beat each other, try to make money to hire only the resident, as well as drink the whole night with the boys from the power station ... and those who come to avoid the press wishing with beautiful actress Fall If you are a follower of Rick and Adde and their work, try it. If not ... do not get the movie. <br /> <br /> * I'm not thick, this is a word in one of Rick Fack Junt's films. ^ ^ ^
