(Spoilers Warning) I could not say enough good things about this movie. This is a terrific horror comedy / trick that fixes everything for change. Humor is great and funny to funny-funny-you joke funny In one case, Ed edits - goes crazy and erases a big view. When his boss was watching Ed's edit, he shouted: "Where is FU %% my Beaver-Rape Scene?!" Epilepsy There are many other great, ridiculous and memorable quotes and moments that are included: Ed yells out "You do not look at me # FU # !!!" Face some poor schmuck again and again. Very interesting thing. The plot of the film is so ridiculous that it is invaluable: Ed is a light-minded everyday person who is transferred to the Horror-Film Editing section and after a while shows the nuts, the monsters and attacking the people while scared. The movie that he has edited This movie has all and is just fun. The DVD costs about $ 7 and it's a great deal as it's rated wide screen cut. I own several DVDs, most of which cost a lot more than this, but not so big as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of my collection highlights and if I try to steal it, then I'll kill one with a telephone receiver. Evil Ed style and quality oozes - something that Hollywood filmmakers will mainly learn. Evil Ed is a rare jewel, and I would like to thank everyone involved in this wonderful movie - you have done everything right, and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10!
