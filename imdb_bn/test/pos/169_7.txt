This movie is great. The 80's stylish Slashar movie was born in about three children, so they all saw them die. They do not really make sense to kill, but it only adds to the kiss of this movie. And dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. You watched the movie, you know who I'm talking about. That baby is awesome! Although the film is not very important, it is entertaining and for some reason you care about the characters. It has some nice nudity. There are some good acting, really an 80s slash movie, but if you ever get the chance to watch it then it's a look. Although you will have nightmares about those nasty kids, I guarantee you!
