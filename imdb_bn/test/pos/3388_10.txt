It was a great movie, all 3. The last one was not as good as the first 2, but it was later created and it was dragging on the straw. But because of the end of the story, you want to see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> I want to have all the troubles, love, tears, and laughter in these movies that people of this movie run away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Old enough to see. But it's a great film for over 20 years.
