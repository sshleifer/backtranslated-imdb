In the future guests are an interesting story of travel, friendship, good and evil war - small budget, child actor and some special effects. Learn from something for Spielberg and Lucas. ;) A sixth-grade Koliya "Nick" Gersimov finds a time machine in a reduction building basement and travels 100 years in the future. He discovered a perfect perfect, utopian society where playing robot guitar and writing poetry, everyone is kind to each other and enjoys the technology that people want to provide. Alice is a prominent scientist who discovered a device called Milephon, who can read the minds of humans and animals. Depending on where the device moves, both of them can be used both good and bad. When the pirates want to attempt to steal the universe, two evil places on Saturday are in the hands of the 20th century school Nick. The pirates get hot on his track, his time comes back, then the pirates and after Alice. Try to mix with silent pirate earthlings as follows Chaos, confusion and funny situation. Alice goes to the same school and displays supernatural skills in the PE class. Detected, Alice does not know how Nick feels, when the pirates work. Also, pirates are able to change their appearance and change them literally. (Hmm, I'm surprised, James Cameron got the terminator's idea ...) Who is Nik and Miyophone - first? Excellent plot, non-stop events, and great soundtracks. I want to kid movies like this kind of Hollywood ...
