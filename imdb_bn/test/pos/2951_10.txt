This is really a great movie! It gets you thinking about your dad We all have a poor relationship with them, unless we actually try to find people as humans. And as soon as important, we should remember to open and show their real identities, not only do we think they want us. Definitely see this documentary! Before posting my comment, IMDB has written me more text, how strange it is Generally, online comments will be short, and here's more to say! Well, I went to see pictures with my parents, then thought they wanted to talk about their parents, but my father wanted to talk to himself and himself in his life, he thought he was objectionable, which was unusual, my father was a cruel Not man, but he was surprised that he wanted to talk about the mistakes he made. Mike and Kitty came to do a question and this and then there was a bad moment when my dad was talking to Mike, when my mother talked with Kitty! To really pad this comment, ignore my last few sentences, and remember '51 Birch Street ', see it!
