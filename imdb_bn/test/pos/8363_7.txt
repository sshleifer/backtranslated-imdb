Child power plants have two divisions: Hero Hai and Shajam. Let's start with Hero Hi. <br /> <br /> Hero High wanted to be a new archive cartoon, among which were their superhero identities: Purehart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superfine (Betty), and Eggwill (Reggie). However, they could not get the right to do the filming so they tweaked it a bit and came up with this. Here the characters are broken: Captain California (Archi), Gloria Gallo (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Tricks (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Regi), Principal Samson (Mister Meteorologist) and Miss Grimma (Miss Grandy). The show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. Humor was usually humorous in the filming of humor, but at least it was a sense of fun about it. It was fairly entertaining for the kids, although not much of the previous quality was. <br /> <br /> Another section was Shajam! Which was comic compared to the previous live action show. The presence of all major villains, as well as the entire Marvel family (including Freel's Marvel, at least one episode). Uncle Doodle acted in the right W Fields and Shadow character as well as his "Chirajamago". One of the 70 television shows was a mid-middleton, big red cheese like fish, Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wales first 6 million man man episode, and Human Schlatter's voice). Civana operates. <BR> <br /> To meet the wonderful standards and practice requirements (censors), Marvels always had radioactivity ideas, so there was little change for their adventures. For example, the stories were very fantastic and inventive. Among the present villains were: Civana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, m. Mind, anti-minerva, ebak, and crocodile animals. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his on screen debut. <br /> <br /> Hero is released from High BCI, but Shazam! Still in limbo, as well as show live action. Hopefully, the proposed movie will help them to loose in their DVDs. It is worth watching the DVD treatment and the worthy price.
