Landscape after the war, Andrzej Wajada in his second film career career, highlighted the mental and psychological confusion in the former Nazi prison in Poland, which was released immediately after WWII. <br /> <br /> A hand-held camera explores a lot of extreme closing-ups and vivid colors. The final credit symbolizes the film as a graffiti to the carriage of freight train cars. The soundtrack is superb, apart from Vivaldi, which sounds firmly in pop-art fashion, at the first end.
