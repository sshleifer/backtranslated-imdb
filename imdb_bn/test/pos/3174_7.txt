A highly down-to-earth, well-made and "Rodeo" Western acting. There is no need for all stars here, because all cast members regularly tell people about a real life story about Rido Howler and his tour on the 60's and 70's. But especially for Slim Pickens to give her signature performance, especially the hats, especially it was true that she had a roid dress in real life. His role went far beyond the role of humor, because he had strictly met with hard-working Rodo's life "Up and Downs" and psychological destruction, which often surrounds such a lifestyle. He and Mr. Coburn collaborated very well as a partner, not just in the circuit, but in the real world even outside of the net. Also, see Anne Archery as Cuba's Native American love interest in the next part of the movie. His first role would be to be one. <br /> <br /> As "junior builder", not shiny, but equally affecting the rendering of the heart and its screenplay. Thanks to Anquaar Western Channel for showing the real credibility of a low-rating movie from time to time.
