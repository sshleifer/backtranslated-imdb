I had many hopes from this movie, and I can say I was not disappointed. Above all, this film, as a world tour for wine making, is a delight to see the beautiful place of the audience. Interviewed people are really interesting and fun, especially Hobart de Montil Shooting may be confusing, the camera is always unstable and often focuses on secondary elements in the background. You can not like it, but I do not consider it as an error. <br /> <br /> The themes raised in the movie can also be confusing, because globalization is not just a matter of discussion. But Nossiter managed to give a compatibility to all of his movies. A major achievement of this film reveals all the characters involved in the wine industry, as they are actually avoiding "good against Evil". This can be the major difference between documentaries of "Mondovino" and Michael Moore; Nossiter's perspective appears in a fine way, through the opinions expressed by his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary depends largely on the characters, the history of long-drinking family, such as De Montillus, Mandvies, Antony and Frescoballi. Nossiter inventor discovers that wine is related to the family, rather than being a business and an art. This movie does not want you to drink alcohol, but of course you want to discover vineyard and wine-makers. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as a student in Nology, and there are many ways to learn it. Despite its technical specifications, 10 out of 10 give this document.
