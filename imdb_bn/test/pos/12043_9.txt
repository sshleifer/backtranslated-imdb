Darr (1993) was an incredible movie. In my opinion, it is one of Bollywood's best. The movie itself empowers sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness, and depression feeling. The role of Shahrukh was incredible, he actually gave emotional a new face. Juhi Chawla is innocent and the opposite of Shahrukh's fierce and enthusiastic character of the girls. Sunny Deol's role seems to be a "bad guy" role in the "good man" role. Shahrukh, not Sunny, took away the audience's attention, proved that everyone has such helpless inner drives that they do not have. Although the film is a few years old, it does not exceed a recent one. The song "Tuare Me Samen" was full of passion and money. His personality perfectly fit the role. He should seriously consider re-acting a similar film.
