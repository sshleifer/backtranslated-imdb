First i am a teenager OK, and I say this movie was quite good. I think it's like a child with ten children and less, but my age can be a little more than a person, Um, a, well, we'll describe the movie as Lam! But I like it. Maybe I can still work like kids, or every weekend I visit a cattle farm, but this movie was beautiful. The performers were like kids, little blond cutesy pies, three levels of clothes, a traditional hat, and almost thousands of oscars (like most of today's show, Drake and Josh, Lizzie Mac Guar, a good show at the kids). And the setting was perfect, But there was an error. The family was in debt, is not it? Why did their internal houses look like something from a "western" Venice store? There was an error <br /> <br /> <br /> The chemo is great, they have almost five hundred, and the only explanatory one is Julia Roberts, a little girl's Auntie. How did they get everyone in the world? This movie seems to have been quite tough. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was a fun to watch, and I thought some parts were too far (a cow sold for 750,000 dollars? ha! My butt sold a cows a lot for that!) But Otherwise it was good, I liked it, and I could see it again. But I do not want to buy it, there's even special features on DVD! What's that with? But rent it, especially if you have little kids around your home.
