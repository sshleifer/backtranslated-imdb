Has anyone ever read or heard of Scorise or David Chase (SopraExchange Producer) about "Death Collector / Family Informer"? I just bought the DVD after watching it on TV (like 20 years), but saw "Goodfellas" and the whole "Soprans". On the clock, both boys have seen death collectors / family enforcers and are probably encouraging their voice for the masterwork, both of which contrast the romanticized Godfather Trilogy's pole. Due to being a jersey guy, it is interesting to see how the jerseys dirt has improved since the mid-70's. This is not a terrible dumping ground. It is used once, though once a body will turn into a local waterway. Also, it's a little bittsweet to see and open a new World Trade Center across the river in the last scene. Who can imagine?
