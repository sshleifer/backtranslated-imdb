I see this movie without much hope, I think everyone will have to do. This is a great TV-Syriac and of course we can not compare it with the wind with the wind, but it's still nice to look at. It's weird to see a different scarlet. Joanne Whalley does not play Scarlett with passion and fire like Varkeuen Lei, but I believe that scarlet shines when grown up. Do not expect to see such things, but do not see it: I think it would be terrible.
