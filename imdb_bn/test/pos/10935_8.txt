An unusual, revisionist West, well worth watching. Despite a slow start, the film produces ?? Very likely no dialogue and with any subtitles ?? A growing and intense portraiture of the almost exterminating atmosphere of the Western desert. Waiting for the rise of main characters is valuable, and strong central cast comes with the true idea of ​​the frustration of the ownership struggle of all important horses. It is interesting how a British director is doing it I hope he is laughing now: I think the film has been largely ignored by contemporary people. But the time its normal pesticide works, and inevitably shines out hidden gold as necessary. One note is blurred for me: revisionism is only carried so far. Sam Waterton as an Indian? - He gave his part drama with real passion and intensity, but really, an American Indian actor can not be found to work? But there is an intimacy in his view with Carolyn Langer, which contrasts nicely with the uncooked landscape around them. <br /> <br /> Forget the big, big-bang bankruptcy of the past, men and rolling music with big chains; This is a fundamental struggle among the sociologists, who robs all the Gulf of the 'normal' way of life, understanding what is valuable to understand. Impressive
