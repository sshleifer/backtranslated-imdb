Asi McGee's Out-Control, Hard-Nassified Detective Based on countless examples from police plays at the end of the 20th century Here is the twist that is literally walking hip. <br /> <br /> The cheap, low-fold mask of the show lies about its cleverness and secret mockery. It can not be said that Asi is free from cruel hatred, only toilet humor is used to laugh harmonically and to be used for eye-roll, consistent laughter. The title of the program shows the cute, fine humor used in the world. This sequence city photos are set in a jazzy 70s cop theme. In one film, a police cruiser is shown and the "camera" is on the front license plate, which is zoomed. Foolish zoom-ins usually scoffs at the production of police plays of the 70s-80s and, eventually, let me laugh at all times. <br /> <br /> All the common characters include: Ashy police chief who can not control Assy; Loyal to the people who work as a foil of Asi's helplessness, minority partner; Regular police who hate money in the money ... All are counted and joyful enemies of all common police plays <br /> <br /> The voice acting mainly performed by Larry Murphy is not spectacular. Asi's voice - With a drunken slur along with a little breathing and mess - with Steve Griffin (Family Guy) and homer Simpson (Simpson) all the time, it's so cute and unique. Although the voice is gradually clear and easy to understand, the voice is gradually clear and easy to understand. This is a great change from the voices of another adult swimming program which often requires close captioning. <br /> <br /> In addition to playing superb production and voice, the script is too ridiculous. Assi's dirty secret is to burn most of the humor, especially in her correlation with the citizens outside the police force. <br /> <br /> If you have access to adult swimming comedy, then Assi McGee must be of course valuable. The clock is only in 8-9 minutes, so you really have a little to lose.
