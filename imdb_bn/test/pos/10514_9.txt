I was not all that influenced by the nightclub, but this one episode stands out. <br /> <br /> Executive is a TV network executive - a young, nerdy boy who earns prognostications. Unless the two prophecies are true in the next morning, the arbitrary elimination of the whole thing as a pale waste. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <Br / <br /> Then, one day, he refused to show up. Coming up to the upcoming short-break, everyone is enduring at the end, even if he does not fulfill his contract and does not make his daily predictions, he is threatening legal action. <br /> <br /> The little boy predicts an awkward prediction tomorrow. <br /> <br /> After the show, the intelligent executive regardless of an explanation, why it is very horrible to reveal the whole truth.
