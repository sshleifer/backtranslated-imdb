Roy Thins and Joan Heckett were fantastic in the 1970's Meldrum. The lovely settings, hunting music, and plot twists make it a really interesting movie. I had seen it before coming out on TV. It was broadcast more when I was VCR, but I did not have the opportunity to tap it. VHS loves it if someone has a copy. Apart from the mysteries (which are worked nicely) I think the story is unique, and it is very true for the book, MRS. Margaret Lin's Matlandan Affair. I would say that it was one of the biggest contro movies of the movies made for the 1970s television. I gave the film # 10, because it was done with such fundamentality. There is a true path and romance wind that is sympathetic to the audience.
