I'm really sorry that this picture received so much negative criticism. I think it's a nice little comedy and really fun. Humor in this movie is warm and innocent and I like it. I like Madonna's character too and she herself does not congratulate herself. She has created a character and a sympathetic. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenery is the fight scene on the sinking car and where Madonna climbs a fancy dress to demand her love. The film's humor touched a little spiritually and probably it is not everyone's cup tea. But this is not their problem, nor the film. <br /> <br /> I found this photo beautiful and sunny. In fact, the day I first saw, I was incredibly sorry for some reason and this movie illuminated my day. And Madonna can work. Just offset your glasses with negative thoughts.
