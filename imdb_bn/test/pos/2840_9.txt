This movie can only cooooo you The image was worth the city's dark travel. Betty (Rene Gelweger) is the only "acceptable" soap group. His character is so captivating and so convincing that you can apologize to yourself as such a fool. I can let myself get lost from the fantasy of Batis, if it is not true that Dr. Revelle's real name is George ... and Satan has said; "Appearance" Greg Kinnear very well met his role. Charlie (Morgan Freeman) wants to wish you the truth of his will, Wesley (Chris Rock) wants to bring him to the chair. And Roza (Tea Texessa) brings you back to that bright grade-school friendship. Sheriff encourages you to eat donuts and to loose his name. The rest of the cast fits well. Never do the same movie twice, the nurse betty exception. These long, cold, winter needs to smile about something.
