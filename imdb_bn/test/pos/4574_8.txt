I would say this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> There is a surveillance of Mike Jazz who will never notice at the office space. Hemes is a statement about dumbling society and dreams of the perfect life in 500 years is only a dream of pipe. Those pop culture and wealthy companies tend to rule the day of mass marketing. Yes there is a lot of humor in it and the story is moving and its point is involved. But the real disappointment in the face of private Joe Bauers is invaluable and in some cases we can all relate to our times at any given time. <br /> <br /> If you do not enjoy the humor see it from a different perspective and see it again. Is this my picture really worth seeing for twice ?? And after seeing it double? I'm going to read a book now.
