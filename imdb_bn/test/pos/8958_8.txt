The story of homosexuals is very good, the abstract former teen star, now the table is waiting. Sexual obscurity is actually explored here with reality and with real human face. This is loose, and throw in a serial killer, and you have love and resemains people. A well illustrated drama, humorous and a strange sense of mystery. The screenplay is fluid and reliable. Performance is better than average, and the twists of the story are sharp. <br /> <br /> This is not the ideal idea for everyone in the movie, but for those who appreciate something different and intelligently written, it's much more of your time. Highly recommended.
