Awesome horror fans, especially Asian awful fans, I've seen a number of movies, but it's a great movie. Why? It has a plot (unfortunately which is unfortunately rare in movies). Actors did a good job. It seems like a real documentary film (even if it is not). It's not annoying for a moment. The director shines a conspiracy with the activity of a certain Japanese magic worship (probably this religion was never present, but still reliable). This reminds me of the same great movie "Forbidden Siren". <br /> <br /> To me, the film's only and annoying thing was Hari, characteristic character, but it was subjective. <br /> <I / I recommend this movie to fans of this quality dawn. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
