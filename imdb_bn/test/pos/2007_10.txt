Illustrated by pain is one of the best pieces of movies I have ever seen. My reviews of the episodes published so far are: <br /> <br /> I was even better than the episode and I have hoped a lot more than what I heard. I'm already very impressed with the actors. The father was unclear and played perfectly. The little girl is so sensible, she uses her eyes to express such emotions. Animation was fantastic. The cinematography was amazing, capturing apparently the sensation of each camera angle. The edit has been so good, combining each scene continuously in the next. The music holds quite good emotions and the stories you paint. I just could not say enough about how wonderful this episode is. It's definitely hungry for more! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first episode! All that I said about the first episode carries everything, only you can see more of the character's development. I can not wait to finally see episode 3, or wait for that topic to see the rest of the series. What's a big developing, character driven story with all the trappings of Hollywood production, but without protests. It is said, with so many words. This series is something you have never seen and can not achieve real success. <br /> <br /> This episode is awesome! No other words describe it! How nice! Everything I said about previous episodes is true, and it was even better! I do not know how to take something amazing and manage to make it even better! More character development proves that it is a full-fledged character-driven piece. Sinemetography always excels it like this and you draw in emily's pain, fear, hatred and emotional roller coaster. I can not wait to see Episode 4 ... or to see the rest of the series. You've really outdone yourself! <br /> <br /> As far as I liked the other episodes, Part 4 is still the best. I love the progress of the letters. I really think Emily, her pain, and her inner struggle have come to know. The other theme I've stated in the past review is continued. Great painter, the writing is awesome, the actors are fine with their paintings and the characters themselves, and the animation is just awesome! Another great job from the DBP crew!
