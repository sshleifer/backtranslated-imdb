After the execution of Louis Jawsy in the second year of the French Republic, established in 1794, the film was played by revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at its best) and Raspisier (which showed the difference between performances between Polish actors Wazichek's commanding performance) Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton returned to Paris from his country seat, where he was ousted as leader of the public security committee by Robespiere in the previous year. He opposed "the reign of terrorism", which resulted in the execution of thousands of people, mainly by the guillotine, who are considered opposed to the revolution. Danton is confident about supporting the general public and is trying to persuade Robespeare to control blood pressure. But Robespier and the Committee are afraid that they will be overthrown by Danton's popularity, and Danton and his supporters will be brought to justice as judges. Andrzej Wajda made the first French-language film after coming to Poland from France. His support for the Solidarity Trade Union closed its Polish film company, which opposed the Polish government at the end of the seventeenth and early detention. His earlier film "Man of Iron" (1981) took Solidarity Union and its leader Leech Wells and it is easy to compare between Welsh relations and Polish leader General Jarsselski and Danton and Robespierre. Danton / Wellsara is the cause of opposition to Robespierre / Jarsselsk, who continue to rule in spite of losing their support in support of the demand for representation. The film was based on the Polish player "Danton Affair" written in the 1930s by Stanislawwa Prizebijusekka, and due to its release some people were criticized for being static and dramatic. But instead of the activities behind the movie-scene meetings and on the streets of Paris, focus on the views of the parliament and the courts.
