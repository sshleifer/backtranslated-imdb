Like all good art, this movie can mean different things to different people. It means to me that by failing to open your heart to others, you can loot happiness and you can leave it with just a life. For the sake of selfishness it is like junk food: it feels good, but eventually it can make you sick. <br /> <br /> Almost everything I see in the United States, it's a commercial mass generating waste, shallow drama, and stupid trick, and this sensitive, deep and poetic movie really touches me.
