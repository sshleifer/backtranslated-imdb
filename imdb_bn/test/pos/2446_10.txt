Do I want to know whether the "outsiders" (Australian TV series) will be released in the future DVD? And the song is available in the music (title theme) CD? <br /> <br /> This play was a series of only 13 episodes and at least three or four series went away. <Br /> <br /> The German German actor of the series was also involved in a German television series called "Black Forest Clinic" on the German blog, which is circulated with leap-sync through the English dialogue in the UK. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting to hear any comments from TV industry staff on the above question, thanks in advance.
