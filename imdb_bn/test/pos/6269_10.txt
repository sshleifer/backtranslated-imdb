Bloodmasters are definitely a memorable entry in the movies of swords and museums. I was very happy to have a bladmaster with Quest for the glorious Sward in a sharp shop in the presence of mentally challenged people and paying 2.00 for them. Trustworthy sets and dresses, well-fought fight and a beautiful female warrior, make it an enjoyable watch. Although there were some problems, there were many details of the plot which was not quite useful, as for the cave men. I did not understand their motives Also, this movie can really benefit from some other monsters. The snake was quiet, but I think it borrowed a little from Canaan. However, any primitive movie where anyone who airs with the hangars is fine by me (see Yor and Battle for End). I think it's cool! Oh, anybody else reminded of the villain's gallery or is it just me? I'm giving the blackmasters 7/10
