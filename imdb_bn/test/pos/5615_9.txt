I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm not a classical music fan. Strict street kids were not very good at discovering classical music and changing their ways, although it was sensitive or too incredible, although some details poured me over my head (Frankie and his dog could be at the school's foundation without a school. Did he discover that he had eaten? Bath? Did he ever have to change clothes? Did he give his dog food, was it not important to inform the police that the school owner was absent, son, but live in heaven? :-)) But we can slide such unreasonable details and just enjoy the touch, fun and little suspicious (for me, anyway) stories and fantastic talented children. <br /> <br /> I like this scene with my mother standing on my shoulder and police do not enter the school, leaving the police step by step step by step! And I like to kiss Frankie's son on the table by stealing his tablets (though he has never gone anywhere), and Francis's friends end up helping him. <br /> <br /> Everyone, movies for everyone!
