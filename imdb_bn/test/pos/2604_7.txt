After the "Fifty-Foot Women Assault" with Alison Hayes, men opened men's doors to dangerous men, perhaps carrying an open market and torch for other movies, and to play the role of a beautiful actress more than Dorothy Provin, "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, From "Mad World" The downsize that cute and blond Provine might just be looking at step in the very sweet and innocent Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really requires somebody with an amount of sex appeal compromise; Provine more girl type type. He can take this role to prove that he might be sexy and may be done, but lets him down the material. Lou Castello has proved that he can make a movie without the band Abbott, and he also has a dramatic role in some of his scenes, when he did not see Gordon in the cheek as a frontrunner for him. Gordon, however, all he can do is frustrating, annoying and pushy, he created the same character on "Lucy Show" at the same time. Charles Lane also performs the same role as his: a straight man, and his screen time is limited. Special effects are convincing for that time, but I'd love Dorothy's cheesecloth and dressing a little more than it was and allowed to be at least dangerous. As the main character of the film, he made a second billing to Costello, who has disappeared like a sub-plot several times with Dorothea. It can not decide whether it is ok to combine the whole film. It is a parody of science fiction, comedy or allison hees classic. There are a lot of good scenes, some funny comedians and some ridiculous camps affect the rest of the film. Yet, I like this movie to empower women; There is not enough movie like this one. If this film had the opportunity to rebuild today, I would highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the main roles and allow me to write the entire script perfectly. Cartoon is the top of my list of my actors who I can believe and will eat adequately fantastic giants; However, I must admit that if Titanic beautiful Alison or Dorothy comes after me, I'll be silent !!
