I have seen this movie as a child almost 30 years ago, and today I have not forgotten it. I could not say it's a good picture. But in those days I fell in love with Gene Simmons. The memories focus on the film's very lover's feelings, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was very young and another film that gave me a similar feeling: David Lin's great prospect. And again it was Gene Simmons. It is unfortunate that Blue Lagoon is not available on video; I want to correct my memory ...
