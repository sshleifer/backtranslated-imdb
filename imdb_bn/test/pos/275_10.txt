I've seen it as a child and I like it and it makes me scared till it gets older, I tried to find the movie and even tried to search it again on TV, because it actually played in the United States network. Anyone knows where to buy this movie, or would anyone have it and would like to make a copy for me? Does anyone know if there is a chance to play on TV again? Probably all of us need to write a station in hopes of wind. I do not think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows, only Steppeford's wife and Stephen Wharf are known to the filmmakers. Familiar with known that there was no child version. Perhaps they seem to have rebuilt it after doing so much with my favorite old thriller / horror flip. Well if someone has any input please let me enter with eggplant information. Thanks Taira tcampo23@aol.com
