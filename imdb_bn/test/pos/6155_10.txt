I saw this picture in Wales in July. It confronts the courage of Czech pilots, who carry out many missions for RAF after their country is occupied by the Nazis. In this film, in the early 1950s, the pilot was beaten to death in the political prison in Kakeskolabakia and during World War II. After returning to their country, they were imprisoned because the Samyabadi regime saw these fighters as threatening to take over them by Sejeskolabakia. Pilots maintain their dignity and during the numerous air warfare against Nazi pilots. This picture contains a love sub-plot that can be understood because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers have sacrificed a lot to protect democracy. At the end of this film, it indicates that the heroes of this Czech pilot were finally recognized after the restoration of democracy, known as Sijkoslavvakia in the early 1990's. This powerful and moving movie was created with Czech government's financial support. I highly recommend this film.
