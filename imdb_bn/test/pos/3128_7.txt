Western can be divided into many sub-series. One of the broad categories is in Town Westerns and plain Westerns. Most of the Western is a mixture of both, but at one end of the spectrum there are pictures like hi-nun and Rio Bravo which are almost completely disposable and rarely out of the way. On the other hand, you are like Wagon Master, where there is not only a residence in the desert. <br /> <br /> Directors John Ford typically emphasizes their "small" both on the west, and then they are contrary to wide open extras, which are both exciting and dangerous. Wagon Master has a generic Frank Nugent script, among which there are some interpolation between older old and green young people, but it still presents Ford with some new challenges. In this film, the danger does not come from the roughness of the landscape, they come from the group in the form of Cleggses. What's more, the absence of the real interior scene can mean losing its influence over time abroad. <br /> <br /> However, while manipulating the place, Ford was a real gentleman. He painted the scene of the camp or wagon so the frame is enclosed and we can get the same feeling of the house as an actual interior. Also, compared to the other western region, he did not actually open the space very much, instead of crossing the wings and bare plains, the wagon trill crosses the canyon and passes. In a few moments, when he sees the wide open space of the landscape, the attention of Indians is drawn and there is a possibility of threats from outside. <br /> <br /> The Wagon Master has some amazingly effective moments in Comic Relief and some great contributions from quirky cast. Harry Carey Junior was shaped up in a pivotal actor like his PK, and this is one of his best initial roles. Joan Drook was frustrated to draw a yellow ribbon, but she appeared more easily as a character with a little surprise, and in fact it's fairly good here. Just a decade ago, Jane Darwell won the Oscars in John Ford-led wine of aggression, where he appeared with the only function of an ongoing joke, where he heard a weak old horn. Still, with his great time and movement he makes the piece works. Francis Ford is one of the many silent drunk plays in his younger brother's film. Her <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And now we've come to lead John Ben Johnson. Although he was not a bad actor, he is not going to be a big star like John Wayne. And yet, with his effortless races and accessible drill, he was one of the most trusted "West" players around. And this brings me to the final point. Despite it seems fairly unassuming, apparently Ford was one of the personal favorites. Wagon Master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity, it is simply playing itself in style. I think this is what Ford chose about. This is not John Waynes or Henry Findas, Ben Johnson and Harry Kerry photos. Opportunity is small, but worthy of its class.
