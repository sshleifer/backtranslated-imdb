I have never read the book, but I always heard something good about it. So when the movie comes out I'm going to see it, but never did it. Now it has come out of the DVD and I have thought of rental for a few weeks now. Last night I finally picked it up. I am so glad that I did. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was incredible in this movie. Scenery, etc .. All of you think that you were Kabul. Acting was all very good, although I'm certain that some emotions are lost in translation. And the story itself was good and pure and lifting. Yes the story was very sad, but at the same time rising up. <br /> <br /> And I'll be honest, as a white American ... ... I have shown me near Kabul and Afghanistan that I have never seen in my picture. I showed Afghanistan before the Taliban. I have been shown a beautiful place. I have been shown a place with good heartfelt people. I was like a community that was away from some bullshit. <br /> <br /> However, I recommend this movie to everyone. It's the best one I've ever seen
