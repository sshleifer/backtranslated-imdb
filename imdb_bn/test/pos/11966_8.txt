I'm in Russia, East Germany or other countries, collected from a complete musical comedy throughout the sitting, the nearly decade-long, often promotional film, fascist-fascist films, war movies (the film direction as), which only reflect the Stalin under the dark, hateful Time And the life behind the Iron screen. Then, to see the other side of the coin, curiosity and rebels trying to see them through the music and not being able to walk the path of socialist society, people often try too. In fact, the film seems to be rather impressive, yali phelojake musical creators as a small group of pioneers in the Gregori alekajandabhera. ক্লিপ (গুলি) থেকে আমি সেই চলচ্চিত্রটি দেখেছি, আমি হতাশ হব যে এটি কেবলমাত্র নিজের থেকে বেরিয়ে আসার একমাত্র কাজ এবং কেবল বন্য, মানসিক, মেক-হাস-হাসির ধরনে গিয়েছিল। But this picture shows, if you want to make a filmmaker entertainment it is good with a 'message'. Through interviews <br /> <br /> Sometimes, a little drama (Russia / Germany /, etc.), image association) censorship on the table, and the clips, behind the scenes and what was on the screen, both for its sheer entertainment for the whole picture Gets the public. Some movies (well, most of them, apparently only 14 years in 14 countries, have been seen significantly) have made a good part of the change, but for what purpose? It can also be grasped in all its cultures, how different is this different from that of America's 'America if it's functioning, but how it's hot'. But at the same time, perhaps this was out of suppression, some interesting, interesting, and (which I saw) was made up-of-bit movies. Stalin's love, but how ordinary they were shown to meet the requirements of living conditions with the tractor, were fairly common. এটি এমনকি একটি গল্প এমনকি juicier হতে পায় যদিও আমরা 60 এর মধ্যে কি ছিল তা দেখানো হয়েছে, বাদ্যযন্ত্র comedy এর শেষ তরঙ্গ হিসাবে, শিলা এবং রোল এবং পপ টিউন অবশেষে তাদের airwaves আঘাত। <br /> <br />, some good things ... but only if interested, really. I have been shown the film in a classical documentary movie, and half the classes fell asleep. So be careful on one hand, on the other hand if it is searched, but it can create a rewarding tour in European history.
