Now I have seen it, I was not what I expected, at least not until the end. I have read some other reviews before choosing this copy from Ammozon and I was happy. Starting with the first work of the park through Old Boulder, I was surprised to learn how I would deal with this section and remained silent as he implemented it. I think the park has become a presentation because while working on a very nice and deliberate camera work in Oldburgh and many other works, there are some excellent innovations in Baku that I have seen in other vamp films. For example, where Haiyan feels increasingly "animal" feeling in her, she always gave her shoes on barefoot and she was able to see the blood pumping through the blood of her eyes and blood in her blood. for this. That was a nice effect. I am very happy that the park was not outside the CJ movie, and it is actually a little CG. I am going to be one thing and have come out completely from Bakuvi to take the journey to the true park fashion. In addition, I like the park played a little bit on the opposite and opposite side, but generally it is not Asian movie. At the beginning of the film we see that gradually develops and characters are known and you think that the sender is an invisible observer. The park treats you little like Christmas Ghost, although it's coming to show you, though it's a little annoying, your life is outside of your world. Ah, but then we started to feel a little relation with his relationship with the father and the growing desire of Taj-Zu and the conflict with the priest's responsibility. We started to basically start for them until we return to this wonderful surprise in the park, and we can actually see that Bacquiao is a film about moral conflict and right and wrong. If I tell you to watch Bazui from the psychology of the priest, then it will not loot and I think that you will be going to a park where you go. Do not expect old man and stylishness because you can not find it here. Actually take a very interesting over the genre. Those who missed many literary elements and religious emotions, they saw any other movie, not Balki. After the conversation, once to the right, let's see, this is also not what you expect.
