Spain's former sailor Ramon Sampdro (Xavier Bardem) has been quadruple for eighteen years and is fighting in court for the right to debate through a friendship, who protects the freedoms of freedom and his friend Gane (Clara Segura). Ramon is launching a lawyer that is protecting his cause, Julia (Belén Rueda), has a degenerative fatal disease; And Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a solo activist who has been abused by men. Their relationships change the behavior and attitudes of Rosa and Julia's life. <br /> <br /> According to Chilean Alejandro Amenber, the best contemporary director. The release of the Brazilian film is extraordinary and composed by the original films: "Abre los ozos", "Tesses", "The Anaas" and "Mar Adentro". Now Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain In their cooperation this highly sensitive drama is a very polymic theme, the right to make euthanasia. This play is never curly or depressing, because the screenplay uses humor as a symptom valve in the most dramatic situations. Cast performance is perfect, with the character and defense of various locations related to this unpleasant theme. Dialog and line are very difficult and intelligent. I mentioned in the outline of the IMDB plot that this film is based on the real life story of Ramon Samadoro. Unfortunately, movies or DVDs do not give this important information. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Maret Adentro" ("Inside the Sea")
