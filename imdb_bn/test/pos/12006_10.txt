Probably the experience of hellfire living under communal rule, which is always inherent. Although, it seems difficult to believe, all of it has happened, the reality is actually worse than the movie. It is similar to Orwellian fiction, this is not just any fiction. John's heart is always as nice. Yes, screenplay is not full of action, but life does not. Plot is breathtaking. Yes, people were shot, yes thousands of them. Their 'offense' they wanted to leave the Communist 'Paradise' without official approval. Sometimes the film produces tears in your eyes. We really need more movies to give us what America supplies for us. Nice movie, highly recommended! God bless our country, United States!
