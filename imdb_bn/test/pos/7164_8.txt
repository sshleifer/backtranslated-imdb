I originally saw this movie as Blockbuster VHS Rental. That's some time ago, but still remember it. Blockbuster is no longer there. Netflix did not have it and there was not much copy on the web - just a few expensive VHS copies. Recently it is available in DVD form at reasonable price (in DVD player, but our DVD player will play play disks on our NTSC TV). <br /> <br /> Both the wife and I have enjoyed it. The film's style is a bit tough, and many parts are not performed much, but it is more like acting, as amusement makes it (especially kids), but it is not boring. The contradictions of society are restricted to overplay. <br /> <br /> It is not saying that in Russia the youth will not try to escape from their extraordinary life, rather they should try at least the best things first. But that's not dominant. It's mostly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some comments on the West have been commented by others, not all IMOs, I accept this as a comment about the prospect of Russian characters. At least when taken from my western perspective Perhaps it is a downplay of the West by a Russian perspective (which is literally by the words it literally). <br /> <br /> I can not say how film subtitle films are fluent, but I can tell that subtitles are done very well, through English figurines such as a native English speaker - complete with "colorful" language .
