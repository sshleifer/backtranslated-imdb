Motorama viewers will already be interested in other off-grade B-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which takes place less or less in the desert). It modeles the funny comedies (and especially the radioactive paths of characters) of the author's 'Seamless Hours' by the writer Joseph Minion. As a metaphor for desert roads, as a metaphor for fantasy, Gass (played by Jordan Christopher Michael), a cute 10 year old son Cassage in his piggy bank, steals a whistle, and his fairly neglected parent It started out through the Liberation War (which is visible with John Dyal's view), but once he entered a scratch-off game called Motram, he easily painted by temptation and lost his child's innocence. He travels from a crazy fiction state to a motor madness card from the participating gas station, in another great way, that he will be able to make a prize-winning motormam and earn a $ 500 million cash prize. In addition, he has teamed up with some strange characters such as Floye, who suddenly plays a little boy, MetLife, who is a crazy bicker, and Mary Vernonov and Sandie Baron (a Sainfieldfield regular) acted as two violent abductors. . <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It is a love story with taglines, which means it is the newest with boldness to meet his dream girl about Jordan Michael Christopher ... which, in spite of the size of the DVD cover, it is only a second, as a fantasy girl of Camo Drew Barrymore, Gus dream. Why did they just do it for the market? It may seem completely bizarre at first sight, it's actually a well planned narrative. <br /> <br /> Fantastic elements for fans of wonderful B-grade comedy. It was a funny story, and especially its main actor Jordan Michael Christopher (who unfortunately got a few screen credits in the note) - and the underlying complex metaphor of the plot. Hopefully it will be easier to find the Creator's fans if it is republished in DVD.
