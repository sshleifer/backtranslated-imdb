I thought it was a wonderful written movie. I love a little scamp, and the street-based angel. This movie is very easy to understand little kids, but also good movies for adults. I liked this movie because it's the original lady and tramp, and that movie is classic. The adventure of Lady and Tramp 2 scamp was filled with new characters, interesting songs, bright animations, and unforgettable classic characters. I saw the first time since I liked the movie. I like how they show different personality in each character. It can also show you the hassle of making new friends and good things. My favorite song in the movie was always because it different characters share their opinions and show how they feel. I certainly recommend this movie for everyone for the original lady and a fan of the tramp.
