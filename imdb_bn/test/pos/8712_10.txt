A superb movie. BB is a wonderful. She is proud She is a feminist. She is still too much in love. <br /> <br /> This movie is in 50's in Paris. Sites, cars (DS!) And Orli are great to see <br /> <br /> is a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy. The music is awesome It almost dissonates On the other hand, it's ridiculous. But perhaps this is the only thing, looking at it with at least the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The film commented on the French method of betraying. It's modern modern Anne Huffett She Trump Enormant, a movie like this, did it in the 80's. But the basic foundation is the same. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the manufacturers for supplying this opportunity to BBQ.
