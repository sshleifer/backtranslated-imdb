Carefully forward spoilers ?? .. for the second time saw 'joe'. There was an air force 30+ years ago for the first time. Air Force Overkote with Tech was reminded me. Sergeant Wove wore by boyfriend / dealer; For the first time we were very pleased with the air force on the screen because it was a 'life' post. Over the years, I have taken several pictures from the picture. Most executive builders were absolutely beautiful and weak girls. Someone else commented, you can not close her eyes. I still can not understand that this is the 20-year-old Susan Sarandan in his first movie. When he looked like that, he did not have more movies what a loss. I also recall the rebellion of being a neighbor hero playing the title of right-handed gunnut like Peter Baell. Unlike Georgie C Scott, Dr. General playing in Strangelove and Patton. And of course, the end of this despair made the lasting impression. <br /> <br /> 30+ years ago it was the most talked about acting about the base. We thought it was a great movie and I was reluctant to see it again because I was afraid that it would be a frustrating day like Easy Rider. But today I am surprised to see how well the film has been made. When Sarandon is with him, he has to think of going out of the bathroom immediately with a boyfriend, but with a bit of holes it is a very strong script. <br /> <br /> Why is this picture still so entertaining? I have to think it has something to do with perfect physical casting. Joel was as physically believable as Joe (others mention his screenplay that a few years later, Archie inspires the character of Banga). Ted Knight modeled his 'cadshash' character-judge Smile after Dead Patrick's advertising editor 'Joe'? They look single and sound similarly. Patrick Wrap-was very credible as a very high-middle-aged executive. And with the doll the doll, innocent men in the eye of innocent Surdon have expressed a reaction to the audience-perfect casting. <br /> <br /> Nude and drug scenes really hold (they were very excited for their day) and clear as anything found in thirteenth. The only issue on the date of this movie is not violent, realistic or graphic. 'Joe' was almost 'The Wild Bunch' at the same time, and the vocal violence of the film simply started to change. <br /> <br /> Another reason for this picture is that in the last few years, events have highlighted the theme of this movie and the relevance of the context. The film depicts both types of 'conservatives', horrified and counter-culture abnormally abhorrent; And filled with jealousy at their free and hedonistic lifestyle. The parallel culture is portrayed as mockery; And although the paranoid towards the conservatives (legally given that only a few months after the Kentucky State) they could not leak their life by trying to oppose it. The political landscape is not different after 30+ years. I'm not sure that the conservatives are jealous of young people and libertarians by the 1970s, but they are afraid and hate them more. <br /> <br /> In the early 1970's, it was a wonderful picture to surprise.
