After reading such negative news in the film over the years, I always avoided it, but the advent of cheap public domain DVD encouraged me to finally see it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it has been transferred from a poor copy. The modern prequel, tinted on the stock, blurry and contrast, exists. Sometimes it is difficult to face occasionally. Not to say that the real story is entertaining and Lau has been added as a full-fledged actor, more than most of the boys. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Most hues are orange or brown. Green vegetables looks especially bad. <br /> <br /> The monster maiden as Dorothy Ford, 'The Polly', was a big plus for me because I enjoyed her first 'Andy Hardy' look. <br /> <br /> Many negative comments link to the actual quality of the printing, I'm still happy to give this movie 7. It gave me a lot of laughter and could manage more comedy than I saw. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance.
