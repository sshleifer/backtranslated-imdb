This was definitely not my kind of movie, but my husband watched on TV and it was really good. So, on the basis of his recommendation, I bought a copy, because I do not know whether it will be on TV. I did not hear anyone other than Arms Assange. At first, it took me a long time in the story, because the first part of the movie is a quarrel of imagination - and it does not make much sense. It is only after the movie that it all comes together. The scene-cutting-if it's called it is a bit flashing - sometimes it seems that some frames are cut in every scene and the scene is thrown - but I guess it has been added to add abnormality (if it is a word) . The story goes here and there, and the exact time it has come out to you all the time, everything goes upside down and you have to adjust your thinking about who is bad guy and who does not. Or bad woman. Acting is very good - I remember how much Norman Raidas looks like Dispiero. The end is a real bend, completely unexpected, which I liked. A good show
