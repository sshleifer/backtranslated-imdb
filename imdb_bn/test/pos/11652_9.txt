Team Robbins makes an amazing film. His wife (Susan Sarandon) gave a wonderful performance to sister Helen Perizan, who wants to help Matthew Poncelet (Shan Pen) on the charge of murder, and her injection will also die ... What did you find in 120-minute epic and touching scenes? Great acting and it's a movie which gives something to think! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandan is the best actress Oscar for 1995. It's probably one of perhaps perhaps one of his greatest films. <br /> <br /> I did not see 'The Cradle Rock Rock' but I definitely want to see more pictures of Robinson. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 9/10 or *** 1/2 4. Go out and see .....
