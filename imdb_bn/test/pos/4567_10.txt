Claudine is presenting a movie that is the worst American system at it. The welfare measures were initially set up as a stepping stone for their families, who needed extra hand to return to their feet. The film has shown how to break the family unit in an accurate picture. In other words, if a man or a man has a person in the life of a woman or a child, then the risk will be only to reduce their financial support from the system. The struggle of the poor is seen all over the world. I would like to see the reproduction of the stores in the stores to rent or buy everyone for the film's collection of their library.
