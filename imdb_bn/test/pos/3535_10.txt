I saw the Messiah: - The first kill and I thought it was always the best program I saw. This is a program that you think that, no, I can not see the rest but you have seen it only because it is forced to see it. Jamie Drewne was an amazing actress in it, able to switch between two complete, completely different characters, one of which is the evil, painful person and the other one by Judge Clifton, the police. To be able to do it, well, I will certainly not be able to do it, whatever without the crack. I really love and care for Jamie Drownen with my heart and I always end up, I think that Jamie is the world's sweetest, engaging, sexiest man. I love Jamie in Ultimate Force because he wore he was a black angel. I love jammy love paula drowne <br /> -X-
