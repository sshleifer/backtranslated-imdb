My sister, friend and I went to see this movie on September 24th for my birthday. We first saw the first "Jackass" movie, and we all enjoyed it. We were really two numbers ahead. <br /> <br /> We were not frustrated <br /> <br /> I started smiling fiercely from the beginning. It is not even for those with equal parts and suddenly, though, and definitely those with weak stomaches. It's obscene, but it's also a great film of American film ... Well, it's probably very much appreciated for a movie, where people deliberately keep their scrootom in ice sculptures, but it is suddenly surprised that it looks like we disrespect it or No, see the courage to show us a "honest" American film that is released nationwide The. <br /> <br /> The only scene was that I felt that it was unnecessarily obscene, and it was a horse - <br /> <br /> I got laughing. I laughed, walked around and wept weeping (from a physical reaction to seeing a rash and eye sight, not depression). My sincere opinion, "Jacques: Number Two" is '06. <br /> <br /> <br /> Did it make me a jack? Probably. But if it is, I can really care less.
