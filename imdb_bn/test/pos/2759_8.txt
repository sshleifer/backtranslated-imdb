This game is very good for the N64. You can skate as Tony Hawke, Bob Burkiewist, Steve Cabellero, Karim Campbell, Eric Coston, Bucky Leses, Ron Glyphberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elisa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad MÃ¼cca, and probably some others. The game does not have Mike V. or Left Margera. Dang! Well whatever the gameplay is awesome A great level with a lot of level school second skate. In carrier mode, you collect skate, get money, get high scores and get other things in 2 minutes. There is a skater, which is pretty cool I created a scatter called Butt Mulligan, a black guy with Afro and a girl board. Park editor, some cool pudded parks, free skates, and there is a single session where you can skate for 2 minutes and get scores. You can see the replacement, which is always cool. Each skater has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics are not that good. Well, they are good for a n64 game. I had a controller pack so I could store my data. Overall, this game is cool. I give it an 8/10 for the N64. But with the GBA version it's fun like the N64 version, but it's hard to control regularly. I give it a 7/10 for GBA. So, go to a place that still sells N64 games and chooses a copy. There is a version for PS1.
