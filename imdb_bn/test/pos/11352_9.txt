When I was fascinated by the movie, I said to myself, "This is how a movie can be made." Wang Kar Yi has captured the fantastic poetic love story throughout life and even after the movie. I must admit it is one of the best love movies, probably the best, I have ever seen. Content and form perfectly overlaps. Seeing secret love, we see the characters in the frame that restrict their movement and their feelings. The beautiful camera makes the angle and light even touchable feeling and blues. I want to congratulate Christopher Dyl and Pin Bing Leo who created the mood of love for their extraordinary film. The music also defines the sadness of the love of the game near the beautiful slow-motion frame, and shows letters in desperation mood. And of course the performance of the actor is what makes love so real. Finally, all the elements of the film meet perfectly in the direction of WKW and call the audience as love.
