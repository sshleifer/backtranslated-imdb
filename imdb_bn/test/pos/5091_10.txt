This is a really wonderful love story I liked the song, but if you do not, you will still love the story. Peter O'Toole is doing his best and Petula Clark is working well. I first saw it at the age of 13 and then liked it. Now in my fifty years, I still enjoy it, probably more. Still makes me cry and smile and feel good. It is simply a movie to watch as a chick flick with it or herself as a flick. But what's wrong with that? A little romance and maybe a little tears, try this movie. <br /> <br />
