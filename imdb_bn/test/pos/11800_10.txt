Such an awesome movie - I was transfixed full time and so emotionally defeated end! Two young male actors in the movie were not mandatory for their performance because their friendships and each other's support were quite credible and I think compared to the lives of their own home / discrimination versus health conditions were so real among them. To bring this movie back to life, perhaps the actor, the EP, the producer, the writer, the director and all the producers as a team effort, say, "Good play!" Missed credit at the beginning of the movie (It is shown in HBO), I was so surprised that I had to search the Internet on the Internet (though briefly) to find the title of this movie - something that should be known by some of the great - a film that needs to be republished Clear indication!
