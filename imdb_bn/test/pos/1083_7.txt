Again I would play something contradarian. Most of the reviews have been very positive for the technology. Mine is positive, but only slightly. 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a "C" letter grade from me. <br /> <br /> It seems that a lot of praise is basically one of the two reasons: one that is more realistic than Bollywood's original film, and two, trying to do it differently. <br /> <br /> I did not care less about the first issue. I'm not looking for realism in movies, and so I do not score high for a movie that shows a story and character that I believe in the real world - I'm supernatural, fantasy, big fan of irrationality, and so, I really dislike real true real movies But <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am commendable for dissenting on behalf of the other party . However, I do not think the beginning of "versatility" versus itself is for a good or bad movie. Just as a film can be "original" and poor, just as a movie source can be excellent and excellent. How important is the picture to be set and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarded the audience is. <br /> <br /> Based on a real story based on the story of Dr. Naik, the police in Mumbai, Abd Rak Chapan . Naik was a "facing expert". "Judge Dredds", the original real-time expedition specialist of the real world, trained experts to work like their offenders and gang members, and is basically licensed to kill the police - judge, judge, jury and executor of the moment. After the narrative narrative of the encounter clash expert Saadya Weasheer (various stakeholders) after the ab tech chapana. We see him in work, his colleagues are involved in specialist and violence. We see him in the house, try to live a normal life in a less luxurious neighborhood. We see that half of them are trying to coordinate a new "commissioner" through the film. And we can see his strange relationship with an infamous Indian gangster, Don Jimmy Jafar (Prasad Purvardhar). <br /> <br /> There is a possibility of creating an incredible, great movie about all of these. I say that generally abandoning Bollywood musical numbers and romances is very good - every film does not need such elements; Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for his music or romance or background or background as well as to be left in many films directed or produced. In addition, there are some good performances of Abo Choppan - Patkar has almost done Charles Branson Vib of Death Wish (1974). It also has pretty cinematography - for example, the hand held staff was especially effective at the beginning of the film. This is a great score that mixes more of a moody Hollywood-sounding action / crime score with traditional Indian instruments and methods. There have been incidents of violence and malicious acts. <br /> <br /> There are excellent interpretations of dialects of interviews, including the morality of the experts, the idea of ​​the following commands, etc. Face-to-face experts clearly show themselves to be divorced from right and wrong ideas. More poignantly, the film blindly follows the order of merit questions. The parallel between the underline experts is that it is said that members of the armed forces of the country, and we have shown that it can be a situation of corruption. <br /> <br /> But (you only knew that "but" is coming, is not it?) Director Shimit Amin and his authors have created many stories with many letters, much more has spread and it is running very slow. All these issues may have been looking at Amin and Krew Godfather movies, which have some (at least patron) compatibility to Abul Taq Chapan, although from the point of view of the police. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> For one, Narayan, I do not know who he was by at least half of the film. His name has been mentioned many times, but the scene will change until I only get his glimpses. Then all of us would like to change clothes again and wanted to find Narayan who wanted to start. <br /> <br /> The same thing happened with the first commissioner of Agag. The film was already in the new commissioner before I could find out the relationship. It seems that every scene has new characters. We do not learn most of them stories. Since some of these may have artistic qualifications, because the face-to-face experts are killing most people who they do not know about (because they are doing so on most orders), because we do not learn much about most of the face specialists, it is difficult to find caring letters, and This is not exactly a secret movie. <br /> <br /> Initial fame Jamiere. But by almost half of the film, there is no indication. She will not get much screen time more than parading her through other villains movies, and she literally "promotes her performance" - she is in some other place (Dubai) in the field of telephone communication. We are not actually seeing a lot of things in the jammy. In most cases the film rely on some "twists" which do not require much of the jammy, but we can see other things in it, and many other villains can be omitted. <br /> <br /> It will make the film a little harder, it will be more attentive and about half an hour will be small, both of which will benefit its effect. This is not an action-packed film in any way. At least for the first 45 minutes or more, I would appreciate myself a significant style of Ab Chuck Chapan, but say, "Okay, take this story already."
