This is one of my favorite "Cappara-Esk" comedy. Not to enjoy this movie, not deconstruct, microscopical analysis. This is not a religious commentary. It's a fun. Imagine it Wonderfully negative comments (IMHO) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have driven us to think of each movie as part of the film. <br /> <br /> Others describe the role of Trivalter (this is why you will see over the movie) and Cast (with Sparky!) with excellent supporters. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a cigar is simply a cigar; Sometimes a movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
