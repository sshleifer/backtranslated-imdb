My two daughters (11 and 13 years old) and I was lucky to see the screening of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how funny and funny this movie was. David Duchowy was very attractive, male and female drivers gave him generally skillful performance. Most of the scenes are laughing funny fun - especially in a scenario minisan driver's colleague has completed "replacements". I liked it as a film that I can see with my children and I do not feel embarrassed by any scenes. Everyone in the movie theater was cheerful and enjoying themselves. Bunny Hunt up thumb!
