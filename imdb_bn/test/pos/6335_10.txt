The strange monster "The Gentleman" captures the population of Sunnydale to steal the human heart without screaming. According to a legend of giles, if a lady screams, the animals will be destroyed, but with Riley Buffy and her friends, demons demons will fight to fight. <br /> <br /> "Hash" is certainly the best episode of Buffy fourth season until this moment. Lots of humor and funny situations, I like so much. Spike ridiculous, romance between Xander and Anya calm, but I eventually loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley. The Gothic scene of the final war against "Gentlemen" reminds the atmosphere of "Dark City". My vote ten <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Silencio" ("Silence")
