I am surprised that after having ridiculous movies within 250 or only 7.0, I thought that more trains would be brought out of "Wax Throm". It's two great comedy actors, Billy Crystal and Danny Davito. Together they created a great duo of madness and emotions. Billy is a man who lost his million dollar story to his ex-wife and repeatedly greeted his dead, Danny was an insane and barbarous elderly mother who misused him. Billy, when Danny advises some "misunderstandings", Danny proposes to Billie, if she kills her ex-wife, Billy wants to kill her mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good smile. Please sit down and enjoy this movie, people! This is a good one! <br /> <br /> 7/10
