Spirit and Chaos A Japanese poet and writer Miyazawa Kenji was an artistic biology which was active in the early 20th century. The film explains and explains the struggle for accepting a harsh reality facing his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the beauty of nature and its superb looks) and his idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The image is composed of myazawa poems beautifully. His relationship with his students was strong, especially in one scene where he gave everything to a student, only to keep things stolen from the classroom. Miyazawa's silly condolences for his village, sister and other unfortunate farmers can serve as text to all of us. In addition, devotion towards the science of miyazawa is also nicely portrayed. In a few days when Western ideas met with suspicion, especially like provincial towns where Miyazawa grew up, he realized his effectiveness in helping his fellow villagers and was inspired by his charm. The film explains deeply and deeply to the author in the moment of artistic emotions and depressing moments. <br /> <br /> I think the CGI film is united, when an innovative ground breaking, collision with more organic animation. It may be advisable that it was deliberate to represent the conflict between the main character, but I think it is rather casual. I wanted to sit down with the film about the Buddhist influence of Maijwa, but it did well. <br /> <br /> This picture is very well done though. I give it a 9/10, with one point cut for CGI. Otherwise the animations, plots, and dialogs were all wonderful and heartwarming. I did not see any other picture of Kaumori Shogi, but after seeing this I will give them a chance.
