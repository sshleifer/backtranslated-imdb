Sequels are a capricious lot somewhere near the original trick. Sometimes you have found a better signal than the original, some critics (such as John Charles) have said that the project A2 is better than the real, I'm somewhat uncomfortable, but this film still fits a well-suited and well-suited to the output of the bright Hong Kong action movie in the 1980's and Jackie's own eyes. I was surprised that his next films are not so good that with such a great release of great movies. He has done two films in the 1990s and has never left it before, but he has made many riots in many films where he is not officially director. <br /> <br /> Earlier in 1987, Jackie's Brain Surgery of God's Armor Critical Fall Filmging. This encourages him to work closely in his next film. This does not encourage him to stop his stunts from risking his life for joy and living. As a result, there is a devastating blow to the house, which is basically a box office lily ($ 19 million compared to the original value of 19 million HK dollars). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Has been, who is the only Chinese police officer who has been allowed to keep guns, still looks better on himself and is considered to be arrested for ignoring the trinity of Lord Trinity named Tiger Au (m Ikela Way-Man Chan, the Dragon Lord). Apparently Chun has a lot of ability to take it directly, but he was released from the San Vayan district (now he is "Two Wayan") which took the Dragon Earth. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon get a makeover and there is a great scene where three officers, who do not know who they are dealing with, try to attack the mother to teach them about the allegations of police officers. He soon took care of the district land and Tiger Au. Dancing with Tiger and his men, choreography and stunts are quite awesome. My favorite stunt was a beautiful barbarian fall in a large float from the second floor and that does not seem to float soft. <br /> <br /> Some subplots are happening at the same time. There is a pirate who is revenge and looking for food to survive from the first film. Then Maggie (Maggie Chung, In the Mood for Love) and Raymond Crowon, the revolutionaries, including Casino riders, Dr. The sun is trying to collect funding for Yat-sen, they are looking for the rebels of the Qing government as well as government workers who are trying. Throw in the mix of corrupt Hong Kong and British police as well as legal people, and you have a stew that enjoys many elements, but still looks the same. This works well (see Max Brothers' scene scene with Cocoants (1929), where Maggi's place where everyone is hiding from anyone else. This scene has spent many weeks and certainly shows this effort. <br /> <br /> There are many errors with the image. There is a specific theoretical nature of the movie What seems to be something that is imagining? At the time of dealing mainly with the revolutionaries and Jackie gives a short speech, especially during the very simple converting of surviving pirates, the female characters are underused and under, especially Maggie Cheung. The plot was not as satisfied as the first movie. Instead of thinking of my master, I feel like Samo Hong and Yueen Biao. (Although I've heard the main reason behind it, they were filming two eastern condoras, but I wonder if Jackie could wait a little while they could accomplish this. ? They will work together for the last year in Dregana), but they have missed. <br /> <br /> I found it quite enjoyable and in good way. Produced film and it is correctly regarded as one of the best comedic action films of the 1980s. This picture is quite good in some unexpected places. The art aspect is fantastic (Eddie Mae Punchu), the costume is fine, cinematography is good and the film looks quite authentic. But stunt, comedy and action that I remember this picture. There is a Chase involving a handsfree dragon and lime which is fantastic (a fog scene scene will be used in Shanghai noon). The last twenty minutes have been confronted by scary hits, crops, pepper-peppery (Jackie has written in this autobiography how he used the real chilli in this scene; you can see him face-to-face with a lot of pain in the end) and this movie is a worthy conclusion. From this sequence, his reverence for the most famous Stunt Stomboat Bill Jr. (1928) to Buster Keaton With this exception there is no hole and only a weak part where it is popped through its head. <br /> <br /> Jackie and / or Hong Kong Action Cinema must definitely consider and see. I must do
