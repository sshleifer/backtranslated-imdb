Warning - This movie contains some amazing graphic images and should never be viewed by kids. <br /> <br /> The story about this story was really a fine Korean painter who grew from the lowest depth. Greatest painter Unfortunately, in many ways, this man had a quarrel with many ways. There were some artistic moods and when it came to art, it might seem boring only to have the nature of its claim. However, at other times he was only drunk - especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. At the end of the film, its annoying, hateful and inappropriately cruelty seems to have diminished. Although not all of this made him specially beautiful, it is important for the film to capture, so we can understand a lot about the nature of the artist. <br /> <br /> I really fascinated the movie and liked the artists' real work shown on the film (on the life line). I really hope I can show it to my students (I teach in a school for art), but this is not too much adult material. Yes there is nudity, but it is more problematic for any audience (especially the children) when he, .... hemm, ... I do not think that the IMDB lets me describe what is happening, but it was very graphic and physical fluid Involved. Not only was there a need to watch a nasty and disgusting scene, but this is a reason to keep junior from observer otherwise wonderful film. This is a real shame.
