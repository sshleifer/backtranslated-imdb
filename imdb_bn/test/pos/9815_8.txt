This Bitsweet Sweetness of Magic Reality was a shiny production history (replaced by director / writer) and box office tanks, but it was a hello movie. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Majello pre-teenage brother Fleke Mom (Loren Brac√≥) shacks up with a moderate cheerful alcoholic (Adam Beldwin). During his alcohol drinking, Belvedu physically abused Mejelo and kept quiet about his condition. But when the wood is happening, the boys put their heads together and resolved a fantasy solution of the Majloe's devastating conflict. <br /> <br /> I like movies which mix imagination and dark reality. They are rarely financially successful ("lawn dogs" are similar examples), but they are usually original and curiosity. <br /> <br /> The drunken Baldwin is shot from a child's point of view, and his head is deliberately closed down the top of the frame. This device allows us to judge fully physically by its actions. Both wood and magella are excellent, and they can easily pull us into our dark, horrible world. <br /> <br /> The title "Radio Flyer" is a small red wagon child transporting their goods. Here it is the dream of the transfer. <br /> <br /> Seriously interesting stuff.
