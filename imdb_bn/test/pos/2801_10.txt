This image is about Xavier, a student of Paris's Erasmus Exchange, who spent a year in Barcelona. At that time, under the influence of all new impressions, he changed and grew. After his return, he has a very clear view on his life and finally he takes it to his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most movable movies I have ever seen, and probably it's probably I Have been in a very similar situation. I came from Germany, not from France, and for me this was Madrid, not Madrid, but I can assure you that the picture is perfect for what the Erasmus seminary of Spain should do with you. The story that I heard is autobiographical, and probably why it is realistic. Give me some examples (light spell warning) - Share a flat with other students from Xaviar Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and England. All the Erasmus shown in Madrid is just like the shared flat. The main characters are nicely developed, and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes. Spanish landlords are also 100% correct. - The story of Javier and his girlfriend Martin, who is in Paris, is very common. About 90% of the relationship between Erasmus (or shortly after) semester went off. - There is such an amazing scene in which Javier tries to satisfy his flatmate Wendy of England, who is going to be "non-skilful" with everyone else. She has finally succeeded, and probably Wendy has her life tonight. Another great thing in this movie is that it is truly bilingual: flat students speak Spanish or English and Javier speaks French with her. Mother and girlfriend There are subtitles to understand what everyone is saying. I'm sure this movie will never be dubbed. I can imagine that this is simply a comedy for non-Erasmus people, but for my colleague Erasmus I can only say: this is your movie! If you do not see it, do so. But be prepared for some nostalgia feelings ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
