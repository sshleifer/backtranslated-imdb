It's always difficult to bring a 450-hour book to a three-hour film. I read the book before, and I have been dealing with this problem in the best way of producing BBC. The book's qualities were not lost: In the 1860s a solid and vivid illustration of family members of a fingerprints in London, the cold and indecent obscenity of Moudud, the different social groups speaking different languages, the unexpected and surprising twist of the story, the film distinguishes the audience from the same view. When they say one of the Moudud from the point of view of interest. The main actors work very well and in particular, growing love among the two women is firmly developed, the first result of a very modest love scene between the two, and finally they were ready to do all the evil things and forgave them, because they still love each other. <br /> <br /> For authors Sarah Waters, every 19th century British life has fully investigated what life was like. At the beginning of the Velvet Tactics, at the beginning of the Wadivilill Theater and the social movement, the horrific reality of female torture and the beginning of Fishery's professor fashionable evolution, in London, the inhuman incident of hanging people and highlighting inhuman public events. Treatment of disturbed individuals or supposed people in Aslam based on reading sources and scientific studies. It is very well transferred to the film so that the relevant scenes show the higher historical value. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three-hour colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and mystery.
