All right, so this series type takes root 'here we go again!' Weeks of the week David Morsch's character helps his ride, who is in a bumpy cat - but what's wrong with that! David Morse is one of the greatest characters of the greatest character and of course, and one of the great creators of this series, David Queppe - Heaven! <br /> <br /> Because of the lack of love for this show by many, I do not see it going in a season series - but do you know? That amount of garbage that it has bored me exceeds - let's hope some good it can past a first series !!!
