Not all movies are Oscar worthy, but let's face it, sometimes these films are more fun and have long and lasting impressions to watch. This one left me sunny and happy and I could not wait to hug my own son. Anyone has a pet (no matter what matter) knows what it feels like to lose. I believe most people will be born with Buddy immediately after losing her best friend. Bruce Willis was a great tycoon, and Joe Lorraine Adams was a good mother believer as well. Playing Badi, the little boy was a cherub face and his sister and friend Edgar played a terrific backup role. The movie likes a lot and anything that the whole family can enjoy. Thanks!
