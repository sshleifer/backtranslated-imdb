Wonderfully good acting, a very well-regarded film about hard rock-worthy youngsters - for getting ticket stardom: His favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace his lead singer. Not too far, the film tries to keep the point of view and not over-the-top; It definitely makes you think about lingering teenager fantasy about being in the business of music. But despite tough conversations, the script follows a tried-and-true, formulary pattern and closes it through its claws in the final act. I enjoyed the sweet fluffball much more than "almost famous". It has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal depletion, but a powerful finish can make it even more memorable. ** **** to 1/2
