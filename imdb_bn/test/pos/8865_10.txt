I'm ashamed to say it, but I must admit, for the first time I saw this picture almost a year ago. After watching this, I immediately came out and purchased the DVD collector version and saw it many times. <br /> <br /> This picture is great on many levels. It acts as a direct giant or action type movie for you, such as a horror / science-fie and acts as a very playful look among the human mind. Unbelievable sense of betrayal, mistrust and fear is not only on the part of the carpenter (which is stunning), but not generally by Cast's incredible performance. Cart Russell (obviously) McDaddy's main role is spectacularly different, and as a direct result he "feels" as a real person rather than "All American Hero" Hollywood. Other cast members carry their role with all the styles, and net results are an acute credible atmosphere, and a really gorgeous film.
