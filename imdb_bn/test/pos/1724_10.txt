After watching the recent episode broadcast in the UK, I write it and it should work hard to keep it up to me. The last episode called "Blink" has elements of Gothic horror, which are related to statues they do not think. Doctors and Martha do not show much, but it is not isolated from a well-planned episode. The general value is designed with a higher level and the last three episodes, two differences with "family" and the last one has made me the best group that the current team has done. <br /> <br /> It's not just David Tennant holding it together, week full support cast week, help is as well. For those who are waiting for the series 3 out of the series, it's good value to wait.
