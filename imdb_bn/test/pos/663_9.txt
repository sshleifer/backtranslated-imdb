Love this movie! Old school kicks! Love the idea. Love script. Love letters. I really really like Geeks! I was still excited to see the lazy slapstick being honored with awesome flicks. My choices like the 14th and the Pandemonium Saturday were just fine. You are a big fan of scary and stupid, then this is your movie! I just loved to have a good word because I just took off a star. Do not sound bad but there will be more choices. Great blood splatters. Great murder weapon Great dress! I really request to the 80's teenager stereotype all breakfast club. And I can appreciate the secret of non-CGI. Instead of spending CGI, really good camera action and light mystery. I would rather fake fake that really fake counterfeit. <br /> <br /> Cast and kisses the makers! Oh, very "made" love too!
