A few years ago I saw this movie, without subtitles, on television, and I do not understand any words, what the characters are saying to me still seems to me, and the mood of the movie does not end me anymore. <br /> <br /> For a long time I saw it again a few weeks ago. Seeing the picture in the television directory, I was leaving my heart and till 8 days till the film was shown, I told all I knew to go and see it. The story reminds me a bit of Alfred Hitchcock's uplift. A slow, brooding movie about a man who one day believed that he saw a girlfriend who disappeared years ago. Flashbacks have a wild rollercoaster journey, change the scene and follow really innovative twists in the plot, and at the end of the film I was left breathless. I certainly did not get what I expected (and I actually saw this movie!). Be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
