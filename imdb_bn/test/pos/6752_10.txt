Mascot Ladisla Starvich's Best Works. This is a stuffed toy that tells the story of a dog, who searches for an orange, when she tells her mother that she does not have any money with her daughter. The dogs are picked up with other toys sold off. In the truck, while others are jumping while the car is running, the dog stands and waits till the shop closes. While hand holding hands and selling fruit, women are being driven to get orange after biting the feet. As he runs, he took his offer to face the devil and stop at the nightclub. There, he met other toys who jumped off the truck. The cat was beside her in the car, especially dogs are determined to get orange. I will just mention here that other wonderful things that happen in the nightclub which you will have to look for yourself. If you love Stewarise and are interested in all of the past animations, it's enough to say, I definitely recommend you to find it!
