It seems that our Scandinavian film should have been cooked more than just the Doug's 1995 movement. Danny Briseman Manne, or The Bothersome Man in English, is rich and deeply worried by the film's deep and comfortable and rich content on both surfaces. As a film alone, we are a scathing comedy on the society and attitude of the modern world; Beatosom has reached the Norway region of a world judged by man and is similar. But with this black comedy it seems that the film takes a deeper and at least raises the issues that I want to uncover, figurative religious places and our human instincts to uncover the truth in so many of our world. Probably seems like an alien to us. <br /> <br /> It's true, for me, contemporary Norwegian movies had a fantastic role to play. This image spreads deep into the section of European art art, and maintains an open Finland with its deep themes and diminished atmosphere, and there is no such thing as the procession of events that can mean one thing or another. Many times we have seen movies that use the set up, Bothr's man embraces and many times he travels around the detective story or walks a story or something with a line, but this film allows his setting and allow. The situation can be found to work as a mere backdrop for Andr√©s (Fausa Arght), for his hero; Where is he and the possible mystery behind this position really. <br /> <br /> It's been said that the setup I'm talking about involves the position of the hero with any previous memory or what has happened before. I will jump on the right, in my opinion he has died and he has been sent to some butterfly in some way like all residents of the city. Everyone mixed with Andres is of the same age; The same mentality and the same perspective suggest to me that most of them are victims of their suicides and have been sent about no emotion, feeling, color or most important pain without any hesitation. <br /> <br /> When we first saw Andres, he closed a bus which was later discovered by his strange power, and reached a gas station in the middle of the village. He has a huge beard and has a scaffold and soon he will reverse, playing a suit and tie; With a clean Chevron mouth and a new job, a home that makes the film one of the best convergent places among the towns and cities I have ever seen. But new jobs as well as new cities are uncomfortable; You can pause whenever you want; Bosses are unusual types and there seems to be just no emotion or reaction. Andres, is still a relative newcomer to the city, crying and being clearly influenced by a movie on the show, but these ideas are the best throughout a movie, but others see the styling face in the style. There is also an elementary example when a man jumps from a window and jumps on some spikes, but everyone goes without terror. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An electronic paper involves a particularly nasty scene involving guillotine and somebody's fingers, but the reaction of each of the phenomenon is encountered in stone and it goes back in the hour. Likewise, a suicidal attempt involving a train goes unnoticed and instead we get our views on how we want to pull tube tracks with ineligibility. The city acts as an obstacle, a painful society where it is impossible to damage itself to a physiotherapist; A place where sexual relationships can occur and break evenly, both are emotions and emotions; A place where people can attempt suicide but it is impossible to die really. The city accepts this power because the damage has already been done in "real life" and thus, the film says that you can not kill yourself twice, in fact you can not feel pain or emotions in the life after pagalir. <br /> <br /> <br /> But the best part of the movie is torn on you. The side story involving the last five minutes of filming and some music from some other music seems to show that the film has a fine line between the places transferred as 'heaven' and 'hell'. Do we get to see this space very short, too ?? So that they formed a single shot so that the short. A colorful kitchen playing 'Heaven' music and children: It gives life, hope, passion and happiness where the hell is a snow-white somewhere where you hope to build up hopes and cut off the eerie points. At the very end of the film, the role of these two spaces suddenly told Andrea and colleague. Face: purgatory and everything that came with her, the next life was not just ready for Andreas and her freethinking, adventure minds ?? And look at where the thinkers end up.
