Although for the theft of the story "Horton Hanks the Egg" Sues should have been given credit, it was a fine movie. It touches both emotions and intelligence. Especially due to the great performance of seven-year-old Justin Henry and a sympathetic syndrome (and everyone's catastrophe) on each character, the long-term thoughtful elements are prolonged after the tears become blurred. Overall, played a solid throw, excellent instruction, and a very powerful script. The right tones of lifetime humor prevented the "heavy" thing from getting tired or difficult. Finally, this film has been a test of time and it does not look like a date after decades of liberation.
