Horror-Genius Dario Argante is one of my personal favorite directors, and his film "Suspriya", "Phenomena" and "Prongo Rosso" are superior to my personal favorite list. The 1987 "Opera" yet another tuning and brilliant film that does not miss a horror lover and will keep you from the end of your chair to the end. This stunning and hugely-fierce gaelo can be described as the master's latest movie, which makes Argentina's movies not known for the intensity of their violence. Envy is extremely extreme and very brilliantly transformed, which creates nightmares for a film sensor. <br /> <br /> - Warning! Speakers ahead! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The killer connects the needle with a wicker belt, so he must be killed and kept watch while he is abominantly killed. When the slaughterhouse ends, the killer leaves the baiti and leaves, only to return to his friends to other friends ... <br /> <br /> Naturally, violence is very graphic and very stylish. "Opera" is really a cruel film, and it's a stylish and atmospheric film. This picture is absolutely tantalizing and pure mystery until absolutely starting from the end. The performance is very good, especially the Christina Marsillak led bright. Similarly, one of the stunning looks and great actresses, Marcelac's talented singer fits perfectly in her role, whose fear and horrible experience are slowly making her crazy. Among other great performances are Ian Charlton who is directing and directing the Hera film director and director Argentina's real life girlfriend Daria Nicolody, who has played her role in most of the films. The camera work is an excellent setting for all the Argentine films, and the magnificent Opera House is a wonderful setting that contributes to the beauty of the film and its permanently obscure environment. Score, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal too, although I'm a different element of several other Argentine films that have missed Gublin's bright progressive rock soundtracks. "Opera" is a really awesome and absolutely exciting Giallo experience. It must be fully seen for a lost boyfriend and I recommend it to a movie-fan which is not very sensitive to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tantalizing!
