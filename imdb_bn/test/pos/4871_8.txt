I think I'm some kind of road runner fan. I do not care how it predictable, I smile anyway. 'Beep, Beep' is predictable most of the time, although it is very beautiful at the same time. Of course, the road runner was thrown behind by the quote and certainly failed to make the quote road runner a new attempt. The plans that come with the quote are very interesting. You will see where you look wrong and you will not be disappointed. Well, you'll be disappointed once, whatever you think will not happen, but it's fun, even fun. <br /> <br /> If you like Road Runner shorts, you'll like it. Great and pretty original at predictive gags work and animation.
