A gang of robbers steals gold coins worth 300,000 dollars during a brave train robbery operated by the impressive, ugly, ruthless Montero (perfectly excellent performance of Gilbert Rowland). But the incredible member Bahunda (a humorous change in Jose Torres) closes the coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda died before killing Munteriro, where he kept the loot. So, Monituro was glossy, playful, intelligent, monster hunter Stranger (played by the handsome George Hilton, easily performed) and the cage, the corrupt banker Clayton (pictured by Eddie "Kaki" Barnes, a delightfully depiction of 50). Enzo G, operated efficiently with a clever, complex, and twist-led script of Casellari, Tito Carpi, and Geovani Symonell. Kastalari, it is a miraculous moral and selfless voice (each doubles and crosses each other with the triangle leaving a happy greedy person). Scores inspired by Alessandro Alessandrini and Francesco De Mossi, a lot of shoot and outsourcing fishfishing, a malicious humorous sense of humor, steady speed and a real dosage of a surprise. Finally, this clever and often sunny feature sends Sergio Leon's inspiration to "The Good, the Bad and the Augle". Stephanie Curdue of Pope Up Mazara in the Nifty Secondary section, Monituro's fiery boy Merisol, Ivano Staxioli Hard-Nassad Senna Captain, and Gerard Herrter as Flintin as Legal Lawrence Blackman. A very fun and enjoyable Rome.
