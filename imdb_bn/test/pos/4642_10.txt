PG was for a movie, it's a funny picture. I grew up watching this film over and over. It's really fun, I do not know how today's viewers will react, but if you're big on it, or prefer 80s, it's a great movie. Like Harold, Stephen First is a great, who thinks I'm one of the best characters of this movie. Paul Ruebens also pops for about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.
