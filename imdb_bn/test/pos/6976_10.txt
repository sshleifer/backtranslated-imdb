In some scenes of rainy people, Francis Ford Coppola is the symbol of his 17th year Hei-Day's precursor, similar to the 1966 Easy Ryder, but not in the same reference frame. Here there is a drama about the isolated people from our society, in some ways by the choice or limited by one or another limit. It is one of the rare original plays where few scenes stand alone as a fake. Coppola is able to capture this clearly defined character and which is what it needs to say through the opposite, unexpected degrees of one letter. Other helplessness, or reverse, or both. And, as it is about the 1960's decimation of the life of the subproductive life, it seems that the movie mentioned earlier has that saddle, but more concrete, drama and intrinsic issues are near worse quality. In this case, if Berghman agrees to find out the strange truths outside the outer generation everyday as some 20-film filmmakers, it could be. <br /> <br /> But very straight and straight sometimes self-aware photography (though sometimes with more documentary methods, its unchanging characters are the same), the actors are all fixed. Charlie Night, the actress I'm not very familiar, has a complex, diverging role as running in an existential conundrum that lives as a pregnant wife. She has some amazing acting moments, and if she is my favorite (if not my beloved) phone call her husband for the first time. Such an exciting view on both ends, and much smaller gestures about her and the reflection of a word is so much spoken with. A great way to mirror others in Coppola movies. Then comes the character of 'killer' played by James Kane. It is also a very dangerous character because it matches the kidneys redness and harmful memories. Think of Forrest Gump if he did not leave soccer and intelligent. This is his best one, in fact, the lowest being - for a guy who is playing solid boys in movies, here's something that is part of the story and the character of the knights. Also a helpful role is very good, as a cop with a check on the rug and past exams of Robert Duvall; An initial sample of other defective characters playing in his own career. <br /> <br /> So the characters and Coppola are at risk of the risk of uncomfortable among them; actually did this film, whatever the story, whatever it is, it certainly does not seem to satisfy you or expectations in the normal way. The last 10 or so minutes is like the others in Coppola's work, where all tragedies of all aspects are covered by emotional-and emotional-principles will leave these principles glorious and sad. It is brave for its time, with the help of bold (both for freedom and error and ambiguity) matter. And the film's style is graphic and self-contained in contrast to long shots in the most important scenes that quickly add a split-type view on it with flashbacks. This was a road movie of his time, but it got much more work than the other filmmaker and the outward characters are unlikely to have the potential of nature. One of the best films of 1969.
