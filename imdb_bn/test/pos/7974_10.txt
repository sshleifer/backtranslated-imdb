Hell-to-Pay Pay is a little bloody for my taste, though it's not worse than many movies. Yet, I've enjoyed the parade of season stars and western scenes & all; However, story lines were very weak and I could not really see it all the points. However, the film that is compatible with this movie makes it impossible for the film. <br /> <br /> Who wrote this song - Where did the boys go? They are awesome !! Music begins right from the moment, far away from what I've heard for years. I think it might be better to have heard me ever! Although I was not thrilled with the performance of the film, the music revealed the right emotion for each scene. During the inaugural achievement I was transferred to the old west and actually felt that I was alive again with those old days. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a purchase price and a beautiful trip to music and memory lane to see again a trip back to old western stars.
