'Radio' mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy, nickname 'Radio' and T. L. A beautiful movie based on a real story of its football coach. Hana High School, Harold Jones <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding, excellent as junior radio! I do not want to imagine him seeing a serious performance, especially because I watch most of the movies with him, comedy. Ed Harris is just like Harold Jones, but this actor is great, so this is nothing new. <br /> <br /> The mentally challenged young James Roberts Kennedy is always called T L. Hanna High School, not disturbing anyone and not nearly aiming. One day, when the ball of football was thrown at him, he decided to stay with the ball for the helplessness of the best player of the football team, Johnny Cash and sometimes one of the most unhappy people ever met. One day, Cash decided to punish James, mocking him with other football players and even dragging him. <br /> <br /> When coach Jones invented this horrible act, he became angry and punished all the teams to help James this day, who received the nickname 'Radio' for his emotional response to radio. <br /> <br /> This film shows how the radio is becoming a helpful assistant, despite the hardships, trains are helping the players and even from the people living in small towns to get respect from them. <br /> <br /> I would recommend all those who want to see real and beautiful stories. It contains a life lesson, especially we have been shown that a person can make a difference, even if we do not say 'normal'. The radio is a big heart and nobody is incapable of hatred, and this is one thing we can apply in our daily lives.
