Until I appeared on television, I could not see the film because I suspected of comic flicks. Since the "Batman" series, "Spon," "Judge Dredged" and many other merciful p.g.-13 bombs, I have torn everything in everything. I will ask in my mind, "Why can not anyone make movies that rated R and thinks the story is true, how difficult is it?" And finally my prayer plate was answered. This movie pops out on the right side of the screen to violence, blood, martial arts, arms, fire, etc. Against evil. Yes sure enough that there are many things in this activity, and most of them have bomb attacks. But not the blood, the film has been properly illustrated, not going to the overboard, does not provide a good length and is not a bad moment. Blade second is cool, but not as cold as the first. Blood is one of the best real comic flicks I've ever seen in a long time.
