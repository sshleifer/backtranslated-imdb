Everything from the novelist director Leon Schrieiber (The Sam of All Fears) writer Jonathan Saferan Fower's novel, above all, is a top-screen version. This story of journey and self-discovery has been demonstrated with a firmly respected performance and sharpness, which is a story which enriches the soul and illumines it. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Fowar (Elias Wood) passed a young man who saw his grandfather, Safran, Jonathan has made a tremendous habit of sealing his small objects and short life memories of life and to display plastic jeep bags on their walls. Safanan showed an old picture to Jonathan, who showed the young Safar standing many years ago, who saved his life many years ago. Jonathan began a long journey to find United's mysterious woman, do not know whether she is still alive. He started a brush, a helping hand, to help Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) a young travel guide. Initially the journey hit the dead end and false leads, but after reaching its goal, the people found themselves in the ruins of the dark chapters of history and the memory of the war and the unknown ghosts of an unknown city. There, they find their own destiny and they will change forever by what they learn. <br /> <br /> This picture looks like one who has the highest profits from its actors. Occasionally, the film is spoken in Russian and is like a foreign movie. The title itself is a game of discovery itself. It is a thoughtful journey of a man of his past, and his past mock his colleagues involved; Jonathan's emotional journey became a psychological journey alongside Alex and his grandfather. It is a long story of bondage and crime must be born for the whole life. At the end of the film, all the experienced lives of these characters are changing, which will permanently combine their lives. It proves that memory can be strong in trimming and purifying the soul too. See how it is a succession of others and any other event or person in the past. Alex finally saw his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these people will change by the end of the film, which is a tribute to a story which is respected. <br /> <br /> The story is easily easy. It works as a road trip movie (like the straight story) combined with an interesting mystery story. It really involves a great many levels of emotions and subplots from the past to the present. The last day is a bit bigger with its day-to-day feeling. <br /> <br /> Elise Wood (Sina City, Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind) has chosen her broad role since Lord of Splash. Ring trilogy Here, he must do a delicate job with which to show the least casual role. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskien rented as well as Alex and his grandfather, respectively. Even grandfather's name is Sammy Davies Junior Jr. (that's right) as a terribly loyal companion. <br /> <br /> A Moody compliment of the thoughtful nature of the movie for additional music scores by Paul Cantelan. The editing is effective as the imagery from the past and present is linked and easily compressed. The painters of Matthew Libitik (Gothika, Form for a Dream) painted some impressive pictures of the war and with its subsequent image, shameless and lifeless. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> We did not fully understand the full story of Alex's grandfather's background and his motivations. Likewise, the absence of empty storages and visible material and depth of Jonathan does not give us much more than a satirical sketch. Sometimes, the film feels a little frustrating and depressed, because more awesome verses are uncovered. But good memories of memorization and closing, with good performance and interesting themes, spontaneous tales that these minor criticisms That Schreiber is not only guided but adapted to this blade piece screenplay adaptable to a potential future and future commitment to its future.
