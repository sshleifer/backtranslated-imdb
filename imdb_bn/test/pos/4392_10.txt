I was great in this movie! I saw this after coming out of the theater so I do not remember all the details. I think it is dependent on Odyssey's Homer's story. Name changes the place and event, but you can still see the similarity of the story. <br /> <br /> I think it's funny how they will suffer themselves and how they come out of themselves. I really enjoyed this version of modern old stories better than the romance and romance than Juliet. <br /> <br /> I agree that in some parts of the story it sometimes becomes stupid but all of them are a great adventure with big name actors.
