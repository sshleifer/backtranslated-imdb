I saw this year (video 2000) years ago and want to see the DVD. A good movie, but if I included it's inheritance of Beatles and The Holi etc. I loved it more. <br /> <br /> I do not even know how true the story - some changes made the story dramatic? <br /> <br /> I was only 3 when the body was crashed, until the end of the 70's, its music did not wake up. After a long time, I saw our family came to our new home - yes, 3rd February, 1959. <br /> <br /> Whatever you say and do, make a little better ... always remember his song - always .. .
