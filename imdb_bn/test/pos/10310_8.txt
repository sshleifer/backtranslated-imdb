I think the movies were really good. The subject, acting and music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was extraordinary. Although the director is dealing with the situation of women in rural areas and how they are enjoying the feminist culture, he neglected Phoolan's character and gave more attention to the violence he brought.
