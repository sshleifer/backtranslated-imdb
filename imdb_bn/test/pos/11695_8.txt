A hit and miss film set from Lawn Butts Club in Australian suburbs of crackerjack cityside. Mick Molli is a scam who has occupied free parking space in Cityside. When the club is pressurized to install poker machines in its premises, they will have to raise $ 8,000 to keep it going. The club needs new members to help, and this place comes in the role of Mick Molli and has to bowl to save the club. With many ups and coming and a hidden gem of the aging actress crackerjack. Be careful, though most of the jokes are with the knowledge of the bottle bottles but there are many funny scenes offering comedic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co-star. Overall, films should be recommended for lawn buttons or to play or play, but there is enough material for a fun game if there is little understanding. If you enjoy Australian humor, then I'm telling you that you are bowling the ball and going to the theater because this is the premiere lawn of the year's comedy (also the only one).
