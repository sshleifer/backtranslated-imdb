I really want to say that Brian is one of CAT's most fun and weird ridiculous movies I've ever seen. This film is packed with stupid conversations, ridiculous scenes and a self-involved plot, which legendary director Lucio Fulci plays herself. <br /> <br /> Threadbayer story-line is an old adult director (Phulchi, who film Lucio Fuchi in the film ...) who has started to go to almonds and hallucinates because of the harmful things that have been kept in the film over the past few years. He took a condoler who mesmerized the follower and told him that he would believe he was a killer, but he would be the victim of a shrinking massacre. The shot is made from the rest of the film "Movie", which is indicative of Phulasi all these actions, the shrinking scenes are always killing people, such as F! The misleading sequence of kicking dying and flowering. Oh, and some good things have been cast for Microsoft ... <br /> <br /> Brian is a CAT completely ridiculous in top-and-all sense. Gore is the classic Fulci - Nasty and strong with some really decent scenery. A female body chainsaw section is pretty cool, such a small boy is beheading chainsaw. Lots of stabbings, gougings and other cool kill scenes make this one a super-non-stop bloodbath. Laughable conversations (LICK IT !!!!!), as well as some crazy mad scenes (Nazi orgy, Opera song movement-festive and innocent hypnosis come down easily in the running.). Make this one fun as hell. It's not nearly as dark as any other film in Phulchi - CAT is a spontaneous horror / comedy which does not seem to be more fun but it's really tragic. I say to grab a fifth of the cheap bourbon and sit on this one. I saw CAT with some friends and we smiled all the time. This summer's feel-good movie ... Recommendation 8/10
