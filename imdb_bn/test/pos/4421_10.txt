All right, so I love Rachel Ray, but now, I love him! How innovative I love that she is a cooking section- I admit that sometimes I'll skip that part, because it makes me very hungry! But I also love that you can get the next grocery list on their website. I love that she has a regular helper and she has made some of her viewers to become her regulars. How much I am capable of and how creative he loves. I liked how he's guests in his mystery. He thinks a lot more genuine than just hosting many other talk shows. She still gets a little starstruck sometimes and I love that. I love that he talks about his personal life and reminds people how happy they are. He even mentioned the tablet before and it's so funny! She has fun stories! Anyway, I'm a fan for life. Even my two-year-old Rachel knows Rai and she loves her too!
