For this comedy, this episode is based on the theme of Pinedelo's drama "The Author of the six-letter investigator" and the genre-Paul Sarther's play "No Exit" (as mentioned in the most explicitly as its title), but of course a sterling wrapper. <br /> <br /> Five different people find themselves in the round room, others have no idea other than their clothing hints. A ring rings an intermittently (perhaps a Hemmingway alliance?), Increase the torment of their prison. A new leader of the party, Major, determined to flee, others resigned from their fate. <br /> <br /> Like Pirandello, there is no story about these characters. There is nothing more than the experience of the room in their consciousness and there is no one to write their existence, so their position is more hopeless than the letters of the pillars of Pinedale. Unlike both Pinedillo and Sartre, there is no relation between letters and so there is no conflict between them, although the theme is in contrast with personal liability in this story. <br /> <br /> While the title of this title is significantly disconnected from the authors, the themes of Sartre and Pirendello (and other writers of the twentieth century) come fully transparently. This is probably a piece that addresses post-modernist view of the Shoel War era. There is a emphasis on personal ambiguity issues. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best episodes I've ever seen, and is still particularly relevant with the current experience (such as Sarrett and Pinedale). Just what makes a good piece of writing in a classic.
