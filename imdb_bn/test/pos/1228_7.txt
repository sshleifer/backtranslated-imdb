I'm not here to tell you "Armard" Kubrickian, Hitkocian or Fellini-Esquiera. No More like referenced director Don Siegel ("Charlie Warrick") and Walter Hill ("Warriors"). The two Helmars are not fooled by the inferiority of keeping women in their movies. No skirts need to be applied. They made unapologetically folk movies. Guns, lots of guns. Men's jaw meets violent deaths with a witch. Their movie head was like a sap. Do you like a friend Get a dog <br /> <br /> "Armed" so many people movies. Dualing armored truck? Bloody gun wounds? Money Explosion? If it does not stimulate the mask of your brain, stay away from it. <br /> <br /> In 88 minutes, "Armed" all muscles without an ounce fat. We are with six security guards who carry armored trucks, every three trucks. Six led by Matt Dillon, plans to hijack a fake involving two trucks. Their mission is to provide $ 42 million from the Federal Reserve (I think). The idea is to run both truck trucks in a warehouse, cash, then hijack. Sure, the police will suspect them, but if they stayed together they would get it. <br /> <br /> The problem is the problem in the six managed by Columbus short. At first. But he faces deportation. And his guardian's guardian for younger brother. She needs cash bad. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon cajoles, pleads, holdout persuades. Nobody has blood in his hand. A clean turn. All good, no bad You have to be rich forever. Blue sky is smiling at you ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything goes to hell. It continues to be a damned thing and shares after another. And it happens almost all of Los Angeles claustrophobically anywhere inside a abandoned warehouse. In fact, the film came out of a retreat project of industrial urban damage. I would like to be like industrial urban decay. <br /> <br /> Mad Dillon Kudos, who plays the top bad dog. He desperately desperate from the crazy mad madness of the movie goes from frustrated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm guessing I heard a few tangentine drill records. Also, it is astonishing that it is a PG-13 movie. I caught one ?? One! ?? F-bomb in this whole movie about violent tough-man robbery At some level, I like that. Take the kids <br /> <br /> Director Himuayan Nimrod, Antal, who created a fine door set "Control" on the Bundapest subway system. Screenwriter James V. There is no person known as Simpson. <br /> <br /> Many people in this movie are just starting. I wish to maintain the respect given in this film and over time the filmmakers will continue their career.
