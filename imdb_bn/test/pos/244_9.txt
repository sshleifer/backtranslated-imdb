This will be the best post of astaire musical created by columbia. This film, directed by Arthur Schwartz and producer Charles W.D., really keeps Jean Kelly on the map and earned Rita Hareth's reputation as the film's premiere female dancing partner. He played a dual role in performing the numbers of comedians and co-star Phil Silver in 1940, but at the end of the 19th century it played the role of his grandfather as a dramatic actor. The music should also be united because I think this last generation was famous for the famous Jerome Kearn ("Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in Year's Eyes") and his lyricist worked equally well. Ira Garsuin They provide a score that is impressive and full of character. Music is particularly notable for historical events, because it is almost entirely the statue of the 20th century which was the real time of Karen. It's a bit like taking a record of your favorite bands in the 1970s and listening to a song in the original genre of that time. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inconsistent, which is good with me. Because this movie is almost an approximate you will sometimes see the golden age of Broadway musical comedy style in the 1930/40 film. Even in the 1940s, the propaganda aspects of the war also made it more impressive as "the way to tomorrow", and it also makes fun of the enemies of America and uses the duration of the time to refer to "the Grimmins". <br /> <Perhaps the most memorable performance in the film is Kelly's dance in "Alter-Ego Dance", which debates with her and dances with herself as a metaphorical picture of the war of conscience. It has been a profitable and memorable scene among most of his subsequent work and professors. The fans want to find it for a variety of reasons - Kelly fans can see it as a rare opportunity to see a different set of co-stars outside the MGM's premises and beyond compatibility with its usual MGM material. Heyear's fans want to see Rita in a glorious color at the top of his fame and skill. And fans of the classic Broadway musical instruments must be surprised to hear Karne's final score and the quality of the songs of Gershwin and the compatibility of their styles. This is a typical jewel of the Colombian music program crown.
