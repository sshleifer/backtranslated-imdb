I love the mockumentary layout that Chris has been developing for years and crew years ago. I really like it and better than "Spinal Tap" "Waiting for Goffman", which was the first of the group (and made of Rob Reiner, but guest and other regular regulars of his make-up). This humor is not for everyone. It is rather subtle and not very physical, so some people can not be related. However, as a dog lover (and a dog show fan), I liked this movie. There are so many fun lines! My daughter and I often quote each other. I think it is amazing that these people can give the very interesting material lib ads for each movie! What they will be a fun bunch. I highly recommend this to those who like their humor beside the cerebral.
