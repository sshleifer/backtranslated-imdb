I saw this movie in 1972, and like those who commented here ... I went back several times to look over ... I think everyone 9 times. Just how great I am describing ... my soundtrack, beautiful panoramas in the south of France, kids were taken away from the beginning of their life. The ideal way to live is to set it up ... Of course, the power to interfere, but when I forget that part, I want to stay in the movie and live like that! It is so good that it is now available in DVD ... it was not for years! <br /> <br />
