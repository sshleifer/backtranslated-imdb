After listening to the book "Unbelievable Book", I went to the library to test these miniseries. The first half of this TV version is really good, but it stumbles quite a bit in the second half. The relationship with the trustee is terminated and the conflict between the jinn and the zoe is inserted, which is not existent in the story of the shoot, my opinion is frankly, because they greatly reduce the story of their love. I was frustrated that Brian Brown joe seemed a little less attractive than a man and book man, but the genius of Helen Morse was really good. I think they have to do a 10-hour miniseries to develop outback stories correctly. But all that said, I saw the whole thing in less or less one and appreciate its eligibility, somebody willing to rebuild less soap.
