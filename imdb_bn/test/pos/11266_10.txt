I bought this video at 50 cents for VC-T Stores at the best-store store. After renting a rent at 50 rupees, I bought some videos for them to sell them to others. This is the only one that will not go back. It is an explosion of artistic genius, color and sound. I do not know whether it should say circus, dance, or both. It's bigger than life itself. They will only be able to do this well over a few short years of their life. Actor for this actor. Jean Kelly and Burt Lancaster were alive today and watched them alive but they would be scared. I want to lend it to others but I know that if I do that, I will never return.
