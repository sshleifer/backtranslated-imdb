David Tenant and Sarah Perish's brilliant performance put me in tears because many of the scenes were known to me. My husband suffered a sub-aconoid hemorrhage in 1977 and needed a big operation involving promoting his brain and plugging leaks. Like the tricks, I was also expected to return to his former soul. After more than 25 years of loving and caring, he warned me that he did not want to go to any woman, and he knew very little. Then he applied for and I am going through divorce now. I hope this program will help people understand what is in the brain to hit the heart.
