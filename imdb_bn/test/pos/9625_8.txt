This is my favorite Kung Fu movie. This is a very recognizable smell, seasoned by a mere music score (traditional Chinese instrument, I think), and reversed supernatural supernatural melodramatic moment by highly influential comedy. In fact, while trying to create their own "western" (ie cowboy film), the Chinese invented a whole new animal, characterized by the influence of Kung Fu war and related words. <br /> <br /> The five finger stories are easy to die, the revenge story (to kill loved ones) and master of the main character to gain "iron-fist technique" which will enable them to destroy the holy vengeance against the enemies. There is even a love interest, though strange, godly kind (most of the Chinese films of the time are available). However, the end result is brilliant and more true than Bruce Lee's movie.
