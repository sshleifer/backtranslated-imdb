Over the last few months, I have seen many reviews for Italian work, many of them are negative Almost all of these discouraged critics mean that it is not worth mentioning in the film for its modernist ambitious and high-budget technology. Look, man, it's just a fun movie. This image is supposed to relax, sit back, and just enjoy the dynamic speed of running the film. Elven (2001) of the Like of Ocean, you can focus on the characters and the plot at the same time, without much thought (some of us are lucky). Approved, "Ocean" is a good movie, but who care? There may be some holes in the plot (this can be done by about 3/4 passage), the process of creating trailers can not be viable, and some conversations may seem uninterrupted and greasy, but again, who really thinks? Cool Characters, Mini Coopers, Big Explosion, Charlene Theron. What else do you want to do? I think fake rosier Iberts meet with Gene Shalit and enjoy for yourself once! Oh, and any other thing, do not compare what you do with the original because it is not a reminder to repeat what F. Gary Gray has told the press ten million times! My suggestion - if you are interested in dancing through a well-lit, fun flick, do not get bothered to see the Italian job. But, if you do not have any serious inferiority complex and / or Ed Norton looking to jack up a bunch of Ukrainians, then proceed. Button line, my fellow movie, is: light up and have fun, damaged.
