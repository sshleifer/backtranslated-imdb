This story has been held in my heart a special place for the last thirty years. As a boy, I enjoyed mountain men and fertile stories. The books "Call of the Wild", "White Fung", "The Frontierman" and "Mount Side of the Mountain" greatly influenced me. I wanted to live like a mountainous man, but in 1975, I was not inspired to do anything on television watching this film. I just wanted to be like "tropper". However, as I was older I found that I was very domesticated for living. However, I'm still romantic about living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this movie that the simplicity of the storyline is quite common in the "Disneyic" type films, but you can see the real themes of the mechanical way you created it and saw the story's heart, then I think you find yourself pleasantly touching. I make a point to see this movie once a year. Thirty years later, I still jumped under the snow on the shore and heard the smile and smile of tropar, still there was a coolness in me. <br /> <br /> - Good old timer and stay free <br /> <br /> PS If you want to read more about true story, then I found this link in the night of the Mad Tropper: <br /> <br /> http: //www.mysteriesofcanada .com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
