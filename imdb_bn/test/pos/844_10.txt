I like this show. I think the rocky road ice cream for the first time was due to this event. Was not the shop located on the beach or something like that? I actually wrote back with Marci for several years. I have lost touch and I can reconnect now as an adult. Where is he now? I wish they were out of the DVD. I seriously doubt that as I think there maybe there are five or six people who remember the bedroom show in the first place. They just do not show up like this, do they? I wonder if I will still keep this day and age. Did you think that VVS can burn any DVD of the DVD taped? I want to give (due).
