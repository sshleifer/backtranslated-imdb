This movie is based on the true story of Christopher's age and his friend Duncan Lee. This interesting story took place during Whittlese Descissal, in which time as a TRW Clerk, Christopher was the secret of classified correspondence, which acknowledged CIA involvement in Australian political and union circles. This movie shows a number of scenes related to Gough Whitley (sent via American TV), where events occur, which confirm Christoph's previously classified documents. Gough Whitlum's removal was an organized CIA coup. Elsewhere in the film, it has been mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of cheating, which in the end is to ensure that the United States is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies in the direction of everyone else. In the present age, nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Christopher probably sold the top secret information in the Soviet Union at that time, Donton Lee He played as his exchange with. Eventually Christopher and Duncan were arrested and convicted. <br /> <br /> While spending time in the United States on May 23, 1982, Christopher agreed to the 60-minute Australian interview with Ray Martin in the same interview as it was an Australian connection that deeply influenced him. In the Australian media, it was a boring cause for almost a week, and then it became quiet. <br /> <br /> I liked the symbol of the movie, and in it Chris was called Falcon, and Duncan the Snowman (drug connection), but in reality the title "Falkan" was not something that Chris used. <br /> <br /> Christopher's Boy: Criminal or Conscience?
