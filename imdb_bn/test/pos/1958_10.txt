I hope the authors, directors, editors, and musicians (and do not forget the producer) read this post ... because their work was really incredible in this movie. Not saying to me without adding to this movie. I'm just a regular guy who was a fan of this movie for almost 12 years and watched it about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Touching the second of this movie. Each scene is classic. Acting is real. Movie honest You can not play these characters as people, not actors. <br /> <br /> This story follows three different killers at different stages of their life. The story is thought carefully and every sub-plot is assembled and sold together, which is a message that puts us in the right and wrong values, which carries inside each of us. <br /> <br /> Christine Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hooper and Joshua John Miller (as a 12-year-old son) gave amazing surprises, a real performance. I've seen this movie 8 times or more and I'm still so absorbed in their performance that I'm watching a movie. It's that good. Everyone who works this works great. Great work. <br /> <br /> The music is amazingly combined and hunting. Carefully editing time with selected cast and pacing, mood and tone and even the director of content, I made the best decisions for any movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is true. It's honest This is a real movie experience that I will never forget. You may not be subject to issues but something that you can not ignore. Finally, it is about humans ... and everyone can be related to it. I recommend this movie to the horror fans above the drama, mystery, and almost every other film.
