I just saw Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed. As soon as the plot was astonishing, the story was easily stuck. Exciting performance, action, humor, and drama filled screen. Topnotch played by some talented Long Islander. Great script. This is the date that Fred Carpenter made the best, he should be proud of this work. Doug Brown's score mark Next to Tom Morris, Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. It's hard to believe this is a low budget, independent film. Imagine what the fiction might do with the Hollywood-level budget. Paul Reidner's last movie, and he has missed a lot and loves everyone. He was a wonderful, successful, talented actor and a great man. He will see us all and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. All those who participate in this film work great. Some are stealing hard work, and deadly comes break serious material. If you enjoy this picture, go see it!
