This anticipated DVD memorial of Rush's South America tour in 2002 may be the best rock video on disk. The picture and sound production standards are even more amazing, because they have constantly fought with the elements to stop this production. The tracks you expect from the Russian catalog are reproduced for the glorious Brazilian crowd, from Tom Swar to the pass. They are actually a YYZ glory, which gives you their enthusiasm! Disk concert and second disc include 3 multi-set set pieces - La Villa Strangiyato, YYZ and awesome drum solo, about 30-minute documentary about visiting the band Brazil. All of this should all be a win and a serious copyright copy of all the classic rock fans.
