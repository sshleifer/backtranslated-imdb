I rarely bothered to see comedic movies or television. They are vague, obscene, and, most important, not funny. This one can be seen as a refreshing explosion from the past. It's valuable to watch, and I do not believe it will be dated in a significant date. Classic humor is a classic writing, and a good writing of good writing is created, irrespective of the created age. <br /> <br /> I want to see this picture again; Recently, after seeing some similar "summer school" on television, I think in the mind. Like a little new movie, "meatballs" are fun, except for cruel, excessive sexual or bathroom humor. Basically, how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of a teenager - even in the changing of a functional life-saving - and how they grow in both the summer places.
