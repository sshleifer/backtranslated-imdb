A good X bad movie with the taste of "James Bond", "Romeo and Juliet", and even even "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Bad Von Von Bruno has found an English gentleman as a guest, a very dangerous victim. Elgo, the beautiful, easy and well-intentioned lady who was forced to marry, gave love to the triangle. Gone is a terrific past point of missing eyes. The English do not think of counting and a terrible behavior for them. Here are the awesome Hanbach, Crocodiles and even some torture machines as well. <br /> <br /> Here Boris Karloff, strong in a support role, but somewhat hard, present. Other actors (and aspects) are the strong representations of black and white films of an era. Since this wicked person has no doubt from the beginning, who is good, who is good. Even traitors and stiffs can be easily identified.
