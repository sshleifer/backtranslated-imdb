I did not see this movie since coming out on a drive in the theater, and I'm searching for it. At the time I was 12, the story made me excited; And now, the last eludes me. It was the young love that made me the worst, not the voice of the voice and the songs of Tupin. The story (at times) hit my emotional home. I'm passionate about a passionate film and still hanging out in my head after 35 years - it's good. Put yourself at the age of the teenager and let your imagination run. If this movie does not excite your curiosity, you were too old. I look forward to seeing it again (even my age)! If Nostalgia is at your venue, I'm sure it's an interesting movie. This innocence is simply wonderful and it is so simple and enjoyable to simplify it.
