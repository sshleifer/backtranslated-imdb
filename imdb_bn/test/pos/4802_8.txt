You know the production conditions and I saw a lot of crappy Hong Kong movies and were good. But it was very good to get out of TIM. <br /> <br /> I guess that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such good chemistry. The first film is really fast movements but slow enough until it is good enough, we do not want a heart attack, lol. In view of the plot, they are doing a lot more to make you interested. There are some quite good moments in the lava as he makes use of the undercover disguised man. Also from the movie "Flying Daughters House" is the film's best oriental supporter cast. <br /> <br /> It is very impossible and it strikes you in every corner. Of course, most of the comedy, action and thrill deal with a good rental contract out of 10 out of 10
