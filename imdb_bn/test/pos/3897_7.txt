Just as "Colombo" we see that it's OK right from the beginning of death. Following is a growing web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Armin, is not even contrary to "Colombo", even some of a fumbler. This is William H. Messi, the film critic, suspects who carries the film. Continuous twist and turning, the plot transmits Macy deep and deep in his "perfect offense". William H. Messi fans will enjoy the "little case of death", as it would like to capture crime with all sorts of delicious possibilities. Add some good timed comedy, and it's like a fine episode of "Colombo". Highly recommended. - Mr.
