In 1981, I got so much inspiration through this picture, I went to theater four times again to meet again! I'm never for any other film. No movie evokes the feeling of growing as four friends like 60's. My own experience in the 60's has been realized so closely that it is probably something that will divide. Jodi Thilen is beautiful and unreliable! I never knew why he did not grow up big. Steve Tysch's script as a whole cast performance is helpless. I always wanted to know how autobiographical the story was. But frustrated, Steve is no longer here to answer this question. I have all wearing my VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!
