Anthony Minghalella (writer / director) Col Mountain is a careful, sensitive and intelligent play set in the social context of the conflict during civil war, which is very subtle and realistic in relation to the politics of war. Although it accurately portrays the cruelty and inhumanity of the war, it does something that does not effectively affect many films related to this period - the Coal Mountain researches from internal to south context and shows changes among non-slave-owned owners, driven by war. And, almost, unusually, the Cold Mountain does not make much of the southern, northern or the other. <br /> <br /> The movie is protected with the necessary styles - not presenting a dull moment. It's a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely combine. <br /> <br /> The story centers on Inman (Juda Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who smitten with each other for very simple reason. With the introduction of this young romance, Inman recorded in the Confederate Army, earning him a book and a picture of him. Ada's character is one of the brightest aspects of the film, it is important because the audience enjoys the film from the perspective of the third person, but the story clearly begins from the beginning to the end. Recovery is an intelligent southern belle and a liberal daughter's daughter. She has acquired skills in the skills of parents of many arts, women who were surrounded by domestic workers, most of them were expected to learn. In other words, he admitted Ruby Thavez (Rene Zelguiger), he is all about a master in vain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With such an experience, he struggled, Survive with the near memories. Ruby entered the picture as a tough young girl who has been raised by an alcoholic and neglected father. Ruby has all the skills and expertise, lack of income, and they become an integral business partner, they love each other as good friends. Inman's experience is basically different, but some of the images in a mirror. While participating in the war, he killed many friends due to the reasons he did not believe and decided in the desert. Anyone who meets him does not come to the rescue because he returns to the cold mountain at the beginning of a thousand miles and returns, and most of them die. <br /> <br /> The big part of the film is in the long walk of Inman. Both titles they live, learn, grow and change. An ongoing law to bear frustration protects their intense passionate love. For Inman, this is the only source of hope for pure disappointment in the world. This is the same thing, but the old South is a symbol and residue - a world that is fast growing. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is strong and exciting. Appalachian landscapes are beautiful shots that give the film a strong sense of history. Script and editing are extremely powerful - emphasis on the wide range of class and educational differences reflected in the southern sub-dialects of middle belt and lower class eastern belum. With the cast of this movie, nothing should be expected of a finite shortage. And cast, mostly, emerge in the event. But, one of my criticisms relates to the expression adopted by Kidman and Law's characters. An Australian and Britt probably should not expect to reproduce South American speeches properly, but there are several occasions where these two exceptional present-day actors confuse the voice of the script. I accept my sensitivity about this, and with some confidence that it will not bother most of the people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and he remembers me in my Senesence by creating a character. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
