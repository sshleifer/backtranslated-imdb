Howard (Kevin Kline) learned English at high school in the small Indiana town. She is finally married to Emily (Joan Cusack), her parents are very happy. The city is very surprised, because its own Cameron (Matt Dillon) has been nominated for acting Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, is watching the academy awards at the television cameron winner! In his acclaim speech, Cameron announced that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military person, in some parts, he had been taught by gay teacher at high school. You guessed it, its Howard! However, Howard never "came out"; Actually, she believes she is straight! The whole city, the media members will be waiting for the incident and watch, how will Howard and Emily move forward and get married? Or is Howard really gay and understand that he can not go with the ceremony? It's a wonderful, funny, and human movie about a gay man and his status. The man-no-perception-he was gay, the kine was nice and touched. The rest of the cast is equally fine, a stitch to make cusack mixed-up fans and Dylan, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Seleck and others to delight the viewers. Clothing is very nice and beautiful Indiana heartland setting is beautiful. Then, too, the script, direction, and production is very, very nice. However, the insightful, ridiculous and thoughtful aspect of the gay population is the best asset in the film, no doubt. For those who are offended by gay-themed movies, yes, just skip this. However, for those who want to laugh heartily and at the same time want to better understand the situation of gay, it is definitely the best film for them.
