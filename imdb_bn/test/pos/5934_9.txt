Shane Michaels vs Edge-8-Shane Michaels is difficult to believe in the opening match, but the great match of both men's liking, whether you like to be the best actor of the ring and Sean Michaels is simply stupid when his performance comes under Undertaker vs. Headnerych. Casket Match-2- Okay, after a good opening match, now this is a painful match. Undertaker gave some wonderful matches to the Royal Rumble, and there was a similar match against Royal Rumble Shawn Michaels in 1998, but this match got worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bradshaw Triple threat WWE Championship-6- It's OK, I think three men can give good performance, it's not really shown at their best. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs. Triple H World Heavyweight Championship-9- Triple HT gets a clean win, can you believe it, sure that he takes Sleejemmer out but does not use it. Randy Orton did a great role when he acted like a compromise, but how he got the clash is really ridiculous. I really liked this match, it was the best performance ever since HHH. <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match-7- It was very entertaining and I usually do not score in the royal rumble match. This is high. The winner is very much expected, but at the moment it was very pleasant to see many moments, with the fliers and guaragulis I've seen segments in a while, the best part. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a great PPV and a wrestling fans.
