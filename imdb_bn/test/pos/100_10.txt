The best short I've ever seen Some commentators have advised that it has been prolonged, because of its insight density. That has the irony in the comments and little talent. All of the acting is up to Nunan and he perfectly carries his grateful character. I might have liked that the narrator might be less "recognizable", but gravities are perfect pitch perfect. It is short for people who grow their "bars" and those who live in such a culture, who celebrate stupidity and welfare, can create a contrasting and bitter savior for them. A beautiful short film. I was satisfied with the references to Picasso, since I once believed that Picasso was the only other whore with small talent; For example, I guess, most people - till that day I saw some drawings at the age of 12. Picasso was a beautiful artist and a brilliant artist in that era, and many artists would be lifelong in his life. I immediately understood why he was known about the industry that he had to make.
