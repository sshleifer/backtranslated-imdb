This movie is a classic. Children will like it now, and people like me, who were kids when they came out for the first time, still see it for their nostalgic values ​​and their comedies and great stories. It introduces children of different cultures and inspires them for courage. It's not just a cartoon, it's a wonderful composition. I love it
