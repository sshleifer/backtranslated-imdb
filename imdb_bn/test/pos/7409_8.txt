This is one of my personal choices, a rare little jewel which is explored by the general population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson formed the heart of a piece that is a well-chosen cast. Some real battlefields sometimes take place behind the civil war, but it can capture the right tunes and moods. If you are a fan of the Synde Mountain book, try this movie and it does not feel that it makes a good companion piece.
