This is a loneliness and how about a film about distance ?? Physical and emotional - continues to strengthen the relationship between people. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yusuf wants to work in big city! After trying a few weeks to find work without any success, Yusuf is more likely to have Mahmood to live with him. Are they quarreling ?? Nothing physical, just oral. Finally, Yusuf left Mahmut alone. The story ends ... <br /> <br /> These two are the best of both films as the real lover of films. Much is apparently called; Dialogs are used in conflicts, disbelief, hostility, and uncertainty that exist between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual gems in this movie. For example, during the search of work, young Yusuf, in need of a relationship, tried in vain to earn the attention of several young women across the city. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> leave the door open; Mahmut finally got up from his work desk, the door (all the glasses) roamed around and cousins ​​looked at each other and looked at each other. Then Mahmut opened the door and threw Yusuf away. Metaphor complete <br /> <br /> Or, clearly after Mahmut Yusuf, it is becoming clearer with gradual and angry; And all the time, do Yusuf waste his time behind Scratch instead of looking seriously for the job, and spend the money on Mahmud on a toy for a nephew ?? Yusuf is emotional, impure, emotional, and weak. Mahmut's rational, logical, confident, and claimant's control: Right-brain, left-brain dynamite plays beautifully by two actors, who can say a look, a gesture, more broken than a word. <BR> <br /> However, Mahmut is not completely innocent: he still loves his former wife who told him that he would go to Canada with her husband. Mahmut influences a distant and confident friendship with his ex, and sure that he's going to be right about. She wished her well. He said goodbye. He leaves coffee shops where they are talking. Later when he said last night, Mahmut went there and walked around secretly to the airport. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ceylan Some argue that speed can be very slow; But life goes slowly for most of the time, especially for those who are alone. The camera work is relatively simple: choose the scene, set the camera and the light, and go on to the actor's view, insert the scene and leave the scene, even if the camera holds it all the time. There were some panning shots, some high-angle tracking shots, a few rural scenes ?? However, most of the images are shown at a level like a fixed camera and a wide angle lens. In the story, there is no music sound track, except for TV and radio music. And, there is a lot of silence in there because two men are sitting and together watching TV and / or engaged in very limited conversations. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV so I was happy to see, some shows, watching television while watching TV. Silence in the movie matched silence in my house (I was awake, everyone else was on the bed); At my Mahmut television, my chair and position matched. Very polite, giving me a sense of 'staying there' with him ?? And, I guess, I mean a <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not say again because I do not want you to taste other scenes that I did not describe. This is definitely not a movie for everyone. I saw any movie, it shows how much we die when we are alone? Just as we all die, we will die. Mahmut face, black in the final scene, will stay with me for a long time, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
