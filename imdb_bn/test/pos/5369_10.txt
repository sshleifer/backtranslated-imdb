I was 10 or 11 years old when I came out of this movie, and it stayed with me for 35 years. When the movie came out, all the theaters in St. Louis area distributed 'Lor', the pack of flower seeds, the movie name in front of it. This is the back of the pack, in many words ... these seeds at midnight. A white flower grows, you are saved ... but if red red flowers, you are destroyed !!! Not saying, for the eleven year old child, I did not plant seeds to be afraid to pop up. Here spoiler: When the movie starts, you see a small toy tank moving in a dirt. A small town is going to a family town, and suddenly the camera is back in the tank again, and it's full size. It waited on the car, and you see the bloody thumb departing from the ruins, then, suddenly, the tank is small again. <br /> <br /> This movie is because of the fact that I stuck with me for long, because I was. One is a correct toy tank as a movie !!!! Unfortunately I do not know what happened, but I look carefully at that thing !!! <br /> <br /> Turn on the lamp, place it in the DVD, create a sandwich and watch this movie. It is very good !!!
