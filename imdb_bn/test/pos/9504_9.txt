"Ikei Flix" is an excellent starting point for anyone with even a vague interest. Most of their classic videos are present (though they are weird about "Earth vs. Flying Sockers" and "Cruise Beaule") and their various CD-ROM projects "Attentive" MTV are able to understand that they are keeping heavy rotation (or, indeed, video time) Time has spent their time. <br /> <br /> All videos in this suite are interesting imagery and stupid music (original track likes and new recordings). And the two of them - "The Third Ritch 'n' Roll" and "One Minute Cinema" - are in the permanent collections of museum museums. Check out this DVD and find out why.
