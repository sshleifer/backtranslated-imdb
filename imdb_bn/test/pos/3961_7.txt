This is a teenage movie and when you see that it has some nuns stuffed here and there, but overall the film is effective, it makes you effective and thinks your story that it is interesting but trustworthy and you feel good in the sequence , It's not like the way to try and do its normal job. Characters are quite well defined and believable. Justin stood tall among others and watched for his speech until he congratulated someone in the lecture, he was only bright in that speech. She will take a more serious role, she's just more valuable than the teen movie. Etch this movie and get released
