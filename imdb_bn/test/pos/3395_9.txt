I saw it with my mother only (who got it for Christmas) I was thrilled to find something different from the normal things I usually see. All the stories were detailed and you can feel the strong passion of each character from the very beginning. Each story is followed brilliantly, which makes you feel completely different for each single character. Cast is amazing, James Hedger and Madeline Faire / Lamot / Muine as my personal favorite, James Reid and Leslie-Annie Down. Making the whole thing deep and wonderful, very compulsory, I recommend it to almost everyone.
