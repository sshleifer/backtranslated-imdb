I do not understand why this movie is so low rating It's completely more demanding! Of course, this is ridiculous, but it was supposed to be. Do not expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty patron competitors stuck in a Caribbean island! Do you hope that it is surprisingly surprising about the most relevant science-fiction, fiction, and blockbuster movies in film history and even the references to other spoofers. All completely hugely and sometimes totally unnecessary, but that's just what stands out in this movie. If you like parodies and enjoy Leslie Nielsen or Mike Mayer, you'll love it. I'm sure!
