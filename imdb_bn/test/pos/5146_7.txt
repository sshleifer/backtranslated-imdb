My family (two 40-something, an eight-year-old and my 71-year-old mother) saw it on April 29th in a lighted preview. We all enjoyed the movie too. The story was good, and it is more enjoyable to be based on real-life events. Lam Wilson team was a hawk (pan-purpose) to visit as Blake Nelson. And blue flin was better to show than anything other than "the average father from scrubb". The children of the film did well and I am sure they will apply for a specific population at the heart rate level. The visuals were very beautiful and Jimmy Buff was added to the music "Florida feeling". Well, maybe the story was very clean and good for some adults, but hey care? I can not compare it to the book, I have not heard it honestly until the film comes. <br /> <br /> It was just a ness and it was a good message. Very easy
