It seems that the hack has been described as untrustworthy ... but what is the TV? The TV is meant to provide a turn from everyday life and I think hacks do that a great job. Add a slow process of publishing its past and engaging / attractive plots; You just do not seem to get enough. What more do you want for the great actors like Plus, David Morse, Andr√© Brugger, and even a little Matthew Barish? So if you are looking for a related experience and prefer "underdog" characters, I suggest hacking an opportunity, especially now it's going to its feet.
