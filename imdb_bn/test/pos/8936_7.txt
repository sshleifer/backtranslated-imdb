When viewing "Plot with a View" (known in the United States as "Undertaking Betty"), I think there is a need to create more movies in Wales. It is trying to move away from a woman in a small village (Brenda Bluthin) from her cheating husband. So, he and the funeral procession manager (Alfred Molina) came up with a plan ... but there could be some glitches along the way. <br /> <br /> I really want to say that the character of Christopher Walken is the most beautiful in the movie (how could she?). But overall, the whole idea is stacked with just a clean, some "oh oh" moments ... especially the ghostly house scenes. This is the movie I want to write that I want to enter it. <br /> <br /> also starring Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Mariam Margilles.
