I was surprised by this picture. I hired / discovered the films of Antonio, and this movie showed me the last episode and results of the management of 50 years. What an eye for setting, color, and detail! I have never seen before such visual beauty and poetry impressed. After the first story, I had to stop and keep tears. Yes, beauty moves me, as it moves Keats to write Ode on a Grecian Urn. This movie is created for mature, mentally and intelligent, viewers. Those who are looking forward to seeing physical and soap operas will be disappointed. I will see this film many times before I can really appreciate this and judge it. This movie should be required to be watched for all cinemographographers and managers. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a curious film on Kurushawa's dream order
