German filmmakers tried to do something completely new with "Anatomy". Generally there are only drama or comedy movies - in that horror style (or was) completely new <br /> <br /> The story is new and terrifying. Franka Potente played brilliantly in her role and I bet you will not find the killer. It is possible, but difficult. Truly a great movie with many talented actors
