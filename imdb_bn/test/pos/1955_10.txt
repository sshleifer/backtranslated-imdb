IMDB is asking critics for typing a certain amount of line, but I really want to say - "This is an incredible movie, and you can not even consider it a movie fan." You should just believe in this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push the game. But I have to type in something. So, give me the following instructions: <br /> (1) The River Edge is the episode of Crispin Glover's all-time comedy and the best performance of a movie and if you're following the Crespen Glover, you know that it's only 10 Provides Lots of funny lines <br /> <br /> (2) On the bank of the river there is the second most memorable performance of the career of Dunge Hooper (other than the blue velvet), and it's really nice. Dennis Hooper is really fun. <br /> <br /> (3) The river has the best performance of the River Cay on the River and it's a wonderful performance. She was the role of the role she was born in. She has a lot of good lines, but especially really really fun. Listen to his character and step-parent while talking to each other. <br /> <br /> Still the best stoner film, it's just a lot more than that. It shows in the movie rental shop drama section, but if it is a drama, it is the most fun drama ever.
