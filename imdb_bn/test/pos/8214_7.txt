It was one of the many techno-fobic films produced in the mid-90's, after going to the main stream of the Internet, like Mashroom. <br /> <br /> Hollywood movies have always chosen the way to "beautify" the finger painted. Look at them better and more interesting. When Hollywood tries to show us some high-tech, the same happens. Such efforts change rather than being remotely and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Monique (1995), etc.) are quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> "net" is located somewhere in that extreme. By Nitpicking, a lot could end up with technical contradictions, and in many cases where ongoings seem much "sexy" and graphical than things in real life (usually occurring in the movie) and graphical. <</ br> <br /> However, ignoring the audience, the audience ends with a strong, entertaining movie. Characters and actors, and the movie ends up doing a good job to keep your seat. The plot is ok (a fair scale, really - based on the good ol paranoike design, but at this high-end side), and quite convincing (again, when ignoring technical issues). The development of the plot is a bit slower, though sometimes you may be surprised at some surprising surprise. <br /> <br /> The bonus here is the Cutie-pie Sandra Bullock, which besides knowing (something she does not quite easily, seemingly), also portrays a solid job. You can feel his character really - his frustration, his passion <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It's also valuable to rent from video libraries or even watch movies. Whether to buy it or not on you.
