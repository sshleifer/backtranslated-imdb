The sad thing about Frontline is that once you see three or four episodes, you really start to understand that it is not far from what has happened in real life. Really sad that makes it extremely fun. <br /> <br /> Series Frontline Team by Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who truly lives and dies only by his show rating. Sometimes, to achieve these ratings, his stunts show him with his line producer Emma Thompson (Alison White); A woman who has not lost all her journalism integrity and is ready to defend the moral scruples on the occasion. Reporter Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - The same reporter who has pulled out all the material from him, can not be said - so much should be asked to laugh while interviewing Ben Elton. His reports are usually made up of interview celebrities (with whom he has previously or has not 'crossed') or usually made of disrespectful complaints. Martin de Stasiio (Tirill Mora) is a reporter with whom the team relies on the importance and dignity, because he has 21 years of journalism in his back. He sometimes draws the line, although he does not have so much policies as a nous which makes the story of a good journalism. Mike Moore (Rob Sitch) is a proud, naive reporter who can not see that he is simply a beautiful face for philosophical journalism. Brian is attracted to his horrors and is only compromising his morals and allowing his stupidity to rest. <br /> <br /> Frontline is such a show that is more needed because it shows that happiness, security and deep political insight in modern times are interesting topics; It's much easier to rate scandal, fear and tabloid celebrity.
