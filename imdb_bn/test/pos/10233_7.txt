If you are looking for an original horror flick, it might be for you. It is strange and lingers on sometimes foolhardy, but it is only a good looking, nice word and original movie, it never fails, without extra long climax time. "Nightbride" must be seen for the fearful fans, or fans of fans of the giant film fans. <br /> <br /> Dreams of live cities full of buain (Craig Schaffer) media. Therapies, his psychologist said. Decker (awful director David Krenberg) came to the conclusion that Booen was a murderer and gave him hallucinogenic medicine and told him to turn himself in. After almost died, Boone died at the hospital. , Where he knows a psychiatric patient who knows about the media and where to go to Booun. The Midian, the wild mutant animals living in a graveyard do not allow the fabric to enter. After only escaping with a nasty bite, the police shot his sister to death, by which Dr. Decker took his position. But Boone did not die. The bite makes him alive, and he goes to the media. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby) tried to find Boone and went downstairs. When Dr. Dakar also found out about this place, then chaos was created. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be long and complex, but it is not difficult to understand. Among other things, the plot really makes this picture. The make-up effect is surprising. Animals look unique and amazing, and this will make a very interesting film. To add more sense appeal, our Danny Elfman has a musical score that fits the film with both colorful and enthusiastic, and a glove. Movie shots are also set up beautifully. Cinematography is beautiful, and the film creates an atmosphere that can never be broken. Even acting is good, with the greatest surprise being a great man of director David Krenberg, who wants to see sister's death for one reason or another. This is awesome for a horror movie. It may well be done. <br /> <br /> Movie problems ... There are good but positive aspects have negative effects. The script sometimes tricks the hairy jokes and adds some humor, but almost everyone is flat. Mutant animals look great and in most cases are well played, but sometimes they seem to be making their amazing makeup for the camera. The worst part of the film will be Climax. It takes so long, and is just constant chaos. This is the part of this movie which is to be removed from individual characters and beautiful tights, blasts of flames from each and the characters we do not know or do not care about. <br /> <br /> Overall, look at this movie is amazing. This is a horror movie that works well, but even with it, it's sometimes a failure of character lines and a dirty climax. However, it is one of the check out. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** *** *** Out. 101 minutes For strong violence and language.
