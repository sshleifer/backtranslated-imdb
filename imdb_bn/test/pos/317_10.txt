Through hundreds of comments posted to IMDB loyal readers in this movie, I think, "The middle of the road" comments are very interesting to me. Everyone loves it, or they hate it. About 30 times now the apocalypse is being seen and recently it is disconnected from the DVD (how we've ever lived without those magical digital machines ???), I can say without hesitation that my heart for this photo is a special place among those people. "Why do you want a movie so confusing?" Many of my partners asked. The answer is: forget about war, forget about atrocities .... It protects from the best story of society which denies them in keeping with their condition. Brando represents the person that has his own way of doing work. They (Big Brother) sent him to work, he did very well, without following the "standard" of death and destruction (I am only saying that 'standard' and 'death' for our death ????), so they are different "Arid Police" to send out. Hmmm .... Do you see every day and draw a parallel between it? With deep respect for Mr. Kapolo, I believe that he is the greatest director ever, I think he crossed the original intention of the film and probably did not realize it until the film was released. There is a lot more ways in which the fine sub-text that flows in the entire subcontinent, designed and illustrated; Instead, it seems, it's like a 'plant', like some wild flowers in the middle of a plant garden. Again I must repeat: I think FF Coppola has been working on this whole production, such as cast and crew, but the sum total of the film exceeds ten times the personal effort. So if you do not see the movie, rent it, check it out, then watch it again, and look for a few more more generic parallels for everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. If you have seen it, see it again with previously described psychology. I think you can get a completely new perception for the film. Maybe or not! No matter you love or hate it, be sure and give credit for Coppola's great storytelling!
