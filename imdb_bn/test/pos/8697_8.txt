The perfect occupier of a movie, and his age, his time ahead of the year. I came home with my dad a neighbor TV in the first week, that guy saw that the scrap has been cast on the hip. A trickster with everything in the power station, Dad worked in two days. It was July 1955 ... and then maybe the third house on the street for television! This was the first picture we saw on the great and exciting old 12-inch screen. "It's an old favorite," I reminded my mother to say! <br /> <br /> It's almost 50 years old, and it does not seem to be old - rather like that World War! Imagine a horrific little carrier carrying 13 passengers including a London Amnibus, that crashed, killing one of their numbers. Then, in the flashback we took the lives of these people and on that day they were taking them on this bus. <br /> <br /> After the crash was over at the end of the movie, the identity of the victim was revealed, probably the list of Adrian Messener's inspiration from the 1960 film list. <br /> <br /> If you ever come across this little gem, then I suggest you look at it!
