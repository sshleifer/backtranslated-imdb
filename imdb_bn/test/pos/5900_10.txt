In 2004, IMDB wrote the following statement on the message board when a user was surprised that The Best Years of a Live Movie was a forgotten movie: <br /> <br /> ***** I have a time capsule to watch this movie. . I'm probably one of the more interesting characters in the "The Best Years of a Live", in many ways, and it is very similar to living in the United States in the mid-1940s, after WWII. I believe "The Coming Home" and "The Hero Hunter" both were released in 1978, the most recent movie, which was the closest to keeping the military forces back from the war raised in "the best years of our life". <br /> <br /> I am really impressed when I was in college in 1980-81 when I was in college and many college college students did not congratulate the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie still packs a wallp and I am very happy to read it in other posts, other users feel like a film that will definitely stand in the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I am very happy to see the movie at the top 100 movies in IMDB and AFI. Also, eventually it became a Christmas classic, but it was a wonderful life, reasonably well, with the best picture of The Best Years of Non Live, the Oscar win. <br /> <br /> I saw the film again in 2005 and almost 60 years later, The Best Years of Non Live is still a strong, beautifully played and orderly motion picture.
