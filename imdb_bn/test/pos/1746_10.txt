How nice. I saw this movie and "up" in one theater at one the other theaters on the same day. I saw the first "Mr. Bug", and then completely followed up "up" was frustrated. What a beautiful and sensitive film! Cinematographs of the 1930s and 40s can be annoying with their musician acting and dialogue nowadays, but the same melodrama and crying as animation can be ridiculous. Drawing 30 seconds and soft "biological" lines and music puts you in a beautiful cozy mood and you can enjoy the show with all its small letters: Ladybug, grassland, bees, shells, stingbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, cricket, and more More with their own cute little (but overbearing) idiosyncrasies. Honesty with humankind, Nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heeled, innocent cats may play baby kids), kindly and unknown to destroyers, realistic and fascinating. You care about the bug, and Dick and Mary. Hero Happi is not a perfect superman who "sets things right" but is a starred optimist who takes everyone's garden (literally!) And each time it seems to be ending with joy in the 1930s style. Another roadblock ...! I was at the edge of my seat "up." I came out of the movie theater, Chucking: This has not happened for a long time!
