To make this film summer: Good for TV but too small for the theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home but I would not see it second time. The idea is good, but what summed up the end of the movie. The end was a 'nice' twist but still unhappy. Maybe it was the director's motto but it did not work like it should be. But then again, it's a exactly kind of movie.
