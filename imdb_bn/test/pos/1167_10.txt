Shan Connie is very good as the great royuli, Lord of the Rif and the faithful of the faithful. This is an adventure movie with Arab, German and the United States, which is moving at one or the other. There are many comedies between the main and supporter characters in the interface. The story was based on the fact that, in the early 1900s, Royusuli kidnapped a wealthy Greek-American businessman. Millionaire replaced Kennes Bergen and his two children as the victim of kidnappers, and this story is open for many literary licenses. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film allows Milias to be reminded by the most famous two (although mostly forgotten) political quotes from the political quote of the era. Brian Keith (very good as a TR) said, "Pedekaris are alive or killed by raisuli!"; And John Huston (as John John Hey Secretary) asked the Japanese ambassador at the White House dinner, "Do you like knives, do you like fowl?"
