When I first saw this movie, I was just a little child and fell in love with me, they did not really make such a movie, I now look a little bit more and still love. <br /> <br /> The humor is perfect and the movie really fits well, all the gags are like kids, but adults can also laugh, and a child's movie is very rare. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The backgrounds are stunning and the colors are amazing. <br /> <br /> characters are only those letters that you fall in love when you see that the girls' chips are very funny and people think the chip is really very sexy. <br /> <br /> Songs are fun to listen to, and anyone is just crying or having fun to wake up and dance, fun to watch with the visual humor on the go with them. <br /> <br /> Voice activation There is no doubt even though most voice acting is higher pitch, but an interesting thing is popped up and it's one of the songs in this movie but gradually to show them the real voice behind them and its really kinda fun To see. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie to rent or shop anywhere, I'm saying it is really worth watching and it's a perfect family movie, it's absolutely amazing, words can not publish this movie.
