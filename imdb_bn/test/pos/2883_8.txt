I enjoyed this image and it lets you think about it even after it ends. I believe Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role, though her "death" performance was slightly to the top, but I did not think Jeremy Brett. <br /> <br /> It's a good part of the play and follow the Oscars Wildes novel very closely. If you enjoy this movie, then I would suggest you see Jeremy Brett as "a perfect husband" like Lord Garring. <br /> <br /> This image gives a deep insight into the thoughts of Oscar Wildes. And while watching Dorian Gray Lord Alfred 'Bossy' Douglas and Basil Halward are reminded of how to do an Oscar Wilde
