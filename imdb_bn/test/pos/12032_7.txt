The "home entertainment" effort has decreased even after Hollywood has produced the Mafia from a production line to a nice, excellent, and some well-played and reasonable scripts (many of which - true! For change!). <br /> <br /> This script is not just clear (all checklist boxes are ticked), but trying to create the best part of other people spending a lot of time. . The Godfather is the most obvious, but there are other references. I will not bother naming them. Yet it is a good taste holder! Producer seems to define a quota for gunfight and murder (at least every twenty minutes?) And the last is weak and "so what?" I said that this generation has different versions, so maybe the version I saw is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gangsters do not take money because they do not take money. Usually by fear. Rather than earning some money, it seems to be more in terms of business killings and greatness. They were the first that they were (in real life and here). At Charlie Lucky 'Luciano "you can not earn money with guns in your hand" at one stage ". Smart gangster is one, though everything is relative. She was a skilled white slave trader and a drug seller Italian bundle before she was home. <br /> <br /> Old school "Peat's moustached" is selected by the new blood, who wanted strength and money for themselves and to make the straight jacket of Italian / Sicilian energy (rarely doing business outside of itself) The young Turk knows that they need to be related to their other groups (especially "Jews" who know how to make money) and it has been mentioned at least and has been accepted. It is not so clear that most immigrant groups had their own mafia - but most of them earn their money and become legitimate. And why not? Who wants to die in jail? <br /> <br /> Jason Bano was a ruthless man, ready to be killed if needed, but not a fool or a fool. His story was tragic that he could earn money in the soil world and he showed special skills to avoid being killed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> bring us and think of something. We - Undoubtedly - a life-watcher watching we are not happy to lead. The people shown here were born in a cruel world, but their only sign was to do it. <br /> <br /> If you do not get enough of gangster style then it would be better to see Godfather 1 and 2. For the tenth time and it's even better - as the basic entertainment - the Godfather 3 is more than that awesome mafafaier.
