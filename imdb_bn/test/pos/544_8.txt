One of the recent over-the-top plays broadcast by Hollywood, this movie is extraordinary, where others have completely failed (especially considering the most dramatic performance in portmantean drama of dramatic characters in recent drama), this film is almost universally run by chemistry that Susan and Natalie share . They seem so natural at the time of the movie that you make mistakes for their real family. Many mothers and daughters went through a lot of conflict in their hard work to not select their acting ability. I think these two actresses' talented performances were highlighted where the story was lacking and was almost known (full of Clive) and really saved the plot of hardship. I love this movie mainly those who love their two actresses or such plays.
