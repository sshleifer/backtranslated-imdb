I was lucky to be extra in this movie at the age of 13 during the roller-rink scenes. My junior high school was invited to participate in the Drama Class. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Bus, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played live music all day long! As a musician, I can praise these boys for uninterrupted work and sacrifice in their role. They must have played those songs 20 times. Under this condition it is very difficult to maintain consistency and strength. "That day," a close-up is visible in a cut-off time, but fortunately the unsuspecting public will probably not pick it up. <br /> <br /> There was incredible thrill of getting skating all day long, getting off school day and returning time. I had my first "date" film. I was walking a girl up to the ticket booth. Hello Even my hair wastewater and light lamps were still valuable with the addition of Veseline. Fun things <br /> <br /> The film's top notch and completely extremely satisfying. Busey never delivers its best role and the supporter throws fantastic. I'm happy to have attended a great movie. I think I might be in the summer of the carvave or something. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was in a video store in Malibu, to watch the movie for the release of the video. Gary went into Busey and stood beside the right. I showed him the cover and how great he was and how I babbled over on an extra and what was. Quite curious, but very good, for what it's worth.
