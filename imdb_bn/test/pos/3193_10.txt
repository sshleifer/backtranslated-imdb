It was a television show that I saw as a child in the 1960s and was impressed by it. Over the years, I've often thought about this show and how good it will be to see it again, but the past should keep in mind that you remember them as not as good. It was a great show in the 1960s and even something lost in 2007. Certainly there are some weird production errors which you see when seeing old shots and took a few episodes to use it in Doubled Voices but that did work, as I was back in the 1960s as I was now captivated. Samui Koichi Oas, who plays very lowly, is played by. I think, due to the popularity of Australia's show in the 60's, he traveled to play the swords and he was disappointed by the show and his interest. It was a fact that one of my favorite shows was still held that magic during my childhood. Have a series to see.
