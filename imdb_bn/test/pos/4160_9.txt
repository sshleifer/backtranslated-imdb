This is the Christmas time! A birthplace in relation to rebirth, or at least it can be expected about Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years ago that Italian cinema did not compose an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be considered as the same level of quality as the Italian superstar of the past, unable to quote any name. And finally this time is a big production for the Italian standard. This film has a rare balance of different elements, enjoying all the rich and fruitful levels. Real poetry, real humor, real elegance, real drama, real beauty No miracle, no simple shortcut, no general tourism tornado-like film screenplay, no acting, no director autorunism. There are also cool cool uses of two hearty Nina Simone songs, whose music, I calculate that no scores have been used properly. So if it is not truly resuscitative for the Italian film, then it is a remarkable evolution for Emanuel Crile's after another lovely film 'Respiro'. 'Nuovomondo' is not missed, it is helpful to make 'Medicine Film' film, watch movies, enjoy life and understand. Francesco Cabras
