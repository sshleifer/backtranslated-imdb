Personally, I love Triss Movie! My best friend told me about it so I rent it on a rental. It's amazing! Music, acting, story lines, emotions, everything ... well without a minor fact. Absolutely no loyalty in the book. Before watching an interview with the vampire, I saw this movie and even before the existence of books, I was surprised to see how many people actually hate this movie. The fans of the book were not satisfied with the disbelief, I quickly got confused, I do not want to be hypocritical (I hate Harry Potter because of lack of book loyalty) I remained silent. Eventually, I picked "The Vampire's Lestat" and realized completely why everyone hated it. It is completely different (the story of the film is the combination of "The Vampire's Loss" and "The Queen of the Damned"). But since I saw it before reading the book since I liked the movie. So if you do not see this movie or see the movie in the movie first you will hate it. If you read the book you have the right to hate this movie.
