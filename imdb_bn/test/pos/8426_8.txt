Here's one of the movies of Jane Austen which I found very enjoyable. The first book I read was heard in Sidi and was affected by how a young Victorian girl could be persuaded to marry a man who loves her because of a fate or lack of education. Anne is an intelligent pleasure that is definitely reunited with a lost love. His parents tried to marry a cousin for a cousin who is not only out of money. Snubbery from the upper classes and share how the differences in the class can follow couples in their hearts. Captain Wentworth realized that he still loved Anna after seven years. His ultimate burden is that Ani's love was always constant and he did not let his family interfere with the way he really loved his true happiness and last marriage.
