George Kakar, who is known as a female director, could not expect more two talented and beautiful women for his last film. John Boon Druten's "Bate Davis Campi" is a remake of Old Aquinantas, this film must be definite, but still delightful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Leish Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She met with her best friend Mary Nell during her lifetime at the exclusive girls school and she started a lifetime of friendly competition forever. Later, when Lease confronted the "promising" but obsessed with the serious imagination, Mary tried to write, which Mary disgusted her suffering because of her casual attitude, taking her very little. <br /> <br /> In many disguises of lease, Mary's trashy novels have hit the pay dirt, and finally, her old friend is judging her novel for the Lease National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as an arrogant writer of his impressive calendar, who plans to combine broken pieces of his life with the last partnership of his life, but sad things are never easy. <br /> <br /> Includes David Selby, whom you played as the dark shadow, Heart Bocher's tragic Quantin Collins and of course, after leaving soap, a delicious young man and Maravian Meng Ryan played a role in his first film. <br /> <br /> Rich and famous Katy, Campi, Wicked and wise. It ends in New Year Fiasco, which pressures on the lasting nature of true friendship, and I have never been able to see it in the New Year Eve. See it and why you will see it.
