For the best movie if this film is not selected for at least one Oscar nominee, I am going to wake up at night watching the show. Friedrich Thur Friedrichson proves that money is not a good film but a key to creating originality. Comes from a cold country to a mental sick man, a warm but worried stimulant film and his struggle against an insane world. After such insight, you ask whether people are crazy or they are living in the world.
