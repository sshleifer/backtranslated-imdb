I had borrowed the whole movie from three to three friends, and saw them when sick on a weekend bed. I thoroughly enjoyed each of them. I was fascinated by how Caleb and his sister grew up at the last moment. In addition, I love the exterior of the "Billy-boy" song which first heard the credits of the first film credit "Shah, plain and tal". However, one thing that I did not like at the end of winter is that she was the youngest girl. He was a very nice little girl, but he got a lot of spirit and looked like warmer than other kids, even talking about childhood, he was still better than Caleb.
