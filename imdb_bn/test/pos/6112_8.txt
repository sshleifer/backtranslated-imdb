I first got to know John Waters' movies by seeing "female problems" in IFC. I was hateful but due to some illness, I enjoyed it. Then, I picked up the pinky flamingos DVD in John Waters's boxed set. This film is about Babes Johnson, "The Fellest Person's Alive", who lives in the trolley of Murrayland's thick egg covered mother and her infamous "crackers". In movies, you can see sexually transmitted diseases such as sex, drug-dealing, drug addiction, torture and other kinds of random insults. This film is a soundtrack of 60's rock and roll artists. The only problem is that dragging some parts of the film and getting a little annoying. I got a little more fun "female problem" NC-17 rates for clear sex, violence, and annoying images. Enjoy.
