Of course, I was a little confusing, but for that time the most accurate illustration of the Marenans shown on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I was at Camp Pendleton with Infantry training when Webb brought his crew down and the film was told to take some outdoor scenes and participate in our company. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Going forever at the age of 18 - The Webb was very wise to get things done (marine things) and he did a good job with an exception - the scene where an employer was wearing sunglasses. Will never happen for any reason. <br /> <br /> I have a video of the movie and my grandkids can sit for a few seconds at any time when I see their Papo when they were young and were part of the world's greatest war crimes and no part of it (no bruises, not just true ). Before that I realized that DIS has some acting genes to finish their work. <br /> <br /> The only film that I saw was equal to DI in the first half of the flower metal jacket and that part is only higher due to the fool language. When D was created, the curse on the screen was not allowed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, or die
