*** Spokes races *** Feeling alone with love and friendship, Francis Austen, Sandy Dennis, puts all those emotions in when he is a popular young single lady with many high-class friends. But because of his deep insecurity, he kept the length of the arms. Francis's male friends are not close to his age so there is no reason to be romantic in his relationship with him. <br /> <br /> One evening, Francis used to entertain some of his friends. He jumped out of his apartment window, a young man, Michael Barnes, was sitting alone for cold weather. It seems that after leaving his friends, heaven and alone, Frances goes out of the park and young people do not take shelter until the rain falls and even sitting in the bedroom of a guest's guest. You can see directly that Francis is only interested in keeping the young person safe outside the cold and rain, then he wants to keep himself as a friend lover or even play toy and as you progress in the movie you see that you were right. <br /> <br /> A remarkable performance by Sandy Dennis, which was similar to the Kathy Bethes Academy Award in the film "Missy" created in the 1990's, almost twenty-one years later. Francis thinks that the young man was alone and homeless and when he met her later, undoubtedly the perfect person saw him as a real friend. He has no way to equate his or her friends like his friends, the Indian chief of the doctor's lawyer, and thus completely dependent on him. It was later found that the young man is not alone and homeless, that Francis thought he was When he gradually finds out that he does not really need him and instead has changed him, on the other hand, it has stopped somewhat in Francis's mind, which has become an obedience to the proportion of the killings. <br /> <br /> A strange film directed by director Robert Otman, which makes people's loneliness and depression deeper. Actress Sandy Dennis played her solo Jakeel and Miss Hyde are perfect, but at the same time, dangerous Frances Austen, and it is a sad fact that he did not receive an Academy Award for his role in the film. But was not even nominated for it. Most of the film stars, like Robert Olman, have made a lot of progress, and in particular the young sister Nina, Susan Benton and her boyfriend Nick, advertise in the free talk dialogue between David Garfield. When I watch a movie, the only thing in the movie seems confusing when we see Francis go to the clinic to take a full clinic test and tell the doctor that he wants to marry soon. Was her husband a young man in his apartment? But alongside this film is very well spread in the story and in the end it is a real shock for the audience along with the audience. Finally, finally he realized that Francis is not only a little away but a madman as a murderer.
