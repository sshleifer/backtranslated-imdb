This is a totally awesome movie! If you have not seen it yet, you should do well. Sure, the plot is slow, special effect is ridiculous, the act is ridiculous and the action is poorly dancer, but wrestler DDP will say; It's not a bad thing .... it's a good thing! Everything about this movie is pleasing, especially if you get the dubbed version, which is even worse actors. Where you fight for sunny, sunny women until infinite, seeks for sequel, end up. So, I give ten stars. If you are not one of the best-tasted 'discriminatory' and 'intelligent' people who only prefer 'high quality' films of the highest qualification, I recommend this completely monkey movie!
