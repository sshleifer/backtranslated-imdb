Well, I hope, for all the campaigns and Oscar nominations, an epic civil war drama (and the amount of "English Patient" will be given to the same director). This picture is not an epic play, but I see it was not released because it was not. It is a love story in the horror of war in which young people are sent for war, deserts are searched and killed, and when men and children leave their homes, the boys and boys live for themselves. However, I thought Nicole Kidman and Ron Jelvis were beautiful and did not know much about Jude Law, he was also right. Looks like Ron J. There were more interesting parts of 3 Lead and impressively impressive, gradually, the lady was able to play with a lot of curiosity. It was also good for me to see actress, Kathy Baker ... Anybody's talent will be more recognizable / recognized. <br /> <br /> This image looks like - I can not really explain why, but it could be a piece of America because. <br /> <br />
