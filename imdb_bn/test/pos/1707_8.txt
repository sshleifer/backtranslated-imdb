I decided to look at this picture, not the title, or was this cover enough to spend my time and money ?? Which shows, me and everyone, that a DVD should not be judged by its cover. <br /> <br /> *** Spokes races *** The film was felt like it was trendsetting along, not really going anywhere ?? The care of Paul Faber (in the sense of) girls was often embarrassing, and on the other hand, attractive Kirsten Becker (as Alexandria Lee) often looks at school-girls. Who was really fashionable in 1995? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Magical To behave like a complete mortal in front of Alexandre (like "Dying with Boomer?") Shame really was as Vicky Mueller as the audience that we were. (Well? That title, give away that, would not you mind?) <br /> <br /> Was really surprised, especially in the scene where Wiki Todd gave a metallic version of his changed ego (dog character) in the small white jewel box. The tingling sensation managed to reassign? And no return points for the wiki. The shame that the film ended with focus (Todd's father after crossing Harvard Drive) to reunite with his friends. Could I envision a whole new movie ?? wiki in New York Following ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, does anyone else notice that this movie is a good one Do not be happy? Todd's mother is a little insane (phone 24/7), does her parents find her interesting (more?) Todd teacher is likely disenchanted by his wife and vice versa ?? Tod also entered into a wonderful loving and brave relationship, which, although it may be beautiful, it will be very difficult to maintain (in fact, the differences in maturity, maturity difference etc), and Alexandre and Jacques will not be together because Alexandra is not mature enough to handle a relationship (-> His reaction to condom, cheating, progress of zak etc. All are very unfamiliar, and p Rai is involved in running away), and Jake himself, poor man ?? Like a very good friend / brother brother can drag too much Alexandra. <br /> <br /> Remember, good movie! I gave it an 8/10. Bright performance by the actor - bring those script life.
