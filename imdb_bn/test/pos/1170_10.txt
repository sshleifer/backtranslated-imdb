Throw this film well, often silly and always funny. Lemon and Matthew work with their tag team Magic Fulfillment. Brent Spinner is just a riot as a cruise director's arrogant tyrant. From the first "Hare Crisna" to the end "You have to pay him fifty rupees to call him two tricks", I thought it was a complete fun entertainment comedy
