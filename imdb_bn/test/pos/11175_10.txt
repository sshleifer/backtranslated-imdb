First I played the second Monkey Island game, and I like it despite low quality graphics and sounds. Then a few months later, I found a new game. I tried it and loved it a lot. The first thing you aim is to have great graphics. Large, colorful, and detailed with lots of exploration of the area. You always have to use your brain in the game, many things. Click all the points and games of the game, is challenging with frustrating. Jokes have not gotten nearly a third time around. Animated cut scenes are also a great addition to the game. This is the best MI game, perhaps to play the best P & C! If you like Cartoonie Games that are playing like a movie then get this game!
