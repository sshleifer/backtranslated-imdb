What anand This is really a parody. Only French people can do that kind of thing without obesity. And as a result, you really have a good time while making a gin dude a fool. Most movies are standing on their shoulders, and they are quite wide enough to make this picture better. More than those of James Bond, he is more likely that Austin Powers' Mike Meyers has no similarity. Documents are good enough to keep viewers' attention, with many stupid jokes, that's really perfect. Among the main sections of the film, both women compare with the main character and it was a challenge. There is no real plot in this movie, but what does it expect for such a movie? You just want to laugh about one hour and 40 minutes and it's just how movie is managed. This is worthy of success in France
