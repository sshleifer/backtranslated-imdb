This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! Anyone who can pounce this movie fixes my imagination! After all, Goodining and Harris's performance were only spectacular, especially Gooding. The only way I can describe acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it will be to play a character like this and it will be closed; Then you see gooding, and its performance was witch. For the plot, since it was based on a real person, so the life of characters goes wherever they are. For all action buffs, it may be a little slow, but then it is not an action film. I definitely give this movie 10. It deserves nothing less!
