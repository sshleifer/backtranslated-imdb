I really can not criticize this film. This is actually the first movie I have seen in mind and led to the fame and fame of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric creatures. Thankfully, after seeing it again years later, it held fairly well. Rod Cameron is a big game hunter whose end is erased by Safari Mammoth. Nobody believes in him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, who had killed his brother. And Rod Cameron was only living. The film was shot in India and has some good scenery. Acting on a higher level. I do not believe Rod Cameron, Caesar Romero and Marie Winson have ever turned into bad performances. Mammoths, fairly effective when they finally arrive. Ultimately, there is also a tremendous twist for the 1950s science fiction film. The price is definitely worth seeing.
