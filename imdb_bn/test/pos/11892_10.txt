We just finished El Padrino screening in Australia. A phenomenal piece of film work We're in the future. I look forward to seeing many more movies from Chapa. A story that looks wonderful together with such a mystery and will be an instant classic is a story that was excellent. Seeing a movie with great quality, Chapar really refers to his potential as a serious feasibility and writer, actor, director and filmmaker. Chapa has influenced many of his bloody blood and his amazing acting in blood, and now he has proved to his work those who saw the potential of being critically acclaimed filmmakers with true artistic control. With Kello Vazquez, the lead role between "Milk Vellka" and "Scarface" of Al Pasino, "Lead in Blood Out", this film will do wonders for us here in Australia.
