I have not heard interesting critics in this movie. I believe it was a love story but I was not sure what the plot was about. So, when I finally saw it, I got myself in the middle of the relationship of love between former Kon E Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and Junky Roofo (Sebastian Harro). So, a love story but probably not what I was hoping for. <br /> <br /> This movie has been focused on Izabel because he is struggling to return to society. He does not want to go around and he finds himself or herself somewhere. So, when he was released from prison, he first experienced the first hour of independence, he came across the rupees, which was his old exchange, when he became a junky in the street. Where not to go, and without income or possible potential sources, he decided to join his residence at Roufou: A covered area in a lonely street. <br /> <br /> The story itself is going on. Explains how the relation between Isabelle and Rufoan deepens to the last final turn of the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely, the movie is valuable. Sebastian Haro is superb in the role of her junk Being able to give a person both a innocent and open door and a ruthless street scum. Only the police with whom she depends. I believe in his role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not believe the role of Isabel Ampudia. The film tries to show bitterness inside a few scenes, but she can not believe me. He is expected to be in the same position on behalf of a very sweet and very honest person. <br /> <br /> The film tries to show love to the depressing situation. This is an enjoyable movie. But the feeling that I received at the end of the film is that Isabel, with her way of thinking and acting, has never reached that situation. His role is partly due to the script, partly because of acting is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I especially like the end, and because of that I picked up my rating one or two points. I like her bittersweetness and sometimes show that the truth is, above the spiritual considerations as the survival instinct. <br /> <br /> Overview, an interesting movie, but a total "see something".
