It's a curiosity to make aesthetic / copper film, which seems to be predictable at first, to the last scene. Playwright is a singer who goes to work at the small carnival, where the manager's beating wife is given to him to kill Dewan, then falls for himself. He is alluring, clever and deadly and he keeps popping up like some sort of disappearing and magical techniques. Other promos in the film include her husband's husband / employer (played in the gifted Arman Assent), some nasty Dominican mobsters and most important for the plot, a suitcase full of money. Just like the old "shell game", where you can guess which peak is below, you would guess who got the money and like victims of this kind of game, you would probably be mistaken. Dagma Domenic, as a lovely divan, a talented actor and eye-eyed, is she dancing with a huge snake around her shoulder or doing her credit for all the unfortunate men in her orbit. Normann Reddas was fined as a young girl who was subjected to fatal beauty, was given to kill him. But do not count him, but he has enabled him to be more efficient than anyone else. This oddball film is worth a look.
