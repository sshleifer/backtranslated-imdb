I do not know if I lived in the United States. I have some preview scenes, advertising, I want to know, Sydney Palak directed it, Harrison Ford and Christian Scott Thomas acting. I will see this film as soon as possible to read any bad reviews. Am i disappointed <br /> <br /> I've read many reviews that said how bad this picture was: It's a boring, long-term emotional movie and it's not interesting. Harrison wood, cold. Sublots should be cut. Very serious, especially for Harrison Ford. I'm interested in this, and I'm not liked by Harrison Ford. I like Sidney Palak and Christian Scott Thomas. So on another website on the IMDB website, then in February I was surprised to read the reviews of the Hungarian Movie Magazine, which was what the film was about. Anyway, movies, directors, they did not want any reviews / stars. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is annoying and cold and I do not realize there is no emotion but I am different. I really like Sliding Dors, The Forbidden Women (This is a French movie, I do not know what its title in English, or French). <br /> <br /> I think the random heart is a nice and funny picture. It is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the investigation of Congress and a corrupt police member, the police investigation is not written well, does not work in detail, but adds some of the leading female and male characters. After the death of his wife and after feeling betrayed, Duch angry came to her page. Will be. She would be suspicious and nearly lost her best friend (then the woman also). This picture shows two ways to survive tragedy: Death of our wife / husband and cheating One of them is female: it is tragedy, but life is running. He does not want to mourn forever. What does she want to know - she will never teach her husband's lover's wife-thinking about her. He was forced to behave in this way. The election comes, and there may be some scandal about her husband. She wants that her daughter will not be frustrated with her father. People are a policeman. She was suffering from a liar reality. He wanted to know - that everyone wants to know this situation when his wife started cheating on him. How long did she get lover? She needs help from the woman but she does not want, but the guy suddenly and steady / steadfast. The woman can not stand up for her because she always goes to her life and she can not forget. Their relationship is intense at the beginning, then gradually becomes a kind of silent sympathy that dislikes the external world, tragedy. (I told them that they had made love on the bed) but the police can not withstand the investigation, can not stop, and do not permit women to do it, but she starts "love" and women want to continue their relationship. But it can not do. Women understand it. The end is a little sad, but logical, and nice at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw Peter Quiet again - I like this guy's face - Sidney Palak. I rarely knew Bonnie Hunt but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford did a good job. Her hide was unusual, but at the beginning I finally believed that she was in her music despite her mood. It was a sad fact that he did not get any joke. But Ford got a good sense of ridiculous. A critic (Hungary) noticed: "Ford is a charismatic against his ears and ear drops and we are waiting for his presence and he wants to make us smile and create a dirty notice." But Jones is not laughing at us. "But he smiles at the end and it's soooo good. I agree with the rest. I like him very much in this role - he is a little rough, quiet, but his soul is better at acting smart policeman anywhere. The character of Thomas is a woman who is determined, confident, but she has a cigarette tower locked inside and she keeps away from her emotions. A true woman who becomes reluctant and helps the police, two quiet, reserved-people find each other. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the script is not good, it is full of simple, inactive sentences, but especially from men. Women and movement have some interesting words, this is a good film but not for everyone but not for the general audience. I saw women under the age of 18 45-year-old men in this picture well liked. Later, probably in Sydney polack this film for his age have created maltiplekse not be. However, I have action scenes with energetic plots like those suggestions, the only Ford's action film like this movie miss.
