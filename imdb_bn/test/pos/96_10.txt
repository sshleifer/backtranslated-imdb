Being raised in Canada, I mostly saw this short multiple times on CBC. I have seen it many times, in my life, in many ages and every time the response is the same. It's a delightful bittersweet, beautiful animated film that tugs your heart. I am sure that I have some VHS tape where some are being dug anywhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Someone who I am not seen in this movie lacks the indifferent temperament of the youth and that little bit of captivity. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly the fan of Montreal's house, and I express my special gratitude for it. But ultimately it's the nostalic appearance and feeling of pond hockey and your family's memories tell you that you will be very beneficial to achieve what you want. And oh yes, the animation is very nice;) <br /> <br /> 10 ratings 10
