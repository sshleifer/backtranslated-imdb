Changi has a delightful fresh script, both young men and older actors also played superbly alike. John Dole did an extraordinary job that brought humor to a tragic true story, sometimes the sad story is funny and mad, especially among us who are not familiar with the events of Southeast Asia during WW2. <br /> <br /> The line of parallel story of the Dollex has successfully maintained the gap between the past and the present, which gives viewers insight into the long-term impact of the war, providing the basis for a wonderful story that promotes the titles in prisoners and their families as well. Personal and joint Doyle deserve praise for this effort. We have been delighted by its abundant and speedy humor in the past, as Greg Pichouse's 'Roy and Hg' <br /> <br /> <br /> How to develop with the progress of the story.
