I went back to the movie in the middle of the night and went very close. This was the only reason I did not decide to see it. In the end, I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting story, a good character, a cute script and a brilliant guide to make this beautiful movie sit and watch. This is actually the first movie I heard, but I would be happy to pay for watching it in the movie. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br />
