Close Land The title itself conjures up concealed thoughts. And that's what Amnesty International has in the heart of the film. Government secrets, private secrets, both are an integral part of this story. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, best actors Alan Rikman and Madeleine Stovve both were remarkable in the illustration of government interrogation and respectively the victims. In this unusual standard-length movie, only with two actors, it is immediately clear that both actors were enough and talented to drag viewers into the world's small bubble and stop the door. <br /> <br /> A word with caution ... <br /> <br /> There is no mention that there is a mistress in this movie description that relates to childhood sexual abuse. There is no graphic detail about misuse, but its nature can be difficult to see some viewers - especially the intensity of the whole movie. I am Amnesty's big fan, not international films, but this movie has attracted me because acting was so exceptional, and I can not help make this film one of my personal choices.
