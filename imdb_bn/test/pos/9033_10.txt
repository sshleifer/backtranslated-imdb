I'm not a Faulkner fan (which is considered sacred, especially I grew up in the author's house); However, I think this is an excellent film. The quality of the movie is "piece to pieces". If you do not see it, buy it anyway. It's a good price to stay your permanent collection. TCM has recently played the film as part of the Race-on-film series. I like they play it more often. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are all on screen. I never knew that until I was pictured there, I noticed the identity of the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of the City Hall, I started to suspect. Look closely at the chin wall pennies: You'll see two for Ol Miss!
