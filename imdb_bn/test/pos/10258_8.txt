I first saw this movie in the first life of my life in 1974 or 1975. I was then 4 years old and watched on a drive in the theater. I did not understand that it would be a classic (I went to sleep in the movie twenty minutes). After watching this on television, I knew about 40, 50, and 75 times at almost the same time with my other two favorite movies, Car Wash (my favorite movie) and The Weise, that there was a movie that was my favorite one. Those three movies were the only live action which shows that I can see as a child. <br /> <br /> I do not want to be a blacksmith movie, rather an urban interest movie. Coaches and Prat reminded me of some of my cats, especially the Wild Irish Rose. My mother also told me about a quarter party, that she attended and the events that happened in the film are similar to the nature of the nature in the real life. If you are not one of the more than thirty or two black people in the movie, I suggest you buy the DVD right now. I am glad that I was witness to some of the events of this era.
