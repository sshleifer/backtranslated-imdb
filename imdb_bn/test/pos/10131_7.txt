Could a psychiatric disabled black youth be a catalyst to unite people in the city of South Carolina? The answer seems to be that, despite his illness, James Kennedy went far enough to understand the credibility of the sports scene, than he was given credit. Also, the film tells how many people have problems that can help if they can only be patient, then coach Jones showed the young man because of his own crime in his heart. <br /> <br /> "Radio", directed by Michael Tollin, is a source inspired by the real story film. Still the film is a complete failure because the director managed to get out of his wonderful cast due to the inspired inspiration. <br /> <br /> Coach Jones is helpful for getting the young man, who is called Radio because his passion is for his collection, associated with sports, he has discovered a passion for this endangered person, who has worked hard in his young life. Coming from the poor background, the radio lives with his mother who questions his defense and the purpose of the trainer. The radio is seen as a mascot by schoolchildren, then its sunny nature recognizes him because he is a good person without the evilness of his body. <br /> <br /> Gave a lot of money to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who made a great pair of coaches and radio. Mr. Harris, among the best actors of our time, he is not bothered with anything in his presence. He got the summary of Principal Coach who saw the possibility of amendment to do something disturbing from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. mentions her best figure as a mentally challenged young man. <br /> <br /> Supporting Cast is excellent. Her generation's best actress S. Ifta Markerson did interesting work like Radio's mother. Alfre Woodard, plays high school policy with another good actress style. There are only a few scenes in Debra Wingar's film. <br /> <br /> "Radio", if sensitive, will warm someone's heart because it shows that we see some people that we do not know anything in our society, how fast and how we judge them. Michael Tolin holds many ideas in the right perspective for us.
