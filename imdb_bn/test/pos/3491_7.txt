No real plot, no character development, no scorcese-level direction, but seriously, did you really have any hope of this? The only thing that is this flick is absolutely sunny, almost the same level as Borat. Sure, the end is about to end, but if you do not crack the cameras of Borat, then the boys will be the worst bat boy in the history of the boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is perhaps the greatest Comedian Alive, and here he gets more smile than Jude Law on a nude beach. I dare not let you laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can pull ten-foot pins from your back one and a half hours and enjoy some good times and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story stupid character, watch this stupid movie. You will be glad you Keep it real!
