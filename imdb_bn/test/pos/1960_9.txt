I have seen this movie several times and found it very compelling and sad. The lack of real passion from most characters is very annoying. They seem to be empty, hopeless. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A boy is killed by his boyfriend for any logical reason - apparently he feels like him. Then he is proud of it to his friends and they do not believe that he sees for their body - several times No one reported the murder. There are two firm sources - Keanu Reps and Crispen Glover - Crispan Glover's character is critically annoying. <br /> <br /> Kate's character, Matt, seems to be the only one who has correct and misconceptions. It's Kaneu at her best time - a stupid performance and very credible - anyone who does not remember this person can see this movie. Matt's younger brother is the most annoying character of the movie. Just twelve and his life no sympathy or love factor. It seems very sad to have kids there like this. It really makes you grateful for what you do. 9/10
