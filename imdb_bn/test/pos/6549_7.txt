Last night, Uzumaki watched and recalled the two early Peter Weyer's films of Australia's Last Wave and Picnic A Hanging Rock. They load the film with the atmosphere but the actual horror is minimal. Uzumaki, obviously influenced by these movies to me. This is a few of the most visible scenes that have become more robust, which you made deeper through the film. It has more scenes of cheating horror scenes and even though I do not think that this film actually works reliably for those two films, it is unusual (not necessarily terrible) of the most worried fans time. 7 out of 10 seems to be fair, but I think the year is still with me after watching the last wave, and it makes the picnic frustrating at the end of Hanning Rock. Note all people criticize acting ... pullleasse ... this trend?
