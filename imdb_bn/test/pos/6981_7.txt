Reasonably effective awful / science fiction is fairly good to give a la "alien" its limited ambition. Some excellent special effects and well-paced action sequences are not quite enough to break the patch in rather annoying dialogue. When a spaceship accident occurs on a remote planet, the survivors became aware that a horrific terror in the darkness of the coming planet would wait for them.
