Gilly published an artificial gratitude "Okkadu" in Telugu, a clear version of the original. It provides the same punch and the brightness of its movie with style and style of pan ache. Most of Vikram's uploads with this photo have been received. Even then, it may be the best film winner in terms of what he liked. But the hard-working actor seems to have lost his glory. Both talented new entrepreneurs have been accepted as acceptable by the industry and the public. <br /> <br /> Sleeping script, which is surrounded by the speed at the breaking point, is a horrific young man kabaddi game (a popular game among boys in India). Muthupundi, the opportunity to save the girl from her trouble, and how she juggernaut with the wishes of her friends, and brings her own form into a final order and final form. Movie Fit role as a winner and a 'T' in the essay, a small and credible artwork next to the boy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With limited dialogue, Trisha uses her sometimes uninterrupted expression and subtle weakness to add color to the role. It is a classic case of age cover page for becoming a professional actress. Tissa has become my personal favorite after this movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Raja Raj has the ability to express the perfect counter weight supply for the role of Vijay Raj. A perfect plan for the role of a villain and the almost impossible curiosity of the hero armor in the seemingly chin. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a great movie that is worth a visit. I give it a clear 8 to 8.
