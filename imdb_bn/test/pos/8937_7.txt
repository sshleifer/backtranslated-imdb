2002's "Plots With A View" is a lovely little comedy that the British can do. The humorous film is gentle and gentle both and still very loving and sometimes very slowly-ish. I have seen this film of director Nick Harran so far and at the moment I'm not interested in seeing any other film (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedy), it's a very enjoyable and pretty funny. This film is held in a small town in Wales, where Betty is married to drunken and immoral chief (Robert Pugh) of Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) city. Local mother-tongue Boris (Alfred Molina) has been in love with Bethey since childhood, but has always been ashamed to accept his love for him. Besides the frustration in love, Boris has more problems because Frank Friderbed (Christopher Walken) of strange American brains has begun a funeral emerging business in the same city ... Strange, very British intelligence in the movie Everyone is in a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes rare . Also, gain "Plot with a View" from a wonderful cast. Brenda led Bethleen to prove herself as a "funny woman" of 2000, and she is very funny, and she is very fond of her role. Alfred Molina, who played his shy fans, always delivers a great performance and Robert Pag is perfectly fit in the role of the lazy husband of Betty. Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as the 'secretary' of the husband, I am becoming a big fan of every movie I see. But most of the role was played by the great Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Waken is bright, because he always plays the role of strange mother who runs most of the inconsistent funerals. Overall, "Plot with a View" is a very entertaining little British comedy that I highly recommend!
