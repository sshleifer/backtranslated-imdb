Do not mow a bad I was hoping for another movie based on women's issues, but surprisingly surprisingly, Sfens Sure, the parts of the plot were quite beautiful, but in most cases the movie kept me guessing. The brown bar was attached to the ex-husband, was anyone inside or was he cut? Daniel Magda was excellent. I saw him at the mother's strike and saw him at the Gillet by the Association, both of whom are very credible, especially as he challenges his soil in a challenging manner, which usually prints. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Usually mother (ex-wife) that can relate to both men and women. He was frustrated enough to feel real. <br /> <br /> See it when you miss it. It is appropriate.
