I was in high school class a few years ago when I saw the movie. I thought it was a provocative thought film that lets you see the power behind the cat. I think people who do not like this type of movie do not want to solve things, or who are frustrated when they can not solve the problem. Its a good movie, based on a real story that happened to my home in Toronto, Ontario. So if you want a real record of things that are happening in the alleys, see this movie. And those who only see films to identify the defects and character flaws, in real life, these same things happen. But that's all I want to say that. Holes are good, some are difficult, some are not. But the film wants you more, more curiosity, more explanation, simply, much more. I want to add more, the concepts inside this movie, the underground puzzle world exists, but there is much more to it. To find it, you can not find it. Do not look for it, it will be a way to find out. Leave your mark, and it will get you.
