There are a few cartoon movies where animals or some people are portraying something "not human" and I think this movie is one of them. In addition to several points of plot and character - this movie can mainly be changed to all people instead of animals. Although - no one is good at it - I think cats are delighted by portraying people in this movie! :-) <br /> <br /> <br /> The film also focuses on many adult issues - which are outstanding for Disney films. It refers to how the dog teaches another dog to "tipspissing" people, and it shows a male cats in a wonderful human and adult way by acting a female cat (Abraham Dalesy Giuseppe Casey Thomas) and 'Mally' by mentioning Alcohol *. <<br /> <br /> As a cartoon picture - or just as a movie, I think it's very good - stories and characters are especially good. The film (generally) is set in France and you meet the families of the cats - Mother Dates and her kids, Marie, Plowaus and Barrios. You meet a kind of (rich) elderly woman who is known as Cats, Butler Edgar and an old man (who has clearly lost his marble) George. Such an old woman with George and Edgar discussed her wishes that she got what she wanted after the cats. He incredibly crosses with this - and has an evil plan mind ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy "Aristocats" - a very intelligent film for every age! <br /> <br /> "Basile the Great Mouse Detective" and some may not think that I am at this point.
