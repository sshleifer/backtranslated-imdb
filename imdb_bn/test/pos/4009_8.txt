Most of the criticisms of "show off attacks" are those people who compared "older computer TV programs" to "Screen savers". People are uncomfortable because G4 has decided to cancel "Screen Savers" and based on pop culture "Shows Off Attack." Comparison of two shows compared to orange to apples! <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" is a unique hour long program that covers current generation X / Y culture. It includes segments on movies / televisions, panel discussions, video games, new DVD releases, sexual advise, new gadgets (MP3 player, cell phone, etc.), comic books / graphic novels, magazines and internet pads. <br /> <br /> This is a funny show, obviously you can check out between 20 or 30. I give it a 10 out of 10.
