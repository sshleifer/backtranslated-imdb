All conspiracies are the best and most thrilling of thrillers, (there was such a movie in the 1970s). It's about a nuclear reaction and an accident in attempts to cover it. Jack Lemon is an employee who understands how dangerous the plant is and the Jane Fonda Crusading television reporter who receives the story on the board and both players are the best of them. The events depicted in the film are, of course, not terrible and at least a short distance (what happened here in the real life of three miles on the island), and although it seems to be for some time now, it's just how fragile and dangerous it is In the world we have created for ourselves. Soon look for similar movies about the effect of global warming (and not junk like "Tomorrow").
