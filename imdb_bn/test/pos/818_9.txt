This movie contains mostly 70 pieces of exploitation film, except that it was directly directed to the video market at the end of the 80's. <br /> <br /> There is a young couple in your love, but their crack dealing or gang violence is involved all over the world. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend eventually becomes weak to all the criminals, who are all in this movie except the police. Firstly he gets hooked on the crack by a dealer and then he becomes the Brown's property because he owes the meaning of drug minister Jim Brown. Then he basically slaughtered a military style crack house which was named for the film. <br /> <br /> Although there is not enough reason to see this movie, you are playing an exceptionally conservative school guide consultant, but he is really a major crack dealer. In a lazy but sunny scene, she claims sexual gratification from the heroine because she has no meaning for any fix. In a previous scene it was established that he was his mentor. That scene and another where Jim Brown forced him to take a scalding hot shower because he stinks is violent. Lead actress Cheryl This film was really good. Tarantino, bring him back. <br /> <br /> It does not surprise me that anyone else in Tarantino's main fan in the review. It is simply the comedy, action, sex, proper mix of romance and the central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's big counter is worth mentioning the same breath like the Wings Hower in the Vice-Squad like the other 80 B Villeren. Sometimes I think this kind of performance can be accepted where I think a B movie will be Oscar. Already going to learn the modern direct DVD movie makers learn how to use this same tongue tongue cheeks to use humor.
