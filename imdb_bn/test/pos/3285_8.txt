This was a nice good episode. Although there's a lot going on for "clutter traps" or "cartoon wars" The character of Al Gore and the mischief-hell "super-serial" was quite interesting. But, the scene that I enjoyed this episode was that I was sure that everyone would agree that one of the best Cartman / Kyle moments of all time. When Curtman Kyle's prejudice says that he will steal his gold (which is of course fake), and he comes in inches of his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up, and they have crazy conversations where Cartman tries to fix everything perfectly fine. Cartman was endlessly funny, though crapping out treasure.
