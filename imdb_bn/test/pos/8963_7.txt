Repeat: Based on the true story of American American congressman Charlie Wilson, who (according to this film) was instrumental in US war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br />: Funny movies are not so funny things, especially they were real. But concentrating on the film, Hanks has played a very good actress like a congratulatory congressman to become the champion of secret wars in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the whole movie Philippe Simmer Hoffman is especially a ridiculous voice. It is so appropriate to add to the joke. But, what the story says, and perhaps the last, really serious. <br /> <br /> A story about what happened to some questions about what happened. So if you want the movie to work as a comedy and if you want it to be more serious. Something for everyone? 7/10
