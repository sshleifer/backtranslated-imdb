I did not hear this, until the documentary, the architect, Louis Kahn. Nearly two hours of documentary that goes faster, his son, Nathaniel, searches for his father's life at the Pennsylvania Philadelphia University in West Philadelphia, from Kan Estonia, where he studied and taught. He traveled to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolla in California and New York City to discover his father's creative talent. Personally, Louis Kan was with his wife, Esther and three families, who refused to deny him a divorce and his daughter Su Anne. Nathaniel includes his family members. Another half-sister of Luis Alexander Teunz is also an associate of his father Anne Ten. Louis' emotions were his art.
