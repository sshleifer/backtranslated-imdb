What do you say "curiosity kills cat"? Well, I've heard a lot about this movie, from any magazine, it has named the worst films of all time, in my 1001 movies you can see before you die, my sister who watched it in the movie festival and I Love the 70's in VH1 I used to watch this movie since it was considered as the best film of all time, and well, after watching this movie last night I was told that it really has been live up to its title. My God, this movie was so weird! I thought I saw several sick movies and TV shows which I saw, some things that I guess would always be frustrating. <br /> <br /> Well, Babes Johnson, Ur Divine, deadly person has been named alive and a jealous couple named Marble are competing for this title. They want to take out Divine and abduct women, rape them, and their children are sold to lesbian couples, living in the name of living couple. But it seems like the Divine and his family ... I do not know, sex with chicken, butt lip adjustment, dog alloy, their skirts, pic stuff, and it gets only grosser and grosser <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pink Flimens played horribly, awesomely made, and well, just plain terrible. I'm going to give these 10 ratings because you can actually rate this movie? I always rate, so I just figure what the hack is? Throughout this film, you have to give John Waters some credits, which hacks 35 years later to think about this movie? Cast and crew acting in this movie, you are simply nasty! <br /> <br /> 10/10
