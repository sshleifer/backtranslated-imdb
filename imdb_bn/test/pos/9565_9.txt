I saw this movie with an open mind, I did not know what to expect. I was surprised by the surprise that this movie was written, directed and played in such a way that its every minute a fun watch People do not seem to be acting, they are actually genuine people who train dogs and lead the lives illustrated in this film. There are some wonderful moments where you laugh or chocolate, some jokes can be dry but are presented in a very spectacular fashion. Highly recommended!
