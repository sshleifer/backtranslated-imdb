Cactus Floor is based on a playful 1940s comedy film based on a Neil Simone, a relationship with a young free-spirited woman (Goldie Haun) related to a dentist (Walter Matthew), fully aware that her dedicated nurses / assistant (Ingrid Bergman) She is in love with him. Muthu can play such a role in his sleep and he is a doctor who is dating a woman. Julian Winston is not as frustrated, but she is actually no proof of love for others. Golden Haunon won an Oscar for his excellent performance as Tony Simmons, the elderly flower child who gradually realizes that he is trapped in a love of death and is not as gentle as the surface. But the actual amusement for me in this movie was the legendary Ingrid Bergman's Stefani Dickinson, Winston's fully dedicated assistant, who is willing to kill and sacrifice his own happiness until he is happy with Dr. Winston Tony. Bergman is brilliant in this picture, absolutely beautiful (though the camera always loves him) and an unexpected knee for light comedy. Yes, conversations and settings are slightly dated, but the story is timeless and they perform by it make it endless watchable.
