Beautiful movies At the beginning, I thought it was a Medique spy-based hi-fi film, but the last one surprised me. I guess, the whole movie covers a lot of things, each of them can be the main thing, for example. Revenge, friendship, and dreams. But it mixes them all without focus. I think it will be a great movie if it ends from the very beginning. <br /> <br />
