Finally I found my DVD, saw it and I'm glad to announce the real drama version of this photo. You've read reviews of "Rich and Pramus" which have been edited for the TV version of the movie which was launched at VHS sometime at the end of 90 minutes, but now WB has corrected the error and released it entirely in DVD. Battery Storm Scenes, Matt Lantzie's Bearer, and Hotel Room View, where Lease (Jacqueline Bisset) Marie (Candice Bergen) is a C **! It has all and looks better than ever! Christ is a clear digital transfer, widescreen and special theater trailer, and especially the special features of the 1981 featurette, which is known as "Rich and Famous On Location" with Cast and Director interviews. If you love this movie then you will not be frustrated with buying this DVD. Finally does the DVD have this? Waiting for good wait! Thank you Warner Bros!
