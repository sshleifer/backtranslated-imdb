It is probably a year of seeing Ujak, but it remembers the memories of the two main characters, the powerful photographer Mahmut and his silent cousin, Yusuf. <br /> <br /> It is a very small dialogue with long films and a very limited plot. This has definitely disturbed a fair few visitors. But the film has created a painstaking portrait of Mahmood and Yusuf that there is a lot of emotional tension like the pasist thriller. <br /> <br /> Just be clear, there is no padding in this picture - the emotion of those characters that you can bear for a long time (and seeing them among you) gives a break that does not speak. Go to see it awake and alert, and you will be gripped than anesthetized. <br /> <br /> Uzak is the true ring in many ways, and sincerity is probably his greatest achievement. People do not combine with facts and problems, so with each other. In fact, there is probably no point in the whole film where the main characters (Mahmud, Yusuf and Mahmud's former wife Najn) are not opposed. <br /> <br /> Most of it is true around the world: Desperate cousin Yusuf deliberately hopes that a ship's job will enter inside him; Mahmud's urban discipline and his reluctance to express sympathy for Yusuf. <br /> <br /> Other truths are more specific for Turkey: Yusuf's ignorance that Mahmut can tolerate his teeth with a tooth; When Yusuf asked to know a woman, he was surrounded by the ambitions of the stage and curiosity in wide eyes. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, Uzzak is undoubtedly an amazing movie, and the power of a silen is not to hit us head. Theme he searched for At least for me, I fully believe the behavior of his characters. All the little failed attempts and tiny cruelties so ring true. And yet I'm not going to give a message that "the world is like that", but instead I found "That's how we deal with each other."
