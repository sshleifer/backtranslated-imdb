Bill, Jeremy Thebold, an inspirational writer who has not yet achieved anything published. Bill also has an odd and peculiar habit, he likes to follow people. <br /> <br /> Bill follows them as street dinners or metro, metro, and their shadows. Maybe Bill will help inspire him to write such a novel that he dreams or gets an article printed in a major magazine? Perhaps it makes a luxurious life luxurious and even focuses on the interest of her curiosity and faces the crowd by the crowd? Or maybe it may be responsible for someone to care for themselves and care for them? There is a general rule in Bill that he follows religiously when he follows someone: If you follow him or follow his home or work place, then you stop. <br /> <br /> One day Bill Sibb took Alex Hawke to the house and instead of following his rules, he still follows Cobb. Bill will soon understand how accurate he was with the rule he gave, and how wrong he was to break it. <br /> <br /> Curiously low budget film made by Christopher Noland broke his role in 1998, and it grew two years later with the original motion picture classic "Momento". Culture movie <br /> <br /> "Follow" is actually a very good movie "Momento" because it's a conventional and follow-up story. The first was confusing than "Momento" and then when you understand what the movie said in your background, it is very complicated. Whats "follow" makes it easier to make it easier, but it also affects those who see it at the same time. The film is a lot more direct and devastating, and it does not have to be over-over to try to tell you something like "Momento". "Follow" is a story of a story in a story, with one of the most surprising and simply final finishes in a story, if you see the movie again and see the initiated notices that you can see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Along with Hollywood, the motion picture industry outside Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Nolland, in which there is nothing more, what talent and imagination can achieve, can not achieve millions of dollars in most cases; An intelligent and at the same time the money does not grow sharp as well as sharp film and big names.
