Man, I do not laugh so much this year, and it's hard to smile. Although I expect some hostel-style movies, the smile came from my mouth at the beginning. This film-in-film finally dries up the whole set till "to die" and "victim" beats it. The director and his funny feedback tells our visitors that mute witness is not usually a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The original character played silent American make-up artist Billy Hughes. Beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Juddina. Its performance is the top notch; His character can not speak, so the language of the body and the emotion in his face will be compensated. And, boy, he did a great job. His sister (Faye Ripley) is the wife of the lover or drunk or "In-film Director" (Ivan Richards). They were quite funny both times. I will not loot more, but in the bathtub after a moment the scenes, with them two, fake police members and then angry neighbors yellow bright black comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Confusing at one particular moment. But do not worry. Such a delicious movie can be seen with family or your boy / girl / friend.
