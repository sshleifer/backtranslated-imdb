Moment of moments when you do not want that deep play series. It must be shown when you do not want a series with heavy stories or you can handle each single episode. There are moments when you just want to see a simple series, with lots of actions and cool letters. For that moment you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who actually enjoyed Charlie's Angels. Critics were superficial and stupid. But the matter is, this is the point! Those who are cool and hopeful of a serious movie can not hate it. It's exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It is superficial It has silly and irrational characters. And that's why I like it. This is not like any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. The character was very annoying and very little. The story was a little hair, and you did not know too much of the characters. But hey, they had only 20 minutes of each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the 40-minute series. And here I started to love it. The series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series. Too bad they had to cancel the series. The last episode of Cleopatra 2525 was actually very good. I will never forget Hell, Saraj and Cleo. Unique characters could only create genre creators!
