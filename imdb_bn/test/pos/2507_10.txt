I'm a big scarred heterosexual male pre-bouncer, ex-rugby player, and pre-boxer, and I love this movie. <br /> <br /> This is no "mysterious river." It's a piece of fluff. But there is a living room for Fluffs, and when that fluff is shot fancy, interesting, interesting people play well, plush plots and fill up good conversations, there are more places for it. <br /> <br /> I I'm not the biggest Tom Selleck fan. But he is good at this. So Julian Nicholson (love her nasty head and frames), Allen DeGeneres, Kate Capps and even Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You!). <br /> <br /> The view is beautiful, the mood is encouraged, there are <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will continue to catch bits and pieces without apologies when I appear on the cable.
