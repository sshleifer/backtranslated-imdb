Kevin Tennie's "Night of the Demons" is an enjoyable horror movie that reminds me of "The Evil Dead" a little bit. On Halloween night, a group of teenagers threw a group out of the city's abandoned funeral home hall house. They performed a civil ceremony under the leadership of Angela and instantly awakened the evil spirits living in the scene. Afterwards, the immune system forces the thirteenth child and makes them among the bloody wicked people. "Giants Night" is a terrific horror film, very scary, beautiful and beautiful atmospheric. This character is better developed and Steve Johnson's hole is pretty good. A shocking impressive, a tongue is being closed, fingers are moved to the eye socket etc. The scene, where Susan (Linja Quigley) cools the lipstick tube through her breast. See it one. Follow two signals.
