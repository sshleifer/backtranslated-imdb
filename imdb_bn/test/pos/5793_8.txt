I was very curious about the Little Vera. I've enjoyed all this movie, but the character behavior is not what many ways I was used to. For example, the environment in which the family of sheep was living was very intense. Family together they often get together, drink or yelling and often it was three adjustments. After seeing the film I felt very intense as it was the cause of all the clashes that took place. This middle-class Russian family was very interested in seeing the story. Over the whole film, reminders of repeated reminders of our memorable screen of Russia's art are reminded. This gives the viewer a sense of mechanical living life. The letters seem to be focused on living their life through work and drinking after work. There was no feeling of happiness throughout the film. One character did not shout when Bharu fell in love with her drunken Sergei for the first time. It was very rare because the viewer was discovered later (Sergei locked the father of the groom in the bathroom and filled him with a scuffle after hurling him off) that he was abusive. Another sheep is said to be the only reason that the family could get bigger apartments. It is very interesting that both the veera and the family were able to deal with each other's behavior. The film was certainly valuable because of its screenplay of what life could look like in Russian territory.
