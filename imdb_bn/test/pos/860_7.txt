I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and today, this year, it is one of my favorites. The story was nice though the turn towards the end was very high and I knew what would happen very soon. Generally, when it happens, the movie is damaged for me (like "others"), but after knowing the result, I finally enjoyed it. Many people comment on acting from Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm not afraid that I was not. Unlike James Haven (Don Weke) 's outstanding performance (or characterization), his performance seems to be a weak part of the film for me ... I hope we will see more of it. What a great little film, highly recommend all!
