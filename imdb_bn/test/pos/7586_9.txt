I have seen the 2000 studio-sound films - along with its own Universal features - Judy Garland, Lane Horn, Sheryl Jones, and Dana Durbin - as well as live and studio recorded music comedy and operas. And I assure you that no one can sing in front of the camera and microphone, or sometimes somewhere rarely touch the durubin ... Mono Soundtrack and the 1930s microphones and all get drunk. From Canada, the child sings this bit from "Il Bacio" and she wrote herself and then her career was delayed to show for a preview in Italy, not like a child she learned from her music teacher. <Br /> <br /> If you skip this extra DVD - or go to Garland alone - you are just depriving yourself, since this cheaper MGM teaser has combined the best performance of 20c.
