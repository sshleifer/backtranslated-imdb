I found this flick is enjoyable and involved in watch, and I bash it so it bent. Actually I can see why; I imagine it's the fans of Eric Roberts and Alice Milano, who gave most of 1 and 2, because if you keep the tape on the machine then these two or both actors are hoping to enjoy something but you can rather be frustrated. Near the end of Eric's movie, nearly half an hour, and Alice's second half is displayed for 5 scenes, and in them they are short and wear less (though you do not want to be nude if you are looking for them.) Although they are always happy, it is tragic, or Eric, does not get much screen time, but I still give it 8. <br /> <br />
