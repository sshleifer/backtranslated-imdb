It is a rare and delicate sight, metaphorical transformation and transformation of death which is not publicity and counterfeit. Mature and brave insight avoid a difference in the arthouse work, refusing to belong to a kind of Northfork. Contrary to the most memorable and accomplished movie for a clear comparison, Wim Wenders 1987's Wings of Desire (Dar Heimel Uber Berlin), it maintains a conflict in a spectrum narrating from the supernatural to Moody. This story of American West's worldly and spiritual-dominated domains literally sticks their birds literally to the literal form that identifies the German predecessors in the strange form of the angels. His spiritual primacy, inspired by cruel beliefs or inspired by dreams of fever, is not the way to part with crew and friction. This firm grounding for writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish redounds great credit.
