About the movies really loved There were some alternatives for Radha and Sita, where in the oppressed circumstances of the fire, where good women were to be forced and that which was right in the eyes of heritage. However, that it was not their only option. Asked what life is like without life, Radha asked Ashok Yes, it is true that life provides many options, but how much we can take depends on external factors. When your world is confined to a small Indian family, a 13-year-old woman who is a silent but cautious mother tongue is a child who has taken an oath of heaven because she is not able to, a man who will only eliminate her wishes To prove his power lies beside you. I think women had the choice but to find comfort in each other's company. I think many women praised Mehta's work, because it gave them the option to think for themselves. Perhaps what was unacceptable was an alternative. The same lesbian scenes I had felt were kept in that point only. At the end of the mosque, from the Taj Mahal to the beginning of the film, every scene of the movie is covered in my mind. How frustrating your feelings and wishes are to be a prisoner. It seems that you should touch from people because it is expected from you. You have to curb any desires and people will wish for touch. Then what is the meaning of our existence is a wonder The scene where Sita is crying alone in the room and Radha comes to comfort her, their lips suddenly hit each other and it sparks their feelings. Some have been denied both of them <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I especially like flashbacks trying to 'watch' for the young Radha sea. It's a metaphor for freedom. The freedom to choose freedom, the freedom to move ourselves, we are usually unable to reach. In those scenes, it has been told to us that the responsibility has been entrusted to his mother, which means that I live in the rich Indian heritage of marriage. The movie is well-crafted and musical score by AR. Stainless Steel. From the film, I became the two main actresses and director's enthusiastic fans. I am looking forward to the future of MP Deepa's production.
