It is now clear that the true golden age of American movies was before the release of Star Wars in the mid-60's. After that, the hey code-integrated pap was too much. With the help of Star Wars, most of the films are being lit in green light and directed towards children and dying, which continues to this day. Seven-UPS, the truth is said, there are some hackneyed lines in the dialogue - "We can do it in a simple way, or we can do it in a difficult way" - but if I find anything I'm frustrated. Otherwise it's wrong. (In fact, this line was not old when making this film.) Seven-UPS is well-presented to the best of the golden era: spell dialogue, realistic acting, real position (a dirty winter New York never seen good / bad), romantic stories, and , Yes, the best car charging ever illustrated. Bill Hickman driver is following the skidder (you can recognize him from the bullet), and the back structure is almost identical to McQueen, but the sharpness of the faces of the skydays here, the pacing, the children's hugely tied bonds, and the shattering conclusions. (The Voodbog bug is about 2 mph always annoying me in the Bullet Chase.) A string of Don Alice, the scorer score sets the perfect mood. Seven UPS: Raised, Deadly, Action-Based, Raised This is a movie that can not be made today; There is no "hostage" for the Kiddies or the preposterous end. Thanks, Phillip d'Aut√≥nie, Ray Square and Tony Lo Bianko: As long as cop films are seen, Seven-UPS and its 1970 brothers (e.g., Friend connections) will set standards.
