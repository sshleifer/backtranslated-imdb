I was lucky enough to see "The Kite Runner" recently in a lucky little theater, how to enjoy the best composition of such sophistication is surrounded by favorite movie-gays. I am hoping for a piece of crew and violence with all the controversies surrounding the central scene of today's film. But Mr. Forster managed this subtle thing, touching and really running. Although the film's credentials have been identified as China's main position to shoot, I could swear I saw Kabul in the events held in Afghanistan. Non-professional, as well as acting professional actors, excellent and excellent casting. So, this is a movie which I see over and over again, because it is undoubtedly tragic, but it gives a whole new hope in modern cinema.
