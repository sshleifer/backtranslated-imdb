Challenge Cats does a wonderful job by portraying a malicious bride, her professional challenges that she waits for, she feels that she does not really love the freedom of memory she is in college (inspired by a famous writer) and the safety of her marriage to a man. This movie is clearly seen - as much as it can be predictable, acting is inspirational and real chemistry between Challenges and Malcolm Jamal Warner.
