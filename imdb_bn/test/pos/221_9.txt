Police Squad! (1982) was a very interesting show. But I think this was done before it became repetitive and weird like American television shows. Zucker, Abraham and Zucker's team win behind this funny exhibition. Airplane hit by his direct acting on copyright !, Leslie Nilssen has got a new career as Comedian. This short living T.V. Continually he had the opportunity to play straight man straight once a painful comedy. Each episode has ended the odd title. But le. Dreybrin (Leslie Nielsen) has found so strange things that they should believe. <br /> <br /> They did not release it from DVD to get bad. If a show needs to be re-released it will be one. A new generation is waiting to see this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend!
