Last time I checked here, there seems to be more than one comment. I am very glad that now more people have caught this blaze, and even you digging all about it I was caught on Christmas Eve of 2002 and I have been unable to change the channel on my TV, though it was an Asian flick - and I'm sorry but really - any off-of-the-art products. I am that night, though, and I deeply thank God for it. I could not shake that cinema from my system- because I tried or tried- and it still surprised me - very grateful - such a great, beautiful way of experiencing the way, completely unexpected, like a Christmas Miracle. Please, if you go to the opportunity to see this movie, buy it or rent it or whatever it is, but watch it. I guarantee it will affect you. I ended the time, but I ended up here with my appraissal so far, so sick back as soon as possible.
