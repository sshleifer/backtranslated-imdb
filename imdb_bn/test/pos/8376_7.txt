Previous commentators performed the film and third-third director, Carroll Reid's classic film Nir and Osn Wells and Joseph Couton. This harmony almost immediately strikes the audience. Robert Crusher Academy Award - Third Third Winner is compared to cinematography. <br /> <br /> The plot of theft identification is very well represented, but in general terms. I found it extremely creative and entertaining. "Mistakeen - or theft - Identity" device is common in both the theater and movie, it is not just an instrument and a plot for the plot. As a result, the viewer has seen this device "thousand times", but the plot of the stolen identity is based on this device and the twists are full. It is an unexpected turn that makes this movie more fresh, more original and furious than plot discipline. The stolen identity does not depend on the mystery of most movies that identify silence, because there is no real mystery. Instead, it depends on the constant, small surprise. In short, the wrong identification device is rather common; But this is not the plot. Finally, although I was not familiar with Cast, the acting seemed to be quite good, sometimes outstanding. I could easily imagine the other actors turning this movie into a melodrama, with bomb blasts, excessive sunshine and clear facial expression. The acting is always more restrained and delicate. Donald Buca is particularly restrained and credible, as we face "face cover" with no face, we often see in movies that depend on the maintenance of small surface to maintain dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only frustration of sub-plot was the poor development otherwise the story of subtle film love. It stands, it looks like a later thought - a light wonder, actually - tacked in the end. Or perhaps during their fate, the actors could not easily publish a chemic substance that I could understand. This sub-plot should be more visible because the story was exposed. After all, I thought the film was a fine little gem and I was surprised that I did not see it before. Try it, you'll love it.
