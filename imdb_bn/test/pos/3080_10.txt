I was amazed by this picture and I laughed so much that I had to see him twice to catch the bits I missed while keeping my stomach! Critics reviewing this movie for this movie have found this pair challenging with IQ in their shoes form, my IQ is about 135 ... I challenge this person to question me and eat his own words! This image is brilliant and the critics above were not so annoying, he can smile once in his life and take things as light as possible !!! <br /> <br /> The number of songs was so fantastic! During the period of the movie, everyone will see a tight dress and understand how different today's clothes are and how fun it will be today's male population if they used to draw on day-to-day! The idea of ​​dedicating a song to a dancer in a tight dress was so fresh that no one can smile !!! (Plus also, hip-hop rappers doing ballet are always violent-as a dancer, I have worked ballet and hip hop and both have been danced with men who have done it .... it still cracks me every time. !!!) < br /> <br /> I love this picture, if someone does not see it yet, do not listen to the critics above ... see it and then decide for yourself !!!
