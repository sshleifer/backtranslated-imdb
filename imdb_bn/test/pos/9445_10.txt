I like this movie so much I am a big fan of Amanda Biao recently. I for her acting ability her (without her body) She is a good actress. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. The girl named Viola wants to play football, but when her school girls cut the football team, she was upset. His brother set to go to a prestigious school and he decided to leave England. So Viala wants to get away from playing the football team in the boarding school. He goes to school and tries for the football team. He gets inside Meanwhile he is the football team player who is a sensitive person who meets Duque. He really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Sebastian - who really violates it. Sebastian is dating Monik and suspects that Sebastian himself is not himself. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not a sparkle of chicken and I enjoyed it. It's so funny and lovable I do not think Amanda did a good job.
