I have been trying to track the Kingdom of the Kingdom for many years. My theater life was played in this theater. At that time, in 1960 I could not follow it myself, because I used to work myself in the theater, used to work for many nights. Now in retirement I have this and keep it myself long. Please, it can not be issued in DVD, I will not remember how much it costs. I have seen that there are others who feel similar. What can we do to do this? This should not be sent in some slight disrespect as great. I have to write two more lines. All right, I can say that I want this series more than anything in the world. Just be able to see the best actors of our age playing our excellent Shakespeare's best words. That's not enough! Ujen
