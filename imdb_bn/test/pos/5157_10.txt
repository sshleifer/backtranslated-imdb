Small spolars will follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is even weird and incomplete than "song from second floor" There are no major characters we follow around. There is no "plot" in common. There is no emphasis on a happy end. There is no crowdpleasing. In other words Roy Anderson returned with a revenge. Instead of taking back conventions and fixed formula, Roy Anderson has an idea around his notion. I'm not going to get that idea, but if you do not get it, I promise you that you'll always see the best visible depth in the film. The "songs" from pale to royal scene <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Seeing the final scene of the movie, I thought, at least, the Amman Bomber aircraft entered the city to take our lives away. <br /> <br /> And of course, do not forget to watch this movie during your limited release. As a "bicycle thief" of these sequences, you have a movie that is actually capable of building you as a better person. A very warm and humane film.
