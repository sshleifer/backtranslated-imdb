When I decided to visit this documentary I did not know what to expect. I knew that the former Laos veteran has fled, but I did not know anything else. Actually, I did not have too much expectations. What a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting, but how Ditta himself tells most of the story by separating it from other biographical documents. The data camera is very comfortable in front of. Her personality really shines He told WWII and his story about the growing life of his life in Germany during the hardships. We are with her in the same small town as her family, inspiration, and struggle description. We followed him in America and his way to fulfill his dream of being a pilot. After that, Dieter describes the story of capturing, shading, and survival of his Laotian jungle. We are in the jungle with him again, as he has described and described his prison and independence path in detail. We saw the same primitive hats, villagers, and preventive methods which have not been changed for 30 years. We see the thick jungle, mountainous terrain and river ditherea facing during his escape. It helps us to understand emotions, pain, and distress. I enjoyed people, stories, and styles. Work well!
