Rupa (Kamalini Mukherjee) lost her parents and other family members in a fatal car accident. She started her own life as an independent woman without any help from relatives. Her son, Rahul (Anuj), has a son friend and is going to marry her, but because of her future mother-in-law's behavior and her boyfriend's return she is back. Ananda (Raja) joined his surroundings. And he started to feel comfortable and safe in Roopa. The story of Ape's richest corporate house MD Anand - Roper as a neighbor and later who has followed, is the story left? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even if the story goes slowly, you get a sense of familiarity with it. Shekhar kammula director for such a horrible! Bright music and background score protected by KMM Radhakrishnan adds value. Kamalini Mukherjee, as a silver, gave a remarkable performance. I think he is the best choice for this role due to this miracle and amazing history. Joy also made the King very good. I have seen this movie three times now and have absolutely enjoyed it. Here is a class except the daily dose of an action film. Highly recommended !!
