I am deeply grateful to see this movie. Wonderful acting, the movie itself is strong and clear, and the issues involved are managed with subtlety and depth. <br /> <br /> This is an important movie. It can be converted deeply. <br /> <br /> I can never pay good money, sometimes it can see. It is * so * so good and complicated, it is extremely difficult to see. I admit that my taste in movies is firm in light; Visual Media can be so strong that I tend to avoid it really important. You can be more comfortable with me than those who are easy to manage. <br /> <br /> But I strongly encourage to see it at least once. Preferably with others, so you can talk to each other and keep in mind that there is more to the world than the movie.
