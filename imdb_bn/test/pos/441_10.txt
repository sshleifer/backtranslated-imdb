"French Can Can" is one of my favorite movies all the time. This is a wonderful film. There are colors, there are humor, there are music. It is a very good portrait of the so-called Bell Effect, though Gene Rannoy's priorities were always a creation, a fantastic exhibition. So the picture is not a historical movie. Girls are the final order which cancan girls immensely images. This is a movie which you will not miss.
