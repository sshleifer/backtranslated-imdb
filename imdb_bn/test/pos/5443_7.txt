This movie was notified as a comedy but it was even more serious than trailers. Do not make me wrong, I've enjoyed the movie, but there was more hope of laughing. Robin Williams and Laura Lynn have great performances. Price of viewing, but do not expect rolling over the floor. This movie made me wonder that the character of Robin Williams was an actual person who was running for the President. Should we choose a comedian? I unfortunately, doubt it Such harsh honesty today is very lacking today. This is a movie that I'm joining in my DVD library as soon as I'm out on DVD. The movie has heart.
