I grew up in Winnipeg and saw residents treated almost every day. Every nation has good and bad, why all of them out to be bad? That goes for all the race today. John Harper was a educated person, he graduated from high school, even before returning to the reserve, there was a university under his belt for a year. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for 3 years of high school and he contacted us year after graduation. He was a kind and gentle spirit, he could be fun loving and time was right when he could be serious. I was not very old when leaving my house, but I can still remember when helping me during my homework while disturbed by my own brother. He even taught Wondepieg 3 grades before the year came. There is no mention of this in the film, and constable cross suicide as far as I am concerned, so much more confession. What happened to John is not only among non-resident communities but also in white communities. Everyone in Winnipeg does not think like a policeman, I knew the person inside, and what he was like a person, not Indian!
