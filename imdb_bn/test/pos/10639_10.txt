Some users are confused about the identity of armed men to move the steps according to the "Odesa Stairs" order. These men are not cosacks but regular army forces. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I'm wrong, please correct me about this. <br /> <br /> But there are some lines of film that apparently did not comment. After Potemkin takeover, someone in the crowded on the coast says, "Kill the Jews!" It's only on screen for a few seconds but it's there. <br /> <br /> Domestic problem is not only in Russia, but in other countries, cruel ideals of history, immediate turmoil and naturally to blame the Jews! Perhaps other parts of the film are not historically practical but the protests against the Jews are very real. Comment, anyone? <br /> <br /> Why can not the English speakers pronounce the word "ptoidomyen" instead of "ptoiminone"? There is a need to differentiate between two potential numbers in Russian "E": such as "you" or "yes" Sometimes two points are used to differentiate between these two numbers, but generally the difference should be remembered only.
