I was perfect for small girls in this movie. It was about a magical place that Jadevov and all his sisters could do at any time what they wanted to do. Most of the younger girls will love this story despite having a thought of death. Although no one dies, the king often does, but little girls can not understand it, so it adds to create a perfect story. Add all events, create a great plot that can make money meaningful enough money. This story is perfect for little girls, and because of a Barbie movie, kids can have fun with it, especially if they have their own barrels. Although anyone can have fun with it, it is so clever and understandable. Overall, I think this movie is a good film for everyone, especially young girls, and it can laugh out at least once.
