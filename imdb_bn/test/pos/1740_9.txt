First off, I've been there until recently. In fact, I did not have an opportunity to see the previous incarnation (because of sleep) because it was not "big" all over the United States because it is like elsewhere. <br /> <br /> He said, obviously) after finishing the second season, it was one of the best science-pay shots I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now, I look at many scientific shows and it shows the show. <br /> <br /> was the foremost in the beginning of the first episode, Christopher Eicleston, and I thought he was superb. Of course, such a beautiful delivery piper who added humanity and warmth to the character of the rosy, nobody could do it well. Let's see Jamie and Noyle Clarke as Mikey / Ricky, who only see an explosion. Then there's David Tenannt. At first, I thought it was very hateful to play the character (his ear !!), but after seeing the second season, he's just looking right. Her sharp acting and physical comedy are almost flawless. He can be great with clear dialogue and become serious without bat batting. <br /> <br /> Most actors played the actor that played. Many of them are intellectual actors, but something new to me and a great fine. <br /> <br /> Top notch production and direction of this ceremony. Occasionally, there will be some delicious effects here and there, but it was a reason for the original series and like those episodes, the negligible. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about this series is: The Story. Writing people, always the great entertainment key. Russell T. Davis wrote episodes along with some other authors and they did a great job. They have managed to bring tension, skill, intelligence and fun with clever ideas and great dialogue. I can break the lines of old stories and old enemies of old doctors (my friend explains a lot to me if I see this event) and can respect it. <br /> <br /> I will not mention that in the second season and how it ends, the Siam-Channel Channel starts broadcasting in the second season. <br /> <br /> I do not want to hide it. It's so fun and excitement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ** Destruction! **
