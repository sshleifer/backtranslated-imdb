"Closet Land" was sponsored by Amnesty International and has many political entities, but there is more to the story more slowly ... <br /> <br /> This is not just about political pressure at the end of the 80's It is a personal torture that a woman keeps herself like a child who is being persecuted by a family friend. We saw a parallel view of the unnecessary government / society structure and parallel culture of sexual orientation, where four children were rebelled and three were raped in one another. <br /> <br /> I bring it a cool chicken-egg egg: Does the attitude of prejudice of our sexual abuse create a political environment of fear and sensing, or the culture of sexual-political inconvenience burns culture? Even the psychological disorders of asking this question compel us to a place where our own answers are brought for development. Finally, our young lady writer (Stoow) at the same time finishes the "laboratory" of Hensen - she realized at a brilliant, momentous moment that secret police (Rickman) was able to steal her power from him. The idea is an illusion. No one can steal your power - they can just cheat you for giving it, and then you have the right to return it at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not a lightly inserted film, and you certainly do not write it. Incoming aspects combined with the animations of the child narrow down the deepest parts of the mindset and keep the viewers unchanged.
