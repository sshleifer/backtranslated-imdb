.... Could it be that ITV does not want to publish this absolute classic because it will show its current series to Mike Beet? While discussing Mike Basket with some work colleagues, I mentioned BOSTC's Cup as a much more dedicated offer and I was surprised to see that I actually saw it in my entire office. It's not right for a movie that I've ever seen to be the most fun thing. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, there is not always the greatest record for the creation of ITV comedy, so you think they will be at least fun to jump at some repetition opportunity. Perhaps it can be combined with a profitable telephone competition where we think the coach driver might want to go later but they might be interested. <br /> <br /> Come on ITV, there are still some of us who like to be loved, see quality comedy / drama. The thing is not the thing. Then repeat it to find the DVD.
