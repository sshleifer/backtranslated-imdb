This is a stunning movie. Moving raw and fertile It is felt like a very intriguing, intelligent level game (but at one point people can actually watch a man on a stage without the dramatic feel), which can look at the consequences of terror against each white terror. All major players are mesmerizing. Tom Wilkinson has finally broken my heart ... and everyone judges the same level of violence and tool scandal to face similar men and women. Julian Fellow has won again. She is a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now this. Can he make any mistake?! Go and see! This is a movie for real raised ups.
