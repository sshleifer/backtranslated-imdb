"Rio in Rio", no doubt, one of the most exciting DVDs I bought. Although I have been favored fan for almost 20 years, I found this performance to be faulty. The music is heavy and sharp (which seems cool to the surrounding sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd gets a constant smile ... It looks like they were able to keep the concert they were going through. For any Rush fan, this DVD must be required; If anything, just to see the "Brazilian boys" documentary (which shows this isolated, personal band travels). For any non-rush fan, this DVD is an enjoyable concert. Rash fans know the talents of these three Canadians. We are rather firmly standing by them for years. The DVD (or parts of it, shown in any way) who do not listen to the rush, or who think the rash is good because they do not appeal to the rock-neutral public (ie gender, medicine, and a drunken frenzy). The following line is that this DVD is worth every fifteen and it is more than worth seeing.
