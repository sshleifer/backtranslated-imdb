Legendary Rowan Atkinson starred in "Mr. Bin", a huge hit during his run in the 1990's, and perhaps I almost had seen it almost ten years after the end, so I saw the resurrection. I certainly did not have a fan at the time, and did not see too much episode. I really did not come to the program until a few late teens, just a few years ago, which finally I saw each episode. Unlike earlier, it laughs me a lot of times, and yet, it's always been the case of the episode repeats! <br /> <br /> Bean is a mysterious, self-centered, anti-social, very perfect buffoon whose best friend is his Teddy! He is far apart from society, and life is not easy for him, because he always struggles with very simple things! Because he has no basic fundamentals and has a child's mind. Wherever he goes, he finds himself in various kinds of troubles and brings a very bizarre way to solve the problems he wants to face! He does not only suffer for himself, but sometimes for other people, which he often can not understand! In other words, Mr. Bean walking disaster! <br /> <br /> This sounds humor is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. Gags are almost always the vision gags, which are almost in the show. Although sometimes unthinkable slang, I can say that most of them are funny, often sunny, (there are many highlights)! Although "Mr. Bin" is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it's still great for many people who like visual humor and because of a very limited dialogue, you do not have to speak English to enjoy the show, why did you get global fame ! The show ran for a few years, but the episodes were made very slowly, so a total of fourteen were made. However, it is a classic series, and deserves its extensive application!
