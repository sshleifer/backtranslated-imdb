This movie can be one of the top Hindi comedy ever made. Rajkumar Santoshi is mostly known for his great hard-hitting social plays, but it is easily the most accessible movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (<br /> <br /> <br /> (Salman Khan). They want to be quick and want to move to big cities. Ravena (Ravina Tendon), daughter of a rich businessman Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal), arranged the same plan separately to marry a rich heir. Thus, she married Rabina and kept her hand on her property. But when they plan to get to know each other, there is an acute exaggerated tension in marrying Rabinina. The ridiculous mess and situations are committed as war criminals. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Ramgopal wants to oust his brother and nephew of Shyamapal Bajaj, the same twin brother of Bajaj and overthrow family fortune. In this, Rabina's maid, Karisma (Karishma Kapoor), a mis-pronounced Butler, named Robert (Wijoo Khot), a manager named Valla (Shehzad Khan), who is the past villain Aziz and funny Gangster (Shakti) Kapoor), who is pirate and rolling See more like comedy, she is waiting for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste time for your movie LOGIC. Leave your brain company and just glad. There is no room left for the actors so narrow that the script is so narrow. Dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are diverse. Music (Snow Bhetia) and Song (Majruh Sultanpuri) are memorable. Illustration and danceography (Saroj Khan) of "Yeh Raat and Yeh Dori", "A Lo Gaya Sanam" and "Dil Kita Hai Teer Pahan" are fine, and my mind will remain pure forever. <br /> <br /> This film is made up of two superstar-in-the-made, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (eventually they became superstar). Aamir Khan is ineligible for his first all-out comedy role. I salute her ideas for comic timing. Compared to Aamir, Salman is still a favorite. Among the supporting characters, Paresh Rawal stood with dual role of Ramgopal and Shyamgal. <br /> <br /> The film has surprisingly failed at the box office. I fail to understand why. I still recommend it all.
