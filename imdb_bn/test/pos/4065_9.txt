A fun movie starring with "Showtime" funny Robert De Niro (Parents, Bronze Tail) and Eddie Murphy (Shake, Dellit). The story is as follows: At the beginning of the movie Detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective rushed to a TV store trying to rape a criminal. While coming to the police, Tray (Eddie Murphy) was a policeman, he did not know a police he tried to detain Mitchi. During this scene, fun things were loaded, which was caught in the eyes of TV producer Chase Rits. He is very excited about his adventures together, he decided to create a TV show called "Shotayem", the tray (police) and Mitch (detective) actor. But that's just funny part. The rest is strictly mystery and action. A foreign man is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. While playing LAPD in the show and doing it in real life, Denro and Murphy are very brave in this story. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a seven or eight.
