This is just my favorite movie all the time. Nothing special It's just so incredibly detailed. Just makes it cry about thinking about it. Geronimo Bill The most perfect guy I can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboo spears are important. You do not need money to get what you need. If you need anything it will just come to you. People could understand that the world would be a great place. Whatever you do, do not do it for the money.
