Gary Cooper is a cool guy. Always liked its easy going level going to the level. As others have commented, there are some oddities in the script, such as the US Marshall who has got his job and can not even hit a burner with a pistol. A rancher with thirty hands, but does not seem to have prevented his cattle from running. <br /> <br /> But there is plenty of quick thinking, direct shooting coopers keep you entertained. <br /> <br /> This movie was made in the 1950s. People from the 20's and 30's have problems understanding the Oscars for not entertaining. <br /> <br /> Oscar Material Hope this picture is injustice Good guys find ways to roam the bad boys, about it. <br /> <br /> So rent this movie, loan, or buy, enjoy some corn pop and once more coupe.
