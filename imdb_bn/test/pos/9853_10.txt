In Sudan, the Arabs rule in and fight the Christian and Anime, living in the southern part of this East African country. This picture follows a group of decca boys, a group of cattle, their orphanage was left after their villages were destroyed, and their family members were killed in a ruthless attack by the Arab forces. Most of these boys now have a teenager and "The Lost Boys". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < , Where they will land in Houston. Those who have been adopted as refugees receive celebrities status, as they think (which they have heard) that America is amazing. A trip from Sudan to America travels like "traveling to heaven" like a young man. A large group was thrown out for their expulsion and they were asked to make Sudan better, and once they were educated they returned to Sudan so that they could contribute to Dinak society. They have been warned that "those with baggy pants" are responsible for the negative stereotype of black males, and regardless of anything, Dinak culture is not forgotten. <br /> <br /> When you try to come to the United States from the third world country of America and try to integrate into America society, they have gone from this place to a great extent where everything is widely produced and very much. They are taught clearly and how to use all the utilities given on a daily basis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> As soon as the image progresses, you will see how American culture begins to corrupt their former flexible thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the boys works and does not work enough to survive, so he comes from Houston and Kansas City so that he can follow the education. When other boys see him, they talk about what they can not attend at school. The main reason for coming to America is learning and the media says that Sudan has been brought from boys for education. This happened because boys were deliberately old, they are actually becoming older than them, preventing them from being able to register at high school. <br /> <br /> This picture shows photos from Houston to Kansas. Peter has been enrolled in school, where he shares a group of Christian conservative children and tries to drive in Santiago (although he operates without his license) and works in Walmart. We have struggled with the father's high school life while trying to build school basketball, and have problems working in Santiago, renting, returning to Sudan, raising tension and dealing with loneliness. <Br /> <br /> It comes at a stage where boys want to return to Sudan, and tell them that what they have been taught about America is false. The boys are saying, "Be here alone, do everything alone". A deadly message in a liberal capitalist lifestyle, how it leads man to fundamentalist personality (a trend that creates both neo-conservative and fundamentalist Islamic movements). America has the largest beef, with no time; Time and we do not waste a second! <br /> <br /> Despite all this, the guys do not lose the sense of Dinak culture. They celebrate the Liberation Day of South Sudan, which makes the day clear that the SPL war in Sudan started, which is still going on today. On the occasion of their arrival in America, they meet with "Lost Boys", where they discuss their experiences in America compared to Sudan. When asked, a boy says that if he is able to live, he would prefer to live in Sudan. He added much more loneliness in the United States. They never lose the sense of their community, which has become conditional among them as part of their culture! This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture raises questions about the way we ask, questions our artificial happiness which has created our society of materialism and nature in us. I will also make changes on the way to refugees, I will never work harder how hard they will work and what will be the purpose for a country like my immigrant Canada. This is a wonderful film. I laughed, I shouted ... very emotional journey, and a very well documented documentary. 10 out of 10
