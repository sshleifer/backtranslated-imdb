I like movies about quirky people "One Flu Over the Kaku Nest" was probably my favorite time, so one might think that such a blast happened to me. If you want to laugh and laugh, it must not be one after the other. This movie is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are scary, even after multiple views (because these kinds of stuff really can happen). It will most definitely hold you a whole ride on the edge of your seat. And if you see the end, if you are not deeply disturbed, then you should definitely check yourself for a pulse. <br /> <br /> The acting was extraordinary. Mercy, instead of Terrett's extreme case, changed from Quikie-Boyd to absolute horror, sometimes appearing outside so much control that she seemed unwanted. Seth was very great. The focus of the film is not as frequent as that of Marcia, although he became one who achieved maximum speed as an impressive character. <br /> <br /> It's a classic love story with some unusual twists, and it's next to my true love story "True Romance". Here there are two bad reviews for this, but one of the reviewers was not directly aware of it and did not get to see the whole film, the other was looking for some Hollywood thrillers only with deep characters. (And perhaps was dropped a little away by the visible openness of a plot, because the last round was moving around a black bobby head stolen from a toy store). The point is that this movie is not something that "normal" or "light" want to see. As this one may be messed up and indie, and heavy climax you will not have to go.
