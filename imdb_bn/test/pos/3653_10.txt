Love labor Each frame picture is perfect and grabs you. Then mere emotions and stories-stories take you through the dream, which is with you for a long time after the film. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of characters. I have seen this movie in 2 festivals and it has come with every gesture of standing. Excellent storytelling crossed nationality and language and I felt I was part of the drama I had before. Perfect as casting can get one. Vijay Raj, Camille and Benoit each hold themselves. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates the strong cinema. I can not wait for commercial release of this movie.
