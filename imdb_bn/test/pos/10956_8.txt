Hey; Belmondo! Anna kareena see! Great America's New Wave (or the one you want to call it) is not as good as a guards or truffout and is not perfect, but such realism, style, warmth and humorous. I love that NY expression; "You do not know anything!"; "Forget it". Just like the French New Wave, it's about young people; partying, falling in love or just hanging around. Lelia Goldoni is so beautiful! She's adorable; Surprisingly Ben Carrrutters are also good, remind me of Belmondo. Do not forget to paint a picture. <br /> <br /> standing in 31; 26.5 ;-)
