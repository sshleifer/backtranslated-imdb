What makes this one less budget to make my favorite movie one? I'm not having fun, I saw it 10 times already and not so tired. Is it flexible melancholia across the whole affair? Is it a classic similarity to the heroine? I was thinking about that a long time. And to determine it: I guess: there is no hero, there are only humans. Try to be good at something. Let's try to be some good. Some are hopeless cases but still people inside are carrying spunk. It's a catastrophic night story in the world at a glance at the end. Catastrophe ends in a chain but nothing is a disaster. Other roads on this night reveal that due to the logical consequences of these people, they can spend the rest of the world. It has some of Dostoevsky's stories.
