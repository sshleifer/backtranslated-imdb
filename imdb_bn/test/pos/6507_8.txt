Church and transformer sketch maker Jazz Jeff's raises several frames, but it is good to see that it costs more than the DVD. Together with SCRH, Doug Prayer, who hated the Greenwich incident in the '90s, in Hipey (1996), created a great documentary about the evolution of the hip-hop DJ and turntablism. His latest documentary, Inphami (2005), invented contemporary American graffiti culture. After some scenes four years ago, my DVD has been collecting dust since then, but recently I have seen the subject again and along with the content, I am amazed how well that documentary is actually shot and edited. An extraordinary enjoyable soundtrack is not just the head, but lots of music, old school footage, parties, dance breaks, you name it. One of the best things about the film is that it is essentially checking the turntablism industry today (which is 2001), without actually overturning the originators. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Camera Oscura --- 8/10
