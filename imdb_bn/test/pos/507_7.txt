Overall, I give this image a decent 7.6. To begin I will say how I love the character that is depicted in the picture and adapted. If you occasionally read a comics or just watch the DVD extra you will see that the character of Blade is different from what we see in movies. In the change, the blade is now the most important half vampire, so "all their strengths, but no avail in their weaknesses." For this it is probably credited with the credit book's dark-colleague David Gear. Thanks to him, Blood has become a much more attractive character and I really found one of my favorite anti-heroes. Wesley Snipps was born to play this role, although some probably enjoyed either Descent Washington or Will Smith (lol). Her acting role here does not have to be just like winning the Oscar per consideration but I decid the DayWalker game in two sequels. Also starring Stephen Doroff as Black's Alfred as our main villain and Chris Christopherson. Acting is really good and puts the plot to ensure action. The opening scene of the club is one of my favorite parts that I want to tell. There are things like this movie that disturb me, which takes something like "Spiderman-Man" or "X-Man" from this movie's ranking. Stephen played acting in such a way that I did not like it so honestly. Their lines were so full of foul muthed comedy that it does not seem like a comic book to me. Plus "La Magra" is a bit frustrating as the final villain but the intense sword war makes it up for I guess. A sense of additional non-realities can not be mentioned: A black man with a skin shroud shows a day-to-day stirring with a police shoulder leave. ..dumb. After turning away from some flaws, Mark Isham's music was great and nicely put the film on. Thankfully, all these problems are resolved and improved in the fixed synchronous "Blade 2".
