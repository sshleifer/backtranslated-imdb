Oh my God is a story! This movie is very good and it is God! You did a tremendous job. Acting really well you have picked the right actor. This movie is so good that I'm really glad you made it because if you do not, I never knew about this story because I'm not a big golf fan and I think it's boring, so thank you. I really enjoyed it and that's why I gave 10 10 movies. I also like Shi'a Labov, he was perfect for the role of Francis Quimet. I hope you had the fact that most of the stuff kept there was there. Oh and some parts were fun and others I was really happy about.
