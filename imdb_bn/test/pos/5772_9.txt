One of the best movie performers in Don Knott, this close film competitor Ghost and Mr. Chicken Knotts is an accountant for a Podunk City Hall that is good for swindling citizens. They are "one of the three capable book keepers who keep the fire and fools" (one of the really dirty dumb). When his garbage collectors can mistakenly empty the wrong trash canton, the notes are bound to be a distraught trapped by the city council. Funny moments in the film include bowling allie Strutum scenes, and the cemetery scene is absolutely delightful. Usually nuts, nervous silly work is used well, and naturally, in the 60's, many crazy characters are surrounded by actors. Frank Welker, and Pitt Herbert add such greatness to the actor. As someone is a big car, a beautiful girl, and she can expect the armed knotts with no real indication of what she is doing. Fun for anyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but almost anyone would love it.
