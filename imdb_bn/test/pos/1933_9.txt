In 1931, "An American Tragedy" was presented, the original story of "Who Will Take a Poor Girl or a Rich Girl" It was really an entertaining film. Babu Stanivik was a beautiful because he could, sally blane ditto. Monroe Ashwell, unveils his father's husband. I have never heard of him, but I think he had a good physical similarity to the "Big Broadcast" ('32 '), cross-fired furnace and the crossbinding of harmful ears. Ricardo Cortez, a wealthy player with a gold heart. A true movie pioneer is going to go back astray. Delmamati is resolved in the final stages of the title and I believe there was a record of recording in Antarti Hanshosh, though the off-screen voice was very good. I enjoyed the dance scene. I'm sure they were pure; The band, one of the leading at the time was fantastic. Good work, Lionel Barrimer !!!!
