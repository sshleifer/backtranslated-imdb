It was surprising that this picture was made when I was. I tested the early beauty and tragedy of the Chausun Dynasty in Sopanzes and discovered the well-known Korean folk tales in Chuniyang, and it has its last two films. The most surprising thing is that his 2002 dinner, Chi Hawa Seon, did not appear in the previous two films Pansori Style. <br /> <br /> I still came through an experienced experience. We combine the life of one real person: the painter of Chusun dynasty who went on the road to modernity in the late nineteenth century, but who is not a great person, and because of his fame in contemporary Korean society and artistic expression of contempt for his people and the old Korean class, His insult to the regime of the colonialists is similar to humiliation. Chitrakar, Chang Seng Up, popularly known as Oh Wang (the famous legend of Park Chan Uck's "Old World", starring by the famous star Chei Mick Six) became more influential throughout the film. Contemporary Korean audience will return such a hero to this fact, or perhaps because he was so unconscious in his time. I remained intact in the sense of beauty and tragedy at once in history. I was a master to catch the foolish people of his country, and he almost put himself in this picture. As I expected in the film, the cinematography is exciting, the performance is specific and the story is central. <br /> <br /> Plots have been set up against Singapore, family ties were examined and broken, hypocritical behavior has been accused. (And sometimes real), all the people who "paint the fire." But against all my complexities I am giving detailed descriptions of the life of the upbringing but sometimes against narrow accounts, Seng-up itself is managed to survive. He became the legend of his ability to reproduce the famous Chinese painting after the only appearance. Industry vendor and agent then try to surround him and earn money "Oh win." In other words, the lines of people who want to take advantage of real sowing up, begin to form an artistic star. But he refused to manipulation. His cleverness in the closure of the massive rope and imperialist deficiency affects the audience, if not. <br /> <br /> What are you thinking about Siang? He got strong emotions and opinions about painting, such as aesthetic belief that painting is a living thing and sometimes not finished. He hates those who try to make the industry profitable. And he is not concerned about politicians who use their power to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast the artist as a traitor. But he thinks that painting plays a role in the upcoming upheaval. Horror scenes involving foreign invasions of France and Japan are presented. I remain a signature historical epic statue, and its influence on the kingdom, this multi-million dollar epic remains prominent. <br /> <br /> The drama causes great sorrow for itself and whoever takes care of it, refuses to paint. This story brings a whole new meaning, one that is not only political but also the social of nature. I take on the pragmatic realistic fashion. <br /> <br /> Oh, one became the character of Jesus. People believe in him being able to make artistic fascinating, and the government thinks it requires artistic support, but the drama that others want him or her to be, is very free and abusive. Finally, both governments and people come down on the seung up move directly from the Bible. His holiness becomes human; His humanity is not accepted; He died of ordinary people's sins, industrial critics, politicians, who killed him (or fled). <br /> <br /> But does he die? Like most of my film, a question remains. In this case, does Seung really become an immortal fan? The film does not deal with that question; This is the only possible ending for the original Chang Sung-up, or ohho presents the victory. No death is known because no death is known. It is difficult to find fault with this picture, but I have become so good at presenting various historical inconsistencies in his culture that it does not surprise when he works. As always as the first rate for film, cinematography, editing and writing. This is a disciplined film that I am impressed with the ability of strange storytelling. Imagine, he might be better to do it through the ancient Korean musical art of Pansiri. Still, the film has an expansive artistic style, and in the end, the viewers feel that they have become secret for a fantastic, vague story. And they have, that's because, precisely, I'm gift.
