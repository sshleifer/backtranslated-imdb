Paul is a scarier than most of his fur and shoe-polished wrewolf guises as a secret security guard inside of Nasi. The story is not unfamiliar, a bunch of kids going to a abandoned school party. The fact is that these kids did the same job a year ago, but now she is dead, and the last group of kids seems to be recovering an event 23 years ago. It is fairly well done for such movies and what is happening is the mystery of the mystery because apparently what happened to children is a part of the mystery and probably the truth is not revealed. Not so, just your standard piece and dies. It goes along a fairly good clip and does not reduce the interest of many movies, and the strange story is compelling enough to be interested in you and there are some mysteries that many films lack today. . The end is rather casual and I think most of you have left the imagination, but then it does not welcome again. 10 out of 7, check it out.
