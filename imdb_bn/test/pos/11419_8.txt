All shots, MMO, Bloody horror movies that came to our end in the last "saw, hostels, saw 2, the eyes of the mountains" Yes, they have the place, do not make me wrong! I went to see, "When a stranger calls" my friend another night! Why? Because it was a classic 1979 classic rebuilding, which was wonderful and afraid that you know what everyone does! I do not know what to expect. But I was amazingly surprised! This is a mood, atmosphere, mystery film! Because people remember, what you do not see, what you think you do not hear, or what you think is too much to hear. If you love moods, creepy, suspense and movies in the atmosphere! You'll love it! It brought it back to original Origin of Halloween. Thumbs up, a solid 8.5 out of 10 people remember, it works well! Not suitable! It's not surprising, bloody, it's weird, or poor! It was good to see that a film is like this long Our mind is restricted and distorted by the glitz and shock values ​​of modern day horror movies, we are forgetting, what is really scary.
