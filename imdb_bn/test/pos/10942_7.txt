The fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a mess-based plot and a voice-sounding voice is almost universally bad, but firmness is compelling, war scenes are quick and dazzling and movies are often quite fun. This is a shame story such as a ruins. There were some places where I had no idea what happened, it was spent almost five minutes and after knowing how you got there you were suddenly in the next scene. The film is poor in explaining things and some things do not give much knowledge, but the film continues lazily so that its flaws are very few registered. By no means is a great movie, but definitely a fun one.
