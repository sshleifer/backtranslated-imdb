Is hello I just want to say nice that you enjoyed your review and comment about 'Excellent Intruder' in your film. I believe that the points you make are insightful, intelligent and fully valid. It is a shame that this movie is never shown on TV this day and it is not available in DVD Region 2 - I live in England. Again, many thanks for your review. Actor Juna Hernandez starred in another brilliant film "Young People with a jealous", starring Kirk Douglas and Lorraine Becklace. That was a very enthusiastic and stylish film with some fantastic music. I hope the influential people can leave the entire catalog of 'Janini Belinda', 'I Think Mama' and 'The Yearing' in the DVD region, we like these movies in Great Britain. I'm not a pensionable age, I am still young and my family and I love the classic movie !! Such films are so beautifully made and they bring excellent memories. Whatever happens ...! Many thanks for your comments!
