It was very refreshing to see this beautiful movie. In addition to the director, as well as general features like Bollywood Assembly-line products, the main plot has been kept in view besides the next plot (doctor's family or other hospital patients). He easily explains the description and ensures that all actors want to portray images that are true in letters. The physiological ways of the grandparents of the clinic, the cold and discouraging behavior of the surgeons, the film's feeling of truth due to the social worker's initiative. I'm glad that the director does not fall for the temptation to add songs or special effects, and it can not reduce the level of joy or the level of the subform. At the end of the film some scenes, such as the boy visiting other blind children and blind workers' workplaces, and the final scene where boys splash and close the word of bird chipping, definitely make your eyes go wrong. <Br. <br /> Many Bollywood players do not realize that Oscar committee members are more concerned about the similarity of the subject and film's authenticity and curvature than glitters and glamor. Shawwas certainly discussed the issue of better nomination, than one that has already been beaten. An MPA member is voluntarily suffering from 4 hours of jingostic drama and music and dance. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more movies from future director Sandeep Sawant.
