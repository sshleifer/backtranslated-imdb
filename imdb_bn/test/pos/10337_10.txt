When I was back in the 7th grade (back in 1977), I was asked to read the novel that it was part of my English class study. I can think of it to be touched very well and can feel excited when a TV version comes out after one year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While making this film, Christie McConnell was a popular TV actress and already a daughter playing in a sick family. Hit TV series "Family" It was clear that he had the range and ability to drag this part. I sometimes think of him as a "strong", but he works well. He carried the film well. <br /> <br /> Easter Ralley is just as beautiful as a house, it seems only that she really takes care of her. Barbara BÃ©rio is also good as a little frightened and a little neurotic mother, such as young Robin Lively (who will finally see Black Widow like Lana Milford in "Twin Pick") as a sweet little sister who looks at parental attention. Affection Bruce Davidson is also applying as a German soldier of a good Creator <br /> <br /> The best performance however is Michael Constantine. It is truly strong and merited more recognition than it got. The toxicity and coolness that he has revealed makes the scenes difficult, but it makes it easier to understand the depressed girl's calm frustration. Constantine gives everything right intensity and seems to be a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivation. <br /> <br /> The film is just different from the book in small ways. It's wonderful to watch and inspirational, and I hope it will be released from the video or DVD again. <br /> <br />
