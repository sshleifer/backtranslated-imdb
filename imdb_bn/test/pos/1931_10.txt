Deep water is a compulsory documentary examining stress and ambition on a common man. The testimony and archive footage was a lucid insight in the late 1960s and a land-breaking across the yacht race around the world. Personal conflicts of family, self and fame have been played in one of the most memorable and influential films I have seen. I am not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. This story is revered by the heroes and villains rather than the ruthless expression of the participants. Most interpreter is left open to the audience so that the room is personally related to the situation and character. This movie is a bitter sweet experience with a mix of mysteries, fun and drama.
