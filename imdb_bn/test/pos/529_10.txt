I absolutely love this movie! Since I do not want to give too much away, it's basically a mother and a daughter and they are all about life together. It's their heartfelt story, in their struggle. I think Natalie and Susan Sarah have perfect chemistry throughout the film! This is definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up, way up!
