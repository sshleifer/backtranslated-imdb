Documentary by which sons and daughters ask to understand a parent and by process, their own life is not unusual. Apart from the uncommon results that reflect the lack of talent, the failure of spontaneity, the abundance of atrocities and, perhaps, the consequences of the lasting search for open revenge for past past pain, real and fantastic revenge. The unusual thing is a brilliant, fair and dignified portrait of an impressive parent and "my architect: a son's Journey" is a rare achievement. <br /> <br /> Louis Kan was immigrated to this country as a child, his face scarred by an accident unexpectedly and brutally. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia, where talented young art and music were loved. Soon he became enamorored in the buildings and decided to answer only his creative abilities in an architect's career. <br /> <br /> The story became an architect but this picture shows as she takes a lot of time before attracting the attention of her leaders. An architect suggested that he was a victim of "yellow armand", which was an inconsistent aspect of anti-Semitism that had long been a bias against women in the American profession of architecture. <br /> <br /> When he received the notice, he was clearly seen as a self-reliant, rightly, the workholder denied his views and his views only to realize his views. Because of that inconsistency, he had made a wonderful plan for building some buildings, but few In an interview with an elderly gentleman who expelled Kana in Philadelphia, due to his unacceptable dream in the transformed urban center, people left their cars in Perimeter and entered the city. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the extensive archive footage shows him with students, his voice is steady but sensual, his gaze is respectful and intense. <br /> <br /> Director, writer and project director Anthony Kahn interviewed many architects, the only son of the architect. Some world famous - IMP, Robert AM Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Geehry and still active nonjenarian Philip Johnson. Their opinions paint a vivid figure of this idealist, but ultimately the building's financially weak designer, which has mixed centuries of fortresses, castles and grand buildings in the present designs. The ear's buildings have been shown, among the most fascinating research laboratories in La Jolla, CA. My style has a neo-romantic air that has died by a lot of free space, instead of attracting people's interaction to repels. <br /> <br /> But Kan's son was more then than his father, architect's story. For many years, Louis Kan had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and had two long-term relationships, of which there was a daughter, the other boy. Kahan often went to his mother's house with his son, but in the evening, the mother and son took Kana to the marriage house. Nathaniel definitely wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he does not seem scarred by a strange matter of course for a young boy. <br /> <br /> When Nuthaniel was a young boy, Louis Kahn died due to a major cardiovascular disease in the men's room of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania. After returning to India, he entered into a huge project, another that was never built. At that time the Philadelphia firm had a loan of at least $ 500,000 and he probably stayed in a Federal Bankruptcy Court tour. <br /> <br /> In Kahan, there are several memorabilia structures in which the government buildings are built. Definitely the biggest. Kana, a local local architect, has been able to build a building that can develop democracy (and optimally). <br /> <br /> Columnist Moosh Safdee thinks that there may be a mental heart attack that may be some measure of hardship in ear problems. Train stations offered its endless globetrotting. I disagree: It is unfortunate that Kahn should replace the true architectural gems of America, the old Pennsylvania station, the sterilized replacement with any character, and a deviation without any continuation of the citizens' memories. <br /> <br> During the journey of a little girl her daughter and her mother are featured in a number of psychological moments, but they are not genuine and running, modal and staged. Architectural historians will always read their ears. His son was found to be faulty but very economical and eventually found reasons to remember as a personal person. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
