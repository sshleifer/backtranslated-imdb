I do not compare Lee to Planckad, which was a more humorous moment of IMH, but during a slow starter in Rome and Juliet, your attention was focused on your life, read beautifully and reached the heart warming conclusion :) There were many wonderful comedic moments, some nice impressive and realistic The situation has played all actors. <br /> <br /> It was a common French film, in which the generation and confrontation faced the audience, which faced the audience's own faults! I'm certainly glad to find it at my library, and there is no doubt that I see time and time again, which is a sign of a great movie to me.
