What's up to you The best drama is now on the Gospel music channel! Visit their website to see the schedule and find out how much it is on your cable or satellite. This is one of my favorite shows. It has everything I want to be a TV show, a clean family friendly drama that does not consume me. A man, who after losing his job, decides to set up for a great cross country adventure. By the way they meet all kinds of attractive people and find themselves in all kinds of difficulties. This show was originally closed off a spin by an Angel touched, another really good family show. Make sure you check it out!
