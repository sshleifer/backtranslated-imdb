I love a movie that mixes senses of the seat suspense, smile, style, good acting, and self-parody. Hitkoch consistently blocked it, and Jean-Pierre Melville did the same thing as "Le Cirque Rouge". I was sorry when this long film ended. <br /> <br /> I agree with an English commentator who has a colleague comment. I like French movies, Italian movies, English movies, Indian movies - and growing rare American films. I also think of a writer who has suppressed the film for not having a good copy of the film in the US, completely missed the issue. But I think it's like jazz: you can get it or not, so try to explain why waste time. <br /> <br /> Just look for "L'Circle silent" and be ready for delicious entertainment.
