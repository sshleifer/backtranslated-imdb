I ended up watching a huge M Lillard fan why I'm watching this movie. Actually I suspect that if he is not in the movie, I have enjoyed it or even saw it but once I saw it, I realized that the story was quite beautiful. A bad end I would say but I see it coming. This is a low budget movie and some actors were not really good but I gave it to everyone 7/10 ratings. <br /> <br /> Interested in this movie, as Lillard actually wondered about what it was. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
