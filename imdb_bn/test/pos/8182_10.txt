The movie invites Shakespeare to compare. Mandarin is nicely written and spoken, and the plot is complex and playful. Gong Li did not look good anymore, there is no glory to represent the screen better in China. Indicating the Gladiator, there is no balance between the political dispersion and the personal conspiracy of the reality. Just incredible.
