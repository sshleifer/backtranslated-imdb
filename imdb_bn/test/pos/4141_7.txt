At the age of 13, when LCV hit its first RCA hit in 1956. One year later, Buddy Holly King stepped up to give some competition. Without its ability to write singing style and its songs, one of Body's main talents is often downplayed. Body was also an expert lead guitar player, his unique Franklin style created his own fender strategy. Gary Busey Buddy's personality attempts to capture this aspect. Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, were other contemporary master guitar robbers in Calibre, but Body's talents are often ignored. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the driving force behind Bushey "Body Holly Story" is the success of The script is not only with the events of the life of the BADIA, but it mainly interacts with the immense number of immunizations for the two years of Badi's popularity in 1957-1959. One of the minds is that Buddy and Maria are watching a 3-D movie scene. Buddy It is all disenchanted and Maria says that it will not end. It's just a fad. Actually there was no 3D movie. The sky for the 3-D was in the early 1950's. By 1955, fade has already faded. Yet another example is enough research to make the story more credible. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to separate what happened to the urban legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story may or may not be a narrative about how the names of cricketers are available, but it certainly does not happen in the way presented in the film. Another problem with the movie is how Buddy's parents are portrayed. Of course, Body's father was a supporter of his musical career. "Maybe the kid" has been submitted to Buddy's mother and has inputs in the song's writing. <br /> <br /> It's good that Buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie, but I did not hear my favorite, "I'm looking for someone's love." I am proud that as a result of this movie, I heard the music of Body for a new generation. His son-in-law from the first day of rock 'n' roll was the best. Rave on, badie, over.
