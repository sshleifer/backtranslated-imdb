To read some other comments, I must agree that some of the bright documents (very few) found in relation to one of the 20th Century Dewas (almost Billy Holdid, Besie Smith, Edith Peaffe, Judy Garland, and Mercedes de Sosa) are fair. Because it is initially a 6-hour-plus TV documentary about his career ("Esthmana Forma de Vida" (V. 1995/1999). With more insights and more insight into Amalia's internal world. To subtitle his song, I'm all for it! Although music, voice and performance can be - is! - There are so many poems in the word universal, just beggary. I think this is a conscious choice by the producer. They were targeted for 200 million Portuguese speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, East Timor, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, the United States, South Africa, St.Tom and Principe, Goa, Daman, Dew, Venezuela. Portuguese-speaking diasporos in Luxembourg, Germany, and around the world. As Lady herself, she did not live to see the documentary this special short DVD version, but she was given a preview of "Estranha Form de Vida". And it seems to have had her choice. So much so
