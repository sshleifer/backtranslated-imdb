This movie has taken me right from the start, where a sweet-looking teenager is shown alone to see the grave, then Elton's strongest song "Friends" shows the player walking alone in the street when carrying a suitcase, silently car thieves and prostitution Be aware of going around. The whole film is a beautiful, romantic, romantic collection of young love scenes, hand-in-hand, wild horses running in the wild, fields of wild animals, sunset, wine toilets, evening fires, fun in the evening, and fun. General innocence, all romantic music set by Allton John. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm sure it has a strong impression on me if I saw it. I remember the radio advertisement of this film in 1971, how was this a special movie about the music of Elton John and in this ad "Friends" theme song (for the world "Makin" to see friends) ..., but in those days I I did not hear anything else, and I did not see it until the rental of 35 years later from the video shop, then it was edited, censored All unhealthy people, including angry agenda, are using all sorts of ugly words to describe the film, can I say that the world has gone crazy since then. The story is that a 14 year old girl After the death of his parents, he was forced to accompany his cousin in Paris (this was their grave when viewing the first scene.) One day, going to the zoo one day, 15 years The boy was seen in the age, they closed it and agreed to meet the next day, the next day, while traveling around, the boy ran his car in a lake in a strange lane car crash, it was his father's car, and he returned home after facing his father's wrath. So, both of the teenagers started living in the French countryside, with mutual background, they both could not go Hated rite. They live in a steady hut, the boy performs odd jobs to support himself, their supposed friendship becomes romance, the girl becomes pregnant, and they are successfully home children. All the time when the boy's father is trying to find his missing son. On the occasion of the 1 year anniversary of the couple's flight together, the police finally identified the child's employer with a person's investigation and said that they can see the work the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning, the boy shows his cottage going to work, telling his girlfriend / wife goodbye, and happily doing a cartwheel, because the scene frees him and sends away his girlfriend. At least that video version is the end I saw. Although it is an unexpected good time to finish, her happy life is disconnected with the picture of her happy last moment and her happy life before the child is brought back to her parents' home. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the stories and pictures, the plot is extremely unreal and very entrepreneurial. I think the movie does not go as happy as the dream-coming-true fantasy of youth and it is better to go through the analysis, because all the logic and credibility quickly fall when the story is deeply tested. Why would be fully equipped and left to the left with the stock cottage doors open and unvisited for a full year? What did they plan to do when the owners came back? Why would a girl believe enough car thief to get pregnant from her? Do not they think that it is immoral to use other people's home and food? How can they ever get dental attention or other emergency medical attention when they are out of the community? With a clash, the boy is on a road car accident and against somebody else? Where civilization is nowhere near where the wild horse is run free? How does a man in a zoo pick up a girl when her mind will not have sex as the primary thing? (Alton Johns lyrics are not fit properly.) Why do they eat clothes when they go to sleep at night? And so Wild horse scenes are set to appeal to women, such as "friendships prior to romance", and with their predicted results, all the rear washing and curiosity scenes, flowering areas are moving on one another, smoke filters, scenes of wildlife in the footfalls, baby ducks, etc. . It works, but it is clearly transformed. Still, it is a movie of youth and independence, and since the 1970s the ideology has not changed. Today's youths are still adults, like adults, and when given the ability to be responsible for the same need of romantic love and freedom as adults, they are restored as animals recovered by the police instead of being treated like adults. Freedom Therefore, the message is public. It is not clear why it will work for a spontaneous: This story is about to be recovered from a magic, often from the real world. Such a situation can not grow indefinitely, assuming that it can happen even in the first place, and then there is a lack of witch appeal in the unforeseen state of a story about the real life. I really hope that a teenager did not take the film seriously enough for such stupid stunts. But I also hope that in the 70's, the youngsters influenced by this film have learned something from here and then instead of keeping the hatred and repression of society in the forefront, this kind of magic tried to create one of the most accomplished reality in the world. Especially on their own children
