As the 50 British comedy can become sunny, the survival of the ST Trinity is almost a minute ... and it creates a terrific time within 91 minutes. Other movies I recommend at the same time are TTFild Thunderbol and Green Man. In fact, Alicester Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Watches or Jos√© Grenfell are happy to have a movie or any combination. In ST Trinity we have got a double dose of symmions that play two roles with the humorous disrespect, he continually waves his face. Jose Grenfell (Oh dear!) As Robi Gates, his 'Jolly Hockey Stick' constable-game is full of perfection. Perhaps the best smile comes from George Cole Flash Harry (who came out of Bush while jumping) and the explosion reaction ('Oh poor betty!') Or science lab genes (M and Fruton) "just send some bottles up to my room") . Each section of the film is interesting from the characters, their costumes and settings. The sequels were but the first three were the best: including this, with the addition of ST Trinity's Blue Murder and later Great Great Transian Train Robert's color.
