"Hey, I did not order any cab!" "Yeah, well you got one ..." What can I say about the hack ... What is a man in men? He turned into a heartwarming former police super cable driver with the heart of gold. If you were able (and fortunately for America's TV viewers ... every week a person was around the cold, hard surface of the hack), you would see a caring person carefully. The show was fantastic, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My favorite friend will be hacked when our beloved friend hacks out of his cab in another dark lane ... nothing more than his boxing ... ready to take revenge for an unjust citizen. The headlight of justice will be lit on my face when the screen shows me a dark smell facial expression of a criminal when my mouth breaks out. Week after week, I canceled my duty to show the brightness of the Klingon Association president Hack's brilliance. I have never seen a good show, and when I canceled the program, I expressed my condolences for the loss of America's greatest treasury. In other news related to hacks, I want to announce the world that my wife and I are hoping to join the world within three weeks of Hack Coen.
