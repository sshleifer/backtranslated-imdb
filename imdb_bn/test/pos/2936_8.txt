Bravo is ten times better than "wants to be a super model", I think it's even more true for business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to find most of each aspiring models. Photos look for the depth, ability of each model, personality and beauty, strength and dignity, and the ability to endure whatever they want and to work. I'm happy to see Tire's personal experience in film shooting and runway. I do not always agree with judges' decisions or tire comments and at least one of the winners, I do not think I could win. But this is a show and there every girl has this opportunity to be very lucky.
