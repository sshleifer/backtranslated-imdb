This film is one of the only historical documents that exhibits many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Those who are with us no longer. We are happy to enjoy it today in 1999, through this movie we have recognized the existence of the present. That's why the survivors of today who are still alive, dead people are super star icons. Due to educational history of music, drama, screenplay, design, singing, etc., this movie is only related to the people of this country. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie. The sound was awesome! The film shows to be full, color and transparency were hired, but the film's frames are considered to be old without any repairs. I agree with all the positive reviews. I do not have any negative views. <br /> <br /> I just want to make a request. Please feel free to contact me, please make this movie available so that all these historical experiences can be there.
