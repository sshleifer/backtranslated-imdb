Good news: Director Amnesty International is committed to the cause and the message of freedom of expression and the strong message of oppression. The plot is unique and the actor is my absolute favorite. Extra news: 'Original' is not a joke at every time visiting movies or video stores. Also, critics of critics such as Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert canceled the film as a failed attempt to transform from stage to movie. If I think correctly, the title is derived from the fairytale story of Stoey's character, and the story has made him a potentially devastating and suspect person in an imaginary place. Her dream is dangerous to the government, here it is intensely by the Rickman, Manipulit represented as interrogator. Since those two people are completely displayed only in the film, the director is in for a real challenge to maintain the attention of viewers. In the end, I found the whole thing interesting. Flawless and definitely not for everyone, but fruitful. It is nowhere near the best composition to explain as Koslovski's 'Little Films of Murder' or 'Dead Man Walking'. But if you are in the movie or in Costa-Gvers' political thrillers, you can also appreciate it. Just do not expect any overexplicit promotion or eye-catching action sequence.
