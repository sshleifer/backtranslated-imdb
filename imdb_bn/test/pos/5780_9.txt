I am giving 9 out of 10 out of this movie because there is not enough scientific reference to prepare food for the sophisticated disgusting. The moduson thinks that the confessional biased commentators are making this element, but even the basic concepts of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will also indicate that at a very short time, they will be on a difficult scientific ground when they say that we can not depend on oil, we can convert into different types of energy. , And there is not a plan that measures the energy received from oil Who will replace. Other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life, and have been destroyed. Read "Collapse" of Jared Diamond, a popular book, or a primary ecology or Earth Science textbook and you can verify the fundamental basis of this film. Go ahead, roar when roaming!
