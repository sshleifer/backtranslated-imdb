David Sauett, (Poirot), "Fullprofey", '03, gave almost outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he has said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin extra spell on his face with incredible perfection! You can only see expressions from the detective face and see that in suspicious behavior he did not miss an item seriously. The beautiful waterfall color outside the English countryside is simply breathing. Megan Dodes, 2000 "Bytes", gave an extraordinary performance as a highly sexy, wild woman who m Be able to keep a very secret secret from Pirate. A very enjoyable movie if you really like David Suchet acting Mr. Pitt!
