Two different movies that went with air and scarlett that were never meant to be compared to them. In fact, all of the original actors in GWTW have died and have their own unique prize and praise capability which I liked gwtw and sometimes did not want to make a sigl√© or live anymore, but half my praise of Gwtw, but my shock scarlett was just as written and as Gwtw Scarlett The right to work for his own rights, I can honestly say that I love what I like best The do not. A number 1 for Scarlett was perfect 'as a sequel. Say! Author director producer and all actors Bravo! AS sequels rarely live for their name until this one runs equal to their predecessor. Those who do not like it you start wondering points and miss a great end
