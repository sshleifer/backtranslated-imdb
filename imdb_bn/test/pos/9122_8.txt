Prior to this, there were hijst movies, and indeed the likes of the Raifif have a clear effect on it - but the Red Circle is more than the other in a more elaborate style, and this film is managed by director Jean-Pierre Melville, who created some of the thresholds and some of his audience Let's think. Being calm is a feature of the movie as a gun and gangster of modern crime film, and Melville distributes it to the draw with the film; The sound of the film is very easy and allows Melville to bubble the bubbles below the film in the big movie. There are many angles in the story but central character Cori - a thief who was released from prison. With his release, the infamous murderer Vogel escaped with the escape, who came down from the police nod by the police commissioner on the journey of the train. In the Liberation War, for the first time, her former boss steals some money from Rico, and the second task is to make it a scary and a sharp drying agent, which helps him pull a jewelry heist. But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves of the thieves ... <br /> <br /> The film comes together with four excellent central performances. Alan Dellon is quiet and counting as the hero of the film, while his role as a murderer escaped by Jiaean Maria Voltaire is terrible. Franco Pierre is also a doubtful club owner, when the original standout performance comes from Andr√© Burvily in his role as the Police Commissioner. The film runs almost one and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride. However, focusing on important elements of the director keeps things interesting interesting. The film shows off crime scenes such as shooting for criminal films, but it is kept to the lowest level. The first two-thirds of the film is finally being created in the Suspenseul Haist scene. Riffef is most famous for his histicic order - a complex design scene where someone speaks a word. The significance of this film is similar in that it is shameless, and I want to say that I liked the scene in the Rififi; But Melville's expertise in skill and it works well in a quiet and secure manner. The film flies up to an exciting climax, which nicely closes. Overall, it may not appeal to fans of all crimes because the action is more than a little slow. But Red Circle is a wonderful movie and it's worth getting its reputation as a fame.
