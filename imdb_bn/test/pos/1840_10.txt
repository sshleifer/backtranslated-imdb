Gracie (mini driver), a woman in her twentieth century, waiting list of heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has tragedy losing his wife in an automobile accident. One can guess the results. Gracie gets Bob's wife's heart, even though they do not have each other's knowledge ... yet! One year later, Gracie felt like a new personality when Bob began to think about his social life. When a friend sets him up on a blind day, Bob himself gives the waitress, greasing his interest in the restaurant. They started to see each other. How true will the truth be, and what will be the result? This lovely, fun, and sensitive movie is one of the best romantic comedy ever made. The couple could only bring together the Heaven and Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belushi, and Carroll O'Connor's supportive shield, as well as surprisingly two starring two stars. Chicago took place near, charming and beautiful in the neighborhood setting. Let's put that dittos for clothing and scripts. If you know someone who goes to GA-GA on funny love stories, you can get a good blessing if you introduce them to this fine movie.
