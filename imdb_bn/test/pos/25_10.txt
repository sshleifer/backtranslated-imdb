This is a movie worthy of description - if you do not see it for a while, or the first look - you were very young after it came out (1983). Based on a game of the same name, it is an old actor, who runs a reporter tour of Shakespeare in England during World War II. It is related to its pressure on young people who try to run Shakespeare every night for military problems such as bombed theaters and organizations that are made of old or physically perverted actors. This is related to the various members of his company, especially his relation with his dredger. So far it sounds like all silence, but nothing can be more from the truth. Although sadly sad, the story is mostly humorous and the emotion is driven throughout life. Both men have received Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Qualifications. I strongly recommend this movie which enjoyed the drama, theater - especially Shakespeare, or who ever returned to power. Retreat is another aspect of the moving movie which will be interesting to the audience.
