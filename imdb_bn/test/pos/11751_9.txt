In order to start her career in 1915, an experienced Hollywood director, Henry King, is one of the few sparkling things of love, one of her last great films. It was based on a vendor of Han Sueen which was easily called the Splendid Thing, which was borrowed by Francis Thompson by the author of the Kingdom of God, where the word "love" is very different and used instead. The context means the meaning of God. The film made in the 50's works with directors like Douglas Sirac and Vincent Minerali, and the revival of the Melodrama genre, its reflections and the relevance of popularity reaches its peak. <br /> <br /> This story begins when a handsome American journalist, Mark Elliot, played the role of William Holden, in which he once again came to Hong Kong in a freely 'Futribi' role and met a young and beautiful Han Sein (Jennifer Jones ) Is a half-Chinese semi-English born who is working as a hospital doctor and recently the Chinese Communists have her husband Killed. Mark immediately feels more powerful attraction towards him but his deep feelings at the beginning cools down after his husband's death ("I now believe only as a doctor)" after the death of it is cold. But very soon he fell in love with the tempting generation as hell Mark and both clearly do not enter the mortgage entrance for any reason, even Mark is unhappy married and his wife does not want to give him divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese sources. Yet it is a fate which is a final word in determining the absoluteness of eternal happiness in such a loving relationship, since both of them think of the time being in an uninterrupted time rather than death <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alfred Newman and very romantic, touch, heart-warming but ultimately heart-breaking story.
