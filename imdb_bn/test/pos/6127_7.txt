A very weird, annoying but playful film. I do not think I ever needed to see what a man can do with his butt, and I doubt if I want to see it again. Who said, "The Girl It Has It Hell", Jenny Mansfield's classic wax is a great way of accepting the Divine and setting up a meat slab on the grocery store's feet. Russ Meyer is a great feeling like the film. Divine performance, usually with poor exceptions.
