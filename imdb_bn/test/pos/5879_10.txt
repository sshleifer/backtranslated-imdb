When I saw "the best year of our life" I flew away. The acting, scripts, and master William Willler's instructions (the best winning winner in 1946) are the brilliant. <br /> <br /> This film is the second calendar year of World War II, who live in the plane together and offers everyone the same city. They are all together with their families. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Different from <br /> <br /> The second male Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in an extraordinary role) has to find a good job and married a wife 20 days before she went to war. He began to find that he was not the same. <br /> <br /> More difficult adaptation to create a third person. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his extraordinary Oscar role), he lost his hands in battle and instead of his family responded 'Willma's (played by Kathy O'Donole). All of these men and their families are re-connected to the film in different scences. All of these men's stories are beautiful interwoven together. <br /> <br /> This picture really defines a "classic" meaning. This unforgettable drama (Best Picture Winner in 1946) is a movie that everyone will see. <br /> <br /> If I'm asked to take a picture of my favorite favorite, then I will choose it. <br /> <br /> 10 of these I give "the best year of our life" 11. <br /> <br /> So, when you hire the movie the next time you do not regret it.
