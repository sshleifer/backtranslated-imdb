Karklyn (1921), based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Leyerloff, directed by a classic film, the Victor Szstrom, in silent films, with male roles. The film tells the story of cruel drinker David Holmay, who threatens his wife, neglects his children, inspires him to drink and blinds in love with an astrologer David sits at the end of the year with his warm friends all over the city and tells the story of the Fantom Roth (Corcelene): Who dies on the New Year's night, before the dawn, to serve one year long as the driver of death and the bodies are released from their bodies. But David gets into a fight with his friends, enjoys a hemorrhage and dead the dead on the ground. Meanwhile, there's a fantool carriage coming. The driver is none other than David's late friend Georges, who had been drinking him and died a year ago. As David refuses to get in the car, Georgie powers him. Together, they suffer from David who lives in people where they drive the station. They went to the nurse, who did not love David and he was infected with tuberculosis, so that he is now dead. But his unconditional love for David will save his soul. Full of his souls, they get David's wife and children. David was able to stop his wife from killing herself and her children, because she could not find a way out of the sadness she had given to David. They also went to David's brother, who had been killed in the waters of Dawood. David tells George to return to his body, because eventually he sees that his way was wrong. Since it prompted Georges once to drink, David's desire was granted, he would get a second chance, and the fantoo carrier would have to be more than one year to pay George for his own sins. This movie is probably one of the most powerful and most impressive films ever made. Deplorably, it is not yet available on international DVDs.
