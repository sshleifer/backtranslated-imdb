So, I would not disagree with the critics, but I did not really move this movie. I was a little hesitant to rent it because I'm going through the same things that the heroine is supposed to face. Still, I did not think I could feel some Cathriss, or at least realize that I am not alone. When I realized the illusion of the hero with his unexpected cousin, I did not think so much about how much I liked his inner struggle. I felt that his separatist cousin was more focused. This is a beautifully illustrated movie, and I truly appreciate the use of silence to get the feeling of isolation.
