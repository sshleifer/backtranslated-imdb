It was really an amazing adaption. I missed the first episode, unfortunately I missed the ties between the characters and the smooth flow of the story. But as soon as I saw the second and then the third installment I just got blown up. I ordered the DVD for less than a week and could not wait to come, I went straight and brought the book. From the moment I opened it, I was hooked, I could not down it. I decided to finish the whole book before I dared to watch the DVD. I liked the book because it went into the minds of characters, you understand where they came from and there was a role in the story. They were disappointed by the disappointment of the book as a master piece and I think they could do it nicely if they were able to expand it for a long time. But considering it being able to fit in only 3 hours slot, I think it's nice. It nicely follows the main twisted saga. And the actor who was called as the main character was amazing! The making scene of love was purely beautiful. It was very flexible and loving and showed just how natural gay love could be. I was completely blown up with books and television adaptations! I've enjoyed both the previous novels of Sarah Waters and the Velvet Adaptation Tiping. But when I read FingerSmith and I saw it, I knew that a novel / adaptation of his earlier novels could not defeat it. Sarah Waters has surpassed herself this time! I recommend you watch this adaptation! Velvet Tiping If your stuff is not, then it does not let you close it. Fingersmith is a completely new ball game. This is a beautiful but dark story about love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> Have a look!
