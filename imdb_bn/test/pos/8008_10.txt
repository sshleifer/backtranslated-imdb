All bat-film, Batman Returns is my favorite. Best of this beautiful, dark and funny movie Tim Burton Although it is very fierce and dark, it's Batman that the creator Bob envisioned why many years ago. Michael Keaton reiterated his role as Gotham City's bad name. During this time, he rose against two deadly enemies, Danny Davito's Penguin and Michelle Pauffer's catwoman. With Danny Elfman's a great casting and film scores, the film takes us as an adventure because Batman Gotham battles with the evil forces who try to take the city. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as a great businessman, who has an evil plan till his braces. But of course, Michelle Poffey stole the show. With all these elements you have a movie that will throw you away. For this reason you go to the movies. It has everything. It's really a shame that Team Burton can not manage other signals. If so, I think the franchise is going to be strong today. Batman Returns is a great experience for fans like great movies.
