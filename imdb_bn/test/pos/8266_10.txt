I copied the video to my DVD so that I can enjoy it when I like it and it also appears alongside the very successful (and rare) wedding! It's just a very novel adaptation of a novel novel. Everything about it is just perfect and it has amazingly good age. There is always an opportunity for this old thing that it may appear to be a little coincidence next to modern theater, but 'Pryceus Ben' is more than its own concept. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> I challenge someone to see the final sequence, at least at least without romantizing a little bit. It is perfect film to watch when it is cold outside and you are snuggled on the sofa. <br /> <br /> I can really recommend this extremely high resolution.
