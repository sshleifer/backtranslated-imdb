This TV series is a stupid and obsolete English gentleman who has done almost all such tragedies. <br /> <br /> I remember Mr. Bin with my family in 1990, when I was still a child. My family was so disappointed with each episode, and the issues that still came to our daily conversations after twenty years. Memorable scenes are still in my head, Mr. Bien was trying to get out of his car park, light up, count sheep and take him to the swimming pool. We bought all Mr. Bin videos of VHS, how expensive a drunk they were. It was valuable because we saw them again! This is a very interesting TV series which is very rare for all ages.
