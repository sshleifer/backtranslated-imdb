It is interesting to see what people think of this film, because it is quite unique (though it carries some trademarks of Clive Barcar's writing). Although it might seem a little uncomfortable, but the film is fairly complex for Hollywood's straight hook and layered status so that if you expect to feed, you will see a large amount of a common giant flick. <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, partly off screen, comment and imagination. <br /> <br /> Another potential hang-up is ending, which I can say, without wasting it, it is not entirely good and not quite bad. Actually, it's not very defined, which I know some people do not know what they can not know, but to me, and to others, I'm sure, by adding someone else the level of the story - the level of guessing, and, moreover, the point is that big Obstacles are a wave that is tremendous to stretch far away <br /> <br /> Of course there must be moral, but you have to face a different-than-off-off-of-off-movie comparison with Hollywood. The display. That moral is easy to summarize, although it does not appear quite simply; Bias tendency to hate and different people <br /> <br /> I love this movie, although many critics have commented, the expression of the actors (in addition to David Craneberg, who is a wonderful face) is rather tacky. I'm not sure that they fully blame their lack of look and lack of depth, however, it is seeing these common issues in the field of literature in converting literature. <br /> <br /> Not everyone, it's a great movie, you do not expect to be an ideal horror movie.
