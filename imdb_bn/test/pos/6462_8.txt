Edge of the City, directed by Martin Ritt, John Cassettes, Sydney Potter, Jack Warden, and Ruby D., 1957. This is an annoying man, Axel's story, which has a mysterious past that slowly comes out during the filming season. He has a connection that works as a loading doc for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real moneylender who takes kickbacks from his staff and works hard on them. Charlie is a black man, T.T. (Poitier) holds a similar position for those who have an acute dislike. TT urges to work for his team; Excel defies Charlie and does so. Axel finds a place for living and socialization with TT, his wife (D) and their son's white school teacher (Catholin McGuire). When the tragedy strikes, no person in the loading dock will talk to the police, and Excel has its values, what it stands for, and the meaning of friendship. <br /> <br /> It's a really nice black and white film that's not being strange or being black or white! It really limits yourself to you and really knows about who you are. Charlie is a satirical and hated that a black man has a good position on the dock. TT charles teases and gives as well as he gets. T.T. And while the time of excel time or TT's boy does not have any white teacher with which the family is socially involved. Acel, Lonar, difficult to accept or accept someone - It is through these TTs that they learn. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , A man with a real encouragement for life, nothing to fear Cassavetes is an excellent and completely opposite character - dramatically shadowed, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film is open to open what happens to Excel. However, he is now a different man. <br /> <br /> Strangely unknown and unknown movie, probably in the shadow of the era of the era of the era of ages and ages forever and forever.
