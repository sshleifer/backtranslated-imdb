My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We stumbled across a PBS station and they asked when they are always now. This is to remind them that their grandfather took care of their daily care in summer. Very funny and sometimes they can not stop talking about one scene or another. I would definitely recommend this show to all young kids. It's very clear and it does not slow down to show you TV all day. When reading a story, it is slowly and he speaks every page with Mona. When I read my girls' next book during my sleep, slowly reminds me about the book and talk about the book instead of hurling it for sleeping.
