What a great little film, lots of good roles from some random stars. Originally this pot is to be caught in a ridiculous adventure that producers. The picture points to the fact that everyone is going to die! Which adds to the comedy. When the character of John Lithgo (3rd Rock) is shown again - it is impossible to imagine the impossible travel, it can be like a total mockery. This film completely fits wrap and wrap that lets you guess at all. Billy Bob Thornton astronaut farmer) is actually brilliant, in fact looking back, the character is the same together. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the final scene is like a dream. But at the same time a nightmare. Hank Azaria (Carter) Finally said, I love you, do you think we should do this every year? I felt my desire they felt. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that this picture is good for everyone, but as a lover of Stonar movies, I give it 10/10. - My suggestion is a joint preparation; Jump back and enjoy!
