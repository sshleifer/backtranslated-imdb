If you are looking for Kung-Fu Action movie, watch elsewhere. During the battlefield battle, the film revolves around its provincial drama, which struggles to find its way to the Americanized Canton. Most "like Kung-Fu Humor", action scenes are used to strengthen humor rather than elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Chung Bui is a statement of great nature in Kung-Fu movies, where they always seem to find some reason to fight. Instead of some grand drama about respect and respect, small misunderstandings began to shout to each other and begin to beat each other. <br /> <br /> My West Ace, as it is known in the West, played the story of Chara Tay-Nun, Kara Hui, who is married to an old zamindar who falls in the hands of her greedy and corrupt brother. Do it. After the death, he resided Canton with his nephew, director Lau Car Liuong and his son Ah Ta Taw, who played Hishiya Ho, live with him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The same age as Ah Tao, his method is more similar to his status as his step-great-aunt. Aha is also speaking in English (very badly), the guitar plays and the costume goes to party, when Chen tries to adapt to her Canton lifestyle, she shows complete, gown, high-heel and dance scenes with makeup. <br /> Does this movie make her realize? Long Kar Leung is probably not the best director of Hong Kong, but Whose Hugh won the "Best Actress" at the Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. Also, this is controversially the best performance of Hishia Ho. His chemistry with Huai was remarkable, and although he took a stroke carrier of Kung-Fu Humor, he often worked alongside the Semo Hung, his perfect combination of athletics and comedy. Romantic excitement and conspiracy, like being in the second half of the film, is completely confronted. Without any care of the world he does not wake up easily through life. He became straight man and his colleague, Ellen and George. <br /> <br /> One of my complaints suddenly, the comic aspects of this movie were conclusively killed. With a little bit of transgressions away from dramatic conspiracies with the film but with a slight change in accessory music. But it has a certain equality. The film attracted attention to the conspiracy, and Lau Carr gave more attention to the character of Leung and it ended up like this. But the final scene comes back to the comedic roots of the film in conjunction with both sides of the film.
