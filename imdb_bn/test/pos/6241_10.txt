This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I think it really does not deserve it. Until I read the glowing reviews here. Looks like I've seen it long ago. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film, and I saw most of my life obscure films. I've always found the dolls, mannequins and such vague as awesome! Look at the "outside of the door" doll and of course the great "trilogy of terror". And what about the "Living Wings" of the epic Twilight Zone episode? Hell, doll weird! And there are moments of travel traps that will stand your hair behind your neck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was memorable. And it seems to think of one of the only trailers to think about the mind which seems to me to think. It took me several years to see it, but it was a treat. <br /> <br /> Stephen King mentioned this movie in his "Dance MacBook" book and gave it an amazing recommendation. Very good company <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture will always be tall on the list of my list. It is a real-time addition to the genre of time and along with the 70th wonder,
