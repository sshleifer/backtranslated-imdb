This is a real jewel of a TV movie. Based on the complete untrue story, it follows their course in the English FC Cup, following the courses of the down-out football league club, where greatness and players play seventy-style sports. Finishing unexpected, fantastic performance, and Nick Hankock shows that he can do anything other than the host sport show. My only regret is that I do not tape it.
