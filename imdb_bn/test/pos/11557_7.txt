Sometimes I really wonder ?? When I see the comments here, it seems that my people have seen a different movie than me. I saw it ... and liked it. Not like that, it made me happy, but on the way to showing good movies! <br /> <br /> The film requires some patience, yes. And yes, the original character is really annoying, but I'm sure that by will. <br /> <br /> This really makes a difference if you watch this movie in the movie or in the house. Most people watching movies in the elevator are watching movies at home. This movie is not as clear as the background of the background. <br /> <br /> and no. Good instruction means five smiles or explosions are not being a second. Good instruction follows your subject and means keeping the stories and actors together. And when it does not work perfectly, at least I think it works quite well. <br /> <br /> I like photography and set, even if they are occasionally supernatural. The opening scene is really special. <br /> <br /> I like acting ?? Guillaume Depardieu Pierre is not playing. He is playing the role of Pierre, who plays the role himself! Pierre is not a romantic hero that he is trying so hard, he is violent and self-righteous stupid, a neutral weak, who loses all those people who claim to be protected. Even his love for the truth is displayed only by a single position in his ongoing lies, and even without questioning himself, does not explain himself. <br /> <br /> People are surprised that this person came from other things: the character is seen for more than two scenes, it becomes obscure, there is enough information scattered throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Even the strange building targets start to show as soon as possible: Remember that escapes from the battlefield in Isabella - and perhaps it is a sanctuary for civil war fighters, perhaps Bosnia (which was still going on when the movie was made Then) was running. At least this indicates that YaÃ«bail told Pierre when he was initially surrounded by him and the next scene in which book Pierre Isabellel with his father book in Bosnia.
