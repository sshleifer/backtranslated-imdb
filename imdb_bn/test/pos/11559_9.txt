I want to know how anyone can get a copy of this movie, "This is the Way of the Earth". I have seen this movie for about 30 years, and I want to see it again. The world wind and fire over the world with their inspirational music and theme. In the early 70's, this group did not stop like their opponent, but America's ethnic tensions were banned, which banned equal understanding of African American music groups. It is good to continue the continuation of their success in the wind and fire of the Earth. I would like to add this collection to my collection Help me if anyone is possible Thank you for your attention. Millennium Shaw
