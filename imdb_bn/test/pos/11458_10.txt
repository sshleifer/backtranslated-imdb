This movie was not great to disrespect it not to understand. I first saw this scene like 87-88 and it was really terrible, if you are a horrible fan of 80, then you should not have any problem with this film, which makes the 80's super-awesome. I had to fill a few of the actors and they were cool. A vague old house, demons, crazy party and horny are not great about young people looking good. The dialog and the special FX made this movie a classic. The film has taken care of such a classic rumor that the black guy will not always die in the end. Although the film was fantastic, it was unknown to me, what was the last thing that happened to the old couple, or the story of that little side story surprised me.
