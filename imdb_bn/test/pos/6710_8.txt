Is this a perfect movie? No This is a wonderful adaptation of science-fay book and it has venues from place, nude beauty and British military skills. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I was young and I can remember the feelings of scary films and mithila girls. In fact, if this extraordinary lady can not make the whole movie nude, I probably would not have been able to give it so much ratings, but showed her poor talent, now I really consider voting for it! <br /> <br /> I am lucky for the movie and I have seen it again. The influential influences of the influential scientists of the Lost Ark or the Polarists are divided into fantasy sci-fi stories, but fully share it with top performances. I still enjoy the picture (as well as Matilda May), but it was a mix of Nostalgia, which they compared with the big films they made today, and actually wanted something more than it did. <br /> <br /> The line below: If you are not allowed to miss this movie you are a fan of the movie fan. Oh, did I mention that Mithila is young, beautiful and naked?
