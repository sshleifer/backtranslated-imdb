Halloween 666 (1995) Producer's Cut Review! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you thought the last section was dark, this one would really hurt your mind. A mysterious "Man in Black" Haidfield police freed Mikeil Maier. In the process poor peasant Lloyd was kidnapped by strange cultists. Do they want to be with him? Who knows, but just to end his long adolescence will soon say. Doctor Lumis is trying to kill Michael Mayer and innocent (good luck) to bring back his remaining evening years. A friend of Lumis, Doctor wine came back after four seagull intervals for better doctor's help. Another old face from a guest star part. <br /> <br /> This bold and cool series was broken down while editing the post. For some reason the distributors felt that the final product was not worth the time of the average horror movie audience. So they decided to submerge it. Then the film kept an egg in the box office for a few months sitting on the shelf. No matter what they film, they make it even worse. They must be left alone alone enough. Hey, film companies now know better than filmmakers .... they do not? <br /> <br /> Producer's Cut: Highly Recommended <br /> <br /> Released version: Not recommended
