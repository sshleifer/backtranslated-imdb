The plot line is an open release under the stomach of American politics. Although the theme seems to be general, the film is a great way to tell the story "created". <br /> <br /> Characters are played firmly. You feel lead innocent, and lost his innocence. Politician Double Talk, a real snake princess. <br /> <br /> The camera work is impressive. It affirms the variety of acting and dialogue. Ditto for the song. <br /> <br /> The story uses an illustration with Vintette where the message is filled with bi-entrepreneurs. A very quick tool by authors / directors. The story is directed by the last scene. <br /> <br /> The film was like a great mystery book. Some were "afoot"; You knew it was bad; You did not know exactly what could happen - you had doubts; And when evil is revealed, you throw your breath that you have noticed that you were holding it. Sorry, your head shakes. <br /> <br /> A story has been well written and well-spoken. A young writer / director of 3 cheers.
