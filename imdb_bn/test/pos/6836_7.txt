This movie was a wonderful surprise for me. All honesty, the preview appeared to be scary until preview, where Emma Thompson and Alan Ricman appeared. So I hired it with reservation, but I've enjoyed this movie perfectly. It was a great acting, a few good plans, and, of course, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. It's definitely worth checking out.
