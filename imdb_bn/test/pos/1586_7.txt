A Kaki, but a bit funny bit. Are you going to see it from the beginning, but this is its own little comedy of every report on the world. Very low budget sci-fi t.v. Very good special effects for Show It's fun to see Red dwarf vein, but more budget. Someone who is coming in the middle of the episode, you need to understand that these guys are all unable, because they have been able to move the command stairs because other officials have died. Also, the main boys are from the laundry corps, so all of them have laundry. If you like Red Dwarf, you probably like it. Slightly different t.v. The idea, what you see is the Commander's report every day. <br /> <br /> If it is better explained then it is very difficult, but not at the beginning of the first episode. You know what happened to Red Dwarf, if you are not told.
