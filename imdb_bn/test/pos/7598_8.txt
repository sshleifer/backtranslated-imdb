After watching this movie, I came to realize that Drew Barrym is a great actress. This movie was not watchable without Drew. Actually anyone, like Drew, can actually find me, and when he was "Josie Grossi" he did it. Her tries to "cool down" the cold girls, she was happy, especially to try to dance to the night club. <br /> <br /> We were also SNL favorites, Molly Shannon, Anita, playing a huge part of JC. Good friend The movie's most interesting scene was trying to teach Anita's Class Sex Ad. These are the most fun performances and best of molly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lily Sobiski liked it too and I really felt for her, because I know people like her that she was tortured. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen for fans of Drew Barryme because Drew creates the movie.
