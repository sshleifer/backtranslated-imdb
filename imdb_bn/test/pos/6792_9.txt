This is a delightful film. Elizabeth Taylor does a great job, like Mickey Rooney. The film just makes you feel happy. It is inspirational, and some part is a little overly emotional, that is easily forgiveness. I could see this movie again. Every time I see it, exciting the race at the end. Highly recommend this film.
