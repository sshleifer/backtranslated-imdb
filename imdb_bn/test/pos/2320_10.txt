See, we rated it at a rate of 10. It sure is a comedy, not an epic like the Lord of the Rings, or the mass with the wind. Especially for comedy, these days, it is a 10. <br /> <br /> is not a long movie, move quickly and easily. Grammar in the house is designed as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel submarine, against the US Navy Navy in the game of war, it is designed to see if it could get nuclear bombs through our terrorists. (This kind of curiosity ... East 911) Do not take this matter seriously because it is mostly sunny to start from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The second command of Rob Schneider (like "Frank Barnes") and pulls a lot of smiles. Perfect for all others as well as their part. Rip Torne and Bruce Darn <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Buy it (we've done) and enjoy it! I wish they would make a part 2!
