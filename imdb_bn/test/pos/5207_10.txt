If we compare the film industry with the ocean, we only have the tendency to patronize. Directed by a powerful Hollywood marketing team, we saw civil warfare films like Civilized Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or Flower Metal Jacket. But from time to time under the splashy wave, less known pearls increase in silence. When you pick one and look carefully, you wonder why this pearl is almost unknown and why it is not on the crown. <br /> <br /> "Stalinad" is such a jewel. Why, is it a bunch of many million dollar rating actors? No, it has thousands of additional? No Is it exciting, spectacular, glossy computerized visual effects? definitely no. So, what's so special? Well, in one word, this pure past reality is resurrected and after fifty years it has been transferred to celluloid. The tragedy of the most bloody war in history is here. Dreaded, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who burned everything during the attack, burnt the village, broke the building, eroded suburbs, gunfight, explosions, fire coats, soldiers, were burnt alive, torn or broken into pieces by the tank in their pocket - you Got all But the real horror is elsewhere. Without some change ability, people are easing easy pawns. The soldiers we follow try to leave the battlefield and they fail. Civilians lived in prostitution somewhere in the middle, just crying for their children. Fierce, huge grinding machines of war melt people, tools, villages, cities together - and ask for more victims and destruction. <br /> <br /> A group of German soldiers struggled to survive and keep at least a minimum level of all these joint frenzy. They fight their duties and brave war. But, everybody knows that almost one battle almost disappears when people start reducing self-confidence and faith. We see how these people are abandoned, how they plan for the desert, how they fight in Berlin (finally wounded) to catch the full plane, how some very badly injured soldiers are considered as Simulants and Shots, how they are forced Run a small group of Russian civilians, of which a young boy, after how they literally Food and water was up to the roof to fill rthe - some "higher" scheduled for officials. One on one, they drop dead. The end of the film is the most tragic, depressed, and sensitive finishing that I have ever seen, the superb score of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The war destroys everything in its way <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen for everyone. A true movie lover should have her in her collection. We all have to be careful about strong anti-war messages. Unfortunately, never human beings, never learn politicians. Suicide is our DNA and human pain seems to last forever. Could we be reasonable enough to stop the war?
