From last October I'm waiting to see this picture! (It was supposed to be out of October '98) and now finally I saw that I'm not disappointed. Bloody surprises! OK, it was slow at the beginning, but once it's gone, it's very exciting to have a nail-cutting fictional Robert Carleille 'The Flute Monty' and Gaz's 'The Flute Monti' and different from 'Teenspotting' in Begis) that makes it difficult to recognize him ! And Janny Lee Miller and her hair boy are acting from the 'Trainspotting' blood hair and why the lengthy Lyle Tyler's Rebecca falls for her, she easily gets her horrible gentleman highway man acting on the right to be sunny and sensitized. A great film. The hadith in Disney's Hercules will say: "Two Thomps Way Way Way Up !!"
