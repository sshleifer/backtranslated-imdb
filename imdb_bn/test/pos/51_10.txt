This is one of the best movies I have seen. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance from a wonderful A-list cast that will make you laugh and laugh after you laugh. <br /> <br /> I could not care about letters but <br /> <br /> Mrs. Marsson will blow you up, young young girl will play. <br /> <br /> I thought that the set design top rate. As the presenter it is really placed inside each era. <br /> <br /> The music is also an explosion. Beautiful selection to represent mind, time and space. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he is distributing some great songs. <br /> <br /> This is a great story that will be seen in a lot of repetition. Take a look at it!
