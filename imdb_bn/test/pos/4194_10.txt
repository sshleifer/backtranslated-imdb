I would admit, in the past I had the opportunity to watch this movie, and after about 5 - 10 minutes, I felt like many people. I'm expecting a monkey movie similar to the television show, but instead I was given ... Well, I did not know that I was allowed to be honest. <br /> <br /> Finally, I realized that I did not have a close mind on this image, I also saw it myself again. This is a movie that is never closed for my interest, because it warns me, because I try to understand its meaning. And when I think I found something in the movie, then once again I see the film is destroyed. It seems like most of the people mostly like to watch a movie with a clear plot. They want to explain everything and answer all the questions in the final finale. Well sorry, if you want it, this is not the movie for you. But if you like movies like The Matrix (and even better, their growing), then you think this movie will encourage you, appreciate the thoughtful thinking. <br /> <br /> Think of the picture as a dream. In our dreams, things do not give any sense, what we hope can not happen, people do not talk about space or things, do not work or work in the same way. Complaining about "Head" is complaining about a dream you felt that you do not understand. Mind is complicated like a complex system, and a movie titled "Head", is it difficult to relate these two? <br /> <br /> The music (and number of music) really stands, especially in Peter Turk's two works, which are among the best tracks in the film, "Can you dig it?" And "Tall Titles: Do I Need To Do This Again?" <br /> <br /> This picture proves that the monkeys were much more than just four classes in the pre-f√°b group (called them as their critics) on a television show, but they are actually more intelligent and talented than the world. Give them credit. There are many messages from Munque and generally 'Entertainment Industry' related films, which have become the best form of film making, which was far away from the time. <br /> <br /> I think, this film has been released as an independent piece at the moment, it will actually qualify for respect and praise. <br /> <br /> One last comment: <br /> <br /> This Beatles can be compared to the movie "Magic Miss Tours", because the Beatles movie seems weird and bizarre. However, in my opinion, "Head" is standing somewhat above the beetles in celluloid.
