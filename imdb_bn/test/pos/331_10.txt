You do not have to be a Tamilian to praise this gem of the movie. I do not know a word in Tamil and saw this movie because a friend suggested it to me. Knowing the language is difficult to understand but I can make the story because the lead actors (and actresses) have really played well. And the little girl was really cute (she was not bothered like most Hindi movie actors). The story is really touching and hat for trying a bit, Mr. Ratnam Relations between parents and their children have been shown to be quite practical. (I could have known the character of the film). It was a movie that will remain in my heart forever and I do not want to hesitate to recommend to my friends. The songs are also out of this world! They were beautiful and meaningfully portrayed. If I could understand the exact meaning of the songs :(
