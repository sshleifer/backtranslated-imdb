Well, I like to have an Italian horror big fan and I like movies such as Argentina, Floris, Bava Level and Bava Juniors, to quote only the most famous. "La villa delle anime méléadet" is one of the most unknown films of this genre, when this movie continues to run today, its crisis begins and director Carlo Acienano hears a whole new word in my ear. (He directed six movies. Italian executives should pay the price for not working in Rome ...). But the film is not so bad. And it's not right to talk about "trash". Well, the plot is not so original; It reminds things like the Amitvil series (the year "Damoviyano Damiani" MTVvil Possession "or the last work of Mario Bava" Shock "). But you have to think that it is a movie cinematographer (like Mario Bava movie); So the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; The atmosphere is made by very good lighting and camera movement. The rest of the background. I think the movie works; Not very good, but works; It is definitely better than many Hollywood productions like Holding, which is a big budget, but not big ideas ...
