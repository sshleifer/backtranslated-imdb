I saw it when it first came out and it has been seen several times from it. I have a DVD This is one of the best works of Drew Barrymore and more than once. <br /> <br /> The pictures that I could add to being highly popular in high school are one. I was not oppressed like JC (in his real high school days) or like Aldes, but I was never like the main party type. The scene was such that three popular girls were victims of their own lips, because Josie Walking Walk is my favorite scene and I first saw when I was driven. <br /> <br /> I can see this movie even today. It's awesome.
