I have asked whether anyone has this show. I would be willing to share it with all 26 episodes airing in the United States and interested people. All I need is that you supply VHS tape or blank DVD I have both formats and pay for shipping. My email is creator67@pipinternet.net, just send me an email and your request and I will notify you and we can arrange it. Quality is very good and you will not be able to see them after they have been broadcast in the 60's, but they are very enjoyable. It was one of my favorite shows as a child and there was a special place in my heart because it brought many memories of my childhood and other groups like Altman and Astroban. <br /> <br /> Peter
