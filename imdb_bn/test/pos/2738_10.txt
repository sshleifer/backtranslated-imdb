It seems that GAF cameras and projectors are leaving the business; Although they will continue with their other initiatives such as the former Swar's Ghost-Master 3 Dimensional Color Slide viewers. <br /> <br /> We rarely knew about the quick process of video cameras, bitmaxs, VHSs. And the last DVD revolution With the super 8 magnetic sound camera we bought, we took some sound film records as a graduate from our South, Jan's First Hollywood Commune and pre-school of his younger sister Mitchell.

Bill Goodwin was the announcer / host. But we never saw this real UPA theatrical cartoon; Or did we know that the young Master McQueen-Boing "Greenwich", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street" fame Seed creation <br /> <br /> Combined workers were very talented and deep. The quality of outstanding production is clear. Director Robert Cannon and supervising director John Habley were the leading veterans of their crafts. The writer was Theodore Jeisel (Dr. Seuss, Humans), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Scott is not considered to be so much contributing to writing in UP, but to become a partner of JWard on television properties such as Rocky and Bulbinkell, MR. PEABODY, Shape Flickr, Jungle Round, Hopper Hooper and Draw Flickr.
