An interesting and involved film about a "living" is just trying to live peacefully on his day. In the next movie of Michael Mann, the main characters of Theophie (1981), Hit (1995), etc. are present. You will find it in the UCLA Instructional Media Laboratory - the only place in the country for which copies are easily available to the public. This is a great one!
