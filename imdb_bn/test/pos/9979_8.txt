Rainy days are not too much. We were surfing movie network channels and it started, so we gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> As we have seen, we are more excited about the story. The underdog of the working class is trying to create the old story of a game (I think in 1913), usually run by the rich high class, but this film was absolutely enormous as seductive and it was also based on a fact. <br /> < br /> acting is credible and welding bright. And . . . We do not have golfers, so just do not miss this one about golf. A person will play a game, because it is about the people. Golf works well for this story because the differences in class and snobbery which seem to involve some to play games. <br /> <br /> bottom line. . . . This is a good movie. It is well kept together and it's not always fun to see people who feel better than each other.
