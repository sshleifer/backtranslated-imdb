I grabbed the film on the horror channel and was very impressed by the film's Gothic atmosphere and voice. As a big fan of all things related to Pumpers, I am always happy to make new changes to Vampires Mithose, in this case, a boyfriend is a horse-like creature living in other dimensions. The director has done a great job of expressing the mood of this matter, using a frustrating scene scene that is a story of love throughout the time and space, which is blood and life is the pure love of friendship. Story by Vampire The characters of the story are transferred to another level which is transferred through the altered substance, where a shaped vampire creature seems to provide the desires of their hearts, when they eliminate the essence of their life. There is some similarity between the effects of drug addiction and control, and how it affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I saw two main male characters in the story, Chris Ivan Civic and Alex Petrovic, who were very attractive huntsman, always plus points in a vampire story for female viewers! Special effects were made and the effects of animals were done well, and the design of the vampire's level set was very effective. Above all, Vampire has been recommended to take an enjoyable way in mythological way, and for some people who do not like their vampire with just some intelligence and step only. The only thing missing to do it better was more sex and nudity, because it would be suitable for plots and themes.
