** Warning! A little plot ahead of Spoilers! ** <br /> <br /> "Italian job" is not the best movie you'll see in that year, or perhaps this summer. But it is a suitable two hours because it does not try to color the lines, learn its limits and cross them. <br /> <br /> How this movie carries the cast work. In a movie about the crew crew, people have good relationships with each other. Without that convincing feeling, the audience does not believe in letters jointly or individually, and there is no chance of the film. But from the first scenes, when people make fun of each other during the infiltration of the Venetian palace and are angry with each other, then the right chemistry is. <br /> <br /> The characters are not novels; They are your basic gang of criminals, about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defined skill. But each actor brings the appropriate products to the table for his or her part. Mark Wahlberg's absolute performance and finesse fit his part as a mastermind planner. Edward Norton offers a good attitude to his dark role and his twitter to Moses. Donald Sutherland is the crew cricketer's father, and he looks suave and part of the old fashion thief, which is still part of the psychological spry. Jason Statham, Seth Green and Moses Deff do not do much beyond their character's skills, but they all nail those parts. Steatham as a smooth operating driver; Green as a tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder; And defolish people as well as def. Charlize Theron slides into a part that does not ask too much of her. He is initially asked to fast drive and look good. She does that. No character is deep or three-dimensional, but there are two dimensions in this known type of movie which is needed. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the film's European feeling, it is a "The Bourne Identity", because it was shot as part of Venice with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Contributing to the euro flair is also a lithic, bounce music, which adds to the nature of Flick's enthusiasm and complements the cast. The look of the movie is also a perfect match. Improve the mood of all locals and add attitude. Minis not only provide a fun change to car charging, but also acts as a necessary plot device. <br /> <br /> The plot is less or less. There are some surprises, but unlike Drop-Your-Jaw Hairpin curves, they are more quick and smooth-like varieties. Even with those, motion alongside the movie. Once the foundation is laid by the first work, everything progresses constantly. Fortunately there is no break for romance, the film is wisely avoiding. 'There is no break even for real life'. The story has its purpose and runs that certainly without distractions. The lack of character defines "The Italian job" more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the hasest planning, these mysteries can drag the flicker's speed and quality. <br /> <br /> There are so many possibilities that I saw and looked after both. But the movie is so enjoyable that I do not care. In the real world, most of the films probably could not clearly go away. But "Italian Jobs" does not take place in the real world. It happens in a stylish and light-hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebels among us. <br /> <br /> "In fact" Italian job "is a movie, there is no evidence of Oscar, and there is no deep moral message in it, it offers pure escapism entertainment and is so good. Bottom Line: Probably the year's best popcorn movie. 10 of 7.
