I do not see why everyone is giving negative reviews of this picture?!? I like this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you do not appreciate the art, I can see why you like this picture. It was a great twist from the average, played vampire movie. If you are looking for a fresh, new and impressive new Vampire movie, then this is for you. But if you want one of them melting in bat, wolf and sunlight movies, then check out your old Dakula flickr. Sure, it's a little bit of budget, but they did a great job with their budget. I'm very happy that I found this movie, because I was about to leave the good vampire style. I was shining this picture! I'm up to 2 thumbs up everybody involved in the author, director and film.
