This mockery really is really, really dead, and nobody is protected. Although the film is a lot of humorous and brilliant imitation of Hitler (here shiny is named "Hinkel" and a ridiculous type of pseudo-German), but the common sound is the movie's place in a tragic history. And the actors even guess I'm not that too much too much. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the last statement of the Jewish sailor, if only things can end in that way. This is not really about the character, Chaplin is saying something that he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, then the film does not look like a date or an old, it actually comes at a pretty nice pace. And the humorous humor found throughout this work will never die, the only thing that I do not care about is slipping, but it comes with the era that I think. This is an incredibly brave, hard work on fascism, it has been so hard for so many years now.
