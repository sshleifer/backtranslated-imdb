Honor's price is an inelegant price, with an ambitious Western Melodyram, in light of action, which calls for an Old West version of JF murder. In 1881 the President traveled to Dallas and fired from a window crossing the city in his car. Corrupt officials have murdered and raped a humble slave. Our hero, sincere, but blue gaeliyano jimma, aims to unravel the conspiracy. An engaging story, indecent for its subject, but despite the lack of shoot-up action, entertaining. Despite the poor rendering of the DVD, the film is 7 out of 10, which is equal to the poorest darkness. Search for a good copy.
