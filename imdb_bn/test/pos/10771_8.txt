Soni Chiba, everyone knows, man In this film, he was Oyama (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought 50 calves with his bare hands? And won (interesting guy ??) to see him However, Chiba only kills a calf in the film, but it is a memorable scene and a liner note says that the zombie vs. hobby scene is right with Jumpy! The film offers a suitable plot for hand-to-hand battle loads and boots, although I do not believe it is all true. This picture is recommended for fans of Wama Trilji Chibber's first and martial arts crews. Finally, three tasty little tidbits; The opening theme is used on Bill Bill Volume 1, Wama is shown on its own front and because of that he trained Cheema for five years!
