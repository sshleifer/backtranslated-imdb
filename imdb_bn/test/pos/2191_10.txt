I've seen this version almost a decade ago, and since then I've been looking for it. I recently found an original VHS version, and it bought for $ 125.00. It sounds crazy, but if you like me it is considered the best of the Broadway musical stage, you can not even think twice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Today <br /> <br /> <br /> Today a Broadway ticket. I hope they will republish it on DVD form soon. It is a piece of musical theater that screams!
