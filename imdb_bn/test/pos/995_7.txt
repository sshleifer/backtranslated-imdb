Kail Knightley and Siena Miller Dylan acted in the story of two women in Thomas' life. Knightley's boyfriend's boyfriend faces again in Blitz. They meet at a time of reconnection, but when Thomas arrives with his wife (Miller) he will meet with him later. Women stop it and things move quickly, until the three will become the husband of the nightline. It makes it even more complicated that jealousy starts showing his face. <br /> <br /> Beautiful looking, uncommonly written and surprisingly played (everyone completely disappears in their role). It is a glorious festival for eyes and ears. It is very nice to see a movie about adult adults. Completely on the Visceral level I really enjoy watching the film because this movie is as fun as the artist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some were missing and some times I had to run the film again to see if I missed something. This is not bad, but the result is not entirely satisfactory. (I tried to watch the line to see how true the film is, but I can not find anything) I still think it is a movie watching. This is probably a beautiful film for adults with the best acting of adults.
