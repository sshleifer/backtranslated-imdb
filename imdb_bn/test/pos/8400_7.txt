These miniseries are a reasonable sequel of the original with the wind. If someone looks at their qualifications (and does not follow the original immediately) it's pretty good. I'm sure most viewers will question Scarlett and Rite's performance, but others do not seem to be doing well. Here many characters are new in this story, so compared to that, (Ritch's mother, cousin Henry Hamilton, Will Bentin) is not a problem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> See it for alone. Obviously, it was a high-budget TV miniseries. It follows for a while, when Scarlett goes to Ireland, there is a whole new plot. <br /> <br /> The acting is not credible if there is nothing special - for Roger Moore, I follow Shan Connie James Bond.
