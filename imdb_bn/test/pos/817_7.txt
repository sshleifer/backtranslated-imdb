When I first saw this movie, Quintin Tarantino showed us a bunch of Austin's Alamo Drafthaus. He wondered how frightening he was and how funny he was and he considered it frustrating in relation to his interpretation. I can see how it will be harmful to some viewers, and the issue is not funny, but there are at least three lines of film that seems to smile so laughing at me. They do not come up to half point, but when they are, O God ... you will die. Oh and Jim Brown Bright. He does not have a lot of movies, but when he is there, you know who movie it is. Naturally, the best line of movie (and funny) is its; You will know it when you hear it.
