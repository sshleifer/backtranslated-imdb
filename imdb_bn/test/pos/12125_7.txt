I've never seen all the Mafia films that are the best for many reasons. Acting from Pesci, Curtis and Vincent. The story is one of the best (in mafia style), it's realistic. Characters are people that can relate to a lot of people. This dialogue is good as well as this movie. It has very realistic fights and action scenes. This movie also introduced Passi and Vincent's career. If it is not for the success of this movie, then the casino and goodflays were not as good as they were. <br /> <br /> Story Story 10 Acting 9/10 Reality 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My Mafia Mafia Pictures: 1: GoodFellus 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: Family Informer (Death Collector) 5: Doporas (I know it's not a movie)
