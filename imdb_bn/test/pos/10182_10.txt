The sea will put my strength in it as I entered this series. Although it started slowly, I saw that the ship was describing, the variety of characters and the lively dialogue was watching me. The drama wanted to challenge, grow and change this journey and I would like to stay there for him. I was not frustrated. This series brings tragedy to humor and occasionally moves the same breath of breathlessness. There was a wealth of emotional overlaying, interaction and expression - relentless and forced to obey. The movement of the ship often adds fantasy elements to many scenes, the letters get sick one moment and later add humor. <br /> <br /> Admand Talbow is a complex character, we often see what we do not like. The captain is standing or Mr. Primateman we know, but they are older men, set in their way. Talbot is young and arrogant, still learning, examining himself and being tested. He struggled to meet with others and made a mistake as a real person but could touch the heart, which grew with every hard-educated experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; It is very rare in movies and television.
