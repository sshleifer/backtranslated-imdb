This movie packs a punch. Now a few and then that makes me think deeply, and bothers me a lot. I could see myself in the same situation - let things happen around me, standing for right and decent things, just trying to avoid trouble. How often do we avoid creating waves or sticking to our throat? Our inertia often does not condone the actions of others. We never join them, we say to ourselves, we know what they are doing, but do we do something for it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Messi) closed his house in Brooklyn, NY, on the terrible days of World War II. He rarely engages in what is happening around him, never married, rarely works socially, just goes to work and takes care of his illegal mother. Then a series of events surrounding his "white" little neighborhood left him with his ample shell in an episode of the event. The meeting of his bedroom window began when he was raped by his neighbor's son Puerto Rican girl. He got glasses due to poor outlook. She is better to see now, she can not cope with the circumstances of her life. A bright spot is a new love for her life, and she hopes to continue in her normal state, marriage. Then, on the street, the anti-Semitism was taken away by him despite his credentials like Presbyterian Wasp. Since things are more straightforward beyond control, they discover that they must make an important decision - whether they stand or they can easily go away. <br /> <br /> How can I see this movie affecting and not affecting? Many think about themselves and what they really stand for. Anti-war anti-violence settings here, but always and there is injustice everywhere. This is where he stands for the person to decide.
