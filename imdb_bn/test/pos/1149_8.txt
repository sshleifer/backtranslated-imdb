At the beginning of the twentieth century, Europeans and Americans were completely attacked in Morocco, the leader of Morocco kidnapped Abdul Mohammed El Raasuli Mahat (Shan Connery), his son and his daughter, American Iden Pedekaris (Candice Bergen). For their fight against Moroccan's corrupt Sultan (Mark Zubar), some money and rifle ransom for their purpose. During the election, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agreed on the proposal. However, Russia was betrayed and Eden helped him get out of prison with American soldiers. I do not like movies about the lack of respect for the colonialism and the sovereignty of other countries, but 'lion and wind' are really a great adventure. The action scene is very realistic The most beautiful American actress in the 1970s, Candice Bergen has been acting as a kidnapper with extraordinary, extraordinary film 'Solarie Blue'. Shan Connery is perfect, as a honest and nationalist religious leader, normal. Brian Keith is great as American President. I do not know much about Morocco's history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this film is an appropriate entertainment. It is only available in VHS in Brazil. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Vento E and Leo' ('Lion and Wind') <br /> <br /> <br />
