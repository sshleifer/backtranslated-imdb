This movie is a great antagonism of action and comedy, it gets right from the beginning, there is no annoying build up. The leading role adds cheerlessness to excitement and enthusiasm, though my doubts were not satisfied. Special effects were brilliantly working and trustworthy! There would be a different end choice but it was still covered in emotions to me. The story line is well-received, but it is a complete film that you can carefully watch from the end, to know all the details, to fully understand and enjoy the maximum. <br /> <br />
