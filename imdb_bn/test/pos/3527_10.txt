This completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made. Too dark it reminds me of a "distribute" of a small famous thriller. Director Jeff Lieberman created a terrifying environment of fear and frustration. All actors are good and Claymax is really exciting and memorable. So if you are looking for something vague, then try to find out this small treasure. My personal rating: 10 out of 10 It's cooler than Halloween.
