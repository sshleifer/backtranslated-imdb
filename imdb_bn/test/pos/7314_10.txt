The Three Stugges I always liked that many actors. I love every one of the shorts that I just love about. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shang, More, Larry, Joe, and Carlie Joe)! Shorts were all colorful and also many other great actors and actresses star in which they were shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stoges is the greatest actor of all time and the most fun comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> One of the hottest three stigmas shorts is black men. Bid Jamison, Jenny Roberts, Phillips Crane, Dale Henderson, 'Little Billy' Rhodes, Billy Gilbert, and Ruth Hayat are all acting in this short film, especially Jasmine and Roberts. There are so many fun scenes that I think most of the three stugs fans will love! My opinion is one of the most important of these three Stooges shorts. I recommend one of these!
