Last night I saw again this morning - which I liked it. There is something about this movie ... When the movie was almost finished, I started crying. I strongly recommend "delayed days" to my friends - it's definitely worth watching! I agree with them that some parts of the movie are not very realistic. For example, both main characters are perfectly intelligent and perfect physical shape (though there is also a shape of round shape :)). I rarely meet such a single person and I have never met a couple. Other parts of the film, including "coincidences", are not too realistic. However, after all it is not a movie, a life story.
