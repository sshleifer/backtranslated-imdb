I love this movie !! I love it because of Madonna but who carries it - it's great! * ALANIS ROC *. When I first saw this photo in the theater in 1987, I thought it was all fun! Madonna is so funny and I look at her double utterance and muddy / fanny. The most fun part of all time when Madonna (Nikki) shouted to a man who was going to a taxi. And when Grafin Dunne (Luden) travels and falls into an interview with an apartment. ** ALANIS ROCK **. Madonna's character Nicky steals / loots people across the whole and makes people fool-friendly - its trolling antics are enough to keep the floor in full time. "Note not loot", when you loot a store, you keep the cashier stuck. We've shed some tape, there is a slight difference, "I love it !!! It's classic. *** ALANIS ROOT ***. I do not know why this movie has been slammed in such a way. I can not see anything wrong with it - of course A great Madonna fan, but what he does is just awesome. Anyone who wants to see something funny, after the classic entertainment, "Who is that girl?" And another very important B Second, all of which should be known to all men, or at least, until the end of ALANIS always "rock YA" that would be! So madona this film, and just completely! Her acting is superb!
