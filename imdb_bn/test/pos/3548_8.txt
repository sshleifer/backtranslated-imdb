10 honored directors each shot a small film with arias operating as inspiration (and music). I will do each separately: <br /> <br /> Nicholas Disease (DIR) - Zeusap Vardi (Music). 1931 A story about a killing attempt in Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roose's Wife) plays a man! Not bad - Very nice and exotic. Russell is great. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturries - Vardi. There are no stories, but some hunting black and white images that perfectly fit the music. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luche Garde - Jan Baptist Lily. Horrible Futile, annoying, no plot, nothing. Faux female filled with nudity. worst! <br /> <br /> Julian Temple - Vardi. Baker Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris star in this funny, if obvious, story about a cheating couple. Very good <br /> <br /> Bruce Beersford - Irich KournGold. Short, lovely and romantic Very good <br /> <br /> Robert Olman - Gene-Philippe Ramau. Dull A yawner <br /> <br /> Fred Roddam - Richard Wagner In his film debut this is Bridget Fonda. Naughty love story with a fairly explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> Kain Russell - Giacomo Pookini It's really weird but okay. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustav Chapantier Voice and voice in old age. Very sweet <br /> <br /> The end is Bill Brighten doing "i go crazy" He wore John Hart (!) Karuzo (!!!) as a clown lip-sync. <br /> <br /> When it came, it got about X ratings (for lots of nudity and sexual scenes). It was given an R with a strict caution that the R rating would be widely applied. The image disappeared after the bomb blasts. <br /> <br /> The idea was not bad and 6 out of 10 parts were suitable. Valuable to see even if you do not like opera. Just avoid garden segments. I'm giving it 8.
