I just saw it twice and with all my heart, I must say that they made a movie about us, like people are not as spiritual beings. Like this story, this waste of human life probably will be a little better. And Eric is warmer than before. In films, people of the first generation are often seen as being different from everyday people. We are always pictured as the main or medicine man. Hey we just like everyone else. And this movie just showed that. If we do injustice, we can beat and we can win the search for justice. It is really bad that big movie companies can not see. I can not wait until the DVD comes out. Thanks to those who really chose to show this story as it was.
