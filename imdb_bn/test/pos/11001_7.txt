I enjoyed watching squire Trelane flock watching near this episode crew, although after a while the whole thing just takes a little longer. Of course, histrionics was fun for some time, and the end was a fantastic way to wrap the whole thing together. I think the problem was that I was happy to see Trollen when he was awful and funny, when the trollen became terrible and nasty, the fun became extinct. Talk about a mood killer - going from an innocent but respectful host to sending Kirk to death! But, despite this, the episode was enjoyable and my time was valuable. For die-hard Trekkies, it will certainly see, for others it's just a beautiful run of mill one.
