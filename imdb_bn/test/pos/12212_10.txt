When I started watching "Surface" for the first time, I was stunned. I had a great cast of shows, shows, actions, mysteries, great intrigues and characters. My whole family liked watching the show. It seems like when a great show is seen on TV, they usually think of this show by canceling the network. They go through the Nielsen rating system which I think is stupid because there are so many junk that they can see how the networks are running wind. If there is only one way to vote in the show then the good show will not be canceled. When I now watch TV, I only see the best show so that the whole TV is not watching now. I hope the network will bring shocking but when they look at mind with a stupid decision, they keep it confined. I hope there are many people who feel the same way.
