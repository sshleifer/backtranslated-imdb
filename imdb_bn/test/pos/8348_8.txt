I often like this movie as the original version! The teenager does not go through the scam; Want to find freedom from your family far more? The songs were beautiful and the characters' designs were great. Lady and the trump saw almost the same way they did the main way. They did a good job both of their voices, even the original voice actor is probably dead. However, I think they should give them more lines to Lady, Anne, Colette and Daniel. Oh well, at least they had a general idea to keep the same scenery from the original movie.
