I just saw this film in a advanced screening. I did not read the book, I did not know the story, but the book was selected as "Book of the Year" by two local colleges. So I can not compare the movie with another book. <br /> <br /> As a child, I thought it was an incredibly moving story. The acting was credible, and insight of Afghan culture and political history was both attractive and casual. My oldest friend is Iranian-American, and so I feel a sense of value and tradition for some Middle East, which was portrayed in the film, because they reminded me to spend time with her family. <br /> <br /> Friendship, family, human values, and courage under fire are universal, and well-developed in movies. I will not list the details of the plot, because it can be found elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of the film, acting, and above all, his heart-twisting story, I would definitely recommend this movie.
