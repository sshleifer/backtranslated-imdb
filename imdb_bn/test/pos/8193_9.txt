Emperor and killer (w / english subtitles) is long in 161 minutes, but the time is packed with a story that rarely fits it. The golden color palace scenes of the Chinese landscape and the yellow ponorum with dust, about 300 BCE, is a true story about the single king of China. A fantastic plot with an extraordinary twists and turns is played with excellent illustration. The general desire of a united empire for the general public of King Kinnis has been fulfilled, but betrayal, plots and counter plots and yes yes, not without the companies. Plenty of body This epic story at the beginning of China is a great way to see the little known Asian history of the West. There are thousands of life-size terracotta images which are still being excavated in the legacy of Emperor Kinney. As a historical person, this film makes it clear that Emperor Kinnah should be named after George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Chingis Khan and Julius Caesar, the world's biggest winner / President. I highly recommend seeing the Emperor and the Killer, especially on the big screen.
