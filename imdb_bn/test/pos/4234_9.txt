I once commented on this Shiny Mahanat, but to say something about the film, I had to do it again, when I first saw it in a great ballet in a great theater. In the movie theater and in my theater there was a lot of fun in the first movie, and it was a special moment for me, because I love shoki. Other horror villains are referenced with great trick !!! And the cow was wonderful! The scene where the gay baby nailed the truck nailed! That was a great night watch !!!!! And the end was so weird and frustrating that it made me *% @ of my pants. The idea of ​​having a chaky seed is very strange and surprising! When I left the theater I just loved it and I could believe it was not true. This child's play installment's bizarre and different attributes marked me as a reason because Jayson's child's play series Hell-to-Hell It's just that strong, malicious and different standards that Jason had reminded me of hell. Confirm ***** *****. Here's how I will rank the series: 1,4,2,3 I like it but Tom Holland's real child play is not like the classic. Can not wait for the chakari seeds! Bring it!
