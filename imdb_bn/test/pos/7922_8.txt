(Warning: spoilers! - Even though it is difficult to spoil the film by describing storytelling.) <br /> <br /> Eizenstein's black and white campaign is not for everyone. It's too old and it's, er, weird. It makes great for me soundtracks, not original but updated soundtracks. Even better, the orchestral version has made Prokofiev (my favorite performance is the Freezer Riner and the Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> The picture is really fun. It's memorable of the old "Midsummer Night Dream". Some of the outdoor scenes are quite pretty. Some of the actors are pretty fantastic (The actor who played Nevsky could be a superstar today.) Ditto, Vasilisa - a rock definitely for the warrior dog.) <br /> <br /> This is the best collection in the world, on Russian, Russian words (they have tons of them - they are spoken Creates a large part of the line). <br /> <br /> War scenes are actually much more realistic than most high-budget Hollywood flicks. These boys are as humble with their war as real farmer. The arms look nasty, so the actors are probably trying to avoid harming each other. <br /> <br /> Playing German "Grand Marshal" is really trying to see scary scary in the film *, but he really looks like a pussycat. He caught * so * looks kindly. (The volume of the intended audience says, d?) <br /> <br /> A ridiculous touch that the German army brings with it an * organ *, it acts as a black-colored character. The Russians bring this guy down * when he is playing <br /> <br /> When the war ended, almost all the German died, the best part of the film (and music), sung by the dead soldiers who sang the motherland. This part is so tragic that it is almost an anti-war statement. <br /> <br /> This image has been identified as ten times as men for women. Why wonder? <br /> <br /> WARNING: Joseph Stalin liked this picture. Lasting - he killed Russians than anyone else. "Those who bring the sword into Russia will die by the sword".
