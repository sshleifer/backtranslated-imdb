The more I see this film, the more they see what they saw like young people. It was one of those movies that the Home Box Office showed on my youth the other day. This film is lodged forever in my brain. If anyone does not grow around this film, you can get damaged by the ADD cycle in the mid-90's and it can become more difficult to grasp this mind. Quiet, I saw my whistle "better than death" Before I died I saw this (in which I raped and loved) - and no one, nobody in the 80's can embrace painful teenage teens in American movies - all this We gave birth, which we got tedious in teen comedy ... Slow Md, all the extra uses of the current soundtrack, new technologyI wonder if the movie will go back to this roots ... this comedy comedy ... yes!
