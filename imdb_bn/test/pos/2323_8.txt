I saw the movie in the theater of his liberation, then saw VHS tapes in years, and when this target was targeted, this DVD was bundled with an additional amount of $ 5.50 with "Pushing Tin". /> <br /> That's really something about this comedy <br I clicked with - how "kelase Grammar" with a tattoo on his thing, an overwhelming commander who received a rusty diesel sub and crew skrubala and maphitera. He rose against the best of the Navy - the Los Angeles class nuclear attack sub-and his old captain (WM Messi). /> <br /> Dirty bad man played by Bruce <br, rip Admiralty exercise progress - with a dog if you do not "run silent" during the segment violently Do not laugh, well, you are from a different kind of humor. /> <br /> In the end, the machine will be <br "dibiepha" without any explanation - it is derived from an old submarine consultant internal knowledge - thanks to Google I know that with the advent of nuclear subscribing old labanaguli "dibiepha" PINs - diesel boats forever wear . <br /> <br /> A naval friend said that many technical aspects are not right, but who cares about them - this is the most interesting movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is a clearer to know who will win this exercise!
