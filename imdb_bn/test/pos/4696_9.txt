This is my favorite series, all the categories, all the time. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to keep the entire series in VHS a few years ago. When I saw it, I like it - in 91-29, when I was 12 years old. As much as I love today or more, considering today's optimistic filmmaking and critical thinking skills, it is remarkable. Most of the movies I liked again, but I do not like this in addition to today's Notealjia Factor. The fact that is also present here, but Robin Robin has more than Nostalgieire. <br /> <br /> There are some bad things about this series. First of all, the first few of the episodes of the image and the sound quality at the very least. Fortunately, it gets better. Second, in combat scenes, you could have wanted more blood and realities, although I know that there was no alternative in this case. <br /> <br /> So good things! And there are a lot of them. First of all, Michael Praed IS Robin Hood. Yet I saw him in a single role, which only strengthens this truth for me. He delivers a credible performance like Robin. Jason Connery was an impossible task to replace him. The fact that Michael Praed does not become a big name as the actor is unbelievable. Or perhaps his fate, to make this role perfectly, then disappeared. <br /> <br /> I love Nicholas Gilles Sheriff of Nottingham. He is not really a complex character, but completely rotten. The relationship between him and Gisborne is just ridiculous. Indeed, just sitting on his throne, looking at Rennol, brilliant, shining, he laughs even before telling me something. The other actor who deserves extra praise is Ray Winston as Will Scarlett. You can feel sad inside him and at the same time feel his hatred towards the soldiers who killed his wife. Winston is an actor who has finally achieved success in Hollywood (provincial and boutiful). There are many other big actors here. <br /> <br /> I love Robin Gang's screenplay. They are having fun, playing, laughing, you've really got a feeling of cameraderie among them, the closure that comes from such close groups. <br /> <br /> I think it's really good to be produced with British actors in the UK, for example - the film version of Kevin Castner-29, which is just fake, fake, fake. (Christian Slaughter Will Scarlett, Come ..) The ability to speak English with British stories makes Cast makes more credible and I feel that the actor, director, and author can keep himself behind the series Robin Hood has much more to do with the American crew May The music is wonderful, perfect for the feeling of the Clannad series. Music is just one of the things that they just nailed. <br /> <br /> There is an exciting addition to imagination and magic torch. It's not up to the top, but trustworthy and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting. Comedy, adventure and drama mix how beautiful I love. <br /> <br /> Some of those who make this series so genuine and so genuine are few. It's the best Robin Hood version until I've ever seen it. I will not wrap it with the "nothing forgotten" quote But one thing that will not be forgotten, for me, this fantastic Robin Hood Retelling. See it.
