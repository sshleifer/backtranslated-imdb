I do not know what Dick Steele was talking about, but I think this movie is one of Japan's most exciting epics. Tomorrow's day is relatively pale for Armageddon or deep impact, or about that. For what I know about movies, most of the disasters in movies are basically akin to Asteroid Flicks or Global Warming. This is how a different course ran. Naturally, a method where the collapse of the Earth is destroyed by such degrees, it takes another place with it for the journey. The scientific teams had to do what they had to do to stop the damage and stop the Japanese from drowning. In most cases it will be called tectonic transfer only in steroids. I have found a letter that lost the child to her mother, which could face her death among strangers. Or the rescue worker can save lives in the face of disaster. Or a man who thought that he could change his mind like not being a brave devil and go with him safely, only protect himself from the country as a hero. And do not forget that just forgetting how the rest of the world has forgotten, Japanese citizens are crying for their help, who are pursuing them. It was a great movie in all aspects. Dick is trying to say that this movie was not Hollywood, it was made in Japan, it was the character that competed with other actors in the world, since the effects they mention were very good, but for that he is waiting, and nothing else. He has a lack of vision and why everyone was feeling the feeling, glory, and humanity of this feeling. I had the top rate of this image, and I saw that many disaster movies in Japan are probably one of the most original and best thought projects I've ever seen. I really hope Shinji Higuchi will make such a film other. Oh and anyway, I'm not Japanese, although in many ways I want to. I am Canadian, born and raised. And buff a strange movie in all directions Predjudicial aspect is not worth the effort to be accepted as bitter and opinion. Dick, you should see it with a more open heart and mind, do not look for surveillance that only creates a movie content, discover what is more important and understand it. They may not be American, but the Japanese are still moving forward towards the market to breathe mostly and create the right-handmade film. Why the doctor's order is worth 25,000,000 rupees. You heard 25,000,000 people to make this movie. Now you tell me, what was it worth? Was the American actor or was it valuable?
