Knight of the Demon (1988) video and "Tin", released on Pay-TV, is one of the long lines of horror films. During the Mecca movie, eighty-eight But unlike most of the bounds, it was actually a modest clock. The annoying "Teenage" group decides to make a Halloween night party with a pair of infamous hul house, a wicked sister (Mimi Kikkad and Linna Quigley). Your initial youth are invited to the general custom party. But when they decided to break the party of the residents of the Hello House, when they tried to survive Halloween night, an average teenage bash turned into terror night. Who will survive this bloody and deadly night? <br /> <br /> A great horror movie that is best viewed in an unknown version. If you see a R-rated cut, you will miss all Splatter effects and nudity. Stay tune for fun epilogue! A poor film that was followed in a trance recreational sequel. Awful fans only for! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
