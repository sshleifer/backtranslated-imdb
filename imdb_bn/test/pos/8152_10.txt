For an independent film, it reasonably scores well with high production standards and a great cast. Acting is outstanding but plot is mandatory. We could have used a bit more development of Wes Ramsey's character, but hey, the fun of the man! Mary Kay Place and Jacqueline Bissett are like icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> It is no surprise that the release was controversial. It is an impressive illustration of Mormon Church and less than a relationship with her. Like the Brokeback Mountain, it seems to be tolerant and accepting your own life, it is more successful in sending a positive message. It was moving too much.
