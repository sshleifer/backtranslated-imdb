If the family bothers you or you just do not get laughing, unfortunately this show is celebrating your religious, neutral, and politically correct people in America. So keep aside your morality and have fun with this show. The reality of today's society is FG open a ridiculous mind. Anyone saying this show is very wrong for a young stranger. With all the references of old movies and politics over 10-80 years ago, I could not imagine any unfamiliar child of this funny finding. The Family Guy is definitely not afraid to criticize the American society for those who are a mature open-minded audience. Sheth and the whole crew who are able to create this show hats off
