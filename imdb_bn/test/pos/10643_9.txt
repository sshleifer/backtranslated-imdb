After reading a biography at the last Russian Tunker (Nicholas II) and failing to protect the military support, I decided to try this picture. <br /> <br /> I saw it completely open mind, or to know something about it (except for its fame). <br /> <br /> These things have affected me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) Battlefield shots, and soldiers used as spare. One time I stopped thinking, "If this work was done at this time and place, 80% of it had become computer-generated." <br /> <br /> 2) Reality in it. From the harmful meat with the title "killing for a bowl" with his candle and sailor, this movie does not give any discounts due to PC (which, thank you, has not been discovered yet). <br /> <br /> 3) Slow descendants in the growing madness of the Odessa step. From the first shot, when limbless people appear, you might be mistaken for some of the ideas; Although overall shots are composed, you feel comfortable surrounding you. Then an amputee appears, and people start reading into the dramatic poses. Yet, the shots are composed ... until Cossacks appear in the scene, and incredible shots appear in juxtapositions. This view is easily worth the cost of admission. <br /> <br /> 4) This movie is 100% incomplete campaign. Then again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan, he had to do something with "campaign"; Just a different kind. <br /> <br /> Overall: A gradual image of a gradual. Yet, the metropolis, Dr. Kaligari's cabinet and this film is a perfect example of innovative, intense movies that are still remembered for their eligibility. They really look boring and repeat in modern cinema.
