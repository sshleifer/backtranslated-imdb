The last film was a dream to give an animated and annoying look of what was probably unlike the originality. In that movie, you did not see the madness, you were there. Now the cell comes with an updated and more annoying screenplay in the mind of a psychic killer. The opening scene brings you a seemingly silly mind of a combole little boy and the things that Catherine Dane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are the first interesting and then awesome. Vincent D'Ophriyo (Vincent D'Ophriyo), the things that he later saw, are amazingly fantastic and interesting, before most of the stuff has never been seen before the movie. <br /> <br /> The Cell Of The Cell is really groundbreaking that's not exactly anything. In fact, it's basically the same as silent stories of Lambs. There is a murderer in your custody and these people will have to enter their mind in search of a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the grounds of the plot is that in Lamb's silence you will find a current killer as well as his current victim, while in the cell you must enter his own victim's quest to find a victim. However, despite the unfortunate weak stories, The Cell revolutionizes the entire psychological thriller style. Anyone has ever made it even closer to come around. Also, the film was in good direction and was played very well. Vince Von has provided one of his most striking performances (he was also good as a Norman Bates in Seiko in 1998) and even Jennifer Lopez talked about his second best effort in career (the other is great from sight). The cell is not enough to give enough credit for cinemagraphy, it's fantastic and impressively accomplished and it's great to see anything in film history. Cell is an incredibly well-built film, and it is worthy of being recognized.
