One day I used to catch it on television when I was young and I liked it. In the 1970s, Lum was a bunch of comedies who tried very hard to be funny so it was a wonderful surprise. This is one of the best comedies of the 1970s and thanks to the extraordinary comedic performance of the summer camp's Comedy Mourari, which still stands as its greatest. This film was indeed considered as the director of Ian Retman. Reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. Although the film is ridiculous and the Matballs 2 is so bad that it's fun, Matballs 3 and Matballs 4 are horrible. Recommended for those who enjoyed Strip and GHostBUSTERS.
