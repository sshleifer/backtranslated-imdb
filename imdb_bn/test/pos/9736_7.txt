I saw this series when I saw the baby Rogers, saw both characters played in the same barber crab and I must admit that these movies are always part of my best entertainment. Fighting against Emperor Minge was one thing, but I was curious to know about the last fate of Flash Triangle with Flash Dial and Aura. Barin came and inspired Ara to forget the flash, his merciless end to cruelty for a beautiful face flush. Serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be seen by all the audience. Another thing is that I learned how to flush the water in the crab while fighting against shark men. Although used in another film by Buddhist Karl's Frankenstein, the soundtrack was also excellent. It will be great if this serial DVD is available with Spanish subtitles (not available yet).
