Fatah Morgan is an absolute best composition. This is the most extraordinary movie of Warner Herzeg This is not a plot or story. Instead of a story, we have collected images, sounds and music that work together together. This is not a documentary. Some people in this movie are guided and read the line. It has some of the most beautiful and hunting images. Harjog shoots real migs and we see because we are in the middle of the desert who are not really there, but hundreds of miles away are reflected in the mirror as well. Music is so bright in this movie - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart and Third Year Band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space ODC in the Desert; That's what's like this movie This image is so hysterical that your soul has the power to think of releasing your body. A must see. It will change the way you watch movies. Ratings: 10 out of 10
