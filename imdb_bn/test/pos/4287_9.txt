Now this kind of picture we used to get weekly. It is rare to see a play that relies on talking to each other today. <br /> <br /> There is no explosion, car driving or any shock, sexual orientation. It is not for small crowds, for those who appreciate talking with each other, they married many because of middle-class problems with the couple. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are probably happy middle-aged loving people & wives. Now Sunder, living in the suburbs of this little London suburb, Rupert Everett returned home to his wealthy father. <br /> <br /> She meets Emily Watson, who can kill Emily. I do not say anything else, before the credit starts, there is a fatal accident, the rest of the picture is lying about the reaction of the accident and all the lies that lie. <br /> <br /> Performing these three and others is excellent. <br /> <br /> Julian Fellow wrote the script based on Nigel Balchin's novel. He ordered, it was his first director's efforts and he did very well. The whole production is first rate <br /> <br /> In the end of 2005, the film ran a few months theater, under 80 theaters. It is shameful to me, at least 2000 screens are stupidly curious, but some of the best plays are open to them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " *** 1/2 (out 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
