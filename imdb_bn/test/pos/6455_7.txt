Water Warner's first film was clearly patterned after the first gangster film of Little Cesar (1931) and The Public Anime (1931), this gangster film was one of the best efforts I've seen. Although not in the same league as the earlier mentioned classics, the young Sylvia Sydney has made a strong performance by it. That is great and its line probably makes it more natural than any person at times. Gary Cooper shows the signs of what will follow the next few years when he gets a normal career and top of this level. Paul Lucas has some interesting villains on this movie (he never seen this disgusting) and Guy Kebbi (shock seeing what his threat looks like). Rowne Mumulian's side is very inventive, probably the person's first voice-over-the-minded look in this movie. If you get the chance to see this little gangster flick, do not let the opportunity go.
