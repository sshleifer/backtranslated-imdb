As a European, as a student of the 1980's and my experience lived abroad and interacted with other nationalities as well as my time was a nice thrill, although the situation was slightly different. Clipis (Director) went to New York Film School from 1982-85, so someone would think that he was drawing on this experience. <br /> <br /> This is a fun fact about how the film adjusts to the message "Do not do generalization" with the concept "for each stereotype, some underlying truth". For example, the Italian character is based on the size of the head compared to any well-known Italian stereotype. The German character shows more striving and tested stereotype features. But the most stereotypical aspect about the film is not a character but the key to unbelief. Critics can be seen that, as a British film class, unfaithfulness is very important for French movies. <br /> <br /> The main character and his girlfriend are both acting as a favorite, which I think is deliberate and great. <<br /> <br /> It may be unknown, but some people have elements that can be adopted as a metaphor for the role of their countries in the EU. The British woman was an American (who was an American American) - when the French saw herself as a natural leader (when the landlord shows). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is diverse like New York, it is shocking that we only see two non-white characters. A Chilean woman, who is accompanied by indigenous traits, despite the age of our protagonists, is not portrayed as a possible subject of interest. Another Gambian-Spanish or Gambian-Catalan man, who invented a little. Anyone can ask why Clapische chose the leaders of the long-established European Union member states of western Europe. Although these nationalities met with students in the 1980s, which show, I think contemporary Europe's exchange programs are more diverse. The Erasmus program includes about 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not EU members. But I understand that the choice of citizens more than the majority of viewers may not be considered that the populace wants to create people in Europe and bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> A small film from a small mobile phone that seems to me to return to Europe. A foreign friend of America, who was also a resident in the United States, kept our feelings of fate in this part of the conflict, "If Europe was more than the United States, I would be frustrated".
