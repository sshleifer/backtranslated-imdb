This movie is probably the most fun I've ever seen, and it does not have the most redeeming value. In fact, it's really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot. However, this "make-up-up-a-go-ho-hog" attitude actually works on the film's benefits. "Tommy Boy" has succeeded as a comedy for the same reason that SNL played successfully in Farley and Spade: The hospitality and greatness of their good timing makes them laughable despite their immaturity.
