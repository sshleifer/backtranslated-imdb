Despite its very low budget, "Soto Nul" is the most successful Portuguese movie of 2004. And I must say, successfully successful success. What I like about "Soto Nula" is the most complex thing that Fernando Fragta is going to be interested in keeping you going and what will happen next. This is a very simple love-story-gone-bad-thriller, very detailed and nicely developed. More enjoyable and satirical about this fact is that the characters are in the same position, not one of them knows the whole story and left the "Soto Nul" on everyone else in their own concepts. This is certainly not a movie that you want to take to the bathroom break, but you will definitely miss something important. I think that the main feature of the movie is to be an established environment. It's monotonous but it's sunny at the same time I quoted this picture somewhere, "... it was like watching the hitkko ..." and I could not agree again !! I like movies where you have to pay attention to everything to understand where everything is going on. 9/10
