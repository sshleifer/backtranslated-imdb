David Attenbaar has attracted his wild life, at this time under the sea, all the animals travel under the ocean of this extraordinary 8th episode! <br /> <br /> Cinematography is amazing, those whales really exciting to bring to the screen! But the good thing about it, as well as watching each episode, how they made it! It creates animal models, or impressive shots of whales, explains how they did it in about 10 minutes! <br /> <br /> 2001's screen had some great TV shows. But, unlike this documentary, they make their beautiful hair! However, to make this documentary series proud as the best TV series of 2001, this series does not enrich the brightness by providing quality entertainment! <br /> <br /> This is the best TV series of 2001. No contest, and, perhaps, the best TV series of 2000!
