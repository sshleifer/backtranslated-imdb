This is my favorite one of all time. Not all actors do a great job. Compared to this film "Arab Lawrence" does not judge both films. "Wind and Lion" is a very low budget level with superb actors portraying hearty characters in an impressive environment. Action and beautiful pictures are provided as well, all of which guarantee a favorite movie to me together.
