A really scary film. The crew of Karmuzen Zucker Crosstor has led me to web expanded web logos with Life Father the Oil Crash (LATOC), Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum, and recently Hubert's Pick Theory. Like this picture, LATOC and Kunstler paint a deadly picture of die-off or die-back. I hope they are premature, but by the middle of 2005, oil prices have been rising, oil prices are rising, Chevron's will will join us in the promotion, BPL is becoming out of petroleum and even T. Bowen believes that the idea is to produce near or near the top . <br /> <br /> After extensive research of limited information, oil investment banker Matt Simmons has proposed that the Saudis will not be able to increase their production for countless, but old age. In the face of increased demand (primarily from the United States and China), the Saudis did not respond to higher production despite the previous assurance. Global production published since 2000 and 2004 indicates that light, sweet crude is actually the top. Which means refinement will become more expensive. <br /> <br /> The image is targeted by baby boomers, but young people, our children also understand the impact of a power-depleting future.
