There are some things in life that we can not experience more than once and the college experience is one among them. Especially if we are in a foreign country and we live in an apartment with 6 vacations in 6 different countries. Javier's main character leaves his disciplined life in Paris, his former Hippie mother and his beautiful girlfriend and went to Barcelona to read the Spanish language to get jobs at the embassy. She fell in love with a French doctor's wife and made friends who showed her differently. When Wandi's brother (one of the Wandi room companions) came from England, the film started to be very interesting. However, Javier began to see things different with his new friends, and perhaps he did something he would never forget and change his life forever. Overall, a very nice nostalgic film, which became more interesting due to the throw of multinational. I thought it was very interesting that you can see these kids from different countries, they all speak different languages ​​and have fun with each other in different cultures. I gave it 9 out of 10 because I gave up the theater with my smile and thought about the things I have done while still in college and want to do it before it's very late.
