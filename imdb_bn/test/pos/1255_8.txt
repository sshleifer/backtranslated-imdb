When I saw the first trailer of this movie, I asked for the story to be taken. After all of his childhood spontaneous, many options are open to all pages. Bruce Willis does an excellent job though his given role does. I was surprised to see how well this part could work. Others have said that this is a good career step, but after seeing it I now agree. This movie is basically not to remember the child you used to be and to realize that you are planning to become an adult. This is a wonderful story and a gripping story that makes us think all about. Generally, we blame the film "what will happen ...". For example, Watford tried to answer the question "What will happen if the world is covered with water ...?" But really, nobody cares. Although this movie influenced everyone in the theater. Indeed, the idea of ​​growing up young children and all your dreams can not be over, but it affects those children's adult and parents. This movie is definitely worth seeing. However, it will be good for the second time because you do not worry so much (how the baby went there and why and all these things) just relax and have fun. And when you leave that movie you take something with you. The piece that you forgot and enjoy your childhood.
