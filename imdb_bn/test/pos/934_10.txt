This picture is not the last piece of triangle of three colors, but three of the best in the 90's and one of the best. There is absolutely no other film that wisely pays homage to people towards humanity. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Although she is a lover, she seems rather alone. One night he had an accident and he hit the dog and took him to a retired age (Jean-Lau TrinityGantant), who is afraid and spy on his neighbors phone calls. Frustrated by her, she can not go away and they meet again. The two lively souls meet each other and they become friends and develop deep love for each other. <br /> <br /> The story is considered completely complex, and there is another relationship between a young man who represents both the judge and the true love of Valentine and their relationship more than just friendship. <<br /> <br /> Actor Wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trinjigant build deep and trustworthy friendships. <br /> <br /> These matters are not all about legality, motherland, communication with each other, but also about privacy rights. Randomly we see these rights hug even more, which makes these such films more important than 1994. <br /> <br /> One of the red red energy that represents internal turmoil, love, anger, and emotions. It is used here as another hero, it brings a combined depth in the film. A great composition!
