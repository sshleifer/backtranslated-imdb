Batman of Black Scorpio Roger Kremen. That's cool and there are lots of cool things in this movie. It's also cool like a Christmas-like breathtaking dog Doom and Darth Vader. Inhalers were in the mind control gas Mad Hatterer. Cormen B-movie style is all this puppy which is not always a good thing. There are lots of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy. This movie weighs bad out well. But if you are not one for comic book movies then I do not want to see Black Scorpion, but if I do not care about the comic book like movies and if it does not care about it before, then I would suggest. Then check out the Black Scorpion, for me I give it 8 stars.
