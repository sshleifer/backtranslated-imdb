I think this movie is responsible for 10 out of 10 because it started funny from the beginning. The plot is simple and straight forward but it keeps watching you and it has many smiles that you really love to love it. When I went for this movie I did not hear a lot about it and I do not know what I can expect. I thought it would be like old women, such as girls in Calendar or something but it surprised me. Although I was still not adolescents and films directed at my age group, I still found it nice and I think people of all ages would love it. I think it's too embarrassing to say that it's not a great and that it gets more promotion capability so that more people can see it and see it and it can understand a great movie.
