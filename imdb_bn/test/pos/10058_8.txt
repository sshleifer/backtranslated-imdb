When I look at a movie, I usually enjoy the entertainment. But of course if I know what's going on, then I'll find out what I want to do. For example, if it is a deep film, I hope the movie will create thoughts in my Kanium and think about what it is saying. But who is that girl? Do not have a deep film. But it's entertaining, nevertheless. It's a campie-type movie that is fun to see The film has very annoying moments and contains a lot of ridiculous parts. I saw it when I was small. Cast is always entertaining as usual. Griffin Dunne was my little crush, although at that time it was not usually male heart disease. Haviland Morris is also bigger. And finally the Austrian actress Bibi survived here! Overall, a joy!
