During the January 31, 1999 edition of the Si-Fi Tz Marathon, this episode was broadcast in my time zone (East) in the late 20th century. It was the day before the New Year, and when the shirt starts singing, "We are here because we are here, because we are here because we are here ..." I realized that it was TZ's cute New Year day because that tune Old Song Shin Tune Coincidence? We will never know. <br /> <br /> I love this story for a little touch: tear, balmy, and the hit on the balerin is the end of the-in-the-head. This and Art Carni Santa Tz is about the only Christmas. <br /> <br /> My personal top five episodes after five letters ...: 1. Hunt 2. The next hour 3. Hitachikar 4. The lonely 5. The little girl lost
