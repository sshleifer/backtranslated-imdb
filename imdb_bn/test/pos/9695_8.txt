OK what you expect, and then something. The first movie was one step above the TV show, sick stunts were censored and a garrelli factor which grew. Surprisingly, the Jacques number two is more sparkling. <br /> <br /> Stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular, some sad and painful antics make the laughing, which makes fun of turning to a sunny curl. << br /> <br /> On the other hand, Naxville always dominates in the proceedings, but at this time, he keeps the central stage because he is with the volunteers for the most dangerous and stupid stunts of all stants, the left Magar has himself proved to be wild forever, In spite of having read his picture under the movie 'Viva La Bam'. Surprisingly, the infamous wild boys (Steve and Chris Pontius), despite having a focus on the previous street, want to take part in the lower part of the skit. <br /> <br /> If you like Jacques or Diego Sanchez, then definitely enjoy this movie and laugh about your disappointment for 100 minutes, if you see it as a childhood, hateful or sad snapshot of today's youth culture, Find out as much. So close ** ** off.
