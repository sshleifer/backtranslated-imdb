Both Abbott and Costello are in this classic version of the story-time. In "Jack and the Bonstalk", everything looks, music, magic and comedy rolled into everything. After listening to Jack's play in Costello, he once told a young man a story. We knew that Jack was a poor boy who sold his doll "Dolly" for 5 magical seeds. Well, he's the one of the five bee vegetation plants, and they're actually magic. He climbed to the sky, saw a big castle there, and he used to sing a song, unknown he would face the demon (Body Baer). Not just him, he would dance with a woman who was a demon. During the dance he would clobber Jack with his shoulders. That was fun! You know how to keep giant as easily as those who harp playing. Give pink golden eggs. And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the monster. He gets the ax, and starts to mold on the beanstalk. Another interesting place where the axes are stuck during the knife, and the final celebration occurs when people dance around the print where the monster falls. Many fun, and fun for the whole family. Highly recommended! 5 stars!
