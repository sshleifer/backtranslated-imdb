How many of us have read a book or watched a game, and then when did the movie version come out we were very frustrated? Well, this might be one of those movies for those who watched this game, but anyone who did not have the opportunity to watch it in the stage, my film was very modest. The character was funny, the music was great and the story was interesting and you felt character, error and genuine sympathy for everyone. Jonathan Silverman has such good comedic timing, and his line is particularly ridiculous. I'm not going to give any spoilers, it's a nicely, funny movie showing the internwork of a middle-class family during WWII. So if you never see the drama, and if you enjoy other Niall Simon movies then do not come back behind some of the negative reviews you see here. On own, Brighton Beach memorial is a great movie. I guarantee it (although no money back).
