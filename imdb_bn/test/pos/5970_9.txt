Larisa Shepitko married Aleem Clivev, no wonder, who came later, 'Aas and C (1985).' 'The Ascent (1977)' ?? The final finale of the legendary before the premature death of the movie ?? The very same mold is manufactured. Set in WWII, this image follows a pair of Soviet sides, who kidnap the German army and tries to secure food for their hungry army. The first forty minutes are sadly intense, because two men pull themselves like a harsh, snow-covered landscape, the world around them is completely separated from life, warmth and color (in fact, so the silence of the scene that it literally brought me. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Though Tatnikov (Boris Platnikov) is unconvinced to betray his army Even though under extreme pressure, the less convincing Reybach (Vladimir Gostyuchin) tried to save himself. Is he wrong? The betrayal of Ryback is frustrating, but the film is not immediately condemned to its actions as a traitor; The reaction is to be compelled to consider what.

Interestingly, the film mostly interacts with this reality, such as Reykbe creates a point of independence and then shot by German captives. This device, though unusual, works well with its biblical metaphor; Ryback has been facing the trial of his eligibility and every time he encounters new contradictions, he always likes the selfish option, the only decision-making criterion for his life. At the end of the film, he is still alive, but continued the nightmare of war and crime.
