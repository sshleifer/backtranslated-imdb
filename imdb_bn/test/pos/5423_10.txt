... the world would never know. (The year the "Best Animated Short" film "Annie and Bella" has been a good year for Oscars, but it's not a "big snitch." Both are available for the "Entertainment of the World Animation" series, if you want to compare. ) <br /> <br /> "Sninet" and its director, Richard Kanady, has attracted so much attention that there is nothing here to add to me. However, I want to keep in mind that my favorite single "Shots" in this movie is contained in an animated short, where a man opens the door to get out of the cat. I do not want to give real events shown here, but for the first time I saw the shot, I screamed from one mood to another, then a few seconds later on the other side. That shots from that way failed to impress me. For this shot, and how Kandy sets up the set of the moment, "The Big Snitch" is worthy of the "Masterpiece" tag.
