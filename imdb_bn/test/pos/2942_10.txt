I saw this photo my girlfriend and we all like it! It's very sweet and impressive, a real tear-jarker! After watching movies I was thinking about the story days. This is a beautiful story about all the difficult things that go through all the families, it is something that can be related to someone. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking to rent on Saturday night. With your girlfriend, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! : D This is a real story about a real family that will drag any heartwarming person. Not to mention, beautiful landscape shots and superb acting. See this, I'm sure you love it as much as you love!
