I went to "The Closer to Getts" to know that the filmmaker's mother had a story about cancer fight. I expect it to be a very annoying, depressing movie. And although the matter must be emotionally folded, but the positive thing about this film is the positive message it sent. Together it shows the total dedication of a family to meet cancer challenges. They even refused to lose faith in each other at even the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> When this belief is expressed, I have the most running moments. Short comment that the mother and family reveal each other, who will survive her (and theirs) and emphasize their unhappiness over the uniting of love and family. In this way it is an emerging and deeply optimistic film. All of us should be lucky to be surrounded by such family in times of serious illness.
