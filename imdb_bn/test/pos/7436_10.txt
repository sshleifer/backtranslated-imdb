It really is not hard to understand this movie! I saw it with no knowledge and no knowledge of stories from games. I flew completely! <br /> <br /> First of all, I wonder how many letters are super-power, but this is called "final comment ...". I was surprised about the cloud's past but that was easy enough to look at. These questions did not destroy the film's enjoyment in any way. Just the opposite; It shows me thinking about the long story after watching the film. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful movies seen in my eyes. Music fully supports movies. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
