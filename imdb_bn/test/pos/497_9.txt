I love it In fact, I saw over over over, and I could see it again. This movie is not boring. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the vampire in this movie is revolutionized. This is a good work, great for today's generation. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time and she has some sexy accents. Donald Logo provides great humorous relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is not different. I can not wait for Blade 2
