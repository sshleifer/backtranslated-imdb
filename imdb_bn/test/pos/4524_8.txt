Considering Chan film considered, this is not bad. Stereotypes starting with black people at the beginning and when the police commanders ordered that "every Hindu in the city" rounded up. A parade scene of stereootype character enters the shape of three stugs. The Charlie Sultan plunge seems to move quickly around the city. W. Village in a flash. End up being silly It crosses an airplane airplane through the sky and then through the nose dive. Ed Wood can not do it well. The final scene is unreasonable, because the murderer must blame himself for trying to keep his person silent. Overall, it's worth watching.
