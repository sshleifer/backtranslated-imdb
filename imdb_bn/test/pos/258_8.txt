Love is a love movie which is LONDED in IMDB and completely confused. I think that some people have mixed their title. What is "plastic giant baby"? This love was not life. A little bit luvy dovey for my taste but a great, fun and original film. Especially in the end that all the climates of the romantic film crash and burned it that the cliche does not fall into the normal hole. Ten to nine
