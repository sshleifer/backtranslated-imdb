Straight up, I love this picture. I love everything about it. It has a great soundtrack, it's much recognizable face and it's fun as hell. There are many plots in this film and each one of them is interesting in one way. <br /> <br /> Where Spikoli was involved in the screen two years ago, Drake is a memorable one of the characters. All he wants to do is have fun. He goes out of the house without the consent of his parent, whenever he feels like it, he avoids the work, he is covered with sex, he loves his drugs and becomes warm and he tries to be a good friend. This is his unthinkable attitude that makes him happy. And he comes with some great lines. And there are so many small observations that you are not coming, but it smiles at worst when you hit it. Tommy and Bill are now a special moment when talking about Bill's former girlfriend with someone else. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his huge beer bottle and throws it on his shoulders, apparently. Then he said good night and the scene is over. This is a perfect view. Tommy has his own world. She really lives in the party and has fun. When the conversation ends, its time is over and he does not take any care that he insults the process. There is an innocence about him. "It's casual". His favorite is not saying. <br /> <br /> Another classic scene reminiscent of Reggie Bill the Donat. He tells him something that my friend and I will never forget because we've reviewed the film ten times and watched that part repeatedly and made ourselves smile. It will be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Wild life was curiosity, curiosity, good ears, when we were entertained and wanted to lose our world. 90 minutes Wild life is not exactly what all things are. If this is a movie you have not seen, then give it a chance. This is a classic. <br /> <br /> Check the man in a military store that has a problem with Jim. She is now a very familiar face and it's her first role in the big screen.
