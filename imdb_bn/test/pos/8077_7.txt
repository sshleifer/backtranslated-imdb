So * really * paranoid game-play scenes, excuse the studio like the cardboard backgrounds and stadiums. In this part, I could give 5 movies instead of 7, but I must read ... <br /> <br /> There is a lot of similarity with "transplantation" from the premises to the plot. Some people say that this film closes "The Replacements", but some say that the script was written earlier. <br/> <br /> "Suspension of unbelief on the basic premises" for both films, and it is particularly difficult for "second string" because it can have its NFL license team and all the history behind it. Too many words for some people, and not to mention the "second string", the larger scores have to be exceeded repeatedly, limiting the play of the game looks worse with limited budgets. <br /> <br /> In case of "transition", you can still make it happen in real life even though premises and leagues are imagined. I believe it's easy to set up with the fabulous story and real event ("Oh yeah, it happened before!" Background with realistic setting / imaginary scene ("There is no way superb can win!"; The scene is actually the Reven Games, the original stadium, the original The audience and some NFL matches were shot in the pre-season of equal shooting angle. <<Br /> But say both movies came on the same day, and we removed the budget factor Flee (thus forgiveness game play action scene iv): Overall, I "replace" on "second string", not many, but I like this more. <br /> <br /> It develops "relatively good" character "Replacement", the character of Keanu is very "synced to the world", and that all of the care that she cared, could possibly get a girl? In the second string you see QB struggles from getting back to work and with coaches It's the problem of the wrong person or the problem of the wrong person. Of course, the solution to "catching the ball all day long" is not new, but we can see the progress in fixing it. <br /> <br /> How do these tricks play? I think it's more than "replace" It seems "relatively realistic". False knee passes like "Dan Marino", shrimp-flickr, wild cats are full, all real, sometimes it's a little easier. But for me it is 50 gauge calls from the center of the "replacement", and how better the goal of the 60 yard field is to look better. Oh BTW, I'm glad they did not force the TE kicker to make their shot. <br /> <br /> Of course - if you review this movie on other soccer movies, it can easily be 10 movie out of 5 out. But someone says this is a bad movie than football? Try "Comebacks".
