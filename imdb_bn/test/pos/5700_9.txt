What a wonderful documentary - I thought it would be repeated over evil stories told by Ezzy Riders, Raging Bulls, but in reality, this is a clear and glorious celebration of a strange and abstract era which is a true great movie. What I was hit because of the lack of ugliness in the director's interview is that the film business is developing in large numbers - instead the people of Fredkin and Coppola have had a positive effect on the memory of their glorious day. Exorcist was an invaluable footage of an audience coming out of a daytime screening. 'It was - deadly,' a person says. The late Ted Dame, a great designation for an exciting movie, I just wish it was long - I could sit through this three hours cut.
