I've seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I see it when the movie was entertaining for the first time! George Burger (played by Tittle Williams), a small group of anti-war "Hippies" group of the 1960s, grew up in New York City. This small group is a young man, Claud Bukowski (played by John Savage), who opened the draft for the deployment of US troops in Vietnam. In spite of his best efforts to condemn him, the cloud finally reported to the army for basic training. The Hippie group stole a car across the United States to see "... a few hours" to see Clod, and then bothered him, George Berger (near the MPs at the entry gate). Army base cloud is temporarily located in Nevada). The results are really touching, so I will not loot those who have not seen this fantastic movie yet. Musical scores are equally fantastic! Don Dakas (Rock Group Chicago), who took part in "Waff" - a part of Hippie, is not an original character, but the film was not the same as the other. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays an influential girl, Rock Franklin, who is friendly with Hippie Group) is exciting in her role! Must see a film !!
