The skeleton of the story is that the main character won a public Kung Fu tournament in the upper part. The meat of the story consists of a lot of battles, a love triangle, betrayal, competition, and revenge. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of this story. The main character is also very liked as a boy of temperament, light-mannered, and very difficult country. Bad vs. movie is good and tough as well as good villains, it's ugly, confusing, and not tricky. <br /> <br /> If there is one vulnerability then it is the scene where the main character of the fianc√©e is hugging her imagination and drama running towards each other in a cauliflower field and when they meet. I thought I saw the sound of music for the second and almost lost hope of the film. Thankfully, the movie quickly recovered with a fight scene.
