Lucino Visconti has become famous in the world after its tremendous production Leopard. The fans of the film had to tell the style of the director who was a new realist, post-war veteran who developed his personal independent thinking and, consequently, expressed him as an artist. However, when applied to this film, it is a slightly different story based on the novel of Monte A Venezia's Thomas Manna. <br /> <br /> The whole picture is so unique in the first look, so emotional and much more. Affected by the different ideas of an artist (director and chief character Gustav Von Assenchach), it seems "unwanted" to many viewers. Therefore, such views about the film have grown as "very slow", "unnecessary" or "endless annoyance". Why? Because nowadays it seems to lie in a remarkable view: "The good movie is consistent with the effective steps." Here, it would be appropriate to say: "Good movies are not compatible with any steps." In fact, everyone can say a word about the content of the film and it will be enough. A vengeance that we found in Morte's murky reality inside both depth and shallow seemingly important for a deep moment. And when we look at the psychic scene of Venice, when we see Gustav at the railway station, when we supply him with a strong mental memory. Insight into its harmful mind is sometimes so intense that the viewer is the only way to see the film and to think and feel instead of thinking about it and experience. Always pale forever, their time comes when the flowers are dry like flowers on the ground. In other words, there is a sense of loss and death without all the facts or even the dialogue. As a result, after this single scene you do not seem to get the idea of ​​the movie. It must be seen double the mind that constantly open. If you like it or not ... it's a different story, very private one. <br /> <br /> Artistic values ​​are targeted at first point of view and it remains with us. Beauty as something very meaningful for the main character that is coming and leaving; He comes to rest as something that is so bad and comes to him in the most unexpected way; It seems that he has found a teenager who appears as a model of all dreams and desires, which disappears as a banned result of homosexual temptation. Costume designer Piero Tosi makes this movie a fantastic job. Through a lot of wonderful clothes she supplies us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action takes place. Cinemographer Pascalino de Santis has given us a great visual experience, which can be called the real festival for the eyes. And in the background comes the music of Gustav Maheller, who introduced the character to the composer Thomas Mann. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> For most of the film, we have lots of insights into her thoughts, feelings, and anger, fatigue and depression. Occasionally depressed, he keeps us on the right track until the least tragic end is not to lose hope ... Tajizio (Desperate Anderson) illustrates the despondent homosexual desire model, but the beauty and purity model which seems to be nice, is short ... "Audiud Tadizio, it was too small "to say the main character. Extraordinary, though very controversial, is by Mark Barnes "The Greatest Pride" by Alfred, with whom Gustav is the doctrine of ideals such as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfred, belong to the beauty senses. How Freudian, How Wonders Can Be Dangerous! And sometimes appearing in artistic Italian films, Silvana Mandano - here as a polite lady in Poland of Poland, here. <br /> <br /> The memorable moments actually constitute the powerful points of the movie; Yet, all the visitors will not get their unforgettable. They, like the same weird movie, need a lot of effort to move towards the right track between the director's distinctive ego and his mentality. In such a scenario, I consider the beach sequence extremely important, especially Gustav Tadizio. Physical distances accurately represents the lack of courage to come around ... When I sit in the Gustav Gondola and the city scene goes to the background, I realize the shots - how memorable it can raise the existing ideas of relocation. We, people, any kind of "passenger" on earth, life's journey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < What is the beginning to look deeper. Then, each scene has become meaningful in its explanation with which you do not want to agree (I do not agree with the original character), but the writer wanted to say it badly, for that you have to bear it at least. Listen to his voice, permit him for a few words on one page of reality ... <br /> <br /> So, there is a long way to understand the film, because many such films were not created in 1971. Now being made. On the contrary, it seems that we are compelled to realize the true feelings in this long film about the film, in the same way we are forced to experience a strange, unexpected, usually unexpected reality once the death experience ... 7/10
