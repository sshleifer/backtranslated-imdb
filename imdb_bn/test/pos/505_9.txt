In the continuation of the growing film adaptation of comic book adaptations, Blade is one of the best perceptions and elements of the universal (overall) source of public. .... Since this character has a history of about 30 years of comics, Abacus as a back-up figure in Dracula's Marvel's Tomb, almost all characters from the author and taking the material plot from Comic's history. Changes are inevitably created, but the subtle aspects of the film are straightforward on any criticism. Do not let any friends tell you different: Blade is a fine film. If it thinks too "comic book" for you but Stanley Kubrick snobs out there, it is supposed to be the reason. It deals with, but it's not for it.
