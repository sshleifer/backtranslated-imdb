Treatment One of the few 10 ratings ratings of 10 I mean, everything is faultless for me in this motion picture. I have seen this almost a year ago, and yet I still remember the many scenes, especially the credit that comes with the most sensitive view. <br /> <br /> The two sons gave the actor explicitly everything and it greatly contributed. Excellent story, the movie made perfect. <br /> <br /> The message is clear - friendship, and it is shown throughout the whole thing. I do not have anything to say here. Simplicity I love a lot about this picture. And of course, it is fun and moving at the same time, suiting people of any age. <br /> <br /> 10/10, nicely done!
