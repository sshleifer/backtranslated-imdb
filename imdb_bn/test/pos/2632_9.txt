I agree with all the mentioned comments. This show was a pleasure to visit. Funny, malicious, awesome acting and zany set. This is a showcase on smartphones that is always a thriller, the audience has brains and shows fine humor. I would love to see DVD again, spend hard earned cash. And as long as we do not feel any chance of a smart series ... how to maximize DVD's DVD releases (other good writing, seamless duck show with a lovely cast of characters.) And add to the list ... Middle Age or Frank's place. There are ways to publish these shows with volts and devoted fans and new audiences.
