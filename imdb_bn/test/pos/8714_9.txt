Bridget Bartdot, looking as sexy as before, is a French ambassador playing a spoiled but innocent girl. He married a man to marry his father's leading associate (female lady Michelle) and it seems to be the best thing for both of them. Michelle is flirting with her old friends soon and to teach her a lesson, Breedgate wrestles heavily with a married Prince Charles. Michael is surprised by his jealousy. A cat and mouse game occurred in Brigade and Michelle ("I'll make a thing ..." "No you do not ...") And finally Michael realized that she could just leave and leave the woman in her life. Breedgate and Michael feel comfortable at home after their happy-after-prince Prince Charles goes home in England. <br /> <br /> This is a spontaneous light piece but it is incredibly charming. Some time it may blame it as a product, I found that is completely enjoyable. A rentable one.
