The best movie I saw this year! Excellent story and storyline (for a rebuilding) <br /> <br /> This represents the "key" situation where the island of Japan can be completely removed from this world. Not to mention the incentive of a thought, the situation of life and death and all life on earth (this is good in Japan). It presents a great and talented solution to this massive tragedy. <br /> <br /> The horror, action, mystery, science, documentary, story of love and all the human interest stories you can get here can be found here! But I also warn you that it is a real tierjekar! Castles, actors and all are nice even better than all Hollywood movies! <br /> <br /> This thing can really be anywhere in the world! Now ask me what you saw ... "What do you do if you are facing this life and death situation?"
