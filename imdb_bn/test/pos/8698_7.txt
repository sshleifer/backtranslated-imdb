A few years ago, when I rented some movies, I came across Subpcpc 4, saw it and really liked it, we need a good vampire full flick which can not be held. But when I go back to the video store, they say they have no subscription video, unfortunately, I've checked out any video stores. I did not actually post all the subsidiaries movies on YouTube and I got to see them all last night and I'm hooked. I am now a fan of the full moon Gulf series. I think that I'm looking for such a horror film, I've been afraid of a good cherry for a long time and filled up the space and filled the subspecies. Radu is one of the most spectacular vampires on the screen and almost gives Nosoftto a run for his fans! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Three American girls who are studying Romanian history and culture, are a man, Stephen bind, who offers help. They lived in the castle fortress where we know that the brothers of Stephen Radu Rhus hugs two girls and surrounds them, but Stephen falls for one of the girls, Michelle, and can do something for her protection. <br /> <br /> Subjects are a fun series despite the effects of sugar, which makes it more beneficial in some ways. Stephen was a perfect angel like Romantic Vampire Plus Radu was a perfect villain. The story is cool and I think it was a funny vampire movie. The first of these series also, the best part, the sequels are just as fun. I'll recommend it for a scary movie night, in the dark it will look, Radia is sure to send shaking your spine or even your throat ... All right, Chesy jokes, can not resist. <br /> <br /> 7/10
