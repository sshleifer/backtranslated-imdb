If you are tired of publishing the same repetitive, intelligent, mainstream film industry, you will enjoy "you alone". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A high middle-aged environment that acts as an escrow and is discovered by its neighbors. Most of the movie comes in the hotel room where he hired him. <br /> <br /> Through their discussion, discover the two transit scenes of prostitution, depression, and loneliness. Still the movie is not frustrating. It talks about dark things without sadness. <br /> <br /> As a visitor, your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around, but slowly. You come up with a lot of thought about it. I like that in a movie
