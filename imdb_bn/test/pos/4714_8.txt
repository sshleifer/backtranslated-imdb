I came across this movie on TV. I had previously changed the channel and almost changed the channel, but it quickly pushed me. <br /> <br /> The stories of the Burmese struggle against a military dictatorship were excited. It is difficult to believe that the level of atrocity required to use something to stay in power. It creates gratitude for living in a country where the government does not shoot people in the street. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
