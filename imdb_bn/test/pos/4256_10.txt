If you get a chance to lose this lost (for many years), doubt that you will be disappointed. The PS has a bit of hottie and a bit of cool blackplpliting - even the slapstick hint of social satire, but it is so weird that it was not seen even before, even after that nothing has been seen. <br /> <br /> I strongly disagree that those who say that the film has a date, especially with Spike Lee's "Bamozojel" (SP?) a few years ago that tried to capture the same message. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who are found in the Mail Brooks comedy are forgiven, they can not believe in non-PCs, 'I can not believe they're funny'. <br /> <br /> Favorite part, advertisement. The film switches to the advertising agency's black (white) black and white imagery from beautiful (probably 16 mm) colors and goes away with it. <br /> <br /> I refuse to indicate any spoilers, but if you see the DVD version, be sure and watch Doney interview (but leave it after the movie.) <br /> <br /> My vote 10/10-- The most intimate film of the 70's in the late 60's. Thanks Prince.
