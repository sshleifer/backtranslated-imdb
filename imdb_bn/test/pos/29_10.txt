<br /> <br /> What more can you ask? A fine screenplay based on the best half plays of the second half of the 20th century, two subtle emotional performances of Courtney and Finni, a realistic view of London during the war, it is a great supporter. This picture takes you through a humorous rollercoaster with humor, sorrow, loss and fulfillment. This is more effective if you are in the theater. This rating scale is a true 10!
