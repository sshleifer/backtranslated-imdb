Some people do not appreciate the magical ingredients in ROS, but they are separating this series, and in fact the producers actually decide to dress up actors at the appropriate time of clothing and armor - not an antaristoric feathery cap, multi-colored tights and plate armor! <br /> <br /> I'm actually writing comments on the previous poster's article. Um, Michael Prade did not release Russell to Jules Verne! There are 15 years in these two series. Yup, I agree and Michael did not agree that it was not a good step - but it was a rude Broadway roles that enticed him with the '84 and his prince's paycheck.
