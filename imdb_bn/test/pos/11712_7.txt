Bart Reynolds has operated this action film and (surprisingly!) He is really a beautiful director. This film starts well, because Burt's drug businessman was bombarded and he was transferred to a vice-squad. Brian Keith always had something to eat, as there are some funny scenes from Atme Cast, Barney KC lost more control over Charles and his squad's control than all his colleagues. <br /> <br /> Vice police stumble upon a high-cost daughter girl girl that could have something with a series of killings. Sharky Domino (Rachel Ward) spent the day out of the apartment, and really began to worship him from a distance. <br /> <br /> Whenever they are close to the criminal leader, Domino is killed. I will not show any surprise to the plot, but the first hour of this photo is great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script gets very cluttered and then incredible. <br /> <br /> Why would Burt Reynolds face his big secret crime offender? The sureture makes the person sweat sweat, but it is also because many more police are killed. And it is not believable that Domino and Sharki love to know each other for one day, their lives are less in danger. And lastly, what happened to all the police in the building with our heroes? Have a SWAT team? Also, the film does not actually tell you how bad everybody is involved, and why so many people have to kill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a shame that climax is usually a common shooting-up-up. However, if you like crime and action movies, this movie must be entertaining. Do not worry about the plot holes, and you will have a good time.
