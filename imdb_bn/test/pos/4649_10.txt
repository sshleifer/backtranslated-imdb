This is my most favorite movie !!! <br /> <br /> I felt like this when I was young and since then I love it. I used to rent it often from this video store used to carry it, and when I moved, I could not find it anywhere, so I went from there to the store so that I could see the movie again! <<br /> <br /> Finally I found it for sale and I bought it and saw over again .... great movie! <br /> <br /> It was my first DVD ever since. After I got my DVD player ... OK well I got them at the same time, the quality of DVD quality is the best way I can not believe it! You will see this one!
