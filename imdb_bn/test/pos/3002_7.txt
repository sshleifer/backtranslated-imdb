Husband and wife Dr. Carol and Niles Nestellan are doing their job fairly well, but Nile has gambling problems. When he changed his fate he (unknowingly) saves a gangster's life from Joe Gourny's crowd and gets a big bonus from gangleyader himself. Changes in luck (and newer apartments in undergraduate), the payoffs for patching other injured members of the Niles gang continued. Unfortunately, his incisive police policeman rides, which hangs the shadow of his wife's career. <br /> <br /> At this time the plot comes to the focus, as Carroll Nelson has to recover his career. His license was suspended. This gang is officially involved in involving less or single interference. <br /> <br /> This is not a hard-gangster picture, but a plot that looks comfortable like a matlock or a shaker like a wart. There is some excitement, but the fool stays the mood by the stupid performance of the proud Girlster, who thinks himself as "the Napoleonic of crime". His other gang members work more as stooges than the hoodlums. And there are some exciting dialogues between Bougert and Francis, especially when he is treating his injuries in his secret place. Of course, as in all gangster flicks, a big shootout is over, but with a ridiculous twist. It's a great little movie that shows a bogurt on the rise of his musical instruments.
