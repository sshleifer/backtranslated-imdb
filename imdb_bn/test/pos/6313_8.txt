Although I agree with Tony D'Girolamo about the outstanding acting of Tony Serilo, I also like to add nice filming and montage that transforms this film into art. Young director Paulo Cirantino had the courage to experiment with different types of cameras, which reminded me of Darren Orphsski's 'Dream for Dream'. They make music with the music of both MTV-style modern (option / techno) music, create the movie ?? Le Consequenze dell'more - Stand apart from the other crime / mafia movies of its series. Although the film may be about "seconds" starting slowly, slowly, but it should be enjoyed because of its calmness, wonderful character illustration, and excellent finish. Must certainly look for those who enjoy a European / Italian movie. We are going to play this kind of PS Tony, we need a request.
