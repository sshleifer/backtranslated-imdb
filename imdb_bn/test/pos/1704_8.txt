Three Americans are retreating their way around Europe, they are challenging each other to compete with each other, and like the hot babe, Andy wants real love. While trying to bump into the Eiffel Tower, he found it when he came across and rescued suicide and heart-bursting beautiful Julie Delpe. In search of this girl and her secret secret, she and her friends lead full speed adventure of leadership, romance, pride and inspired humor, never taking themselves seriously, or trying to do anything other than brutal entertainment. 90 minutes ride. I have seen this movie several times and it has got a much more rewarding experience than 'London', although both movies are so different, but it is not fair to compare two or even even consider it a sequel.
