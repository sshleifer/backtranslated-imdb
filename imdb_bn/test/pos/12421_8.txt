It's a surprisingly great low budget / comedy, it's fun and nicely done well, good performance and really great wrench ends! All the characters are quite cool, and unknown when the story was very good, plus Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) together were fantastic chemistry. The most fun moments of the film for me is when Adam gets trapped in the bathroom, and Hurley decides to find the giant truck sitting there, and wakes up the trucks, and the Aime Brooks is simply sexy! , Plus it's one of the best low budget horror films it has seen in a long time. It's too serious, but in a ridiculous way, and I thought it was very well written, plus Michael Bailey Smith was as superb as Manster Man and had some mischievous makeup! It's like movies like Joe Ride, Dual, Zipper Cryphers etc. It has a few suspicious moments here and there, plus the part of the plush is done well in most cases. This is a surprisingly great low budget / comedy, it's funny and nicely done with good, good performance and really great twist ends, I highly recommend it! Directions are very good! Michael Davies is very good! Great camera work, good angle, good use of colors, and working here using a great setting, plus he kept the film fun and very fast. <br /> <br /> There are so many people! . We bleed very bloody nose, impaling poor, bloody stabbings, the man is cut through a giant truck by half, the human residue in a cooked stew, hits all over, the boys fall out, the pencil in the eye, bloody throat, turn around without turmoil People on the run, poor dead smell, headache, lame organs, bloody and molten bodies, a fair amount of bloodshed, a lot at the very end Undara scene! <br /> <br /> acting is very good for a low budget film. Aries Jungman was fantastic here, he was an inferior but a very likable, he was fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, had some cool lines, and I just loved his character, he looked to enjoy himself, and he was especially good at the end! Justin Yurich is the best friend of the donkey, but I just could not help him, but I thought he was very funny, and often stole many scenes, I really dug him! Ayme Brooks was fantastic, and did great work on what he wanted to do, with good chemistry with the hanger, and was particularly good like Jungman, because I love his mysterious character. Michael Belle was wonderful like Smith the Monster Man, he was very awesome, had some great makeup, and now my favorite slashhers! The rest of the cast fined. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend it! *** 1/2 out 5
