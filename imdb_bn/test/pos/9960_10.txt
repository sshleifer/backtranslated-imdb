Before going to the heart of the film, some thoughts: 1) I have never seen so many empty breasts in a film, many non-sex scenes were shown - it was weird; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where were you? You * attracted us * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare's love, and then you went for a while. Mainstream American wants more! Okay, I'm English professor of a college, I've read this game many times, and this is probably the best movie version I've seen. Other productions may stand in different directions, but the overall package is well placed together. Passino is not an olive, but it does not need to, so get up on it! Cinematography of the film is not only due to bare nipples. Venice is portrayed amazing, and you get a feeling for being really there. Portier's residential island is amazingly beautiful, and the light always tears the right path for the 'perfect mood'. <br /> <br /> Anti-Semitism in this movie / play is particularly difficult to see. Passino knees down and throws his religious artifacts, perhaps the most powerful moment in his film since his Godfather Part III * (when Michael's daughter was shot in the opera stage). Is the game anti-Semitic? Of course. * Othal * racist? Of course. Take this for: A commentary from Elizabeth's era, is not a comment today. <br /> <br /> Fiones in the film are unused, but still the joy to see Women are okay in the film; Nobody really stands here, but they do not blend nicely with the scenery. Jeremy Irons and Casino's two juiciest roles, ultimately the opponents are excellent. I've always felt Irene was under (when I hear his voice from lion * * I get cold), and Pacino is Pacino.
