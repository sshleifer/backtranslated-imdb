Kite Runner is one of the modern epics that is sometimes enjoyed. For two continents, multiple family generations and for many decades, this film touches on many items associated with friendship, love, loss, and ultimately release. <br /> <br /> This is Main Aamir (Zakeria Ibrahimi)), a native Afghan boy who often plays with help from tenant; Mainly young Hasan (Ahmed Khan Mahmudzada), a Hajra son, who feels the family is worse than the Afghans. But both of them develop friendship bonds based on education (Emir Hassan teaches to read), Amir's house closure, and of course, flying thin flying <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kabul's communists are attacking and due to the harsh treatment of Afghans boy bias against Hassan, Amir and Hassan have been separated. The two can not meet each other again. <br /> <br /> Aamir's father could bring himself and his son out of Afghanistan, eventually going to America. Here are two markets sold by a gas station and a direct hand bind. And if Amir's father gradually becomes ill, a new revelation will occur in Amir's heart; One that she can not ignore and needs her back to her favorite Kabul <br /> <br /> A study of friendship, war, and reconciliation, Kite Runner is a fantastic piece of movie indeed. Whenever we live in a foreign country, the story is not spoken inappropriately in English, and whenever we are in America, only English breaks. It encouraged itself in a sense of refreshment and reality. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, as you can see. Special note Homun Ershadi, who plays Amir's sick father and strong father's father, must be made. Khalid also led Abdullah like the old Amir, especially when he came back to destroy Kabul; <br /> <br /> While shooting for Amir, Afghanistan's cinematography and final return is not exciting, snowflake peaks that will ruin your face (I'm not) sure they used to be in a movie, but wherever I would like to go and myself I want to make a film!) But this is not a cinematography and does not play one or two films that make this film a success. This is a simple story that is very good that it makes a movie observer valuable. Highly recommended.
