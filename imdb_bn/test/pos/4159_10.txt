Golden Door (Nuvomondo) for this year's best film for the audience. It is a compilation of ideas, writing, direction, acting and film. More importantly, the word 'border' is not a political fuse, but when it comes to seeing the 'foreigners' migration history in America, this transformed beautiful film is a very important mirror. The author / director Emmanuel Criellezes did not even tell us a deeply moving story, also provided a sensitive stone to see our source history for the audience: Except for American Americans, we all are 'foreigners' in America at any time in our history, and remembering this picture in mind At the same time, it is threatened. <br /> <br /> The image is open to Sicily in the beginning of the century, such as the devastating legislator of the poverty line Salvatore Mankuso (Vinsenjo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Cassisa) climbed a rocky hill to present their tokens to the cross so that they May fight for existence on the island or want a sign about whether the country of dreams can go to America. The deaf silent son of Mancusa (Filippo Pissilo) goes to the top of the hill with postcards found in America (compared to humanity, tree, fruit and money growing in plants, etc.) and Salvatore acknowledges that he should move his family to America. After starting his journey, believing mother Fortunaata (Aurora Quatroqui) and her sister Rita (Federica de Cola) and Rosa (Izbella Ragnos), she sells her only property (two ass, goat and rabbit) and the man with the boat Their travel arrangements, family shoes, suitable clothing and third-party passenger delivery instructions provide a sea fishing boat instructions. As soon as the Mancuso family was ready on board, they were asked for a photo and they stood behind a painted set, an English lady Lucy / Luke (Charlotte Gainsberg) went to the film, although she was part of this farming family. <br /> <br /> The journey begins and Luas begins his gentle way, identifying with the family of Mancuso, finally makes Salvatore strong in his safe path by offering him the convenience. Not for love 'time to reach America Due to poor populist storms and living conditions, the third class passenger population survives, bonds and eventually reach Alice Island, believing America has fulfilled their dreams. But everyone must determine whether they must enter America as well as strict physical examinations, de-lowsing, and even intelligence testing: Officials tell them that America does not want genetically inferior people to enter the new world! They must be selected by a man to marry Alice Island before each woman is allowed to get admission. The Mancuso family is united until some surprising end, which is the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Many of us face tough rules and hard-working migrants (or at least face it) centuries) on Alice Island, and if we have selected that information submerge. The Golden Door represents a case of migrants who does not just touch our hearts, but also recognizes the current immigration laws. But apart from all the political issues, Golden Door is the first and foremost beauty, fine photography, a deeply felt performance by a huge cast and a very sensitively written and directed story film. This is a film that deserves wide range, it is a movie that must be seen for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
