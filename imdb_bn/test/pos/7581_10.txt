Anderson's animations easily compete with Pixar and I've seen Disney as the best thing to do. Some say the story is a little abstract, I find it a thought and provocative change of exaggerated characters and usually found in animated shorts of left-handed creatures. This is an international version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left a safe shelter house and left alone, has terrible places, he will easily identify with this exposed microbb. Excellent work, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
