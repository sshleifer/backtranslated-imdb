I came across this movie in mid-teens and it immediately became one of my favorite holidays and holiday holiday films. You can say from another review that this film is a very good story line and a great actor signed for it. <br /> <br /> Stenwie is a great supporter since the second thought. Dennis Morgan's performance is also strong. He was unknowingly in most movies but was a very talented actor, see Kate Fayle. In this film, he plays a traveling sailor who keeps Stawwak away from her husband. <br /> <br /> This is a Christmas classic. Settings and stories made for a great Christmas romance
