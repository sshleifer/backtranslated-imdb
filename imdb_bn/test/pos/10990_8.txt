From the Buffalo area I was well aware of the movie with reading many articles in local publications. I was influenced most with the movie, especially his cute plot, acting and local scenes. Different roles are very old, beautiful to look great in quality. I think this movie will be great especially for more than 50 years and you can feel like a theater that your time is well spent.
