In Mississippi, former Blues guy Lazar (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, lost his wife, who left him. She found the city crack and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) drugged, near her small farm, drugged, peat and almost dumped dead street. Lazarus brings his house, gives medicines and nursing and nourishes him like his father, keeping his heat in order to keep his heat under control. When his boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) came out of the army due to his concerns, he misinterpreted the relationship between Lazarus and Rai and tried to kill him. <br /> <br /> "Black Snake Monan" is a strange belief, hope, love and story of blues. Gifted Christina Ricky has done an impressive performance in the role of a young trump tied to her father's childhood and she lives in the entire city where she lives. The diversity of this actress is amazing, and perhaps it's the most mature job that I showed to Christina Richie. Samuel L. Jackson also performed exceptionally well in Laser's role. Soundtrack with wonderful blues, I've heard the movie in the most beautiful My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre o CÃ©u e o Inferno" ("between heaven and hell")
