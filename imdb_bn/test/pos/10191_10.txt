This movie is amazing. You never have to laugh hard. This is a goal. No, I think it's ... yes it's ... a book! This movie gets the second fun - like when Jackie Chan's character dies until the end of the final war scene. This movie is looking like a Veli Velie Trev! Congratulations if you buy this or rent it. You do not return to my opinion, it. I did not, and I found it from a shop. I saw this movie once and I was in love with Kung-Fu Action Flickr forever. If you are looking for an amazing movie in the state of great production, good or medium acting, and special effects ... this movie is not. If you are looking for sunny and timeless wonders, pick it for a dollar and you probably will not let it go. With friends, popcorn and drink, it's perfect evening.
