Your daily Tom and Jerry are not short for many reasons. One, there is a voiceover description by Jerry, which is odd, because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Two, two friends who work very rare and rarely work as well as more hostile shorts. Thirdly, and most importantly, the cartoons are rarely ridiculous (by design) and here humorous bubbles of blood with dried chocolate and end yeast. Think of a Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Team Burton. Not completely successful, but it basically works. I can think that the maximum end for an MGM short. Proof that not for everyone and these shorts targets are not intended as children only as viewers. Well worth watching. Recommended with caveats above.
