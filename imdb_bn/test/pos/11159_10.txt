This picture is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really delightful. Dialogs are diverse and conversations. This picture did not appear to be much more like 'The Mystery of Murder', like the relationship between tension characters. The picture tells two parallel stories. <br /> <br /> The first story is played in the role of TintinGent and Casovits. Trintignant is a striking drifter, followed by a somewhat ridiculous macho energy, with a beautiful nature smile praised by a naive young man Kassovitz. Many good moments in the film come from contrast between two letters, for example, when Trinjigant tries to teach how to scare Kosovitt. <br /> <br /> The second story is how a salesman performing John Yann's job of finding a young friend's killer and his wife up. Yanne is part of a kind of episode with aggressive taunts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The picture was malicious but a successful mix of patrons gangster films, director Father (celebrated Michelle Edward) wrote and "emotional French film" with a lot of emotional depth and emotions. With great care.
