One of America's best art works, Maurice Dilsondro opens the film by sex, with a face open mouth. We wonder, is he coming close to a heroin high? We just saw her face, then, flash, her body, flash, behind her naked. I can not think of a movie that creates a hypnosis, drug mood to make this flash-blip form so well-edited, an editing process that works wonderfully as both pacing and style. After the introduction, when Dalesendro opens his mouth, his pronunciation awakens - we hope he has some soft-spoken conversations; Instead, he got the voice of a street goat - Morrissey is not comfortable letting our guess go unchecked. Long opening is very sexy and playful - it is a combination of marshal problems, Dalesandro's impressive lips-kiss kiss and morning morning sexual escape; It all flows together, if not always smooth, then emotionally realistic. <br /> <br /> I got what I got from "I got 400 explosions," it was the same when I saw it - this story is like a 20-something continuation. There is a sense of cameramic between meat sellers and buyers; When Dalsandro is walking on the street, there is a sense of secret handshake for men looking for men (for his wife's abortion fund) to deal with each other. I did not find it annoying, though nothing happens - nothing happens brightly, hanging around boys, as they are doing, waiting for tricks. Dalesendro's original technique uses Greek descriptions and only after touching the back, a part of the aesthetic body worship in humans seems interesting to see. It's very awesome fun ("I'm not talking with an empty bed, I?"). This is one of the most revealing scenes in the movie - I think in any movie; Of course no movie dealing with sex and sex for sale. When Dalsandro's eyes became red and swollen, we could not say that he was drunk, ashamed, embarrassed or all. <br /> <br /> Movies are cutting - they do not matter. (The film is silent in some scenes, a little shocking and beautiful that you can never be experienced.) But when Morris likes to include one, it includes (we break it together), it is frustrating, such as Dalsandro and a newbie hostler. One conversation between - and none of them ever mentions the word "gay" or "hover". To give Dalsandrro a job we can hear a tide of a transvestite where a scene is followed - after explaining it to the "use" for the newborn. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Given to her, both her client and Maurice. He is less acting than acting, acting in the sense of acting, but since he is publicly unbelievably - he wants to feel immediately above anybody, yet with his experiences, all his complexities, and we 're trying and trying to know him. He is an empty slate that we can draw but can not hold. And of course he fell incredibly - forgotten all others, this is partly the beauty of the male body, a connivance of Dallesandro's fantastic dust and a standing pillow standing permanently. The movie is a destructive scene, but like everything else you can not really dominate it - a girl says that she has been raped, and her only self-defense says that rapists are only for sex Asked, liked him, he liked it well. It is shattering The film is emotional for everyone, but better than that, it is not only sympathetic, it actually attempts to help us understand the human being - and understand how it can be directed to us for understanding. It does not look at people in the movie and does not glamorize them. It seems inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he read a letter (he did not get eight grades at one stage), he is completely charming, as he breaks on a word ... then says, "Woteva," and continue. <br /> <br /> <br /> You can learn something deeper than the interaction between Dalsandro and its clients in a gay-related relationship than in what case you study. Here we have a young boy who smiles (as his upper lip disappears), while 30-some gymnasium Korean war veterans carry his fingers through his hair; This is a scene that feels very deep, sharing this adult person with a small version of herself - it does not come together with two gay men, or directly to a straight man; it is not something else that you put on your finger; The question of sexuality is next to the point. (Sometimes seems like a pimple boyfriend.) After sharing anything with each other (though with Dalsandro, it is not clear why he is there while he is there for money; even though he is not less than sincerity, his worst quality) "So ... can you help me?" People are sure to say. "I do not mean my pants!" 10/10
