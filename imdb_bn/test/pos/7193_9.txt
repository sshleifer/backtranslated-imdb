Normal repetitive part), collect a bunch of great actors (Gerard Darmon Wonderful, Often, Chabat himself a great Caesar). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, when the obligation to keep up with Christian Clavier as Asterix, Chabat has ultimately resolved his role in the film for giving special importance to Devum and Devoj ... which is always a good idea! <br /> <br /> => Great environment, great scene, great director, great actor, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... if there were no Clive bee, then this movie was worth 10 and N was involved.
