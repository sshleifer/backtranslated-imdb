Mr. Sharky, you can see it is normal. You will not find a table in this fancy cocktail restaurant / bistro. I, eat 'other grapes and pockets' every day Would you like my fur coat with all fine trimming? Gold is my golden gold ring? Or maybe you like this blonde, 'What are you saying, bombshell, who are desirable in aerobics and nude petanakis, who decorate my tall, chicken velvet sofa with pan fried foil and decorate like a soft high lark like a fig tree. Do you like You can not stay! Jai is all mine. <br /> <br /> You will never go to you. Apart from Momin, Domino was the best. You do not understand the love forming industry. Just look at your inferior mosaic. It's almost funny to me, lazy, in the face of your stupid thinking of the humorous fascination, as you walked around the mountain of love of the Domino, such as forests, forests, and winds of hot air! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zey learn, Zey becomes teacher Learning until it's done. Now math, art of love I got the Domino seed bed. I watered her very often. Sharky everywhere Her perfume petals, her proud rope everywhere, She can dry up under your ridiculous hose, like souffl√© removed from five minutes soon. <br /> <br /> I will go to the shark now, so with me your dishonor behavior. It will flushed down like le pissoir like those smelly things to you. <br /> <br /> Forest opportunity!
