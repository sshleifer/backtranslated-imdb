I will tell you the truth I wanted to see this movie because of Rose McGowan. I think that part definitely works out ... actually quite good. However, the film was very good. Some parts of this movie are really good. <br /> <br /> The film also did a great job. Finding this mystery is very difficult and Rose [McGowan] is acting on some of the "Oscars" films, but I do not want to give anything. Adam Beach and Jurgen Proknov are also superb in a film with several other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like the mystery, or the action movies, or just like in the rows ... I totally think you want this movie.
