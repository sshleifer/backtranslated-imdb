Thanks for the help of a fellow IMDB member, I have been able to see this movie for another 20 years and I can honestly say that it has not lost a kick. I can not believe that Channel 4 has invented it without trace because it is a very strong, moving and morally resulted in the consequences of wrong commitments. <br /> <br /> It monitors friendship for ten years and focuses on their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; Especially they use one and cruelly suffer other. The events of both past and present have gradually grown, such as the great revenge of Shane Midos, Dead Man Juice. Acting, writing, and direction are very brave for 1983 and still pack a wall despite the above cross accent of the central character. Yes, it can be set to public school, but it is marketed by marketing ivory without any world; I got a state education and can still draw countless illustrations from the story. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you keep in mind for a long time - if you see it - but you probably will not go but Chanel 4 (or FilmFor) likes to bury it. On their own official website they describe it as "an illogical neglected jewel from the first day of Channel 4" - who ignores? It was one of the first Channel 4 movies (which would be thanks to the FilmPhof for the success of films such as the filming of Transposing), so anyone has to have a master print. At the moment, where you can get more or less a few of the problems of enhanced collectors, it is a bit moody that they can not give the film, it promotes the promotion. So, if you are reading one of the Channel 4 production flaky, stop programs that humiliate themselves in order to secure a tabloid contract, follow this movie and decorate a special special anniversary. Version disc or anything, please!
