After all these years still funny. Midnight Madness good entertainment for all ages. It introduces Michael J. Fox as a common 15-year-old problem maker. Melio and Blaylak are throwing it as far as the most fun characters and Leon is perfectly master of a wierdo game. The emerging romances among Adam and girls can not be any cheesier. Fagabeefe !!!!
