"Challenge to Bay Free" was the first movie I saw as a child. This is one of the first VHS tapes I owned. I have not seen the film for several years, so yesterday I decided to keep the tape and see it. How nice. The story is so strong that I have seen it now. I am old enough to think that I can grace the values ​​transformed into a film better. (Self-reliance, the value of freedom and nature's love) It is a "B" film, but it is a subject that you will remember for years, especially if you see it as a child.
