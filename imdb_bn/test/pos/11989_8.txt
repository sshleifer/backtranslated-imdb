Amazing, down the way to the way of my favorite movie below. I do not like the "ordinary people" to do what I'm going to do. Jackie Messon is sunny in this movie, and so Randy Quaid. I could never get enough of his "tough-arm" tricks like Moving. He was notable in the National Lampun's Christmas Vacation. Love that guy
