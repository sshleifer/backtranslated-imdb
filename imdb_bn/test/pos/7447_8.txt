Just then saw it. It's superb pretty fantastic. Fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool! This is a totally video-game part, where there are some amazing hand-fighting battles. <br /> <br /> This movie is for fans: "Those who love this world once before and have spent time with their friends, gather again and dedicate your time ..." Besides this unexpected opening, follow the story too It was not difficult, and Ihave never played a fantasy fantasy game. I think this roll play games can be commonly known; The knowledge of style knowledge helps you understand something better. I think that if you pay attention and recognize what the film spreads to you, it is easy to understand. There are many things that are not explicitly explained, and if you claim that you should do it, you might be confused and annoyed. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies see the Grand Saga, and keep a lot of puzzles together as possible. I like the method; You are running through all the letters that catch the mystery and confusion. But I said, just take it. If we talk about the strange red lion, roam and take the name and take the name and other characters say that he is an old friend, he accepts it and continues; You do not need a biodiversity flashback, or an all-down-down. You are an observer here, something beyond your experience and absence. So: Fantastic graphics and animations, great voice acting, great video games, stylized music, stories and characters involved, and perhaps some great fights you'll see at a time. It's worth watching, and when it's for fans, it's not quite a game that's perfectly accessible for people like me.
