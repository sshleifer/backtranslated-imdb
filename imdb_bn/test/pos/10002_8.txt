I saw the film in preview of this pore, and it's lovely. Cinematography is extraordinarily creative, good acting, and fabulous stories. If this film does not do well then it will not be effective because it does not have the capability. Before this movie, I did not understand how attractive Shiite Leibov could be. He works as an incredible, self-reliant, as leadership. There's something incredibly sweet about her, and it makes the movie even better. Other actors also do well, and the film really holds high suspense moments, hopefully more than one movie about golf. Sports Drama a dozen of movies, but this one stands. <br /> <br /> This is what I recommend to anyone.
