Yesterday I saw this movie and saw that I see the best for TV movies. It was very well-directed and acting fantastic, very believable. Music was good and cinematography was shot nicely. Find out the disappointment for a dream, and you're lost. A wonderful illustration of the drug addiction in the world and its results are given in a very open way that can be related to any one. Mtv cudos for a better flashing us for a change! * $ *% Like Crossroads
