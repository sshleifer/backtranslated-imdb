I have never seen a doctor before (at least not in any viewpoint), so I thought the new one was new. I want to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it must be called "comedy" in the description of the letter; many of the plot moves are acceptable only for their comedic standards), it's good writing and it makes a small budget longer. Human level is very strong and attractive, which is very rare in current TV shows. <br /> <br /> I saw the first eight episodes, and # 6-8 was my darling. All such stories that are easy to screw up (with time-travel, save a dead parent and their belongings) work wonderfully here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you see Christopher Eccleston as a wicked and mild heart sometimes breaks the doctor - I would be surprised if they found a good replacement for him. But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. But there is no doubt that Ecleston episodes are going down in history as a classic. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. Doc is far more than a father than romantic interest, and yet there is an indication of romantic revival among them, which is far more emotional than human sexuality and human. <br /> <br /> A good show. Low budget low budget - a show like this should have a good special effect. And why they just do not use some cheap effects, I do not know. At this day and age, SFX will not have to spend a bundle - just watch Star Wars: Revelations fan movie. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8.
