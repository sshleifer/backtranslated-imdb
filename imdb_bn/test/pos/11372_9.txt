I have seen this series have been for 40 years, but still its memory has not faded. It would be a natural for the DVD re-issue, it seems to me. Many actors have gone big fame (Robert Hardy, Shann Connery, a couple named); Although it was a minor role, I still think of Judy Dante as Catherine (Henry VI) of France, at the age of 20. She was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> This site has a hint that the series was printed in color - did not it? Who among us will know - there is no color TV in those days. There is no chicken sorrow, no VCR; If so, something may be recorded on it. As a way of teaching English history, this series has been resurrected in such a way that teachers of some classrooms can manage. <br /> <br /> How good it will be!
