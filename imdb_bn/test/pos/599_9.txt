Who does not love muppets? It is impossible to see them without some kind of warm, vague feeling. So, I think it's important that this movie has been successfully captured by Muppets, especially. I do not think much about the details of the plot, but I totally remember the moments and characters of the film. In fact, most of the film's nostalgic atmosphere was there but without being aware of itself in a bad way. Refreshing for those who get very hungry on potential details and strategies; "Magic" crosses all other stuff. 'What is actually made in the movie <br /> <br /> So, how does this picture achieve? Hmmm, nice question! Am i stumped let's see. Really, I think it's pretty easy. Filmmakers believe in their ingredients and do not take themselves too seriously in the process. I probably would not say that this film is really a very inspiring moment, but it has a specific life (which is quite adequate for the lack of many "true people" movies). A quarrel You really want to believe these funny little people and their event. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. Lots of genius, little predictability and lots of warm personalities are coming through. Caesar certainly had a bunch of beautiful surprises, for example. Maybe I do not think a lot about it because I saw it when I was half-sleep (and / or I write this review). However, I'm half-repeating myself here but I liked the movie's idea of ​​the family. I could assume you are full of love. Again, Nostalgia comes to mind a feeling that does not allow many movies to be so effective or easy to achieve. <br /> <br /> And once again to repeat itself, one of the best characters in the film is that this is a very relaxed and welcoming environment. Nathaniel Hawthorne (like), with a butterfly quote, so trying to do Muppet movie in such a way seems to be partially successful. Beauty is well discovered or untouched or disobedient or the same with something like that. However, if it seems sad, I deemed it was very pleasant. So, all this, this movie is very funny, touches and hard to smile with. Plus it features many great music! Very young and young both in mind, highly recommended by all people.
