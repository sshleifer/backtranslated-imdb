I hired this obscure Australian rilak to show in a friend's place a few years ago, and it was an instant success. Oz Wizard's classic tale with a perfect cornball 70's Australian twist. Acting is not just Shakespeare, but later, "Mad Max" star Bruce Spence is a beautifully different Surfing / Scarcro and Gary Waddell and Robin Ramsey have some wonderful comic movies as a wonderful 70 camp fairy godmother / father character. Also note that Pre-Daddy Cool Frontman Ross Wilson is on the title song of musical contribution to the song. The same day has played the same comedy as "the Queen of the Australian desert Priscilla Rani".
