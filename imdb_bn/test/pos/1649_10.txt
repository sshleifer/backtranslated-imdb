On one episode you want the next leaf. Thousands of Shatfbat battalions are listed to pay close attention to the credit. An unauthorized story involving thousands of people. Sometimes cruel, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialogues. Excellent set and camera work produced with. Heroes and Villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. The portrait of the people struggling to survive and spend the most horrible times. I want to buy a copy for my own collection so that I can enjoy series again.
