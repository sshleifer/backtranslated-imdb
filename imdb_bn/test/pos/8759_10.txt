I can only agree with viewers that one of the most memorable dramas created for traffic television. I saw traffic on TV, and I saw it again. I am particularly moved by the main music by Team Suester, and especially by Dolorus Strain of Simon's Shotkovvich Chamber Symphony C-Teen (Music on Credit and Film Components). The music characters intensify as they follow their sad destiny. Music is strong emotional. This system integrates two of the movement from Symphony, but I recommend to listen to every symphony.
