I really enjoyed this movie thoroughly. For one, the big budget movies did not have special effects. This act was very good, only you can say right on the bat that it has been dubbed, but once you get the truth and you can not switch the languages ​​to the DVD version. The plot line was very unique, you face a situation as the temperature around the world is very common, especially in Frankfurt which I've done many times and you take a garbage strike which is often enough in these countries and recipes for your disaster. I like that the rats have gone everywhere and how the idea is that if you pick garbage it is the last thing you want to do, you choose it, the rats can not get what they want, they're following the free garbage pick up, so you are good Asked if garbage men are striking, those garbage, private contractors, whatever unnecessary want to do unnecessary work from the military city Yasita work, then you will have to take over the city all the rats, to keep the lid on the budget and you want to keep the lines of his pocket and threw a mayor, you have a realistic film and the female lead is a lovely thing to see on the screen. It was created in such a way that the other part of the novelty of Frankfurt could be better edited, but the average audience was not in Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and went to Frankfurt. It's a matter, but all a big toe is all up.
