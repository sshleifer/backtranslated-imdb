I have seen this movie many years ago, have tried to identify it, but it is obvious that it can not be found anywhere. It was so clear, and still several movies that have been with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the movie is, and perhaps, like the uncertainty principle, the obscurity is certain things. Acting supernatural, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of predictive, an overall sadness permit, and yet, it is not difficult to absorb in the story. I thought it was science fiction (it was some completely misleading blogger including scientist section), but quite clearly it is not. Or awful, even Suspense. Indeed, one grateful that the director had the courage to create a movie like this, which probably would not be a hard listener. I know some people complain about the short role of Claus Kinski, but I think it's very appropriate - its limited exposure is critical to the mystery of this film.
