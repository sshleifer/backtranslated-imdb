I hate songs because music numbers suddenly happen suddenly and usually start from looting scenes, but it is quite different - it's just brighter. The plot is probably not a challenge for the audience, but the simplicity of human life stories makes the film a great one. <br /> <br /> I have seen it at least a dozen times and I am still not tired of plots, characters or music (I just like soundtrack - this is my only soundtrack which I really wanted and probably my only remaining). <br /> <br /> For me it is definitely a must-see movie, the great character is compiled with an entertaining song and many things to think after the movie ends.
