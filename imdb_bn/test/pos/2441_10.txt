This picture has not been seen by me for several years. It came to Disney Channel early in the morning. I waited to see it, and it is more entertaining than the first time. The stories, the scenes and the characters they come as well. I know that if anyone takes time to watch this film, they can see it twice. It's very memorable in multiple ways. I would recommend this picture to anyone because it is both recreational and educational for the relevant <br /> <br />
