This film is directed by Clive Barker, who really knows how to establish relationships between the audience and the characters. I think there is a fondness for this one, instead of barker's errand of this trip should have been devoted to this movie instead of the annoying Lord, which I think was the real trash. But I think that for this reason and due to lack of signals, Enbridge has become a classic of horror cultures of horror films.
