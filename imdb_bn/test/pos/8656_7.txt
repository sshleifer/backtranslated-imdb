Enjoy 'Den Brysomme Mannen' http://ow.ly/PTTp (I do not have my wife, so I saw it in bits in a few days.) <br /> <br /> The critics have been mainly confused - mostly it's metaphor, but what No; 'Heaven', 'hell', 'socialism', 'capitalism'? <br /> <br /> Most people who do not want to escape, and it is basically banned, are banned with most of the alternatives. <br /> <br /> So perhaps you fear your favorite preoccupation / bias / it over. <br /> <br /> So I would say it's about an astronaut's life. In the literal sense of the color of the colorless, colorless form of color.
