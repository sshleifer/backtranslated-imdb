I tune in this movie because there was nothing to see. I was immediately sucked by the letters. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney in this movie is nothing less than spectacular. The mental sick woman is both moving and 100% believable in her screenplay. Really, this kind of thing is not easy to make. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We know that this image is about to end, but you can not close your eyes to it. Character performs stupid things, but compared to most Hollywood movies where people are silent because the plots claim that these people do stupid things because the head is not right - and what they do is completely consistent with their characters. <Br> <br /> This is a great example of creating IMHO. Great writing, great acting, great instruction. For those of filmmakers, a movie may be more than stupid entertainment.
