I saw in the theater because I enjoyed this movie. Some movies have a cast of letters and a script that combines perfect tolerance and it is one of them. Characters always work on achieving superiority from people, working together, forming groups and highlighting some facts about achieving goals, sometimes without promoting ethics. The situation is well-formed and consistent with the opening ceremony of the film. The tone builds nicely and humorously clean and consistent throughout. The film mainly moves me to draw for characters and manages to laugh nicely in all ways. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, the songs are usually the perfect copy of the music in the heavier post-war Navy Navy, which produces humor and indicates the viewer's attention. Credit views have a great music video of "In Navis", which deserve their full screen special features. The scenes and the kits have been well-made and casting and acting are okay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In reality, the lack of demonstrations makes it so much fun to see. I love these boys and girls. <br /> <br /> The other day I thought about the picture, and was surprised at what was available in the DVD. Good luck came to us, and the DVD came out in May 2004. I went to the store, and snapped up a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed another sunny night in front of the big screen. I rated this movie as 10 because it comes together at all levels, much better than high budget films and Oscar winners. This is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to Fox Home Video: There is a great movie on your vaults and it is shameful to find a cheap shot DVD with only very close-ended color DVDs after just 8 years of liberation war. So why do not you want to restore the color and present the film? I would gladly give more money to get the picture. I am thankful to have my own copy. Now give our movie a great candy and how to re-establish the credit sequence as a full-screen music video special feature.
