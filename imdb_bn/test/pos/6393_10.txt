If you accept Hooksbel Parents and Kyle's parents are involved, you may wish to have your own family-child-development skills under the parent and parent of the end. The best part of every show is that parents are not very religious self-righteous upper class, they do not know at the same time they are not unaware educated parents, who are left-handed and humiliated by their children. My kids are 20, 16 and 6; Just like Kyle's kids are of the same age and I mostly mirror my own experience with my family in most of the circumstances. The ciline they show only shows that you do not have to take yourself very seriously to stay together with your family and have fun with your kids if you have affection for your family.
