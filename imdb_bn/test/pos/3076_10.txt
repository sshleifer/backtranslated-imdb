"Robin Hood: Tights of Men" got no respect. It was ridiculous! Carrier Ellow has done a great job as "the prince of the thief" and like a blackline like David Chapel, Amy Yaseck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield. I will never understand the animosity of "Robin Hood: Tight in Man's", but when I see it, I know a great comedy. <br /> <br /> "Robin Hood: Tights of Men" *** Out of ****.
