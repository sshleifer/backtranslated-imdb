It's a top car flick (it's a work of art / a work of the YER industry!) All the classic cars are not superbly plastic, I saw it over again, I wear two video tape and will wear a lot more. A lot more car lover young or old will love this movie and it will see more than 1 time! So rent it or buy it (just watch it) I want them to create more (car) movies such as this V8 power does not awaken little whiper sniper !!!! <br /> <br /> (351 right? (motor magic) (chariot hip) <br /> <br /> (You will learn to feel power)
