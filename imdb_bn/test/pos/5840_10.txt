Tom Fontana's Unforgettable "Oz" hands down one of the greatest television series ever made. Brightly written, played, and operated, it gets closer to the perfection of any art form (movies, television, literature, music). As a result of its extreme cruelty, it creates a world of prisons that are filled with characters, which are terrifying from sympathetic to flat. This is a show that does not exceed any cruel thing, its eyes can not be closed. The combination of professional-trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a range of different and all original performances. <br /> <br /> And when the show is universally admired and is a trusted fan base, nobody can feel that due to other HBO plays such as "The Soprans", "Sex and the City" and "Six Feet" It was less appreciative during its television run. And these shows are in fine and boring skills, many people forget that it was "Oz", which was the first entry of HBO's one hour television drama series. It was a bold, risky first entry and HBO with it hit a grand slam with it. It gets as good as it gets.
