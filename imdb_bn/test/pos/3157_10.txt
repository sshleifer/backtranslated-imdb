This is interesting because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it is either a love or a hate affair. You'll probably love it or hate it too. I think the best films divide people because they have no effect. I'm in a five star camp because this image was a real number to me and I wanted to go back and learn more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I must admit that I was beautifully tuned when all that was happening. Especially in Afghanistan and I feel guilty about that. The music through the movie was beautiful. Especially for some time in the historical flashback, I lost it. Personally, I thought the audio was great. I think soundtracks with lectures, music and radio have been put together so that you think you're in the gym, the main character, or RV on his head. Everything was not very clear on the radio and everything on the radio was actually on the radio. However, this is a very amazing DVD that made me cry.
