I am the first person, sympathetic to the suffering of Schmidt, we see in this episode. He reminded me of the badness associated with the only security force somewhere at night - almost 20 years ago I shortened the type of work. Of course, I was never in danger of burning a crisp, desiring the title of the colony (Lynch). Here in the darkness of the murder of members of a deep mine colony, the monster creates a scary impression in the first action. We do not see it in early scenes, and many of us realize that the best monsters sometimes go to fantasy. 'Big and Shaggy' describes one vowel, but in fact it looks similar to a large, drunk pepperoni pizza, skittering the ground like a silicon centiped - a limitation of the show's budget, unfortunately. It also shows the latest matte paintings, which is famous for Trek fans, the only way to reveal a long shot of mining operations. <br /> <br /> However, the whole theme of this episode is not about the inside, but the external appearance, however. Sure, this Harta, newly discovered silicon-based life-form, looks like a monster of the mind at first glance. Speak telepathic power (perhaps the best use of the Valkan mind for the purpose of the plot) Thanks, we learn it is a very intelligent, even advanced animal. Along with his practical support for using his talent to speak, McKay surpasses his usual medical routine - healing a creature similar to stones or asbestos. He said to sing one of his most famous lines, "I'm not a doctor, not a brick!" In his view he has found true real life, where he enjoyed successfully, although he can not share Kirk with his enthusiasm - Kirk's very busy organizational outcomes The story spreads unexpected changes in the character and motivation of the audience as a progress; Speak champions probably take the normal position to prevent the red-shirt's death (any half step, as "Man Trap") as the need to preserve this inventive life. But later, because of which Kirk fired a murder blast, for some reason that the victim's body was wearing and the time of reflection on the point of speech (I believe that it was during this episode filming) Shatter learned his father's death). Uncharacteristic for most of the first season, this has been a happy ending. Contradictions arise from the necessity of basic capitalism, such as meeting the standards of natural environment and against the protection of its residents, a place age of protecting Oulu from the modern progressing tractor. Because, despite many killings and a sense that can go to hell with a raised phasar, Kirk and Spark handle a deal broker by satisfying everyone. I think people and silents are more reasonable in the 23rd century.
