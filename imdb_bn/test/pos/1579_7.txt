GUITS of a Beauty A little better than a virgin's predecessor GUTS. Although this movie does not really have anything to do with the first episode but in this sense it is not a sequel but I like to be very strong and keep it together better than Vargin ... but then again, that's not really saying much. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY started off as a fairly rough and direct face-absorbing film. A couple of Yakuza cat hold a young prisoner and started raping her on most brutal fashion. This selflessness continues, the chief man told the girl that he did the same to his sister and sold him as a slave in Africa, and they would do the same with him. Then they shoot her with some drugs and rape her more. She somehow gets tired and ends with the clinic where the nurse listens to her grief story. Rape comes out of pressure from her previous experience and commits suicide. Clinic activists, moved by the story of young girl, decided to take revenge on the gang trying to hypnotize him to seducing the lower-level people and killing Yakuza leaders. This whole plan has been brought back, so now Miss Wiegelant-Clinic-Worker has encountered similar treatment that got our original rapie - just bad (some rough butt-rape is in line with gang rape before rape ...). She is very addictive, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly fierce prey ----- It turns her into a raging hermaphroditic blood demon! (No sh! T, it will really happen !!!) whenever the wife takes something really nice! Demonstrates murderous murder scenes - This is a very enthusiastic book-explosion-rape which is the Alien and a bad porn, and my choice - a head-stain-by-giant-killer murder (complete with giant Jon-nut ...) Can be done ... <br /> <br /> Certain things are going to be a beauty goiter, but still very hesitant feeling. Beauty seems to be gathering in an incompatible way, like almost two different movies. Still, I have to credit the film - rape scenes are very rough and miserable, and killing scenes are completely outside the wall. Another crazy J-awful "classic" is a tough 7/10.
