We see a man coming out of town and changing dramatically - his family asks questions, but he becomes crazy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The wonderful location, great actor, a movie that mash as "thriller", but which lead to madness among the lead people Case-study in case. <br /> <br /> As part of the film, the picture was above the other screen. The best luck of the team reached this photo. It's a grand masterpiece, a grand guignol, noir. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that "10" prevents that words and music are sometimes powerful. It's the way to get the image, which speaks for itself.
