I saw the Toronto International Film Festival 2:37 in September and it was blown up by! This film opens in a panic scene, at 2:37 pm at Adelaide High School. After returning to the beginning of the day, this scene was left unexpectedly and is known at the age of teens, who are ready to go to school. The audience becomes intimate with each major character, and faces daily problems - such as drug, imperfection, homosexuality, rape, and violence. Each scene is played repeatedly from various thirteen views and Gus Van Sant's elephant is memorable. This is the first time a great movie by director Murli K Thalali. It was created with non-professional student actors and was purchased through a script's unprecedented 76 draft. It plays the role of Melody, displaying stunning performances by several student actors, especially Teresa Palma. The age of this arrival is both intimate and thoughtful with a wonderful and annoying end.
