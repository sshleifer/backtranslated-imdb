As long life fan of Kung Fu film, I would say it is the best one I have seen. There is nothing special about the plot but people are entertaining it. As the section has the most movies. This image is packed with action and its audience does not warm. When I saw my face became quite smiling. It also has an impact on future movies like Bill Bill. (For example, this movie has sound effects from the Kill Bills.) This is a visual scene for all the viewers in Kung Fu. The open form for closing this image is filled with fierce fighting that I really see something continuous. There are some Kung Fu films that measure up to the perfect magic and entertainment of this film. So check it out definitely for a great Kung Fu movie search.
