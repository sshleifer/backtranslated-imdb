I was very impressed with this film from new actor Dir./Witer Jose Reyes. Cast was excellent. "George Cordoba" is a strong <br /> <br /> and frustrated as the main character of "RAFA". These talents are inspirational to see independent films with this level. <br /> <br /> It gains talent, courage and determination and creates a good quality film. <br /> <br /> I suppose that I appreciate someone who can take ideas from the idea and go to the mile. <br /> <br /> People are easy to judge young film makers more strictly, but I'm "Jose Rys" <br /> <br /> Congratulations and talented cast for their successful endeavor.
