Let's do one thing straight, it does not get 7 out of 10 on a normal scale, but from the bad film scale This is a movie that is hired for you, where you knowingly knew it was a terrible threat and was heard by everyone else. <br /> <br /> I made a promise from the movie, the train will have a snake, and it will distribute it! <br /> <br /> <br /> Gore itself is really good, and characters have extraordinary roles. Let's get everything from stoned train pilots to girls' trafficking drugs, even an electric engineer has got its pump! You will see some helpless nudity, explosion, snake, gore, and a Mexican chief lead her cracked pipe around healing his girlfriend and walking by the smoke leak in her mouth !! As I mentioned and there are many, the pacing of the film is a little bit far away, but still respectable. <br /> <br /> Such films keep the tradition of bunding together and make one or two pieces to look at each other beautifully. It can be a good time to spend together after coming together to enjoy a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> It may learn some or both of the other fine flickr choices, such as aliens lockdown or b vs python, but there are some big shoes to fill it out. <br /> <br /> There is a hard 7 in 10.
