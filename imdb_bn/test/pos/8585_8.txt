I call myself Belgian, I see interest in the history of the Congo. It has been our only colony for many years (Rwanda was protected by Belgian, but not colonized), and it is part of our country's history. It seems very popular nowadays that what the Bengalis did in Congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying that something bad happened. Of course they did, but back then this was not unusual. Do you really think that the French or Brittas were so inferior in their colonies? No, they were not. It was 'normal' when using Kongo as a way to get our King Leopold II private property. It was his personal property (it was not then part of the state) and he tried to do more than it. Of course, terrible things have happened like closing tastes and standards that are not standard in today's days, but in those days it was a common practice. And it should be said, these have not happened in the last decade ... I know many people who worked in Congo many years before declaring the independence of Congo. It is true that they had many black slaves, but they are very nice people and I can not imagine that they ever treated them badly. As far as I know they always treated them with great respect (but I'm not saying all the Belgians). In fact, if they are not old (now about 80 years old) they would love to return to Congo. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that it historically gives the right perspective what happened in the last years of the Belgian regime and in the first years of the independence of Congo. The story is black and not white (probably the best word in this context, but to explain what I mean) how I was scared. It is not saying that the Belgians were wrong and all Congolese were good. It fully shows how the Congolese could not get help from the Russians and American Americans, who were more focused on raw materials like copper, diamond, bauxite, rubber, in an effort to become independent from the Bengalis. , ... and was not all interested in getting Congolese in their political camps and their freedom. It did not give a good idea about how Lumumba became more powerful, but not how Mautu played a dual role. It shows Belgian reactions to violating, threatening, and even killing some of our countrymen. (My father was one of the Paratroopers to send the Congo to the rescue of the Belgian). It gives a good idea of ​​political problems because the Lutumba province did not want to be part of the Congolese republic of Katanga province, it was not the role of killing the Belgians on the lavumba ... all of which took part in this film. <br /> <br /> The story looks very correct and the characters actually look and act like real. This film has been able to give a very good idea to everyone who is interested in the history of Congo and in the late half of the fifties. But it should also be seen in history classes, especially in Belgium, because it is a part of our history which should never be forgotten. I pay it 7.5 / 10, probably an 8/10.
