This movie is excellent! Angel is beautiful and the scamp is adorable! When his horrible heels are afraid to smile, the most interesting parts are: the scandal is covered in the screen and 'I have never felt it before' when the Angel and Scamp sing. Perfectly recommend this movie, it is coming special edition on June 20. The cover is a trash can and the scalp on the underside of the foot. <br /> <br /> I am romantic, charming, funny, and adorable in this movie. Funny junkyard scene, all junkyard dogs have something special. The fun I laugh, the kids will love it. Buy it when it comes, it has new features!
