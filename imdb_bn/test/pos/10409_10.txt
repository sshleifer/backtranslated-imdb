Anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not awesome. Some people enjoy gorefests with the line and character development of subpar stories. I personally enjoy horror films that monitor the atmosphere and interesting concepts (e.g., two daughters, Kairo, etc.). Any type of horror movie that you personally love, only a few people who really scare you. Nore is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary-style film, which means that the whole film is a collection of video clips that are related to the legend of a genius entity named Kagutba. A journalist has filmed his own footage in interviews with people involved with giant customs related to Kalpana Bagh, then summarized the footage from other sources related to his research. Despite the fact that the story itself is fraud, how do the results that feel very real and very annoying cool down? <br /> <br /> Some people compared Nororo with The Blair Witch project, but the only similar documentary style. One obvious difference between the films is that the viewers get scared by combining events by using different sources of Nokia. For example, the journal has recorded outside of a house that he is studying and looks somewhat strange on veranda. Later in the film, a clip from other character's home video that introduces the same strange phenomenon. Visitors link two incidents in memory and start running cold below their spine. Another example involves a television show with a child psychologist who gives correct answers to a single question other than singles. In fact, his answer is so wrong that viewers may wonder what the filmmakers think. After, however, that wrong answer enabled an extremely annoying incident to be linked out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the greatest horrific scenes in horror movie history. I do not say this thing lightly. This has completely destroyed me in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of filmmaking have been well done. Kagetbagh's legendary and formal background is very interesting and most actors have done well. The only over-the-top performance comes from a man who should be crazy in some way, so it is expected. Cinematography is deliberately rosy because it is supposed to present the shot video of all camcorders in the footage. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were great. In some cases they create other worldly feelings (for example, static interference or the first termination), but in other cases they are realistic in despair (for example, second end). <br /> <br /> When all is said and done, I went down as the most horrible movie I ever saw. As far as I can say there is no film of existence that provides such terrorism from the end of the night like Noreyi. Now look at it.
