I was hoping to suck this movie, but what I got was a nice good slash / gore film Death scenes are mostly brutal. Than teens decent, Penny McNamee is definitely good bunch. Rachel Taylor looked like a young Christie Brinkley, but did not bring any other movie than that. Why the killer was as good, and as a horrible juggernaut is completely credible. I saw "Twist" miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> But genuinely standing near me was that direction Gregory Dark could actually have a career in legal film before him. Awesome movie "Speed ​​cam" (you know where the person's face will jump quickly?), There are too many shots here. The camera angle and environment really emphasizes the size of the Ken, because he's actually looking bigger than that. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep story or a letter, it is not. But that's not about slashher movies. If you are looking for some good violence, or if you're in poor films, check this out!
