Just see it! It's a smart movie but very difficult to understand for the first time. See it once. Everything you watch or listen to on the screen is intentionally created to create a feeling, sensation, or voice. The transparency of certain visions and crispness of some words deliberately vaguely contrasted with images or pop, crackles, herses and barely audible words. The structure is non-linear and intricate. Repeat the motif as time moves both clockwise and counterclockwise. The "plot" and character-related expectations are defined as a non-traditional film image, both narrow and humanitarian, as both old stories. It is a part of the review: "The American film is emotionally intense, intellectually stimulating and deeply annoying in the amazing and unusual ways." Diane Dennis, PhD
