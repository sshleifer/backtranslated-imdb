All right, I got a DVD set last week and I'm finally getting closer to posting my reviews, but I definitely liked this way in many ways. <br /> <br /> Z Zombie Bloodbath 2: Amaze Rage. OK. This movie at a quick clip, has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style. I really would continue the record that the most stylish DV shot I bought it could be Flickr. Most of the time, I'm angry with DV movies to look like annoying and soap operas. Even I like that a movie like Bone Illness, Dull has incredible stretch. This is not the movie. It does not stop long enough to let you catch your breath. Although I do not say that I liked it better than the first movie, but I would say that within two years the sheets are technically advanced. Among these, a good gore, inevitable jumbo feeding scene, skumgang characters, and some acting actors (though their role is different) is primarily a good psychopath with the killer Mollet from Jerry Angle Hell. Shots are more ambitious and scripts right now because you can say that the sheets are trying to stop far more than that in the first movie. Some of it works and nothing in it, but I must say that at least he is not trying to do the bigger version of the first movie. At this time there was almost no mention of chemical spillage power plant, only satanism and the mystery which made life alive. So I try to do something with this one, tell Mr Kidos the sheet. I give up two bloody thumbs in this picture!
