This is an unusual film because it is made by Quarter-Century Fox but it is one of the few pairs of Barbara Stanwick and her future husband Robert Taylor. Many times, Stanwick is making many different studios (RockyOs, Paramount and Celestian) movies, since he made me in this topic, but Taylor was an MGM contract player, so he appeared in the film because he was given a loan in Fox - sometimes some studio in this studio Has been there. <br /> <br /> The picture is interesting because there are people in many real life roles, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction. You will play William McEnalli, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Deeway players. I can not remember any film with either McKinley or Davy as a character, although I think remember Roosevelt the Wind and the Leon and a few other movies. Three Cheers to see a film as a main character "less president"! <br /> <br /> This picture begins with McKinley taking a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) aside and calling him a special agent for him - and no one even called the Secret Service. Because the President is afraid that anyone in the organization is closing a gang which is robbing a long robbery - all based on the information inside. So it is Taylor (who is not particularly known for his mental role - especially at this stage of his career) as a lip and responsible for the gang and find the internal people. [<br /> However, there are two serious complications. First, he was able to find gang members, a gang member's stop-sister, a Stanwick. Taylor has found that she has fallen in love with her, but she also has to perform her duties and return to the authorities. Second, because in McKinley, another truly real man, McKinley is facing serious problems while killing and Taylor is hanged for death penalty !!! <br /> <br /> The movie has done a great job to create a story and establish it in a historical context. Although today most people do not remember McKinley and he did not even kill, remember that the film has been set in this interesting period. The acting is quite beautiful, because they are supported by Victor McLaggellen and Brian Donley, although I should admit that Donlievi's role was commensurable and more compelling than many other film roles. Overall, it is very interesting in the section of the romance, well written and very sad. A good trip for all.
