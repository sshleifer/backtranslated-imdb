When I first started the movie, I thought of Chesi. The first ten minutes were really annoying. After a slow start and after soap opera antrix, I started to like it. The plot was different from what I saw. Now, what was it horrible? Not really. It should not be classified as a horror or producers could add more money to the film for fear. As it was, the animals were there for only a short time there. I can only guess because of this money. <br /> <br /> The good direction was that the movie was very entertaining. This is my interest (after the start) and I am surprised by animals from other levels. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this was the first movie to be a director, but there were a few highlights. In the end, I was hooked. Very bad Hollywood did not make more money behind this.
