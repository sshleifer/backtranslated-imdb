There are some films made on this kind of grand scale and have made so much difference in the film making industry. <br /> <br /> "Bronnoset Patiomakin" is one of the films, and it should be the list of anyone looking to learn more about movie history. <br /> <br /> Grigory Alexander and Sergey M. Eisenstein has guided this groundbreaking film, which records the horrors of a Russian war. When the sailors finally take vengeance against their superiors, the locals embrace them and support them. The things get ugly when a team of soldiers is sent to a small town for the care of the business. One of the most imitated scenes in movie history is followed. I just realized that anyone who saw "untouchable" and "bronicates ptoomkin" <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this film has raised the bar for filmmaking, as it did "dissonance" some years ago. If you do not think silent movies, please have a look at yourself and see "bronenaceate pityamine". <br /> <br /> If you do not like silent movies, then see "Bronnoset ptoiminone". <br /> <br />
