Even if you do not understand Germany, this movie will send you cold under your spine. I first saw this in my German class at high school and it was found in my local Wall-Mart for $ 5. I've seen it at least 20 times * It's just a few years ago * and it's great to watch the movie night. The plastic agency is mostly practical, used from the body of the world. This was a lash out of that movie. A German doctor named Dr. Death * began to plasticize the human body to show nickname, and now the physical world is a travel agreement in Chicago IL. Many people were opposed to this and so a great German horror movie was created. I personally like this movie and like Thriller Slasher films that recommend it.
