<br /> <br /> 'The Last Frontier' has overcome a lot of deficiencies in building a high western life (Victor Mature), Gass (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationship with the army. , Especially Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Proston) and Cornell's wife Cornina Marston (Anne Bancroft). After losing their supplies to Indian, Jade, Gus and Mango, the scout has been appointed as a 'living in a fort on the edge of the last frontier' to live civilized lives. Jess, who was raised by Gus, both inspires and looks at the 'old' Gass and Mingo, and especially the time to deal with 'civilization' is very difficult. After realizing his kenina's wife Corina, her real problem started. Colonel Marstones is a helpless man, who endangers everyone around him with the dream of a ruthless victory over the opponent. Corrina, the pressure of a woman to delegate her station and responsibility, she loves what she can do for her and for what she does. Captain Riordon was caught in the middle, a brave and intelligent man jumped into his duty to the military, his fear of his strong friendship with Z and the possible disastrous fear of the colonel's helplessness. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < > <br /> First, scrappy. Almost all mistresses (especially the lazy colonists) have done well somewhere else, but rarely combined with such barbarism. When you know what's going to happen next, it just falls from a different direction. Possible Speakers: `The Last Frontier 'is the production code film (the word' virgin 'was banned in the previous day), it is very surprising that the reason for the adultery was conducted in such mature, tolerant ways. I was hoping to punish Z. or Colonel's wife for some of their sins. I was surprised and disappointed that the movie does not misuse the expectations of the less expected end. <br /> <br /> Second, casting. At least ten years old mature, wild fools are raised in the jungle to play a part of Z. James Whitmore, who plays Gus, said, 'Jade is a man who is five years old rather than mature.' Despite that, maturity is very respectful, civilization is not innocent in any way but silly in any way. Although there were a number of actors at that time who could play the role at this time (most notably, Bert Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), no one could play well in Jeddah. Preston (also mature's junior) playing Colonel Maestron, missing a tick and influence from such kind of people is a missing. However, Preston expressed his full respect to anyone who wanted to show him such foolish fools in the Colonel of Marston. A particularly impressive choice as Bancroft Corrina. Bancroft's dark haired blonde has died, and it has the same effect for Winona Ryder ('Edward Sisorhands') and Christina Rixie ('Slip Hole'). That is why I do not know why I am hesitant about the character; I believe that blondes and brunettes have enough skin tone and eye shadow. In addition, Benchraft has always shown the hardness that the borders of hardness (here the golden hair makes him a bit mild). This 24-year-old bunrft enables toe toe with both 40-year-old mature and 37-year-old Preston; Yes, he might be the wife of a colonel. Madison maintains a careful balance of tasks such as Reordan, plays a complex role and sometimes manages strange conversations. More efficient work is done by playing a role similar to that of John Wein in 'Madison' Fort Apache '. <br /> <br /> The movie has a 'Silverado' type camaraderie. That alone makes it worth watching. It has memorable performance, beautiful scenerary and great action and direction. I hope a Letterbox version is available (much lost), because this movie takes full advantage of this format.
