I (unfortunately) saw the double version. <br /> <br /> Student Pla Henning (Frank Patent who was also in the novel "Run Lola Run") was a deadly medical student who went to a prestigious school in Germany, but soon discovered that some students were missing and that they were in body exercises labs The organization works incredibly fresh ... <br /> <br /> I saw the version of the tomb seized. It hit a lot (words that do not match the lips are boring real quick) but I still like what I have seen. The performance was good, it was neatly photographed, it was not very awesome and I was not bothered. Even more refreshing was a favorite heroine, when bad guys went after them. (Light) Nudity is a refreshing twist, male! Beno Farman (who was awesome) mentioned a previous poster, but I can not remember it. Yet it's a well-done, scary and nice thriller. Since I read the original German language version, the best (I do not suspect for a second) but the dubbed version is worth seeing. I give this a 7.
