Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Once the heroine addicted Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) came out of prison She is trying to enlarge the band as a drummer in the left-wing prison, with partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), Joyce (Alan Parker) and the cat molly (Kim Novak) on the side of the painful cat. Tu his big break until he junkie- high stakes games Dealing card was no good doing one thing else comes along. And try him as soon as possible, even the prison did not cure him from his addiction to Satan's narcotics - causing him to tell lies about running lies and feeding his habit of feeding his habit. <br /> <br /> When people think of Frank Sinatra, they usually remember the cover of My My Skin, New York New York and the classic hypead song. You have to be But if one forgets that he was actually a famous actor, and if his performance is not enough from here to endlessly from the acclaimed, then he will also remember for this cut-off play, for the highly prohibited drug abuse. <br /> <br /> This image is often listed as a matter of graphic heroin use (probably behind the 15 certificates) when it is a subject that is still heavily pushed underground. Sinatra fined in the main playwright's screenplay, expresses total frustration, frustration and sincerity, which is losing his second chance. His cold turkey scene is more intense than Ian McGregor of Transposing. To make the first co-star an impression, Parker, as a liability for her husband's accusation and the impact of his wife on the needs of his wife, poor persecution, and the effects he can make. Novak still managed some powerful moments as his secret lover, but fewer stars than Parker. Stang is his usual comic refresh thing, his leftist Sidekick who captures leading people around his stunning New York accent. <br /> <br /> The director sometimes lets the speed of auto-racing to be slightly dragged, but it still enriches the immense twists and bars to enlarge the film, and that should be admired for being one of the first films to be so vividly so vivid. ****
