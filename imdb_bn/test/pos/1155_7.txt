The idea that "the wind and the lion" is beyond the real diplomatic event is a very great adventure in the desert of Africa. <br /> <br /> A group of Arab tribes kidnapped El Russiuli (Shan Connie). Outside American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith), American women (Candice Bergen) and his two children get some discount from his country. Outside of this simple plot John Milies received a very complete and enjoyable movie in this genre. <br /> <br /> The location of outdoor confectionery, an impressive color photography, very well-operated action sequences and perfect settings turn an image. Greatness is one of the epic with an undeniable sense. Musical score is also amazing. Compatible with it. <br /> <br /> Shan Connie can play a very good role as an Arab leader and proof. So Candice Bergen looks at the power of those dangerous situations as women but as deep inside is scared and her weaknesses; He appreciated the connery and even realized their complete focus on accomplishing the life arising from their completely different cultures. Brian Keith starred in his role as American President Teddy Roosevelt <br /> <br /> The most entertaining and very good film genre of this series. Give it a chance, you will not regret it.
