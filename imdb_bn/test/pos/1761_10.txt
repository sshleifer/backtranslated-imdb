"Happity Gear to Town" was the second and last full-length animated feature made by Max and Dave Fleshar, who created Parallel Universe in Disney. Although Disney's movies are still memorable, both flyers have forgotten the "Gore's Travels" and this movie. <br /> <br /> "Happi" is not the kind of adaptation to the first spell. That's a major plus, one would think. No, critics rarely get into them to start from the flalists. Yes, the story is not as tight as "shooter", but how can you hate a movie that makes you so happy? <br /> <br /> This is a crime and a very involved story, which will reveal a crime. Characters are loving and charming and have heart in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> After tanking at the box office, most of them will be dedicated to a relayer. It's embarrassing that they could not continue to feature. Who knows? Their next attempt could become what they were looking for to achieve. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4
