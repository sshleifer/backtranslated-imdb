- The Best Bit: When the gentle mobster (Nicholas Turturro) called out the runway (Matthew Modin) "Shane! .. Shane back!" And when the old man asks him, "What are you doing?" She's just "enjoying my time!" Actually like me at the moment! <br /> <br /> - The most obscure part: I've always been surprised to see: Where did I see that girl before? Where? Where? Until I find off the credit .. Until my Allah! He (Elizabeth Berkley) .. from Schabberg 'fiasco! But I just did not recognize him with his clothes! I felt a shaking vibration to tell the truth. He was really cute and beautiful but perhaps Hollywood had no mercy! <br /> <br /> - Most sexy bit: When (Berkeley) says "Do you mean an element that gives you a bout?". <br /> <br /> - Maximum details: A day after the detained assistant and the car is still alive on the night and in the end it is healthy !! ??, Mexican runner took 3 bullets (same car!) And he is not dead !! ?? <br /> <br /> - The most painful thing: those who killed everyone, as well as numerous (F) wards in an annoying amount! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful thing: crazy cute script with all the fun character and unhappy situation, especially the love of Paul Rodriguez (who was Paul Rodriguez), who stole the show (as well as his best conversation! ). The most frustrating thing: Although the aspect was not abhorrent about the deviation of the story, at the same time it is a unique touch, disagreement signed, some crazy stories itself, one of the laughs. But maybe less production is better! And of course, easy tosle music that can be cheap production! <br /> <br /> - The most confusing part: (Matthew Modin) is a genius but what did he do to get out of the "A" star list? Probably what he could create (or not!) Can be finished in light-free jolt (shipment)? <br /> <br /> - The most missing scene: Where did the Mexico Runner (Jose) go? I thought that we would see him again, as a surviving minor criminal, once more the runner could implement such a world in such a shorter world. <br /> <br /> - At the end I had the most questions: when would we see (Run - 2)? As I'm very interested to see that the subtle little sunny hurly-burly atmosphere is again! <br /> <br /> This was my own answer.
