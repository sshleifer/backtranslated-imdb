O god Obviously, when you rent or buy it, you are not expecting to see a documentary on their habit of habit of habitual practices in natural habitats. You're expecting a visual festival of blood and gore and even a fear or two. Well, for those who are sick and stomach like me, you will not be afraid much, but you will come near the urine to urinate yourself. The phrases caught in this movie are with you and your friends forever. It was shown to my friends and colleagues for the first time three years ago, but we still have our asses smiling and using catch phrases. It's addicted to Sam Rime's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive / Branded and Funny. From the ridiculous dialogue of the opening scene, in the best works of Splater and Gore section, in the extraordinary capacities of the film Edward Ed, you will laugh again and laugh. As far as blood and gore visual festival, oh yes, they got it. And they are very beautiful for this ... "The neck and bones are attached to the head and bone ..." I have sometimes seen the best nightmares / hallucinations / perfectly soft scenes scene. And that one does not mean to be funny, but people do it well (and unclear.) Above all, blood bunch and not a good time against anyone, if you see this movie it !!!! It's on Netflix, for sure that I have.
