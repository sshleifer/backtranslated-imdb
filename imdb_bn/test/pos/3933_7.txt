Many people watch this film for the presence of Paris Hilton, but the film is not a good reason to protest. Reality is part of the fairly free part of Paris, and he spent most of the movie. The film makes fun of him on several occasions, usually with a camera and at least once in the night vision. For those who enjoy the stage of Paris Hilton stage, it can be a movie to watch when the video is released, because during screening, I laughed at everyone's sadness through the movie and it was "suspicious value". <br /> <br /> The movie was very good (in contrast to the recent flooding of the worst horror of Flickr), it should be a good nightmare; A weird villain, too much violence, that made the average person cringe ... to hit all the bases of this movie. It's definitely worth a watch.
