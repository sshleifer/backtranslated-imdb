I was lucky to have this picture coming to TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's hard to find despite being a hitcoach classic. Unfortunately, it also has errors, some of which have repeated it after the ock. First off, the end is very little and "perfect". In the last few minutes, for the past five minutes, there are exciting tensions; Then, five minutes just cleaned everything completely ... very dissatisfied. For the last one hitcock film, too dramatic. He was always the master of suspense ... why would he stoop something less as a cheap action sequence for the end? In addition to some flaws, the film is superb. The plot is nice; One of the best and most universal. Theme? Easy. You met a stranger. A perfect stranger He proposes to kill someone for you ... you know that you want to stay with someone (if there is nothing else, but unconsciously). Have got caught? He asked you to do the same for him ... Would you take this malicious but clever action? You are clear of doubt, and so he ... after all, you know someone hunting. And you do not know each other, either ... You're just 'unknown to the train'. Bright ideas, and one that can do almost every single relationship. Good pacing, you do not lose interest or patience. The cinematography is good, but it's not as good as the others, like the hitcoach movie. Acting flawless Characters are well written, trustworthy and realistic. Hitcoe uses some elements that he often uses; Domineering mother, mother boy, etc. The picture is very good, but it drinks a little water. It is not that famous extra mile that it has been great. That's normal and brave before it crossed the line before it was closed. This is the primary reason for the film's failure to be great, but it is likely to be more than that, but mainly it is good. The last page you get offensive and disappointed. However, whatever is going on at the end is very good, so the film is still 8/10 worthy. Well, but not great. Any fan of Hitakoos will have to see it, because it is in its best ... it is in the list, but still there. I recommend it to any fan of Hitakoos. 8/10
