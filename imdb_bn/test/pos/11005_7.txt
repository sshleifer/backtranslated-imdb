I think Gerard's comment on DARE hit the nail on the head. Interesting movie, but very long This is definitely the sticky, sexy, Moore-style Doc's new school challenge. There is no descriptor, no information or side data interlaced, and no other hostage. What you see is a glimpse of the invisible world of Titan Saltman. As a huge dock fan, I am surprised how much attention I have lost to this movie, which means due to the length and lack of dialogue If the matter is interesting to you at the end, then I would recommend it. It is nicely shot, informative, and a valuable (and off) window presented in Tibetan saltmen (and women's lives) - all the important qualities of a good doc. But make coffee a big pot, it will help.
