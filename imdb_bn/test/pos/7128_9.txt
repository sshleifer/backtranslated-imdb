This groundbreaking film is really a work of art. I went to Convention at the Indiana conference with very little expectations, the title already saw two other films with "gamer" (both were so bad that at the end of second I left my one with my ankle straw and with a curved paper clip found in the original cushions with me Own eyes). But the "Dorkness" from the inaugural credit was to me. Temperatures in the northwest setting disappointing game master, Lodge (portrayed by powerful Nathan Rice) and his friends have created a beautiful backdrop for the plays around the band's ish band, those who set real life dramas are made available every day to meet the fantastic plays in the lodge. . After the first scene (they live in the fantasy world) they have fiercely tried to escape the frustration by returning to the earth. It compares so much in my own life that I moved away from tears. Rice's acting is such a great sophistication that I really believed in really 20 minutes that she was really a great man, disappointment, male pattern neck, and a boring group of "friends" that could not understand. Ideas like correct and wrong. Friends of the Laws Here are some notes: Leo, the oldest and heaviest of three, besides other jobs from the lodge. Yet, Gary feels socially proud of the youngest of the society. It seems only a little weird until Gary actually realizes the fact that her sexually misunderstood sophisticated "imagination" is less likely to be outside the world. This doubly confused not only for confusion but also informs and encourages the audience about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint about this is that actors from Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) appear to laugh at times, though they knew they were acting in a comedy rather than a hard disk. Hit / hit the play While talking about the work, Brian Lewis made his film debut as the third and most influential member of the film's first debut case, the Motley Cruway of Lodge. The tension is always high when he is on screen, when he is debating disputes emotionally about his faith while displaying his extraordinary martial arts skills as a "luxury" or "luxury." Or even when it turns around and encounters the audience, and lets listen to the hearing in the audience so that his gorgeous chin does not crush. Lewis illuminated the screen without doing any work and I hope to see more of it in the future. Once the action has started in this movie, it is not just exited. Drama and Action Combination are so shameless that you can say whether you are in the middle of a rising action sequence or a sensitive dramatic moment. A thrill ride really epic proportion, "Gamers: Dorkness Rising" will recommend as I need to watch for those who love film. It was worth losing almost one eye. <br /> <br /> ~ Chip Diadelphic
