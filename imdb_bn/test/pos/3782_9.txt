Charlie was associated with a fantastic Chaplin film with multiple memorable moments. Charlie joined the army to fight in WW. <br /> <br /> He first went to boot camp, where he had to learn how to handle his rifle and how the line would continue. This is really funny scene because the tram is not used to keep its legs straight! <br /> <br /> Later you know that he is in the trench in France. Here the funny scenes include a hungry Charlie eat a Mesetrap cheese and read a letter from someone on the shoulder house. <br /> <br /> When Charlie goes to sleep, she finds her bunker's flood and her room snoring. This is such a fun part! I can not really describe it, just watch movies. When Charlie woke up, her legs became bent so she tried to 'wake up'. His second leg still looks soft when I was rolling over the floor ... while Charlie actually rubs the feet of his roommate! <br /> <br /> Then the movie turns a bit fierce, as Charlie shoots a couple of Germans from his cage (although it has been done in a very interesting way) and to draw close to the enemy, make him a tree-like personality, Save the friend. <br /> <br /> The last part is a French girl's trouble by hiding in her house. Then he has to save him and he will catch German Kaiser while doing it. To do this, he impersonates a German colonel or something. Charlie asked something in Germany and I love to take it as neon. The soldier shows him funny so that Charlie changes his mind: Joe! Kaiser was caught and Charlie was the hero ... But then he got up again in the bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream <br /> <br /> <br /> But who carries, this movie is so much It was funny that all mocked me. There is something to say about Chaplin's film (the next work has become more and more social commentary on a number of disasters around the world) and the best in the last sentence of the film is: 'Peace in the world, good for all mankind. <br /> <br /> Short: A Charlie classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10
