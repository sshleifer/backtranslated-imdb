Just saw it on the Hallmark channel. I was surprised by John Denver! This movie was full of clichés, but it should be expected (for the TV Christmas movie - Come!), The act is made for any other 80 TV movie. The story, as I said earlier, is expected and cliché, but still good. If you are looking for a campie christmas movie, it will of course be your irritable excavation. <br /> <br /> When I'm happy that this happened happened in Georgetown, Colorado. This is a real hill town in Denver West. <br /> <br /> I was never too old to be a Denver fan (I always thought he was very nice) but he was a good actor. He is very good like a good old boy playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm sure there will be again in 2007.
