This image is not actually stereoateip, nor dance dance, not pickup lines. This image was about the weaknesses of the human heart. Kevin James can play a strong role that Will Smith can be satisfied without any action, and such a hackneyed style of film can be successful. I do not want to fall in love with this film - it was not "groundbreaking" in any way - but it was a movie worth watching. Was it credible? No New York can not be so easy and there is no person in the history of mankind whose hits have "hootjah". Of course, there are bar stumps, but no dog can get any time - of course, without the rickshaw of seven numbers. The best thing for this movie was that it was not just a comedy, but a real focus even in the dramatic direction. It was a fun two hours, no doubt. But for more than two hours, you sit in your seat, immerse yourself in character and laugh.
