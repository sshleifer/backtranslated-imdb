I liked that mood was light and air. I liked that the character was sure about his future, and his roommate set him "direct" to everyone. I was guided by homosexuals that men's team members tackled dynamics how to deal with each other, there is a whole theme of manhood, out there, ridicule, isolated and questioned. What makes a man? What makes one straight, gay, or bisexual? You are not really sure if you are sure about who really wants our real character; He is at the moment to live and throw air alert. This, and for other reasons, love me this picture.
