The story of Swine Todd is remembered by the memories of classic writers like Charles Dickens, and memories of contemporary authors such as Edward Góry. As a musical, it naturally became like musicalables Les Miserables. The industrial revolution has both the deadly effects of poverty and the breakdown of organized society. But this music is different from Les Miss's very important point: Steven Schmidt, a song writer who can adapt to a style. To be sure, there were successes and failures, but you can always rely on one of the things about its shows: they will be unique. Who would think that someone would compose a musical instrument about a sailor who snatches his neck and makes a pot of meat? Sondheim did, and he did it surprisingly. Under the entire show community, a factory is set up to recommend the most devastating effects of suffering, and it offers absolutely complete service to the show. Catwalks and railing are removed across the streets and walkways and bridges recommend. Strategies are visible from poetry and Noah and change the sets with visible stages. Then, to top it all, the great Angela Lancerbe played the humorous Mrs. Lovette and George Heron as a murderous Todd for her operative baritone voice, and you have a own musical car. The rest of the cast is completely smooth, except for Johanna and Pirelli, through the clichés of the love story, who louder aloud very loudly. If Johanna and Pareli can be here from the Broadway show, it would be perfect. He listened to OB's album listening when listening to more songs than Lane Kariyur, and these words are not forced to force here. Through this, the score of Sandhiham never fails to underline the dark gravity of the story. As I said, he can adapt to a style. In Fola, he followed Pacific Overlookers' showtimes' 30s' 40 second style, he captured fine art in Asia's music; Indu Odes closed Disney style songs 32 times, and Assassins added American music history. Here, though, he does amazing work in making English compositions from Gilbert / Sullivan style pattern to operative Dualite and soliloquies from Social Waltzes to definitely make his score. And yet still, the show remains deadly serious, although it provokes smile to any musical comedy. It's still a serious warning about evil to take revenge. The film makes a mistake in spending the judge's singles where he blames himself for his own crime. Without it, the judge is just a conventional villain, and there is no straight villain in this movie's point. Both Todd and Judge are too late, the horrors of accepting the responsibility of their actions, and Tod not loses all of his emotions. It is well illustrated by the intense reactionary revival of Swiny Todd, with the end of the burial with Tod and Love, we end up telling us that the last is the same: In the entire world of swine, revenge is only vengeance. "Join the story of Seven Todd, he served God in a dark and vindictive manner. He can lead hell to take revenge, but everyone does it, and seldom, Sweeney, the flight street daemon Barber's Swine Tod."
