It is very happy to see such a nice movie as it gets from IMDB users. Best Years of the Lives of Mehedies of the Syriac Statement of State of the Wards of Return Frederick March often overlooks the best performance easily. Indeed the whole cast, the music shines with the legendary Hogi Carmichael which treats us all with a fine version of its classic Lazy River. I would recommend this excellent film to those who love movies.
