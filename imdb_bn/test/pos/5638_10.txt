The most entertaining movie I've seen this documentary for several days. I had it for a whole day. The selected component pieces flow amazingly well and never forget the three letters that are impossible to develop. These people come back to create curious moving films about different levels of perseverance, loyalty and determination. These characters end up suprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable.
