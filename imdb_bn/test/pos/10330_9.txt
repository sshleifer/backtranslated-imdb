I absolutely like this show. It is not understood why it is called Bug Juice. It almost came when I was about 13. I think they have run on Channel 4 on the summer holiday, when Pongal summer re-run and something like bells or something was preserved. I remember sitting there and staying in the summer camp - haha. All its kids looked so much fun, it was all about "who are you discovering" and "growing up" First kiss and all that stuff. I think there was a really cute guy there, I think he got that special summer morning. They must have more enemies Daku-soap, I thought it was great!
