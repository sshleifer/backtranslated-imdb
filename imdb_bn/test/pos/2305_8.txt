In 1895, Twijie (Tasuussua Fuji), wife of Gitterburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yushuiqi), in a small village in Japan, is related to a man at the age of 26. Tizi was jealous of Gisbaura and gave plots to kill him. They pierce Gisburu and dump his body into a wooden valve, and so locals say that Gisburu is going to work in Tokyo. Three years later, the locals were gossip about the fate of Gisbara, and were so scared by his ghosts. When the village police authorities came to investigate the disappearance of Gisburu, the situation with helplessness and tiredness became helpless. <br /> <br /> "I no bori" is a supernatural and supernatural love story. Siki's repentance and criminal conviction allow her to see the ghost of her murderer, spoil her boyfriend's perfect plot. The painting has been endangered by the quality of VHS, published in Brazil, but has a very good view, including "ring" and American rickie "The Ring" using the view of the inner core of the same angle. Performance and direction are excellent "IA Noor Bory" making a great movie. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "And Imperio de Pixo" ("Empire of the Animals")
