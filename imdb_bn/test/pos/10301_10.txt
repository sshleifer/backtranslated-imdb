This movie is based mainly on people's emotions and interactions. There are only three locations (school, shop, and coach house) which are really used. This is mainly the coach's home, however. A movie does not have special effects or surprising scenes, it's amazing in itself. <br /> <br /> Meet with four friends who had bonded during their basketball. One is rich, important, and there is no real love beyond the meaning. One wants to be a mayor again, but his competition is to convince him. A school wants to be superintendent and wants to take care of his family. One is a travel alcoholic. <br /> <br /> First off, I love the actor in this movie. They all have my family name. They proved their worth here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was shouting about how the coach could win . He hit the whistle of the coach and yells back to his cufffeases - "Forgive my sins, I sinned!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
