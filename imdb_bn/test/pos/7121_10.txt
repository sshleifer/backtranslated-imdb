Gamers: DR is not a fancy movie, it's more like amateur video. The effect of horror magic, really fake firearms, horribly designed ornaments, castles, villages ...... sword, fog, shield, dress, plate ... oak ... everything. You will need 10 minutes to adjust your expectations on your perspective, then you will enjoy 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I'm from Hong Kong and it's really hard to find RPers, I do not play any friend RPG and I always fancy to be one of the characters in the D & D world. Watching Gamers: DR just show me what would be like a gamer. You see rule books, dices, game sets, etc etc etc; You hear the sound like "fighter", "wizard", "hit point", "level", "character", "burning hand", "Chaotic Evil". <br /> <br /> Let me do something you want, what RPG does not stop by the software RPG it is my fancy. Gamers: DR provide the same components, you do not know what happens next and probably it laughs dead dead to you. This movie is also in the real life of the game as well as the D & D world. When the action of the game takes place, you cast the gamma to the gamer, which makes you think that you actually participate in the game. <br /> <br /> I do not want to loot anything but briefly gamers: DR will definitely watch the movie for RPG lovers. People can not play GG games anymore, I'm sure you still get much fun from it.
