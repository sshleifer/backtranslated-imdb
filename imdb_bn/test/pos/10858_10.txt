I think Andrew Davies has done a commendable job of taking a great book, which portrayed the speed and styling of a Victorian novel, and it turned into a movable and entertaining film. I'm happy that I read the book once (twice) which is usually about me. I know that one must definitely see a novel and a film as a different media and accordingly they have to be judged accordingly. But, still, after leaving the best parts of the film, it is often difficult to read the original. <br /> <br /> I understand that Davis is a very good adapter, but I want the producers who like to write a screenplay. Davis emphasized the statement that he agreed with the film about the DVD, especially the book's more physiological bits. I certainly enjoyed the movie. But Davis missed a half-a-dozen moments, which is so frustrating, painful, that if she could have more sensitivity, she could include it. <br /> <br /> I will also take the issue of the primary symbol of the book, the use of roses. <br /> <br /> Because Davis's plot was plotted, the denial was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think it was a lot more interesting to give the author the name of Waters' pink symbol. And I like the novel that Davies likes Nan's "age is coming". <br /> <br /> A quick comment about four actors playing a key role. They are all amazingly gifted - well, without singing and dancing, perhaps - and, even then, their physical representations are as much as seen in the eyes of the mind when reading the novel before watching the movie. I thought they were all horrible. <br /> <br /> I recommend that any gay and anyone who loves good fiction, add velitti and book in their book book.
