"The Coach Trip" is one of those stupid comedies, which they sank in the 80's. In this case, Dan Akkodd is a psychiatric patient who has stood as a psychotherapist, and he goes to Beverly Hills in the Gulf of Charles Grodin. Most of the film's comedies are exposed to their satiric character (apparently a woman with a power struggle with her maid) in the lives of Beverly Hills and their people. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you just want to see is a good time. Do not expect any kind of religious experience. But Beverly Hills may laugh at how people laugh at their riches. Also starring Walter Matthew, Donna Dixon, and Gross and Victoria Jackson ("UHF").
