I did not have much faith at the beginning, but as a citizen of Costa Rica, I can make sure that the movie we live in day-to-day and shows a lot of our culture, such as the way we talk about, our music, without any weapon, without any fear we stand for our rights Our way to stay <br /> <br /> I'm really proud of the work I did and how they do not forget about the movie They did not care for us money, but actually working with a small budget, our beautiful view and great photography Appreciate it <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend watching this movie, you will not regret it.
