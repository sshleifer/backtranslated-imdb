Corniness alert Many fellow IMDB users already know that I am not a freaky, delicious person. If you do not want to read such reviews then go. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, you heard from a person who smiles through the titanic and almost breaks his parents' tape, continuously replay the propeller scene. <br /> --- Spoolers --- <br /> <br /> One day I went to the theater to see two friends Dickie Roberts: The former child star, in August last year. One rolled on the boring trailer until quietly start off. It was for radio. At the moment I saw the trailer, I would like to see the opening weekend of this movie. When that weekend rolled along, the scary movie was out there so many teenagers had a teenager waiting on Friday night. The film was sold out and the boys were so frustrated to see the movie, they went and sold a good boy and radio. I could not get the ticket and the next week, I was busy with more important things. About 5 months later, my friend rented a radio. He lent me and I saw it in my room. I'll tell you right now, I've never seen this movie that sometimes I cry. When Radio's mother dies, it comes out automatically. The next day, I went to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I'm just a fool for my personal story, I tell you about the movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Junior. Renowned radio stars as a mentally challenged man. Ed Harris co-starred and directed by Mike Toulin. Based on the real story, the radio is a teen who spent most of his life alone. He'll take a shopping cart that he can and always carry a radio. He got his own collection. At the end of the day he went home to his mother. She did not go to school until after the film. One day, the radio passes through the local high school when the football team is practicing. Fly on a football fence and the radio picks it up and continues. Ed Harris, Jones, Football Coach They meet and this radio's life. <br /> <br /> Throughout the whole movie, radio and coach Jones spend quality together, both of them teach each other. It's nice to see how the movie goes to the highest fun, lowest bottom and the radio can see its life. You will laugh, cry and live the radio life with him. This movie has a special place in my story with Toy Story and others. This is for the whole family by yourself, or if you are one who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Radio will not be forgotten by me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "We are not radio, radio is teaching us." <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Eliasson A.
