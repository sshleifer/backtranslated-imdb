Despite the title and other stories about love and war, this picture is not very sticky and pink, because love is like a rose: with thorns, that is. Four leading actors are realistic in their character and set in balance with a good sense and tragic and down-to-earth. <br /> <br /> The grave / chanson-escarp song and song songs (Geera singing itself in Nightclub) attracted visitors from one place to another, in a cruel battle and deep and deep. Peaceful love Some people may find it too much biophysic, but this is mostly romantic story, although it follows the lives of Dylan Thomas and the life of quarterly relationships, which becomes joyous and jealous. <br /> <br /> London is visualized from one angle at a time, during the bombing of Germany, the Bohemian life of Dillon was set in the floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, legs and bars. Independent women, soldiers and doings of the poet move away from the feeling of constant love and anger. <br /> <br /> The end is too thick and the light can hang slightly in the rest of the picture, but all of this is a romantic story.
