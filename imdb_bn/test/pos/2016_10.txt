I like this movie. This is a very simple plot and I understand what it is based on a true story. With the hard rock / hair metal grow in the 80's, this film can do something with my love, but it's a fun movie to watch except for music. Try it out, you'll love it until you are the most difficult of critics and just like "Citizen Why" movies.
