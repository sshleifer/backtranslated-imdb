Seeing this picture in the theater in 1984, I think 6 years old (you math) I absolutely love it. After two weeks I saw Tajan (the furniture was climbing, the monkey used to jump to make words). It started an affinity with Tarzan and Monkeys, but the long-lasting love for Christopher Lambert (remember that I've seen Hilland very soon). At the end of 1984 I saw that movie, almost a month ago. I was ready for the bed at 3:30 and then it was too late and I was tired and I had to work at 9.00, I watched this movie. Choice as a kid. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I realized that it was not too great and even a snout, Andy McDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was certainly difficult as usual, and surprisingly the monkeys still still held up handsome, but what was most surprising was Lambert was as good Tarzan. He was great! The depth of its depth was deep enough to bring this character through such a deep line, its primary physical language and its largest ship. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier I was Lambert fan, but I used to be the Hilandar, Hunting and the castle. He was really good at this film and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth. <br /> <br /> To make the short story way too long, I was a little disappointed because the film was not good, but I was happy to see Lambert was good and could not stay until 6.00 to see it.
