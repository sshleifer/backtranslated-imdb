The best one ever. Directions, illustrators, an exciting and dramatic history, wonderful soundtracks and most, incredible credibility of Susan Sardon and Shan Penn, the best and least devaluation "under-40 generation" actors. After watching this movie, I suppose that if there is anyone who has no doubts about the death of other people, what can he do despite the ugly things?
