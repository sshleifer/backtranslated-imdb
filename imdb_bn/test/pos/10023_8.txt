Felix watches an actor with her lines in Rihres: "Ham, A Hum! My State for My Ham Sandwich!" Falix tells the dramatic man that "to dedicate my art and go to the movies." She's in tears. Felix just looks like his crazy, and blurts on his shoulders. The old man tells Falic "Get ahead of you" and find meaning for a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks, "How does he expect me to get money?" <br /> <br /> <br /> In a few minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), she is the owner of the shoes trader in her "bankruptcy shop". Felix takes a plan to host him and the person promises a $ 500 cats if it works. <br /> <br /> All right, but people want to go alone and leave Felix at home. In a disgraceful scene, Felix transforms herself into a briefcase and she goes to Hollywood, just as she returns to her, transforms herself into a cat. <br /> <br /> We tried to show Felix's events. Her auditory scenes are very interesting, especially in imitation of her Charlie Chaplin. There are also some famous silent film stars and executive characters. In all, the 9.5 minute cartoon contains several elements. It's more amazing how much you can get in the extra 2.5 minutes, guess that the maximum animated shorts are seven minutes in length. <br /> <br /> There were so many smiles at any time and you could do more than just look at the cartoon, there is a sword with a huge mosquito like Felix! Crazy stuff.
