<br /> <br /> My favorite science fiction, unbelievable journey through unbelief and war of reality. Probably the best acting I've ever seen in Jude Law play. Incredibly original and a story line that revolves quickly with interesting character development and takes the film a couple of minutes to fully consolidate its talent. In the end it changes to start more fun watching again.
