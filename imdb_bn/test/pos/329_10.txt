Hello everyone! I went without any expectations in this movie, though I knew that Maniratnam gave a nice movie! I was amazed !! Retreat struggle between Sri Lanka and Tamils ​​living in the government. A young woman living in Chennai with the parents of the parents of Chennai went to Sri Lanka to find her real mother. The high point of the film is the performance of every actor and actress and actress, film-maker, editing and all other technical specifications. Cast and full sign of the crew. I want to mention cinematography because it brings war in such a way that you feel yourself there. Excellent work! Although the continuity of the war reminds me of the Savings Private Routine, this kind of work has never been tried in the Indian screen. Overall the movie is great! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I love to see this image again and again. An excellent film and one must definitely see.
