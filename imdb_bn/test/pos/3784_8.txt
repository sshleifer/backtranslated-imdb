Charles Chaplin's 1915 Kandar Arms was his longest film, although it was only 45 minutes long, it was not the most feature film. Drawing closely with the First World War, many popular entertainers of that time were playing their role to inspire their local soldiers and Chaplin was no exception. And so loving tram went to war! The film begins with a trump and the character is very much unfinished with martial arts and gun-sling in extremely simple military exercises, its drill sergeant's hatred. The tragedy then finds itself in the thrust, facing more terrible enemies, even though the Germans eventually turned out to be even infinitely infinitely more than that. Trump announces that at the monotonous moment, he held 13 German soldiers who had handed them all alone "around them", they kept me in pieces. <br /> <br /> There are many great moments in this movie. Chaplin awoke to find his sleeping barrack under water and could not literally detect his own feet, because his tube was easy to use from the record player's tube to sleep under the surface. <br /> <br /> The memorable scenes of the film undoubtedly hang the chaplin behind the trees like the dungeon. Responding to rebel German soldiers, in just a few meters from unidentified sworn enemies, they are very much pleased to be united exclusively, especially when a soldier occupies an apartment to cut firewood trees. <br /> <br /> This is a very enjoyable movie, and one of Chaplin's finest 1920's efforts is the best. Highly recommended.
