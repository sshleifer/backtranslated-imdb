SPOILER alerts <br /> <br /> I got this Deeno-Documentary DVD on Christmas 2002. I was interested to see it and I was not frustrated. The score was memorable (my <br /> <br /> was the "Sourpad" theme song and "Winters Coming" song). The effect was fantastic, you could almost believe they were. You actually learn a lot; Stegosaurs may have been able to pump their plates with blood. The female T Rex's Mite has gone on a killer spree before placing their eggs. I know that there are many people who thought a lot about this idea, but there will always be questions that we can guess. And there are many hard-core, indefinable fact as well. We know that some dinosaurs traveled in the ankle, we know that nicotisas consume stones to consume their insects. The series is very good despite this "speculation". Well actually, it spawned a followup, a prequel and a few particular specials. If you're a Dino fan, it's for you. It makes Jurassic Park small and hump appearance.
