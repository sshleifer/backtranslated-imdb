The book is better than most of the authors due to Ondersty's prose. I saw this picture, anyone who saw it, told me that love depicted in this film is not real. After watching this movie, I can see that suspension suspension on this issue can be confusing as well as other movie-viewers. Actually, the intense show of love was ridiculous and appears to be on the verge of parody. But in the end, everyone must understand that it is a big message in the industry. It is not particularly about love, but it uses "love" to dialectically divide human beings or arbitrary boundaries of nations that support war and hatred. This is a misconception and blind that follows us differently. Important scene for this movie's original theme when the protagonist or antiharyera applications are ignored for help in the desert for his helpless boyfriend and ignored for the reasons shown in that scene. It is also expected to hope and apologize for the picture, the hope of a reshaping character of Benoch and a different relationship between the Indian minorists (who are attracted to his friend-friendly relationship with his white colleague who eventually dies) and the first victim of the forgiveness character in the Cravaggejo and then he He thinks of his "crime" (betrayal of the country) of his war, refraining from it The hero will confess. I think the film is even better. I do not know if the realistic theme of the love situation is more realistic and the point of this film is not clear, but I admit this film is not about real romantic love, because the people behind it are the last lovers first seen when implying an elementary view of art or film pieces . How does a new car, broken cars, fast cars, etc. talk about heroes (I'm performing) still a car, it does not matter which adjective you put in front of it. He replies but there are many types of love of parental love, platonic love, romantic love etc. It is ridiculous because this film is really for love that would be for all people (or for peace) (which is not actually the real cause of the war, like most of us, "cars", let's say) otherwise, we can see the wall of ancient wall art / swimming Can be stuck dead in a cave in a broad desert with a picture, which says that sea and life-supporting waters which are once unseen I lost all of that, I believe, "The English Patient" won Oscars for this remarkable message, especially for the romantic love screenplay, the prize would have been the way to go. To attract the audience, there was a need for a hero and heroine relationship, unfortunately this scene of love was in development of divorce. May be old and so many units that can not be integrated into many levels So curious versions of the myth difficult to fall in love, even dinadrabyaguliteo, love has always been a film, especially old Hollywood. The film may be less than expected, however, regardless of the film can be seen in 7 out of 10.
