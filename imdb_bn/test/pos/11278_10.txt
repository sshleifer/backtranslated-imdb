Such anger can only be contained in a young person who seeks his religion and position on the earth with utmost importance. At the beginning of the film it has been said in the text, these images are dead: they are already past, and the product is right from the moment of preparation. But it is only for the creators of these "products": perhaps someone who is in the same mind (I think fewer people, at least those who are deeply interested in religion, go through the same horrific anger and suspect their personal development). And that, of course, the art is made in the first place: identification and comfort among fellow people. <br /> <br /> This film uses the "classic" technology of experimental movies very well. And these techniques are my opinion in my best possible use: these are not just like pure aesthetics, but they are not the end of the story of telling stories and making the atmosphere. Those "tricks" have already made many enough times. Other movies I imagine have influenced this director, "Erezhered" and "Nasferttu". These techniques are completely timeless by how the film is timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this movie. Or anything from a certain time. It can be made a thousand years ago. It is interesting in this story that how these people deal with this new born child: They use it selfishly for self-interest and even do not even try to hear him. They beat him, twisted his intestines, and threw him. They forced her to pull her living body from place to place. And they do the same kind of violence in his mother. The story reminds me of the short story "El Infroi de Brodie" in Barcelona. Also the criticism of the practices of Christian organization reminds me of "El Topeo" great. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the unpleasant clock, but beautiful. Very simple, thought and concentrated. Very strong movie, almost very strong. The whole human power has focused on this. This film also shows that when you have passion and sense, you can create a movie with a round zero budget. <br /> <br /> I must admit that "contemporary" visitors like me, because the trials It was so slow and demand. But after all, the price of sorrow. I have to give ten points to try to make such a movie.
