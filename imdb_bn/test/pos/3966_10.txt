Let's see ... let's see. Shrader (sp?) Said, "Ask me about my Wayne," when I was shown to show this film the only reason being was the commercial dog showing hot dogs Then I saw that movie and I saw it some of my friends ... and WOW is amazing. One of the best movies of the year. The whole movie I laugh like crazy! The plot of this story is that they are not acceptable in any schools (Justin Long), so he created another fake college for his friends so that he made his parents fool that he had made it in college. So he touched the end and he fooled his parents ... until more students see the website and see the clock (the one-click of the confession) and all these rejection come to this school. They face many problems and they just do not seem to be right. It is now liked to see it
