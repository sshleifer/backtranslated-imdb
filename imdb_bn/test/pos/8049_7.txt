It's hard to imagine that the "Battle of the Battle of the Elderbush", the legendary Dr. Dr. Griffith returned in 1914. This is a showcase for Griffith's emerging style. <br /> <br /> The story is located around a group of Cameron Brothers and their families, where a young Wife (mother Marsh) gave birth to her ancestors and gave birth to a young wife (Lilian Gish), who just gave birth. A team of Indians tries to catch a Wife pet dog and man is driven by them. Henry B., the son of Indian chief during the clashes Wothal was killed. The Indian took revenge on the main revenge, and Eldarash started attacking small communities of Gulch community. <br /> <br /> This attack, which is extremely brutal and graphic for this or any other time, which is the original picture. Indians killed the city, women and children alike and pushed them out of their city towards Cameron's residence. A newborn baby divides her mother and breaks all hell breaks. Someone goes for help and comes back to Calvary free of charge. <br /> <br /> There are some graphic violence in war scenes. For example, we see a woman being scalped alive and a discipline where we see a horse being shot. I do not see an animal killed so cruelly on the screen. Mr. Griffith was becoming a master of managing large scale war scenes, he used extensively in his epic drama "Big of the Nation", which was released next year. <br /> <br /> It runs a little 29 minutes, "Elder Shuffle War", yet it's a breathtaking and a bit of historical filmmaking. See if you can spot Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carie in the bit part.
