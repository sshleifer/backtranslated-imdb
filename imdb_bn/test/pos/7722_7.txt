Generally Spanish production - moving slowly, but sex with great actress and sexuality sex with sex actress Paz Vega. (See her "Spanglite"). Great set, lots of color - you can see in Cardobaba, Seville, Spanish mountains and in the countryside. This plot continues to flourish here and there, but if you follow closely (although I'm directed by the Spanish language) you will get the subject. <br /> <br /> This gruesome young Gypsy woman, Carmen, uses her feminist will to induce men to do his satirical work. Carmen is being taken to prison after a cigarette factory in the cigarette factory. Jose forced him to go to jail to take him to prison. Speaking to Jose Burke, he was impressed by his glasses (he spoke in Navarre and the same language). Jose was sentenced to a month's imprisonment and posted as a soldier in the foot. After that he met a group Carmen and they ended up becoming lovers. But Carmen refuses to promise him, and continues his shy and flirty lifestyle. In an enraged anger, Jose Carmen, a fellow soldier killed. Then they will move to the city. Life on the run turned into a bandit in José. Carmen, meanwhile, remains the same wild, a wildly promiscuous woman. Finally, Jose lost his mind and ended up killing Carmen. <br /> <br /> Jose said loudly in prison, waiting to execute the execution. The story he is telling is French author and anthropologist Prospero Marime, whose fictional watch (played by Fuel Elise of Beethoven) was stolen by Carmen or José. <br /> <br /> Set-up and valuable captivating Paz Vega to visit.
