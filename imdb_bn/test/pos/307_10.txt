Spoilers This review was conducted due to the word limitations. <br /> <br /> 'Awful fear.' Marlon Brando, Now Apocalypse (1979) and ApocalypseNew Redox (2001) <br /> <br /> What is this sentence that you see here, baby, or 'are you talking to me?' Or, 'the army should be with you,' or 'I'll be back,' that means a little more than a few -found fishing. When it is called, it links to the air with an importance and meaning that can not be known. How some viewers can play plays is that they can not find any answer from Herro until they can see the film again and try to closely monitor each single frame. <br /> <br /> What, what is the meaning of dialogue? The reality of the alleged horror battle. The reality of moral men becomes so easily polluted that they started their growing instinct and killed a colleague without any trace of the criminal. Captain Willard (Martin Shane) stood before Colonel Cartage (Marlon Brando) after his death at the end of the movie, 'The Horror. Hello. ' Willard's feeling of corruption. As part of his appointment, he undoubtedly killed a man in a cold blood. This is not a common Hollywood end. In most cases a character gets something, mentally, physically, mentally or three. But Willard both gain and lose. He has gained knowledge that he has lost his morality. And it's a shocking ending. <br /> <br /> 'Apolletipus Now' is a tribute to Francis Ford Coppola in the artistic direction of filmmaking. This picture is completely different from 'The Godfather'. It is a hallucinogenic, visible spectacular part of the visual and human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it is weird, and then symbolic, and, ultimately, the original from its own perspective on the spiritual side of the war. It is not as much a movie as it is about Vietnam War, because it is a film about war between us. <br /> <br /> First it seems like another war film. Captain Willard (Shane) has appointed an army lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to kill a fake American colonel called Cartage (Brando), who is hiding somewhere in Vietnam with soldiers, who work less or less like his slaves. <br /> <br /> She has conducted her mission with extreme superstitions, walking on a boat along with four soldiers, including the captain of the cat, Chief (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederick Forest), and a very young man. 'Larry' Fishborn (who later appeared as 'Morphias' in 'Matrix') <br /> <br /> "Homodored ODC Modern Updates" in many ways "Apocalypse Now". Our main character, Willard, was born on his journey, he le "The Million Dollar Hotel" is less than Jeremy Davies, which I have ever seen, among the worst films of Colonel Kilgo (Robert Duval), who is strange for surfing and a rocked photographer (Dennis Hooper) whose vivid gestures and methods can be compared. A. Davis failed to connect with viewers; Hooper has. He is like poetic vibe in Willard and Kurtz; She is going back and as an interpreter to speak foreign languages. In this case, he translates the cartridge to the Willard, though I'm not sure that the cartridge needs the translation of the will. <br /> <br /> Many movies are lucky, with one or two memorable scenes or lines. There's a lot of "apocalypse now". One of the most memorable scenes in the history of the Kilogram movie, which is a vietnam village, played by Wagner's "Valerie Ride". In it sharpness, it is a cruelty, it is a terrible tone, and a sense of playfulness. When Kilogo walked on the beach, he said, "In the morning I love the smell of napam. It smells like a victory, 'We all smile smile. <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you. The Apocalypse is now 'a weird film. It's not the easiest thing to analyze. The final audience could disappoint some viewers if Markel Brandon could not understand the important lecture. But it really comes, which is really important, this movie is about the dark nature of human mind. War of horror and its effects, war itself is not realized. Kurtz says, 'You have the right to kill me. But you do not have the right to judge you. Brando's character, cartage, left to judge in the audience. To many intelligent viewers, he can look like a crazy loon whose power he has got from his head. But Francis Ford Coppola, which is trying to overcome, is not. Through the Vietnam War, Kartez realized how great he was, and how bad others were. After walking through devastating villages, he finally realized that we are living in a paradise of fools, fools. We are completely naive around our neighborhood and the potential misfortune until we hit. Seeing how bad some Vietnamese is, Kartez realizes how easily he got some hurt. It can be just as easy as the people around him. And he realizes that those who have done this work have abandoned their morals and left the door. Many people think horror is one thing. It's two For the horrors of horror, the horrors he was and the effect of the war on humans is the reality. And after the murder of Willard Cartz, and hearing about the death of Cartage, he also understood it. He realized the impact of the war. Realizing the horror of a man who can fight a man to see many soldiers who have no feeling of right or wrong. And what did he do to him? Horror <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
