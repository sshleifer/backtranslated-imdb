My opinion in this movie was a good story, very good battleship scenes but I was a little disappointed at the end of the movie. I think it was also known to lord diner, or if he knew to use some weapons, his character became more attractive and he was a competitor to Cynthia. I think when director Cynthia and Dinner finished the final 'war' film, he wanted to finish the movie, so he was not worried about how he would eventually run. I think all fans of Cynthia Rathrak will be very pleased to see this movie. It's not like 'yes, madam'! Or swear in the name of justice, but it was a lot of entertainment and the movie looks great in this movie, so my rate of this movie is a tough 8/10
