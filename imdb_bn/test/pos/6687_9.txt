Usually I do not like movies with alliance but K-pack is different. Actor is fantastic in the film - especially Kevin Spacy has played his role! The movie never falls on the lower level - the suspicion always remains in the movie and you want to know exactly how it ends, what about the proto ... After the movie you will have to think a lot because there are some open questions ... Robert Portter Protocol or Transport Cable Robert As a means of transport using porters. He can see how UV light and how he can learn a lot about astrology. But everyone can finish themselves and believe that he wants to believe. Very nice movie with a nice Kevin Spacy!
