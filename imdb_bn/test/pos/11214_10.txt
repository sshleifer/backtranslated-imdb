Uzak (2002), a Turkish movie starring "Remote" in the United States, <br /> <br /> <br /> Directed, produced, written, and illustrated in Nuri Bilal. <br /> <br /> Cyan. <BR /> <br /> This movie is a great and stupid version of "City Mouse", Mahmut directed by Muzaffar Ozdemi, and "Country Mouse" Yusuf. It played Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are remarkable actors, and the plot can show their acting skills. (Sadly, shortly after the film was completed, Emin Toprak died.) <br /> <br /> In most of the countries cats / nude cats, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is illustrated in a ridiculous fashion. In this picture, there is little humor or even warmth. Two men <br /> <br /> lost contact with human society. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His human interaction is limited to the silent observation of other people who are beyond his way. He is definitely a warm and caring person, but can not express these qualities in an urban environment. <br /> <br /> Cousins ​​do not have a good relationship with the world, and they do not have good relations with each other. Makes an attempt to work in a way that will provide an opportunity for ties or closeness. <br /> <br /> <br /> In this case, this image is a waste of opportunity. <br /> <br /> Certainly, each cousin could provide at least part of the life of a cousin. Instead, they run parallel unhappiness courses. The two men are remote, which is a situation suggested by the movie title. <br /> <br /> My friends have mentioned a wonderful method in which Sylan has detailed in detail in detail. These details are not ultimately telling us more about the characters, we learned through simple exposition. <br /> <br /> Yusk was shown as part of Rochester Labor Film series. This is not a "labor film" in the traditional sense of that genre. This is a labor film because it displays the harmful effects of unhappy work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> This is a cool, dry, dark movie. Although it is not ready to be happy, I went out <br /> <br />. The theater realized that I was really creative and <br /> <br /> important movie. Finding these pictures and watching the price!
