There are many movies that are complex stories of many levels such as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of the story is the flashback and the ability to move the motion of the film. This film does not flash the fourth, fourth and fourth straight, but it also flows through most of the Yuko Mishima. This image crosses every aspect and is a pleasure to see. Not to mention the incredible Philipp Gloss soundtrack.
