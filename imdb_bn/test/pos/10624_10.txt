If it is true that Sodomoscima is a bi-sided coin that is full of different opinions of its opponents, then the image of Irika Kohat's film is its reality. Professor Kohat treats his piano students with a fascist sorrow, when he expresses similar interest to himself. His outward expression is his desire project. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is her student So that you want to be around him He rejected him from the hand, but because of his talent, the Vienna Conservative voted him. He loves her. Again he pushed him, but he could not answer, and as a result, he started to harm his own family to corruption and self-respect. <br /> <br /> At this time visitors can ask, who is in control? Miser or Monsieur? Indeed those who are agitated and difficult? It's hard to tell Is it a person who is greatly abused both in both mental and physical, who is actually an extraordinary winner and wounded in the floor of perfection, or is it the person who is coming out of the door? <br /> <br /> <br / > But Erica is not just sad. She is a sexual extreme freak. While maintaining a masculinity of respect, she feels the experience of human sexuality. That's not even true in fact. He did not care what he think of others. She loves because she does not care if they walk and find bloodshed on the floor. Love, she calls it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How is its glorious such a superfluity? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is neatly handled and operated well through the mechanical Henke, which explains the expert camera work story and carefully prepared sets in which the effectiveness of the action is not just clear, but for example ( Like Bathroom, when Walter raised himself from the top of the stall to find Iraq). He also fines the players' positions so that they always have to spend a good time from one angle to another. This scene is particularly important, where Erica, white and black in the light of a dead body like bloody dead body, is under her lover, as hard as a stone. In most parts here we see Stark's outline with only his mouth and his throat ventricle. We do not have to look anymore. <br /> <br /> The part of Iraq Kohat is perfect for Isupel Huppert, who is not very afraid; Indeed he excels them. I saw him in a number of movies, and how well his character becomes the body and soul. The woman she plays in this movie is surprised by the opinions of others and she thinks about her appearance in the sense of decorating. What is its efficiency and challenges? No part is very demanded. No character too depraved. Hupert wants to experience all humanity's experiences and he wants us to see him. She is always fascinating and almost flawless. He is not only a leading light of French cinema; He is one of the best actors of our time who has done an amazingly different body work together. <br /> <br /> I think it is very educational and provides a wonderful and interesting contrast to compare with its performance. Lesmaker (La Dentelere) acting 22 years old since 1977. There he had red hair and fractalis and his beautiful face and his lovely little figure in his Paris-based professor Hairdresser pod. Her character was shy about sex and submissive - just a common French girl who expected to be a beautician one day. Here he is a bitter ruthless witch with his own self-knowledge, shameful and totally unexpected knowledge. <br /> <br /> Hupperts are fortunate as actresses in France, where there are such parts for older women starlets. (Hollywood could not produce such a movie.) In American cinema, only a few hundred years of very good and hard-working actresses could have a career. Huppert greatly increased his exposure due to his ability and range, but here he and La Ceramini (1995) are willing to play an unfinished role, in which he plays a scary, stupid fool. <br /> <br /> See this for Isabelle Huppert. Do not forget her or her character she brings to life.
