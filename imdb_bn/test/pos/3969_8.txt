Accepted a 2006 teen rush that folk star from Mac and PC ads. About the movie Bartelby. For the college he has applied for, he has decided to create his own college and has received a person who has applied to invite all others, the problem is that hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie was ridiculous and I was fortunate enough to buy it for a fortunate $ 5.00 and I have always seen it. Overall this film must be watched for all comedians fans because it's funny, malicious and just a good movie. I rate this movie a very fair 78%. Take a SEQUEL GUYS approval but make sure it does not tremble.
