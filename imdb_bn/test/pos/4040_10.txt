This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It's just so magical and it's fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! Characters are always so compelling, so real, you will just love them! The story of love of Garda and Ka'i will really surprise you and keep that little spark of magic in your life. <br /> <br /> I do not see if anyone cares about the movie. The movie was amazing! I did not even read the book, and guess what? I do not care. In fact, if the movie and book are so different, you can only call them two different stories and be happy with it. <br /> <br /> I was bleeding brilliant! Bridgette Fonda Snow Queen, so evil, and so cold - you just have to hate him Chelsea Hobbs Gerda, a boyfriend beat girl who is determined to find her love, takes it whatever, and goes to a wonderful adventure. And I just love Snow Queen Bones (Spring Witch, Summer Princess, and Autumn Rubber), they are so funny and different in different ways. <br /> <br /> I did not see this movie in a while, so if I make a minor mistake please forgive me .... but I suspect that I always like this movie.
