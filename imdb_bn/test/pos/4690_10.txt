Used to see this when I was too small, then used to watch my video. Now I see the DVD, I love this. Ray Winston 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is all good and even works with all Robin Hood changes. The wonderful story, twists and ways it has been shot - can be missing missing as unrained eyes (that mine is not trained) but it adds to the absorption film of the audience. Due to the green forest and dark woods and dark forests of the castle, the dense forest of the forest - its great. The definition of Robin Hood personalities personally. If you get the chance, I can not stress how much you will see it, then you must see it.
