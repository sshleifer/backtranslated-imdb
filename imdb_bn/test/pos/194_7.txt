After watching this movie it is not difficult, why the Soviet film is honored with a slight criticism of why this silent criticism. Do not make me wrong The cranes are flying, at least for the first half, extremely entertaining, absolutely touch brightness, unexpected from the origin of its country. A fresh, intense, wide-ranging strategy which finally irritates as soon as it charms; Two stunning piece set pieces; And a romantic flame that flirts with, but several samples in Lelouch region. It's just that, in the main part of his love relationships, huge social, national and global events, this is certainly not different from a traditional Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the progress of these two young young lovers is a relief that, in the Soviet Union, the state has been emphasized on all other things, and in an era (World War II) which imposes independence and freedom to counter killer symbolism. And subjective resemblance - All the renovated love wages as well as the war - adding to its possible loveability with the most amazing two of all the films (seventh huevane, lace paraplegis de cherubberg). <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. Boris, a young factory worker from a brilliant medical and artistic family, and a student Veronica, manage a large relationship at night, their only free time. Boris cousin Mark, a musician, also has eyes on Veronica. When the Nazis attacked Russia, Boris secretly volunteers, his family and lovers' enemies. He promised to write in Veronica, but never thought that he would not be bothered to see him, or perhaps the mail was incredible. Veronica's parents died during an air raid, and she went with the family of Barish, where her father's injured soldiers were helped to get admitted to hospital. Worried by Boris's silence, Veronica also attacks Mark's perspective, who gets a bribe from the military duty of a local official. She is finally passed down, and to humiliate her adopted family, marry him. Meanwhile, Boris, was killed in action. Veronica, disgusted with herself and the adulterous Mark, denies this belief and is waiting for her return, encourages a young orphan in her name. <br /> <br /> The couple love the title of their title, probably the symbol of its transcendant, epiphanical energy. But this delusional - the cranes are flying in a Void structure, and this shape spreads across the entire film, by geography-building, internal, outgoing, human group, composition, camera angle, name or editing. In one story, the walking feet of the south-west are filled by the feet on the other side of the south-east. <br /> <br /> It works to trap lovers who do not control their destiny and Stalinist powers which are never mentioned in the film. Although the pair seems to be free in space, although it is literally privileged to be privileged in an unexplained environment or hot binding, but always greed, shorten, isolate - situations, families, by crowds (see, brilliant, if obvious, cranes where Veronica Tanks, or the pair fail to meet with a huge crowd), or simply by the structure of the film which is constantly Perularialism of the distance, eliminated by their closest. Although the brightness and brightness of the style initially suggests a beautiful romantic idea, it is constantly broken by the camera angle of peculiar editing or music graduation sketches. <br /> <br /> The most amazing is how these blocks are achieved by the romance historic force rather than abstract. The entire movie, but especially the war itself, is weird miracles and dreams, we have never seen its effects on his harsh, cruel reality, lovers. In fact, it is transformed into a royal spectrum, deprived of the ugly Germans. <br /> <br /> In front of the house, the shade of wind shade and shade, or almost create a delicious effect of the ruins of Gothic frustration. In Banki, the threat of the Soviet empire is less important than Boris's perceived indifference. Empty, stubborn Moscow places her mother with her mother at the beginning of Veronica, but there are fewer physical positions than the psychological spaces. <br /> <br /> When striking yourself in Mark Veronica, air strikes are less devastating than the symbolic expression of sexual and mental depression. This is a brilliant sequence, which is depicted in silent, expressive terrorism, which seems to burst into the screen with violence and violence, which is more compelling for the 'modest humility' of the previous scenes. <br /> <br /> It is not much different in front, where girls fight against honor is more important than fight, nazi or despair. Boris and his wounded comrade have a more abstraction of the experience of the war in the final place, making it a sexual move in a jungle; And Boris's final, pre-death flashback is an extraordinary mix of dream-fulfillment and high anxiety, for which it has become willpower and diverse. <br /> <br /> This picture is a little less interesting at this moment, a little more obvious. Another perception for Expressionist overload - Veronica tried to commit suicide; and her rescuers - being moderately managed; And his cruel crime dropped a paralyzing shadow over the whole film. The use of deep focus, with the first barbarity, is soon worn, it becomes meaningless as moral strength, which means that Welles Citizen comes to his ears. In the event of the end of criticism of the sovereignty of the sovereignty of the person, it is finally expected to be a personal, victimized, symbolic (eg innocent, arrogant) in Russia's industry.
