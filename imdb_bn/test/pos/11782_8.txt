I've seen that from all parodies of Star Wars, it's probably funny. Instead of spaceship, it is not for Star Wars, but with the simplest electronics, it's how badly it worked. This is deliberately overacted, and makes it pleasing, and since everyone knows deliberately overacted, nobody complains about one. Special effects may be deliberately awkward, and a visible string that can include a toaster on a tornet and a strawberry on an egg beater. This short story is funny for a fan of Star Wars (which I'm not), or anyone can kill for 15 minutes. Great short !! <br /> <br /> Out of my rating *** *** *** 13 minutes Do not rate.
