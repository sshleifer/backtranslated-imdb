Personally, I think Kevin Spacy is the greatest actor of his generation, perhaps the greatest. It's a combination of another amazing actor Jeff Bridges, it can not be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-Pax" is one of the most delightful surprises in the last year. The movie has a brilliantly written story to begin with. It makes the movie so great. The other side to contribute to the greatness of the film is played. The combination of the spacy-brigades really works. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie again and I'm sure it will not be the last time. "K-Pack" has everything. Moments are very funny, a part that reminds real thrillers and others that reminds of high-class dramas. I think this movie is a lot of ratings and a lot more rewarding. Great movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
