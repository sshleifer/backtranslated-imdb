Being a marine, I can tell you that d. Eye. How Marine Corps boot camps and boys are turned into men illustrate how accurate a date is as accurate. Jack Webb Sgt.Jim Moore is excellent, Paris is a tough, but fair drill instructor in North Carolina. The film is not an employer who seems to get along with "the program." A complete latest movie, full metal jacket, also shows the basic training life and it is good to see.
