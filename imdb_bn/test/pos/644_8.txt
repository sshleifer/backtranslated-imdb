I just finished this movie and my only comment was "Oh! Wow!" Jennifer Bels is just like Baghdatta, but Yancy Batler is the genuine dynamite of Hollywood as a female dance coach! I saw him at WITCHBLADE, I was not ready for the perfect unwanted sex and raw sexual excitement from the screen. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again .... if only for Yany Butler as Korin!
