It was not like a fantasy film. The picture is dark, with dark overtones. The soundtrack way also uplifting the point it intruded on the visual. I'm sure they targeted some militants, but it did not work. The scene is a perfect example when Astin is trying to escape. Why does it sound like a donkey? There is no comedy, there is no brightness in it !! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is great, and the performance is very good. I enjoyed everyone's performance. It is available on Netflix's online viewing. <br /> <br /> Of course, valuable to watch, but write your own soundtrack !!
