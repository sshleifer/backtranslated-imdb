Late Ship is a great book, I read the book many years ago, and I was transferred to the Catastrade Revolution, which Johnny Carson retired and J Leno and Johnny Carson tried to grab his spot. When the movie came out, I hijacked the VHS copy of the movie and recently it is difficult to reconsider the book, which I have enjoyed, because they amount to the same amount of information. Two leading actors, John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, are convinced that two of the actors I have never heard of before, Leno and Letterman congratulate, despite the dismissal of Letterman being poor due to their painting. Many people play quite well, despite searching for it two imitations. I was not as interested in that. The stories are counted. And that brings me Kathy Bates. Keith Betts, Helen Kushnik, playing this movie. He played this evil bitch of a character, so you think how this woman can control herself, it is a national TV show less. Dad! Become a signal !!
