I and a coupla friends build the university - Alberto Lopez, Dave Hall, Selene Alcock (we graduated from Yua, Norwich, UK in 1997) and I watch B-movies once a month. <br /> <br /> We are experts in the art of bad film making, and this movie was quickly transferred to the top 10 of the horror / brilliant movies. <br /> <br /> So if you are getting beer and weed and need a film for you to laugh like a drain at UC Phonix 2 of Drain Gun! Mark Singer is fully aware that he is in a film here in Turkey and Milk for what he can do! Matthius Hues played his timber and musclebound moronity (he is a word?) That grunts are glorified in "But I want my 20 thousand!" Pure Shawk Gold! If you like it, see more: Transcors, Runstone, Dolman and Charles Band or Fred O'Neill some of Ray ... (But be careful: some of their films are completely and completely without merit and you will scream, who lost your life hours! !! !!!!).
