When the new external limit first started, these episodes were quite hopeful and challenging. As the beginning of the series decreases, most of the episodes only become the PadmaSatna and surpass any entertainment prices. Here the six episodes are very good in series, and reflect the worst. <br /> <br /> Since external boundaries always promote moral. I want to offer my own The flop starts with the most fun. <br /> <br /> 1. Next Life: As an institution, the United States military-industrial complex is both evil and terrible, not common sense. However, people with great honesty serve our country and they will accept their conscience in the face of stress! In the end, the aliens do not have to say a word. Those who are not unconcerned, they are stupid fools, who are cruelly insulted! <br /> <br /> A truly confusing episode! One time the Prime Time should be shown on television! This may be an omission for some, but the unconscious people should not allow us to serve in the military! No end is justified! <br /> <br /> Relativity theory: For the sake of safe and intelligent people, and for good intentions, good people can be divided into good or bad-second decisions. This decision makes it even more difficult to make the toughest tougher: Getting drunk with foreign foreign strangers, with whom you can not contact Jason, or go with a group that you think will keep you safe from unknown dangers. They are stupid and ruthless fools! <br /> <br /> This episode is bright! This impurity fuels what is good old fashion greed. This episode is one of the most fascinating allegations of rape in capitalism, international corporations and the environment, I have ever seen in my life! In contrast to real life, justice is served here - and fast! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless corporate telegraph said something to the effect, "We did the same in the Amnest Rainforest War." Protesting the assassination of the Amazonian Indians, who were trying to protect their rain forest from digging, and as a basis for the literal killing of "living alive". Some Darwin is not literally meant to be taken! <br /> <br /> Alien Shops: Extraordinary powers can be used even for even better than external aliens. This energy can be used to cure instead of being destroyed. People can learn from their mistakes! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. Grell: An alien could be a Christ-like figure! In a distant future, slavery can be made reasonable again, in the name of expensiveness! Basically good people can be contaminated. Sometimes a person has to feel ashamed to see the person doing the evil thing. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Political power to strengthen those who are responsible! Another task of talent! As a species, "learn from human history?" <br /> <br /> Flip No.1: Dignity Quality: Lush Lips, Sindh Ship! In the war when your face is closed about important military plans. G, do I want to watch an hour-long soap opera to get it out? !! I wonder, have the outside limitations come out of the idea, or are the corporate corporate plugs dragged? Dark and ugly, serve no purpose, but frustration! <br /> <br /> Flip Number 2: Out of the Vill: So Moral is Not So Bad, But It: If Someone Locked Up In The Psychiatric Hospital, Please Use Some Common Sense! This episode is so annoying it's so annoying. What an X file rip off! Do not waste your time on this one! Thank you later! <br /> <br /> It is a sad commentary that the outer limit has gone to the tubes at the end of its rice. The confusing phase, like the first four, can not last forever! It was a miracle they were made at all! Hopefully, one day, other brave ghosts will follow the tradition of the external boundaries of the new territory! <br /> <br /> If you are such a brave person, then a good place to start with a unique book: "The Entomemy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction", edited by the Blue Baron! As far as I'm concerned, the most comprehensive book ever written on the subject.
