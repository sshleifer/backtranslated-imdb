When people hammer about how they use them as "they do not make it", then point out this fantastic entertaining, and diverse look, comedy horror from writer-director Glenn McQueyad. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a story of graverobbers (played by Dominican Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) who end up digging more than just silent, immobile dead bodies. After the initial shock, they soon realized that they could actually make the situation their advantage. And that's what they try to do. It seems, it seems, before a poor young man Arthur (Monghan) was hanged, a priest (Ron Perlman) seems to be related to his story, so it seems that the matter has not worked properly. <br /> <br /> For the details of his film, McQueud took his first, original piece of small film and expanded the effort of this feature, which is not a bad thing. Fasenden returned and performed well, Munaghan is a person who can really like him when he is seen in the movie about the negative business of stealing from the dead and other choices like Perlin and Angus scream. It's a lot of fun for successive fans. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from a unique and favorable design and appearance, sometimes the EC runs on live-action (a la cropo) in comic-style panels and always feels quite a bit, it is authentic in Hammer's awful feeling. Maybe everything is covered with just so dry ice but next to that point. Whatever the film is captured in everything, it works. It works well. There is no fear of it, but this movie has great humorous black humor and its runtime in MACB elements has become clearly visible, which will make everyone happy, patience for patience is a bit more widespread and it seems like it is in Hammer's days. Can be made again. See it if you want: Flush and fansend, Doctor and The Devils, Crawl Show.
