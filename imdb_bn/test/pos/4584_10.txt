I never heard of this movie when a good friend recommends it. I believe this friend's taste, so I purchased the DVD. My wife and I sit to see it with no knowledge about what it is about. I thought it was the most fun movie ever seen, mainly because I saw the truth of the mockery. I firmly recommend this photo to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Some people will see a comedy and stupid statue, and they have found that idiots are one of the stupid movies. These people do not realize that animal humor is not there to entertain visitors but to reflect the future appeal of the body. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Average Joe." He's going to be a pale for the ridiculous comments about the society that is scattered throughout this film. There are many fun bits in the background, so this is easily seen many times. The movie makes it more fun and makes it even more intimidating, that I look at its elements in everyday life or in the media. Then, I go back again and see Idiors again, and realize how good it is. <br /> <br /> Some people who have seen and enjoyed this movie are able to be part of an elite club. I'll look for an ad for some products, including some new material and tell my wife, "It's got electrolyte!" She knows exactly what I mean.
