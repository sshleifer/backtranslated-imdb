Forget about all the unfortunate romantic movies involved in notebooks and lip-locked couples that somehow manage to grow together after the life of the simplest illogical romance screen. Forget all the shameless dogs "The dog gives his life to save his family" (although I must admit that it is a soft spot for myself). Ricky Schoder had already shown the time of damage by showing his radioactivity (which was now shameful!). <br /> <br /> This TV-movie which is unfortunately and never released, always under the control of champion Tiar Jarakar. And a good writing and well-played story boots. Ann Margarette took a great opportunity to take up this role. Here is nothing flamboyant or sexy about her, and that itself is a prestigious achievement. Based on the real story, he plays in Lucile Frae, who, in turn, is a sick mother, who likes to struggle for his body instead of leaving them in the hands of unstable government agencies to find good homes for his ten children. Her husband, Frederick Forrest, acts as a heartfelt, but incredible routine, with poor pregnancies and personal demons disabling her to care for the kids. <br /> <br /> This picture interviewed the potential parents of Lusil's heart-twist and then watched her kids leave home. It gives the view of our own and father's children - because of the suffering of this incident, now anyone else wants to follow and is frustrated by the inability to do more. The scene that took the youngest of the children (Stevens) to his new home, that I've ever seen is the most heartfelt. Now, I grew up as a "disappointed romantic," and then spent many years increasing myself a much more difficult, more worried shell. I usually find mock more than empathize with our foisted emotional cinema trip these days. But since the early 1980's, this gem still killed me. <br /> <br /> I really want someone in the marketing sense to publish a DVD version of this play. One of the special features to include Emmy Awards next year's broadcast. The A-M was nominated for this role, but the award for Best Dramatic Actress went to Barbara Stanwick and went for "Thorn Bird". Stenwawk tears in his acclaim speech and shouted, "Anne Margaret, I love you!", Which brings Ann-MK to the tears. <br /> <br /> One final note. IMDb Ratings "Like Who Lie My My Child" However, 75% of ratings are in 8-10 range (mostly 10's). To correct the overall rating of movies listed by IMDB, this site uses any kind of handicapping system, which it completely identifies. This one is always "cry", and boots to boot the TV-movie well.
