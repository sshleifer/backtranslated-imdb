I see West Point as an acceptable movie, although I will see it again that there is a doubt. Actor was convinced, another unexpectedly funny young man with William Henes, who is appealing to her up-apply from the end of the film. It is hard to believe that Starwood made Juan Crawford awake in less than a year after the film was made, because he's sometimes looking weird. <br /> <br /> I will apply another comment related to Ramon Nvrro's "Hoodle" (1932) in this picture. There is a great movie waiting to be made here, but there is a little lacking there. The backbone and integration of the orbit was used well, but I think I was less involved than I would have been. Perhaps the character of Henes was too far, or it went too far. His "repentance" does not seem to be genuine; What kind of messages were sent to play every game in the last minute of the army-navy? Where "Corps"? Besides, ten other men have been brought out and let them do everything. Also, I suspect that the weak, guilty character of William Beckwell will never be a real-life opponent at the West Point. <br /> <br /> All these aside, movies are sometimes very running and inspiring. It's a fine look in a reputable organization's daily practice. In contrast to the ugly "tradition" of the Ivy League school, thanks to the tradition of making Westpie still a bit of money, these days only half-heartedly involved. <br /> <br /> As a score: it was appropriately marshal. However, there was a distinct use of the trap drum. Using them for knocks on doors, scene changes, and ALU as well as good half scenes to be rather tiring. This is rather reduced to the viewing experience. I was ready to say "I got points before." With <br /> <br />, enjoy the film, but do not expect too much emotional involvement.
