I enjoyed this film very much. It combines humor, imagination and a few moments of dawn with the help of a strong film from Higuchinsky. A very original story about superb visual and spiral. My only complaint was that it had silent moments and it was not as brave as it was. Despite that, I give it a hard 8 in 10. In the US this and other fine Japanese horror / fantasy movies should be kept in mind which have recently arrived and they are available in Zone 1 DVD. Indeed, Asian movies are generally some of the best films that have ignored the American people because they are hard to find. I firmly recommend to look for these treasures, they are hard to find, but once you find them, you will be glad.
