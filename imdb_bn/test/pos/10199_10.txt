Because of power in 1933, Hitler and his "National Socialist German Workers Party", of course, all of us are known as Nazi, while the time has passed, they have strengthened their stability on the country. At the beginning of their clutches in the German people, they called some and all artists, men of the newspaper and filmmakers in their Nazi headquarters, so that the newly announced "third verdict" (Akash Empire) was expected from them. <br /> <br /> Mr. Fred Lang was summoned to meet Master Director Har Geibel of the uninterrupted influential and evolutionary era of German film; He listened carefully and did not say anything. Immediately after leaving the Promotional Office Minister, Herl went straight to the train station and took the passenger directly to Paris. After returning to his residence, Fries Lang did not return to Germany (at least not for many years.) He is in France and eventually comes to the United States of America. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lang earned the right to work in the United States; Most enjoyable, strong and notably high-quality films make up the movie. The title of this title includes the title of today's fate Western Union (20th Century Fox, 1941). <br /> <br /> Both Typically Old West and Pioneer's days are both required for quality as well as cast quality. Western Union qualifies for both requirements. Each scene makes us happy for our senses. <br /> <br /> Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Zager and Virginia Gillmore, a vampire or other awesome person, but a physician), Geor G "Slim" Somerville (senior character actor, experienced in Silent Film and graduate of MacSenson's Keston Comedies), Chill Wills (always a reliable player and "Avalon Boys" Singer) and barbarous bad guy Burton McLean In this mix, we have names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Yvvwing Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kimmitt Maynard (Brain of Cain Maynard). <br /> <br /> Producer among the American Indians: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverhills It has also been noted that a great representation of Aboriginal People of North America is that great, monotonous impressive and memorable example Red Man, Louisiana Native, Iron Aij Codi (born the Sicilian immigrant parent). The fine outdoor scenes are filmed at the position of Arizona and Utah and the highest grade in Technikogore. (There is no memorial in the valley, but then, Mr. John Ford's province.) In some cases, this film is a much more extraordinary success than we can imagine; It took the story of a sizable magazine, which was adapted to the tastes and statues of America war in the late 30s and the end of the first half of the decade. All of this is done by the German-born director, Holivida, and America's shortest time period. In the last analysis of <br /> <br />, Western Union, it may not be historically accurate example of West Zener; We just do not care. Score it in all the necessary sections for a great night on movies! So, who really thinks about a little detail as "precision"? <br /> <br /> We are Mr. Lang and 20th Century Fox rating ******************************************************************************************** ********** It was about film actors, directors and other artisans to come. (It seems that movie fox and scientists were the biggest export for Germany at this particular point of time; scientists who created nuclear bombs, as well as NASA's future future people came from Europe.) <br /> <br /> Pundin graduate !!
