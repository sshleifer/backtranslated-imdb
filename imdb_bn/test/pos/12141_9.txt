Classe Tous Risques (Big Risk) is a French gangster film that does not try for style. Why is it style? Because the movie is so down and so important, it is more involved. And because of the Hebrew Devos Lino Ventura, we have invested passionately in this little joke, the hard killer of love for his wife and children, there is an interview with customs agents around night that he and he does not expect us and who is a valve Or one of the lint off with little passion as willing to shoot as a traitor Bit off person. We first met with his wife and two younger sons in Italy, Devos, about 9 and 4 in one. <br /> <br /> "This person is the person who is hanged for the death of a Health Devos, in absentia". "During the years of running, he reduced his resources, even worried him away, and as soon as the Italian police was closed every day, France was again its best bet, maybe he forgot." <br /> <br /> Davis is the top Gangster of Paris who cared for his friends. That was a few years ago. To return to France, it is not very wrong to pay him. Now she is hiding with her two kids. He called his friends to Paris to help him. He and his children have to go from Paris to Nice but the police are hunting him and they have set the road. Time for the two best friends of Daoos and they have gone. They do not want to risk themselves, and for what? Obligation can take precautions. So they hire Erich Stark (Jean-Paul Belmando), a young thief to take Davos and children to an ambulance, then heavily bound Davos and go to Paris to hide the children. We're making a move where Dave's options are increasingly limited, where he must find ways to care for his children, where he realizes that there is no relation between friendships, where betrayal seems likely and where his only friend is left is Eric Stark . <br /> <br /> This little satirical film works so well as it works forcefully. There are no trench coats with drag-up callers, so many French directors have no connection with gangster code, so there is no relation with Maildrum. Classe tous Risques gives us hellebles, a man who was once, who will not be any longer and who responds with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura influences the movie, but when it is associated with Jean-Paul Belmondo, a playful chemistry happens. Like Davos, fans are worried and worried about caring for their boys. He is insulted by his condition. He is a tough man, who, if necessary, tries to kill someone, if necessary, as part of his business. Belmondo is initially sent as a driver with a young thief and sends winds of a friend to rely on it. The film keeps the film under another levy. Belmondo is younger at the age of 27. Its unlikely star power as a major actor - broken nose, under the jaw jaw-screen shines right to the right. They shared Anne with a view when making a match for Vicurrah. And Belmond's scenes are Lilien (Sandra Millo), young girl who has become his daughter friend, attractive and beautiful nature sex appeal. Without finishing bittersweet luck, and a stylistic posture of sight. We say to Deves, "Hubble has gone, nothing is left." It is valuable to know what the clash toss risak means. <br /> <br /> There are many good French gangsters. I'll keep it there with a one-way pass and with Gresby and Bob Le Flambur.
