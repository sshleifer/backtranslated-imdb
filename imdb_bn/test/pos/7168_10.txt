My first mammy film, IFC saw it a long time ago, and love it. It looked absolutely artistic, original, fun and sunny. A moment in the movie does not leave me or annoys me, and I had a lot smile or smile on my face. I mean this movie is really fun. But here's the idea: it's very artistic and creative - if you do not know Yuri Mamin (perhaps, sadly, that many of her big films are not available here) because she has no original style and she is not my favorite film for me (now It's crazy ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy"). Also, let me say as Russian, this movie is great because you really see like Russians. Could it be because it did not sell me a true Russian film, an American film or an attempt to appeal to an American; Mammy did not sell it (or even after that, Gorko (1998) was better if not good.In fact, true Russian style filming is the reality of the communist society <br /> <br /> If you like this picture, then it seems like you have other movies in the movie I have a lot of love, I actually liked a few of them, more than this one, I suppose it is the most accessible film in it. Similar film Fountain, during perestroika 6 years ago, it has the leading role in the same actors, and Mamin Regularly those who will recognize you Paris from the window; At the end of this one has a supernatural twist but mostly a realistic comedy, a great one. Viva Mammy, I hope the criteria will hook up all of her movies for a day, she's still working, and her catalog is so great! If you can see her film any of her
