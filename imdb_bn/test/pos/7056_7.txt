... because I love this movie so much because it has its soul. This is a junior summer camp film, so jokes are not considered in a chronic manner that makes a character a permanent butt of ridicule. Curiosity continues to happen, but you feel that the associated fallers may laugh behind looking back, enough doping for them - and besides being very impressive, it's really nice that everyone still has friends! <br /> <br /> This is an extra special bonus when all of these delightful japes are ringing the Ringmaster Bill. For me, the comedy without a colleague has looked as God when he still gets a chance to be happy. Someone really is good at producing a sense of cruel anarchy freewheeling without hurting anyone. The whole film's voice is the same style as its leading, it was established with a great opening scene, which shows the way to be ready for Mararea's day. Everything is stupid, yes, but fun is more important than behaving like an adult. "Meatballs" deliver such promise and finally a nutrition watch.
