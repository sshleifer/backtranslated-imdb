This is a story of a long and weird love. A 50-year-old woman is portrayed with daily life and some people around her. His daily life is so common and routine that I suspect that was the real lead character in the beginning. Then listeners know that there was a very small connection between a woman and her high school class companion. Women are doing the same - a milk woman and a supermarket supermarket - so long. Many bottles of milk bottle suppliers work a very hard one. The man married another woman, who is now a victim of cancer. He worked at City Hall and undoubtedly cared for him at home. They do not look directly and do not talk to each other, but they do not forget each other. <br /> <br /> The original Japanese title means "you read books for a while". But of course, when people said, "I want to do what I want to do now", it had to embrace him and love him. He wrote a radio disc jockey that "if God speaks to us, we need at least one whole day". On that day, he dreamed of hard work and the desire to read books. I personally love a woman who loved a man for many years, even after having married another person died for the accident. Therefore setting the story is not that special. Rather, this movie portrays obscure romances among most common men and women. Through this movie, you will remember your romance which has long been lost. It is a movie with permanent effects.
