I first introduced this movie in San Antonio, TX. This movie was second. A double feature. Unfortunately, I saw this where the theater is broken. However, five fingers of death (Ur: King Boxer) were released, released in 1972, and introduced in the United States next year. "Other" Kung-Fu movies were released while riding "Enter-the-Tails" of Enter the Dragon, this particular movie was really good. This is the son of a country who sent himself to the martial arts institute and earned his fighting skills. Meanwhile, the plans and plans of the "rival" martial arts school try to snatch the track using dirty tricks and to prevent them from participating in the tournament, to disappoint our hero. Surprised, I thought Warner Bros. will deliver the film in the US, Warner Bros. is going to issue DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, both of these films are released in English and Cantonese, we / sub-titles ... The next "cleaner and clear" version. Although fighting clues are a little fun (i.e. the flying blow and injury in the air, jumping on the house, using a warrior's head ... literally ... to strike his opponent etc.), despite this, the classic Kung Fu action is wonderful Planned and executed. If you like Enter the Dragon, then there will be an excellent addition to the collection of five fingerprint Death Movie ... if you can find it.
