It's the best book I've ever read. Carl Urban and Steve Jhan are great together. It was drama, adventure and sweet and sadness. I laughed I waved. Gus is hard to laugh while talking. I hope Claire, like Guus Inner, will push. Clara has led Gus for only those years with which she has no intention of marrying him. She just likes playing with her. It is sad that he spent his whole life pining for him. It would have been better if he married Woodro Maggi, then he died on her. Udro was a man who could not express his feelings and kept them bottled. It is clear that he loved Maggie after the attack on Austin when the Rangers came back and he ran to catch him. Val Kilmer is fantastic to play funny characters. I like his screenplay in Captain Inish School. I like the whole loony dive Saga. The best of comanche moon bunch.
