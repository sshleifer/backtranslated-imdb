Despite all the negative criticisms I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not saying this light. I like movies and it's fair about them (more than 9,000 movies on my home DVD collection - some cool, others are okay, some I do not like). And, those who criticize this: A comedy. I simply love this movie. It's light, fun, and very awkward. I'm aware of all of the deficits (or at most) but I love it. Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNro's comedic titles have been taped (completely - for this type of movie). Do not compare this star with other movies, just enjoy it Cast is great and I believe that the purpose of this movie is fully accomplished. If you really want "easy going" and want a very resting night - check out this movie. DÃ©ronro and Murphy were just fun to make this movie, so we'll also see it (seeing it). And, please, not so negative. Do not expect Godfather's performance or do not meet your parents from Denio, do not expect the performance of comedy blockbusters from Marie ... it's a completely different genre and it gave me rest after hard work. Your party may not be divided into smiles, but it is still very interesting.
