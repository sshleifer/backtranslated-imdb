Well I just discovered my eldest sister, Carol from IMDb. Carroll and I played "Fat Uniform Twin" in Midnight Madness. There was not much preparation for our fat part, which came with us and was good and the rest were normal. ;) This was our first major movie role and we had an explosion in it. We were at the age of 21 at that time and lived for about one and a half hours from Barbad's DVD studio and the Hollywood area in California, California. We grew up in front of the TV and probably got some of the first generation of leach-key kids. In the twentieth century, we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or nowadays politically correct. We do not try to do any other work, but after coming to the right opportunity we came to know about 'coming back'. Carroll is a chiropractor in our home town in Southern California and I'm in Georgia's Information Technology field. <br /> <br /> I might favor, but I think the picture was beautiful, clean and fun. We knew it was not a master piece or an Oscar nominated, but it was and it is still a movie that the whole family can see and have fun. Your youngsters can watch videos without moving a specific section fast, but it's not good to think about it. And Carroll and I were released in the video as when it was someone exited. Carroll is available at Kmart for $ 6.99! Now it's a memorable way to capture your memories and share it with others. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Bitsy Lin and Carroll Gune; Thompson Twin
