The train carrying the Union soldiers is taking 300,000 US Dollars, with a banker's clientele, there it is to reach its destination, but it was suddenly looted by the Bandit Monetor. But Bahunanda disappeared with gold and kept hidden, but when Montero tried to find him, the soldiers were killed. Only a formula is a medalist, but Montero is caught and will soon be executed. A stranger dressed as a pastor (who after Monteror's grace) and offered to save his life for half of the gold. In return, Monitours give him half of the medalion, but the client is targeting it and discovering something. Soon three are crossing each other for gold, but the insurance company and the Monituro gang of banks are looking at them, waiting to wait for their opportunity. <br /> <br /> Just seeing the open sequence, you know, 'A spaghetti is based on a tongue-in-the-goal style in the west and many references (some nonsense perceptions) from sub-series (mostly dollar trilogy) based on sprinkling Do it. The clear direction of director Enzo Castallari is broad and mostly lightweight, but there are many possibilities in its grand, decorative set pieces and smooth lithic speed. A lot of tissues, fist-fighting (and lots of acrobatic stunts) are being performed, which are compared to all outdoors animal shootouts. However most stunts work very well, and are very enjoyable and have burning power when shooting guns. The traditional story takes a closer look to the current, but many conviving and outfoxing are in progress, so the spontaneous nature ensures that you are not sure how you are finally going through three. This leads up to many effective suspenseful moments, shiny twists, and surprises, in plenty, wink. Lovely cute characters in Stark script. Work kindly in light and bright style, Giovanni Bergamini dynamically taut framing and impulsively enthusiastic score of Francesco de Masi. Performance is very well designed and formed in an interesting relationship. George Hilton's wry and scuffed turn hesitated as strangers strangely. Gilbert Rowland came with class and intelligence in his wonderful Mexican band Monteiro. Ed Byers gives a perfect performance as a client, that holds up well. Karen is not able to do much, but a worthy look. Gerard Herrter, Pedro Sanchez and Iowa Staccio supported support. <br /> <br /> A fun and deserving spaghetti parody / tribute that is another and very fruitful, after a 'no' dirty antics rains a curve.
