I saw this movie at the age of 6, it was in the Children section of Ariels Video because it was an animation. We saw it and it was a completely different ball game! A very violent story and graphic death is very entertaining and compulsory, but not for children. Avoid watching the family, my mother had almost a heart attack and separated the video!
