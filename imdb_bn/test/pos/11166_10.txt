Great movie about a great man Thomas Kreschmann, like all his other films, is the first rate. I have never seen him as Pope John Paul. It's the volume for the casting director Why did they throw him as a German officer? And he came only after the "Pianist" for universal attention? Of course she looks so hot at uniform. I hugged a very beautiful girl on her beautiful face. But this guy is a great actor and has such great potential. If you do not trust me, then go to watch "Stalinad". I hope he gets a lot of great role in future with more diversity. Otherwise, what is a hearty waste of great talent?
