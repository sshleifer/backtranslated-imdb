This Christmas gift has reached TCM courtesy. We have seen many films of Stanwick repeatedly, although we have never seen this movie. This comedy makes us so laughable that sometimes we had to stop ourselves if we had to listen to our dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is in the pressures of people, especially around Christmas. It will certainly lift one's spirits by letting go. The movie will make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS tape. <br /> <br /> "Crystal in Connecticut" was directed by Peter Godfrey's great pan ache, based on the story of Isleen Hamilton. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Barbara Stanwick always played strong deliberate women, presumably, it was a change of pace for her. In this film, as well as "Lady Eve", Miss Stanwick displays a thrill for comedians. He and Mr. Morgan, who played many musical comedies, created a winning combination. <br /> <br /> There is no poor performance in the movie. Sydney Greenstone, who is an infamous actor for the "heavy" play, is rich and greasy Alexander Eardenley, who owns a media empire and is happy to see who knew it well. A successful English actor, Reginald Gardner, added star cast glasses behind the two principals. <br /> <br /> Jade Sakal, another source of continuous joy; She played Hungarian Chef Felix, who had a hard time with the English version's own version. Also, he is a perfect naura who owns the perfect Connecticut farm house of Sloan. <br /> <br /> In order to read other comments on this forum, glorious black and white paintings are not appreciated. By some people Finally, in the 40's, the color was not widely used and most of the classic movies should be seen in its original format because what will be done in their 'color'? <br /> <br /> This image should be done for almost two hours during the Christmas time, anyone who wants to spend uninterrupted fun, because the total measurement is confirmed. See it with an open mind and heart, perhaps you want to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
