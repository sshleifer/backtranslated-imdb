This is a phenomenal movie. One of the best movies I've ever seen was really one. I'm a serious critic and it takes a lot to wake me up, but there was all the proper adjustment to "stir" this movie. Serious and subtle truth about the actor's emotions, restraint, injury for all characters, marriages and divorce, all of this must be seen in the film, though it was in the 1970s. This is not necessarily an "old movie", but a classic / vintage movie. I hope you will be associated with it as I see how all kinds of unstable relationships happen, when you also consider how deep a pain can be with love and how difficult decisions can always be the most painful, but once they reduce the pain Will be, but only slowly. This film must show that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and are certainly not synonymous with abandonment or lack of love. The film's 'Crafting' must of course originate from a place in someone's heart and mind.
