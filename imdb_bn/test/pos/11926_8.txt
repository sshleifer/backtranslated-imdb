I am rarely part of the smart-ased teenage film, whose authorities have problems, but "toy soldiers" raised me with a repetitive philosophy. It's becoming a big movie like Billy Presser and is becoming adults as something else, and I credit San Austin and writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr. instead of making it a big part of it, rather than publishing it and sneaking on you. The camerarets of the pressers, their grief over the death of Joe, and their joy to their survival, all are actually going on. And, I must admit, I can take a certain patriot (and perhaps a little reptile) gly when the US Army boys finally move and poke a fair-terrorist butt. Oh-Rah, General Crumer! And heroic Robert Fox score is the highest cherry. I'm sure, we can find hundreds of reasons to not like "toy soldiers", but unless we take it seriously, I do not see the requirements. This is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.
