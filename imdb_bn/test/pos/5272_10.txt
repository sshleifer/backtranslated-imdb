The Helge Schneider defies a simple description or rapid sorting. Nevertheless, for the international audience not to be known to him, someone can say that he is something weird like Al Yanakovich and Andy Kaufmann, which adds a sum to decorate jazz music and 70's outside. Her stage performances are already brilliant, her movie work is only rousingly violent. <br /> <br /> "I think 200 Schneider" is the best movie of the Hedgehog. He played two leading roles - Police Intelligence "Commander 00 Schneider" and a valuable minor role as a murderer-famous "Nihil Baxter" and physician "Dr. Hasenbin". <br /> <br /> In the scene, we see how modern-art-loving backliters accidentally killed Bratislav Metulsky, a circus couple, from whom he bought an unused jaguar, when a favorite sculptor came out of the hand of the bacteria, seriously hit Metloski Do it. After reading about newspaper events, an adult actor played with the same name at the age of 200, with the support of his loyal side Lieutenant Quarsegan, the case came back from retirement to investigate. They quickly picked up the track of Baxter and asked for a strangely decorated palace (one of the best scenes in the movie!), But initially failed to gather any evidence. The story often turns into a wind, which does not contribute to the development of the plot in most of the scenes, but is cheerfully funny, such as 00 by the dreadrium (with the most unusual scenes in the short summary car in the film running on the film), a police departmental party, at which time a queue with the Head of Quirechenz Entered and was admitted to the hospital, and already mentioned Said to be. A visit to Hasenbin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> So you take everyone out in search of new laughter, I firmly recommend this movie. Have got caught? You must understand German (I have doubts about an English version) ...
