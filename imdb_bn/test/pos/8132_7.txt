Although I saw this movie in French, I'm sure it lost something in the translation, lack of pronunciation, etc. It's a nice, fun movie - a real pick-me-for a room in a hotel, has been correctly and positively illustrated for finding a place among private sexuality, gender roles, and communities - including male, gay, urban, 30- Ihs etc. I television for such an honest and positive image exhibition of the French gay community. Although the lead of the gay lead is finally finished somewhat "straight", it is frustrating, life, and sometimes it happens. This is a great movie, whether alone or with a date! A really enjoyable experience.
