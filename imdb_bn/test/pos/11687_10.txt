One of the remarkable successes of the fall of Western civilization, filmmaker Penelope Spirits 'Indy Breakthrough', is that it might appeal to non-punk fans like hardcore. More importantly, the movement takes a moment in history before it becomes fully "marketable", when the band plays (or, at least, will try to play in some cases), dirty clubs which were to viewers as self-respect, as they respect for the band Was there. For fans like me, there are valuable interviews with LA's Punk-Scam's mythological stories, some dead, some are still alive and still working hard. <br /> <br /> The Circle Xerox, X, Black Flag (in the days of pre-Henry Rollin day), Catholic discipline, Fear, Alice Bag Band, and the most memorable (in my opinion) germs are on performance and interviews. Although I knew some of the cinematic bands and actors (The Zerox and Black Flag), I only heard rumors about lead singer Derby Crash, and thought of being one of the footage of this photo. Not if not, epitomes of punk movement. He does not take himself too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he speaks of his complete cruelty, and the attitude he brings on stage is both fun and joyful in a free-form way. An actor who is probably afraid of Steve Miller and Jackson Brown from their skins. <br /> <br /> The non-punk fan (it is difficult to find in the video) to find out the film's civilization is not reducing, but it should not necessarily turn them off. Like an anthropomorphic person inserted into a party, Spyriz treats the behaviors of these vessels, their motives, their likes and dislikes, and their strengths on those and off-screen people. Some of them are closed almost as normal, some do not, but they are not too open for things that are offensive to them. Above this, the film must surely see the views of the children which they think are crazy fans just because they hear the good Charlotte and Blink-182: If you want to get the real key to the movement and style of the stone you profess to love, give the pioneers a chance.
