I found these Stooges to be more chaotic than the short (as weird as that weird). There were a number of funny bits, especially the running gags ("Dr. Howard Calling, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!", Breaks the glass door, entered the stughus supply provider's room and came back ... well, you know), but it's pretty Something was taken that did not give any idea to me. I think that these "Main In White" scenes were generally closed, but since I do not know much about this movie, I can not say for sure. Maybe someone could explain this, I appreciate this short more.
