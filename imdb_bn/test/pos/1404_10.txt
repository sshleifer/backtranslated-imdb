How even hit was even played across. Wonderful for the silent film that William Hines was in an acting range. Not on the edge Camera work is the most wonderful, and moments that have been associated with the story, when he is waiting to see the superintendent, it is done very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
