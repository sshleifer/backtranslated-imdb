Even for the film, there is a little more for this film. Okay, a little more ... after seeing my first thought, I just lost my mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Darko fans are not going to like other Richard Kelly because they value their strange rituals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I had to see before I chose the box to be honest. <br /> <br /> Deep meaning - (To maintain a bunch of anti-social groups) People are surrendering, we have made a decision that can destroy our lives and can not open mail without return address. Summary: The unclear old man tells Cameron Diaz, if you push the button, then I'll kill someone who you do not know and gives you millions of dollars. Of course he gets a case of money as it pushes and promised by the weird old. Then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. To type my fingers ... To press the button, to press the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by the supernatural tribes, in an extensive test to gauge the ethnicity of human species. <br /> <br /> I like: Ignore the desire to film generic movies. It's different. Its intense It has a deep meaning (though its philosophy 101 material). It's the page you guess. Do not End a Hollywood! <br /> <br /> I liked: Why such a ridiculous plan to interfere with other technology? What is God like tradition to have patience for? Diaz was good, but what was the need to pronounce the country? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I gave it 7 because Kelly did not pay much attention to her other movies. Overall good flick.
