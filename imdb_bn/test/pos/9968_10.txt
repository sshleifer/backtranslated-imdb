I saw Venice's businessman in London last week. Great acting of Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fines and Lin Collins. Compare to other movies based on Shakespeare's play, making it so easy to understand and follow this product. Bravo directs such top actors such as Michael Radadford. The costume and the scenery are great and it is depicted on Venice's position, since it gives the film and the pure smell. I read this game thirty years ago in the school and emphasized the anti-Semitic behavior of Christians and the cruelty of Christians towards the Jews. I do not know whether this movie is going to be controversial, but in some cases I'm sure it will get some Oscar nominations.
