If you want to see a true thriller, rent this !!! This is not the director or screenwriter of "Scrum", it is not an extra payment feature for the supermodeled "TV" actors converting as "star," and it is not the driving force of special effects. Instead you will find a top authentic, crazy, very powerful (violence) yet thrilling nailbiter.
