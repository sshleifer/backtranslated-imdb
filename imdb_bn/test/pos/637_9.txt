In the first 5 minutes it is always a well-known and important pointing device to set up a film's atmosphere. In important introductory scenes, the film will have to strengthen itself and take notice of visitors and be interested in the rest of the film. Here, we find a main example of this among "mute witness". <br /> <br /> * Explosion of the scene * <br /> <br /> In the first 5-10 minutes, the film opens very well with a beautiful blonde lady Hechokhian scene, with radio. He wanders, lipstick, tricks himself, and ignores news reports of a serial killer in zero. Of course, the serial killer has his home, and his moves, hand knife monitoring. He looks at a room, shows a room, and has a partner in his pool of blood. At the very point of his scream, he faces face-to-face with a knife-crooked dog who repeatedly performs a cruel and terrible act. <br /> <br /> ... Then it'll be a bit weird. As a woman's miserliness in her death, the killer sat down and took a cigarette to see her victim wasted. Before finding out his lighter, his cigarette is provoked ... someone else in the room! The camera has gone out, and we realize that there are more people in the room, some take notes, some are filming, some are recording deaths, and the woman who is taking too much time to die, and very hammy is working too . When the audience realizes what is happening and the whole scene is part of a movie, then the suspicious and horrific scenes take on the elements of humor. <br /> <br /> * End view spiller * <br /> <br /> I highlighted this opening scene for a variety of reasons. First of all, it portrays the entire film's atmosphere. A thriller in Hitkoc or De Palma style, with some very unhealthy and even curious moments. - It reveals a central issue (it is a film screen death and a difference between a 'snap film death' which is released later in a movie) and finally it represents the characters in the audience, as soon as possible with silence <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Billy can not speak, but she communicates with her sister in sign language. After the filing of the evening, delivery was accidentally locked in the warehouse accidentally and in an attempt to flee, two crew interviews show that the first one seems to be a pornographic film, but it is a spoiled movie. Suddenly, his turn from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> No doubt, the first half of the film is strong and absolutely gripping. The grace of Billy's salvation, and his difficulty is that he is not able to say a word. (Actually, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is that women shouting is not shiny). Some perfect boring moments and some fantastic set pieces of real mystery (The Corridor, and Lift Shutts are the perfect examples). The time is liquid, and the whole first half itself is an incredibly satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> Introducing the new concept of the second half of the film. There are still several suspenseful moments, the focus is on plaster twists. New characters are introduced, and they are hesitant to find out which side. Although there is nothing wrong with the second half of the film, it does not measure up to the first half. There are some perfect moments of black hustle that completely spoil jokes and some dramatic scenes, but some very comedy moments (especially coming from Billy's sister and his drunk, who is the director of the movie), which often destroys the film, Because they are badly transmitted and / or mistakenly and destroying the speed. At the end, the twists are coming at a fast speed, and at the end of the film, as well as the Creator, as the first half is in black. <br /> <br /> There are many things that will really make the movie. Baskee's face-to-face communication barriers, such as silent and an American in Moscow, mean that emergency calls have also become dangerous situations for help. Billy, Natasha Juddina starring actress, did a wonderful job of filming, with an on-screen presentation and a brilliant performance, and finally, in the entire direction, but especially in the first half of the film, which is a study of genuine Alfred Hitchcock's suspense / thriller film techniques. <br /> <br /> I have said already, though, the mismanagement of the movie has come from some terrible comic relief moments which really do not need to be added. There is a consistent and effective structure in dark hues appearing in the film to look at some visible seat-comers for Karen Hughes and Andy Clark characters (sisters and moviemakers). However, despite these flaws, the film is ideal for a group full thriller thriller and Halloween. (Naturally Slashar is better than awesome movie ...!)
