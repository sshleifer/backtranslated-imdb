"Sarah, Plain and Tall" I enjoyed three movies in the trilogy. These three final decisions were "good people". This is an excellent family movie with three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close, and Jack Paul's extraordinary performance. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but well-established. The only sub-performance was by one of the children. It was interesting to see how the children grew up from the first movie. First of all, "Sarah," the first was a pretty cinematography. It was not in this movie, but it was the best story. It was some really-tearsome moments of moments and a very beautiful end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
