When I saw this picture I probably had a really good mood. But whatever, I really liked this picture. Was it a terrible root? No Was this a little guessable? Yes And what's that? It was still a really nice movie. I always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, Hudson Haque and the fifth element was, after all), and he perfectly portrayed a selfish, satirical b *** ard. Maybe this is not an element of the Academy Award Academy, but it is a good element to make sure. Rent it.
