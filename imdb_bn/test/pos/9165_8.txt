The "Sparta" Italian concept was grace and stagnation in social behavior, which achieved success of love according to the 16th century manual "The Cortier". The film "Hit" is valuable for the episode of "Spreazatour" concept in the dynamic performance of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Smith Alex is the character of Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant who is short of luck and confidence. With the surprise of the New Yorkites to win the heart of Socialite and Sarah's attraction to Sarah's attraction and Alice's Island, Hit has coached her painful and dangerous Albert in pain. In these scenes, Smith supports the good work from Kevin James and Eve Mendes. But this film is directed by Smith's impressive and amazing personality. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning, Smith's average smile has raised above the script so that "hits" can create a nicely visible and entertaining film. I do not believe that this actress is capable of caring with a comedic mom like Will Smith, and one of the best actors who is acting today. And its secret is "sprezzatura"!
