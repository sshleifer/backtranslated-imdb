This is the fourth full-length feature film by Mark Richard. By the third 'Les Mans buides' hands-appear-I promise myself not to cut myself in my veins. But this time the plot was completely different - Ramon Barnels (Saddleley 1940 - Reus 2001) respected to a Catalan journalist. The scenes of the trailer are stunning-danced in the sunlight-and the promise that Mark himself will be in front of the camera with his two brothers - both professional actors - it ended up six weeks after the liberation war. Escape to this very unusual road / river film yourself. Do not learn much about Ramon Barnels, but his most heinous heir: a constant battle against the forgetting of the Catalan people. 'La batalla de l'Ebre' - Look for Ebro War at Wikipedia- Once not lost but 40 years after half-hearted and half-hearted democracy 25 years someone has kept in mind many legal laws in Spanish civil war and those who fight it. The film goes about in the same place with very little conscience about what took place almost 70 years ago. This picture is about the landscape.
