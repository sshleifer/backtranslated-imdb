I am here to be a vast minority. I do not take too much care for the original cadets, as well as Chase / Murray from the scene and Rodney Jock. All right, break it: Rodney vs. Jackie - Both Jews and have similar comedies. Rodney is a bigger name and more distinct. Jackie is a formal and more observational approach to his curiosity and there's more 'up yours' in this signal. Jackie's attitude towards everything is memorable and in a way, inspirational! His quick line and confidence left me so I could express myself in this way. Rodney was good, but it was not enough, and he was more 'your face' and dismissive. Jackie, in the appearance of a rare movie, made a perfect sub for the arrival of Rodney (a gun-shaped hair dryer?!?), Really look small things! <br /> <br /> Stack vs Knight - both play very good snobby yuppies. Teddy Night, despite his amazing TV / film career, Kinda shows his age. However, he does not pull the snobbish needs of the part and we want to see him fall. Ted looks weak and quite annoying, playing a very slapstick with his anger and frustration, while the stack is more snide and vengeance eventually; You really enjoy watching him hate him and constantly failing him. Wins the stack with me <br /> <br /> Murray vs. Icord-Well, both were excellent, Vintage SNL-like scenes that are life-long and enjoyable Chie Chase (Tie Web). I like the murray / good one like that. Murray with his obvious improv skills, his great, annoying, chatty character is dramatic and loving- yet annoying. And the exact same can be said for aykroyd. After a while it became annoying, but it tie. <br /> <br /> For the first time I really like the second part. They have 2 completely different mooded films. One of the parts is more drugs / bathrooms / sexual humor with a cast full of great drugs. Part 2 uses golf as a 'stick-to-the-the-money-rich' comedy kind of backdrop, which feels better about a working class. 80's script? Yes A little away? Yes, but was not the first? Golf is an insult? Yes, this is a movie. Thin story Yes, it's a comedy with real humor - not 'dance with wolf' !! As well - Part 2 has a good soundtrack !! Please do not expect this to be a secular event !! It has 98% of its own film and it does not have to be named 'Cadishashak'. That said, I caddyshack 2 is a great fan and it's 80's fluff entertainment great editor with quality humor. Viva Jackie Mason !!! Light up all the reducers! It is a custom comedy of its own. Randi quaid was wonderful, Jonathan Silverman was wonderful, hack, everyone was !! This is all chats and now I feel like watching it! I think I will
