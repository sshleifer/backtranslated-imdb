Before reading the film I read the book, and the film is one of its best adaptations. Very true and faithful to the book. Sun pens and Sundance are amazing. Robins is a talented filmmaker and I hope he'll add more to his reproduction. He made the film very hunting and deliberately slow to add deeply. Especially a big bit of film production was soon reflecting the victims in the presence of the execution room.
