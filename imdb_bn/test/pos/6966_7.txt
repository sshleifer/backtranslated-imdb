This movie was on IMDB Button 20, I only had to pay it. <br /> <br /> recommend! Surprised! At this point there is no sadness to see everyone. In fact, I really enjoyed it. This film has a camp level that puts the classical 80s classical as shameful. Is it a fool Yes, but Jim Onnoski has proved that stupid is not bad at all later. <br /> <br /> Rent it for comedians but it is actually meant to be funny. Wynorski is a genius. Hopefully next Ninja kurtcha will run the movie
