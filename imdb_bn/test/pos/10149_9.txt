I can not believe this movie is just 7.4 score! This must be with Hitkow's best film such as VERTIGO or Marney. The only reason I can remember is that the score is so low, that in most cases people will abandon violence and not get a diploma in "gender and crime". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Today, Mel Gibson has seen a lot of harsh kidnapping films, as it seems to be normal, but in the 1950s, where the family was in contemporary America, the concept of such crimes must have stirred many emotions. <br /> <br /> And this tension still works for me. Yes, these boys are selfish, unknown savage, they are annoying about how they work: it is an agreement for them, and they want to be a "good businessman", the business here is kidnapping opera kids and killing politicians! <br /> <br /> The movie makes great, but the creative aspects, the strange views of Hitako, the scary bizarre view of the church (which makes the audience's attention lonely, how the titles are abandoned, no one cares, no one is helping, the church People are going home ...), preparing stuffed and dead animals with the owner of the shop (which is somewhat "regional"), at least at least this movie is about music. There is Mika. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> So the hitchcock allowed the camera to follow the orchestra score and now it will happen in a second *** and *************************************************************************************************************** He is singing to inform the children in his parents' embassy ... <br /> <br /> Everyone: Classic !!
