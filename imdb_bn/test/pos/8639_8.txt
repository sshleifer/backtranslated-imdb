Wow, what a weird film It's a wonderful wonder that's a David Liberation movie so it's wonderful. <br /> <br /> I deny someone to explain everything in this film completely. I can not be done. After doing some research after this second look, I know most of the stories but without first aid or other help from critics or help, it is difficult to portray the subject. So, if you're in that boat and get confused, do not feel bad; It's normal. Just tell me what is the character of Navimi Watts? <br /> <br /> <br /> I love the wonderful visual and rich colors, and each character in this movie is really different and fun to see. The camera-work is excellent and the music is vague, a La Lynch's "Blue Velvet." Some dramatic scenes have some good sound effects to help. <br /> <br /> "Lincoln" Twin Pix "television series, it was a film that eventually clashed together, because Lynch felt that the film was going to be long out of the TV series. When it did not happen, in the last minute he ended. Ultimately, due to some confusion and the characters we see before the movie, there may be reasons for lack of explanations, but those who disappear mysteriously. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story, supposedly, negative comments about it is Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems that both women are crazy, sometimes looking, at other times, stunning. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie for the second time looking at the first picture. This is not just a curiosity piece; This is a very interesting movie .. If you can not understand a few things but just do not feel stupid.
