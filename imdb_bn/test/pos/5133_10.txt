I must admit, I was surprised when this movie was so good at how good it was. I planned to watch it in the theater during the summer, but it has already gone and gone. Therefore, I was expected to have moved from the theater because it was bad. Then, today, I saw it hired and really enjoyed it. The speed that was happening in the event was suspicious, it could be a bit more. I think it was true to the book, but it excluded some important parts: the original name of Milet Finger, etc. I felt that I did not read the book, then I could not understand what was happening. Acting was great, another thing I wanted to be poor, but the police super, I can not remember the name of the actor, I could work a little better. After all, I found this a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all the audience!
