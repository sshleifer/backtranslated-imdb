For the first time you watch this movie but you can hate it, but the second time you see this movie I guarantee that all around are laughing. Dog owners are so fluent that you can not help but look at them and smile. From the announcer to Littlest Toys Poodle, everything will make you laugh. And you can learn each single nut there!
