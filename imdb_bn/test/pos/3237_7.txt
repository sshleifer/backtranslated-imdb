I again saw this on BBC Channel 4. This is not the best novel by Jane Austen in any way, but the film is a reasonable explanation. I doubt there was more crowd rather than shown at the rally council at Bath. Perhaps they can not afford extra Why also everyone is silent so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation? When I was going to dance, no one ever told me that I never said anything and I doubt that the bath in the 18th or 19th century was the same. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that America / Canada reviews; They miss the harmful elements that have been completely lifelong. The "Gothic" scenes are presented very cleverly, but you have to read them correctly. I'm sure Jane A will be gently amused by those reviews. Nothing suggests, does anyone else think that Peter Firth does not see more than Colin Baker (former doctor), or older both are older?
