The Westerners of West 1940's, when I came across TCM or FMC, I see, because it is historically flawless, but it is very entertaining and well-played, the plan was Radcliffe Scott, who got my favorite actor second only with Gary Cooper-Well, OK, Fourth Coop, Charlton Heston, and behind Gregory Peck. But the film itself, however, is historically correct, and as I said earlier, played well and very well "flowing" - I made sure I saw it 50 or 60 times and enjoyed more than ever before watching it. I am tape from TCM but after buying it it will buy it within a minute. If you do not see it - I'm sure you like it!
