This is a really ridiculous movie and I have seen many times. Drew Barry's brightness like Jos√© Geller, as David Arquette is his brother. You feel embarrassed to return to high school, because the high school was really like! Her teams are painful and weird, and it brings back memories of those who wear a little again! The lady Michael Warton was adorned as a teacher (I was a teacher while I was in high school!) And Josie Bos was fantastic. This is a movie that you can see repeatedly, with a fabulous sound track! One after another who is studying in school for 90!
