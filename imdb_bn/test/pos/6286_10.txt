It was a funny movie, which often forgot, because there are probably many such tin and young adult comedy. The movie is not released as expected. The crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very dedicated friend. Still, Rebecca, an unlikely match for those who have an interesting and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. When he helped to feel more easily at school, showing him around the neighborhood and encouraging him to further socialize, they become friends, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes that her boyfriend can offer, she does not feel ready to be ready, she loves her boyfriend, but feels like enjoying the life of her free retired party in college, she is still not ready to save the life of marriage and responsibility. You learn well that a good friend crawls when he tells her that she will help her out of marriage. When his boyfriend offers to him, in front of the whole family, he crawls and spots him. He told the whole family that he offered to him and gave his ring a ring, which was his whole time (he certainly came from money or something, and he never stopped ringing). The message of the film seems to not be about judging people by their appearance and judging people before judging them. Rebecca's boyfriend, who loves her parents, means that when Rebecca (Amber Thesan) and after the crawl broke her new girlfriend, Rebecca used to break Crowl. Although they were not, Rebecca was crazy about her, when you thought about it, it was inappropriate, because they were not a couple, but I think they started to like each other. And I think he was thinking more. The film never showed them that they really became a couple, they kept it open for the viewer's decision. They did not even kiss at any time, even though they were almost a share. That was one thing that most visitors misunderstood. Many people saw and said that parents would be mistreated after seeing their homes or shocks, but eventually they were friends all the time. And he did not introduce her as his boyfriend; Yet they did not tell their parents that they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did not. Even if she never became her lover, they could still be friends. Men in the 90s were men and this big stereo was that women's women liked men (there is no problem with them), it seems that this kind of sensitive sensitive woman, who crawls through Rebecca with her friendship, is proven. But when I saw the movie, I must admit, if I see, I think I will go for the first boyfriend. Yet it was a creative film, which taught a lesson on friendship and tried to judge others.
