Pickle was one of the most undressed films of the decade. Despite my best efforts at home, it is still seen as a bad movie. I say hell on this with everyone. Not everyone can understand that it's finally a comedy with a dramatic turn. Danny Aiello conveys a burning director with a perfection and a sad depressed man. He is trying to record a last message, the scene is pretty good. The interludes of stone cinema are absolutely fun. "This is Harry Stone and today I become a man!" All a fine and sad misunderstood movie. Plus by a great camio Little Richard extremely happy! I hope this movie will see more people because 202 people are not enough to agree. <br /> <br /> - Silence dogs
