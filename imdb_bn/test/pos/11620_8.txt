"Subconscious Cr√ºcklty" One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Although it is very serious and important, politically correct mainstream should not disturb the fans of the trash. The film mixes a lot of wonderful scenes with a lot of strange scenes. And gore.It is extremely weird, mischievous and annoying, so bizarre movie fans will not be disappointed. My favorite segment from "Subconscious Crucifixi" is "Human larvae" which shows us an isolated relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The Birbhum view is especially nasty and not easily forgotten. The last part can be believed "right brain / martyr" It is incredibly harsh and condemnable with scenes of genital mutiny and fatal torture. We detain Jesus Christ through three nude women who secrete him, tear his flesh off his chest, hit his knees, and squeeze him. There is a statue of Jesus with a proverb in it. "The subconscious crew" is a really memorable movie that should be watched by fans of extreme movies. Check it out.
