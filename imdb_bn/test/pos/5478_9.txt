This is a Hollywood film. The certificate of the accused is not revolutionary. This picture will not change the world. However, it is well-made, well-planned and well-played which calculates for many. <br /> <br /> This is a disgruntled former CIA assassin cat and mouse story that trails betraying. John F. Kennedy, a secret service agent who saved Danes Kennedy while he was dead. In the next years of his career, the agent was able to understand this failure, and when the film began in 1992 or in contemporary America, it was Mitch Layer (John Malkovich's assassin's killer). In which he gives a transitional performance) and has been conspiring with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to kill the President. He hid that he has a common reason for secret service agent Frank Harrigan (Clint Eastwood is the best in his cool, quiet, good nature), who believes that he believes because he believes because the Warren Commission has blamed Hargin unfairly, Levy believes - for the killing of President Kennedy. From Larry to Hargin-Layer's phone calls, the tension does not want to betray her position and plan even if she wants to keep Harrogine close. <br /> <br /> Rally Russo is excellent, Lioli develops a cooperative agent with whom Horrigan raises a raised relationship. It is nice to see the relationship between two equally capable colleagues (even if the ROSO is a fair deal compared to Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is able to go to toe with toes with a quiet, capable agent fast-witted Horrigan in Friendly Banner. This is a wonderful part of Russo, which is not for him to play the role of a capable professional woman and the default romantic interest of the old man. I can show the film over, leadership acting, Wolfgang Peterson's skillful thinking, thoughtful use of plot development, and excellent cinematography.
