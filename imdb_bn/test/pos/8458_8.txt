Intelligent, nail-drama did not come out of anywhere in 1979 and soon was in the cover of every American newspaper (when life followed the picture). An atomic power plant in Southern California gave a threat to the plant when it decided to go public with the real story behind the accident. Apparently a stuck valve problem, the film of a TV news crew shows that it is an accident that is investigating an accidental ratio - and worse, the security conditions are scrubbing millions of dollars, which is a cover-up that pays everyone's life . The film also gets very much more technical (especially the second half), and Jack Leman, Jane Fonda (the right place at the right time, as a pap-tune news-woman) can perform the performance, and use more human interplay. Michael Douglas (as a freelance cameraman) is fantastic. The explosion bits involved with atomic protesters are considered completely accurate and bitterly satirical, and news-beijing (with its corporate structure and bogus yes-men) are considered separately. **** to ****
