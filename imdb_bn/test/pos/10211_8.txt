I doubt whether the real story of the development of the Western Union has achieved the true audience. Instead of talking about the telegraph system building in the West, it is the story of the board room, which has affected one of the most appealing (and unhappy) of the great "Robber Baron": J. Gaul The Gould Striker took it off and turned it into a communication giant - and part of its effort to compete against Vanderbart in a national railway system. But, while interesting, the telegraph line itself is not as exciting as the story of laying. At least, the audience will see how it is. J Gould died in 1829. He lived in modern times and invested in Hollywood, perhaps he also agreed to this assessment. <br /> <br /> The film captures the telegraph system as it is endangered. Inspired by the Indians, by Jack Slade (Barton McCallen). Slayd is not disappointed with the development of a frustrating communication system, which will certainly create a quarrel between its power, which will avoid the police in the region. He faces a telegram cable bed, Edward Criton (Dean Jagger), a relative of Crayton's brother Richard Black (Robert Young), and a brother of Slade's brother Van Cheyau (Randolph Scott), a London man. With a little understanding of the West, the former Blake, Crete's sister Su (Romania Giulom) is romancing, but it seems difficult to use around her new surroundings. But he has become a close friend, especially trying to face the slide. <br /> <br /> Slade was a real Western criminal and a section of Rogue IT in Mark Twain. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he was not involved in stirring the Indians against the railway or telegraph company. However, MacLean makes him a memorable, evil, and completely harmful type. One of the main characters is that her assassination suddenly and backs away - and she saw the corpse, even though she was only freed from an annoyance. But lang is also responsible for other touches. See the order of Chil Wills, where he repairs it to a telegraph pole. While talking to the young man, he sprayed tobacco juice several times, who was scattered. Then an Indian attack which we observe from the ground level. In conclusion, Yang suddenly explodes, but it is not brown, but the red casts her. He looks at the top of the pole, and through him there is a will with an Indian arrow. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting movie, and interesting to watch.
