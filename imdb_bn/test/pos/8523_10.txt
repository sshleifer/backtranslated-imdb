In 1983, two bond films were produced, Roger Moore's acting official Bond film, Octopussy, which was first performed for James Bond in Live and Le Mai, and the other was the unauthorized Bond film Never Say Aware Aven, who played Shan Connery. James Bond's role for the first time in Dr. Noon, the film was first created in the 007 James Bond film. Do not say it is sometimes called unauthorized because the company that created another James Bond film did not create it. Never Say Never Again Again, a remake of the 1965 007 movie Thunderbolt, there is a difference between Never Say Never Again, which can tell you not made by EON. One thing that's different from opening, no gun barrel sequence and no pre-credit sequence, another difference is the music score. Some things in this movie seem like gadgets and cars like James Bond, plus James Bond has always found it with women, and the film has an opening credit song. San Connie still does a great job of playing bonds, the other big actors are also great. <br /> <br /> Never say again a good movie that is entertaining like the official James Bond film. See it 10/10
