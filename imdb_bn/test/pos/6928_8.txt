At first I thought the film would annoy me. It was such that I saw this movie somewhere earlier. Surprised hero, father-in-law and 9-year-old sister who is older and intelligent than her age (see Gregory's daughter), but then, not within 15 minutes, it became a laughing heart laugh at a movie. Dylan Muran (I thought it was just going to bug me) was nice. Mr Gammon and Crazy was as a Scottish Hitman. Lena Haydy was extremely sexy. For half of the film I was trying to remember where I saw him earlier. Parole Officer. She has the most amazing smiles. But Mr. Kain, the true hero of this film. These people will have to do a lot of comedy. It also goes alongside its best comedy roles (Uncle Clooney, the Wanted Rotten Scouts). He is delighted to see all his scenes, but especially towards the end. <br /> <br /> Someone can not say how ** can ** to Microsoft. <br /> <br />
