When I was a child I saw the movie. I think it's a great movie to watch for kids and do not be afraid of any violence or pornography of parents. Sunny Brite is a delightful young girl and she is trying to go away in the winter. He tries to steal some or anyone's life source and finds it for themselves. I love this movie and I think even adults can enjoy this movie.
