Basically, this is a very good film. Although it is much different from other movies of Sigl, which unfortunately can stop some fans. Contrary to some other photo, it does not seem like a 'Sigal vehicles'. You can see lots of other characters as well as Mr. We did not see all the tasks of the seagulls before. The concept of 'intellectual' is a wonderful change in anything other than bomb and other surgery. Although there are some unrealistic portions in the film (some more obvious than others), you can let them slide because the movie is fun. <br /> <br /> It flies to: If you are looking for a classic Seagal action film, sorry but you are going to be frustrated. See it whatever it is for fun. If you open the Seagal without action, it's a good value to look at. I personally believe that this has worked in a few days. <br /> <br />
