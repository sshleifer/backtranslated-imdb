Most people will consider that Yule Brenner's greatest performance was King and I was as the ruler of the fast. Certainly it gave him a variety of moods to test his ability, from being a joke, eager to learn domination from tragic, disgusting. . This shows him to be "conversational" and also as a dancer. Finally, it was also the performance of his Tony Award winner from Broadway, the film allows us to capture some of the great Broadway performance. <br /> <br /> But he did another film which was quite nice with his talent as well as the King and I was once more with his sunny feathering. Anastasia had her performance as General Benin, or in her tenth Parliament session, Ramsey. Yet he came as the heir to the 1950s, as Eric Von Straimhem "loved to hate". A certain weakness in his acting and roles led him to the film, even after his best years after that - and he did much more to repeat the king of fasting on television and stage. <br /> <br> To me, the 1959 play has its best performance with Dabora Care, Jason Roberts Junior, Robert Mourley, Eiji Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The picture has been set in modern times - Hungarian Patriotic Emmetors were in Hungary in 1956 under the renovation of Nagi and her supporters when in Hungary. But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad times. The Russians and their Polish and East German associates sent tanks (and arrested and killed the Nagi and other reformers) to crush the rebellion. The West was standing and this was to happen: England and France were caught in the Suez Crisis and the United States made Israel and Israel vicious for their attack. Due to the activities of three close friends in the US, it was difficult to denounce the high value of the Soviet Union in the West. It was an unfortunate situation, and Hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned. <br /> <br /> Brenner Major Sergeov, a Russian intelligence officer who is waiting for some leaders in Hungary to rebel, one of which is Paul Kids (Jason Roberts). Some Western Cayes support can be found on a bus tour through Hungary, under whose leadership Robert Morley (Marshall, Jackson, Howard and Care). Later, their bus is being restored in the hotel, and Brenner matches them, Roberts hopes to move forward. But the people of Brenner - he tries to sympathize with these people (who everyone sees him as a giant), and according to the sequence, when he was a little more drunk, he confronted the annoying questions of historians since 1945: how (in charge of Russian stalin The one note that remains) Relations between Russia and the West break so fast? From 1941 to 1945, the groups worked well together, but after all, Yalta and Potsdam were triggered by all kinds of mutual suspicions. What do they have Surov is a good officer, but he has been half-leaked to the Communist regime in the Soviet Union and Hungary, and he supports in Hungary and his growing love for care, who is hiding from Robert, is willing to remember the more human side, the Russian chief. And when the film reaches its tragic measure, we will see whether Survad will follow his decision, whether it wants to leave Care, Roberts and other Westerners. It stands out as a real struggle for him - and one that he can delay a lot. It was a great movie about a post-war tragedy and perhaps illustrated by Eul Brenner's most thoughtful role.
