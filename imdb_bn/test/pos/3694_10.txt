You know, comedians often forget that it's okay for frustration. Well, this is not the time. Innocent love does it all. As a romantic lead with Barry Manilo and a dwarf Cam Bates ... and it works. It just does not work, it works very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I smiled so much that I hit myself, but still the main characters were so human, so honest, and very real. But where does the comedy come from? Do the characters need the power to feel real feelings, real emotions, and real pain? Well, they are in this movie. Dirty love is a movie that you should not miss, especially if you need a serious smile, or if you are interested in seeing the psychological dwarf in Red Raincoat.
