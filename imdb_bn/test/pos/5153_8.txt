You, Living (2007) <br /> <br /> Morning. I did not write that word before but it comes to feel here. Let me see it. Well, it's a part of-- Digger, but funny as the hack. So harmful fun. It is impossible to choose it on a dry film, of course, with some dry dry wit and playful humor. In theater stage, static cameras and static cameras, in a few extra styles, we see a small law formulation. <br /> <br /> But it seems to be common - which is not it. General life is shown frumpy, satirical, colorful, coy, and depression. And impossible. We must be alive, of course, and we are alive, we can also take notes. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who saw you laughing yourself and did not know why. Properly. And the propagator material said somewhere that it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and that means it's a dry, silent, promising appearance of the famous Swedish films of Engmer Barman, but it has some sensitive elements of the satirical, British comedians. <br /> <br /> I would say, clearly, at least this half-hour watch will watch. There is a part in me that I thought - still the rest of the little skating and moments continue to be added in the same way and they are slowly growing, but there is no conspiracy in the sub-continent to follow or follow the normal type. After some great moments, even the thunderstorm focuses on, which exposes us thoroughly from human events. <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic in its classical control, almost like a series of scenes in Gregory Crusden (and actually surpassing the photographer). And acting, with its very common, non-glam folksiness, right. A surprising, beautiful, weird experience.
