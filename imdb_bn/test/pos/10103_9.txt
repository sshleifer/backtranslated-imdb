Two sisters, Su-mi (I am Su-Jong) and Su-Yen (Muoun Jun-Youth) returned home with their father (Kim Gap-Soo). Yun-Zu (Yame Jing-A) welcomes them, but Su-Mil's behavior is difficult for her. Su-mien hates Juan-Jun because the father worked as the wife of his mother after mother's death. Seeing his views, Jin-Zun is going to behave cold with sisters and bring an exciting environment among them. <br /> <br /> If it is said through the atmosphere, then mysterious things happen at home. When Su-matching hanging her dress wearing her dress, the same design has already been violated many dresses. When he puts his diary in the drawer, he finds another diary of the same type. When he is sleeping on his bed with a scared Su-yen, a nightmare awakens and she finds a woman standing on her - and the woman comes out from the skirt of the hand! <br /> <br /> Mysterious things happen to other people, too. In the evening next weekend, In-Zu's brother and his wife meet the family and they dine together. Yun-joo gladly talked to a madman when he was a child, but nobody is interested in him. He said, the madman has become disturbed by the brother, but he says he does not know anything about the person. <br /> <br /> On hearing about them, the brother's wife is very scared. <br /> <br /> <br /> After dinner, Yun-Zu and sister-in-law clashed with her. Yun-joo dragged Su-Yen into a garment and locked it in. Su-mi cry out to save the sisters and complain about what their father did to Eun-Joo. But his reaction was unexpected. "Give me a break." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, I hate horror movies . Although I sat myself in a theater because my insight told me that the movie was different, my curiosity started showing me when I started showing it, I was sorry. The reason for the sadness, after ten minutes, was changed to the joy of hope. <br /> <br /> This picture is a lot mysterious than a terrible mystery - horrible and painful! Beautiful than breathtaking That might be a hard-core horror fan, but for a mystery fan like me, this film must definitely see. (10 out of 9)
