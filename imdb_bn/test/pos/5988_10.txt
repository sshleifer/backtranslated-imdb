This is a long time I saw the best movie! The director did a great job by showing contrasts between the social classes, which is very relevant today in France. All characters are lovable, especially Juliet and her family. The development of romance is not entirely realistic, at least reasonable, and does a wonderful job that shows how much people will change for love. Cinderella seems to be the story of warmth - but Cinderella considers herself a powerful woman. I smiled through this whole movie, and I loved it very much. Rome I and Juliet recommend those who enjoy unique characters, comedy, and spontaneous romances.
