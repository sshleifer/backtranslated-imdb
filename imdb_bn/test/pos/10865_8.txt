I started to expect it the worst, I was happy that the film might be enjoyable, in some parts becoming confusing, as if they started singing right away. This gave me a chance to watch Daniel Wa for the first time, I think it's better actor, sometimes he came out of some space. I think the purple storm deserves its Hong Kong legend, because it's the other most HK. Aside from the loss of memory, it is a mental emotional struggle, it can be instantaneous, but ultimately when it really is and who it really makes the film a lot more interesting. Once you enter the film, it will keep you in it, as if you miss a little too many movies can make a will, for example I missed a little earlier and I would recommend to anyone to show it that they will not miss it. So I can say that this movie is valuable to watch and grateful for me, I enjoyed it.
