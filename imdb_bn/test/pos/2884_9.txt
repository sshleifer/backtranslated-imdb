In the playwright's drama of the novel, John Osborn has narrow narratives, has dropped most of his letters, and has been quoted instead of showing Durian's essential wickedness. If you want more clear rendering, see the 1945 film. Wild and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in the same time frame, but of course there were quite a few men and writers. This story really talks with Stevenson's "Dr. Jakeel and a theme like Mr. Hyde", but remember that the WILD decided to choose his story, and RLS took the scientific path. Both of the plays are male, among them good evil, finally evil victory. <br /> <br /> The actor of this BBC movie chose different ways than the 1945 film. George Gilgood said, similar jokes and fascinating quips like George Sanders, his role really reveals Wild, but with a delicate difference. The doubtful people would surely believe that he really believed what he was saying, but Gilgood might have said what he expected of him rather than faith. Peter Fever showed the two sides of his character in modest fashion, but then we can not see many parts of it, such as had the opportunity to display the Haard Hatfield. <br /> <br /> It reflects the needs of the novel, good production with dramatization, if all its traffic is not there.
