My teacher did this movie. This is a new start. See it, and you will not see it in a Romanian movie. The old annoying style has gone. Now it's something else. After a revolutionary movie. It is using the latest imaging technology and most unknown artists. They are unique. You do not even know what you are looking at, you will only be moved out of the screen and you will feel each frame. Do not miss it, pay attention to the plot but do not ignore details. They make the difference between this film and other Romanian films. You will hear some music at some point in time. It is representative for a part of us, but it does not represent us. Please just keep your head straight and leave your body free.
