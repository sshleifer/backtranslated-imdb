This movie has a serious view. A scene that can tell you that his film does not drag many cheap punches. It takes place in a crowded train station and the drama is attacked by the killers with automatic weapons. They made a break for it and managed to get out of the hunt of the gunfight. The head of the train station is filled with crossfire and dead bodies of innocent people. Keep in mind that something that is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick would be very sad and / or serious call. I call it honesty. Most action films lean towards "safe direction" to show violence and plot elements. Most of these mean innocent innocent people do not die in innocent shootouts or at least we do not see them die. Violence vs all good people versus good vs. bad versus people badly dead. <br /> <br /> Renee Hurlin showed her one of its first (and sadly) hits, Die Hard 2. These villains deliberately destroyed the entire plane of the people. Get their points. The scene was illustrated with a backup scene just on the Cargo plane, in which some people on-board were leaving, but the intense and perhaps more realistic scenes were over. However, to fit the spirit of the first film, Die Hard 2 is mostly the "Fun Action Movie". Here, that is a wide range of grimmer and more convincing edges. Violence is bloody. One liners are pleasing, but echo in the original moment of action in a certain style that clich√©d some more natural echoes than the film wiseracks. The plot is also packed with more malicious purpose than most action films. Villain is not a little rude to just retaliate or to drive madness in power. It's less ridiculous, but more awesome than that. From recent movies, the "Bourne" trilogy gets it with less chassis than the normal action film genre, but this film was made big on the screen with Matt Dammon's "The Broomen Identity" from 1996 to 7 years ago. <Br /> <br /> Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually the heroine. And before the movie version of "Tomb Rider" hits, it's good. What's more is that this heroine really feels like she can go down to John McClane and still still be able to take light cigarettes. This movie marks the role of Gina Davis' second action-heroin role and she is not yet managed to hit. Angelina Jolie a few years later "Grave Ryder" and a hit score. Because I was overcome. Completely <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not all dark. One can see only an action film that is sloppy and spectacular set pieces. The chemical bomb explosion explores the purely pirated visualization of the film, multiple laws of physics, convenient breaks. So, here's the formula, but it's a Hollywood action formula replica act-formula. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BScBB classification: 13+ --- Violence, prejudice
