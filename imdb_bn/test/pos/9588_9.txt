Her old lady is sent to Tweety in her cage on a train by the owner. The same luggage car, in a cage, Sylst. <br /> <br /> No time, Sylvester did not catch Tweety but a trainman came back and "Sneakin 'foam slaps," as he calls him, returning to his cage. He tweety "up in a safe place," and the cat says, "Now remember: no tactics!" Sylvester puts on his alphabet and looks innocent. Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> I found the most interesting thing, except Sylvester vs Tivy, but there was no other cage "eye dog" next to Sylvester. The cat gets appetizing with her, and offers a great price in a very interesting manner. Sylvester does not just learn, but for one reason we love him! (I know a lot of IMDB critics do not like the TV, but I like both main characters - they both crack me!) <br /> <br /> The train and surrounding scenes are really nice visuals depicted here beautifully.
