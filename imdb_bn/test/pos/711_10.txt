The nature of Peter Strauss, a short series and often produced in the making of films made inappropriate proportions of bad response - usually from ten-minute movies from casual observers, with the channel-hoped-order-way. Well, I've read all the other 20 reviews for this film and I'm not happy to say a bad thing about Jericho Mile - you should be enough to buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss has won an Emmy for his role in this film and even once it shows why he has earned so much ... <br /> <br /> I tried to criticize the purpose This image. Instead, I found myself debating one of my potential nit-picks. This is about making true, realistic film. This is not your ideal Hollywood sensitivity, where everything is restrained - it is such a real and true life that people have thought it is based on a real event !!
