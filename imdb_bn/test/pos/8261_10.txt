Please tell me about any version of Prussian Bay or Gon-II Earth that can be aware of the video. I love all the books on Mary Web and will be grateful for any information related to VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I went to Prisonous Ben and Earth, which my beloved from Mary Web, many times, and collected other novels by her. I was lucky to have "poem spirit" poems and essays, but I have never seen the Priestius Ben version, which was in the masterpiece theater, or the full version of the Gone to Earth, although an American film was The Wild Heart's Classic Airing, which cut the real-life movie Up version. <br /> <br /> I would be grateful if anyone can help me get copies of these two or both films (full version)!
