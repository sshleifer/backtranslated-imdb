No, "Lifeforce" is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is an average movie (and, of course, Matilda May), though some good effects and a compulsory story. This may actually be one of my favorite SF / Awesome Flickr, which is very easy because they try to cause their way through space vampire science. How often do you see that? Not even in "Allian" (SF / Dark Blaze all the time) Science comes into the story itself. In the "Life Force" they are trying to cause an irrational world. <br /> Now, do I think it's successful? No I think the movie has debated a massive shoe that hoverpages prevent and keep track of, and visitors have to pay attention to multiple 'villains' and have multiple road trips. <Br /> <br /> To be honest, the movie is fun and candy for watching. But what Hooper was trying to do and there is a great potential for a higher rescheduling for really strong, awesome, SF / horror films. <br /> <br /> If there is a remake, I claim that Mathila may have a Kyomo.
