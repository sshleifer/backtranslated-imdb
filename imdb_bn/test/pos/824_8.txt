I have not seen Van Dam Flick for a while, I am amazed, he still has it, looks old, but hard, like Sly, has become worse with age. It's a good flashing and inspiration to keep an eye on the movies I missed in the last ten years of Van Dam. I would like to see a good director to put Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot. Van Dam still has taken steps to surprise visitors, the last film with Van Damme was Legioniaia, which was also a good flash. In addition, I looked at Van Dam's history of the first war, I was also very surprised, I realized that he was the real deal, very successful martial artist in his short years.
