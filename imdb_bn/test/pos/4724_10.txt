I have never seen such a powerful true story movie. I've discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a Nobel Prize winner, for this wonderful piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie you can not say that you watched <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The courage, humility, and life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not see anything good. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 9, 1999
