Seeing Wagonmaster, like many other big Ford movies, there might be a deeper thought than many other films like The Sea Wharf, My Darling Climetin, The Man Who Shut Liberty Valenas and The Grape's of Rath, but it is likely to create a feeling. Fear and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: Two Cowboys decided to help a Wagon Train to travel to Mormons California. Alongside the road, they escaped with a medicine whose lands were scattered, a group of bank robbers, and some navajos. There is a lot of courage and tension on the trail, and the movie is matched with fun and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The visible view from Monument Valley is as beautiful as before. Plus, how could you be wrong with James Arness? Wagonmaster can not be one of John Ford's best known movies but if you get the chance, it must be seen. 9/10
