My family and I do not see local movies because they are badly created, they lack their depth and our time is not worth it. <br /> <br /> "I caught the attention of the people of Nassan", I took the time out of the attention of my daughter and daughter so we watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeds our expectations. Cinematography was very good, the story was beautiful and the acting was extraordinary. Jericho Rosales was really good, so Claudine Berreto. Evidence of Deitha Okampo's triviality was effective in his role. I have not been moved by this touch, and have been influenced by a local movie before. Imagine an interesting trick of my eyes after the photo? Congratulations to Star Cinema !! Go to Jericho and Claudine !!
