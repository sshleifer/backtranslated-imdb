The Korean "romance" is the owner of a camera store, identified by the deadly disease. She goes about her daily routine and is ready for the end, she meets a young girl who is a customer. Increasing a friendship and romance, Eve does not even express affection for anyone else. The good movie is something that you can not see like rebuilding in America, because the studios will strongly say that "couples" work in their feelings. He will not say anything because he does not have to live long, because what he is doing is not his and he does not respond as he does not respond. Of course, I'm making it more complicated than this and in all honesty it is something that you should discover for yourself. This is a great film? No, but it's a good one that will move you mentally. The final lines of the film still disappointed me: "I always knew that love would be pale like photographs - but you will be in my heart as you are at my last moment. Thanks and goodbye." It may seem strange in the context, but it is very running in relation to the film.
