It was an awesome movie! I want to see it again and again. The actors were horrific. The movie kept on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I want to keep this movie in Lifetime DVD. I would certainly purchase a copy. This film proves that you should be very careful about who you hooked up with. You may recognize someone, but you never know. My daughter watched movies with me. She was great at it. What I know is that I will watch this movie every time in the life time winds. This is a movie that keeps you glued to the TV. Lifetime will restart the movie, but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen.
