I saw this movie about four times and second time I was fascinated by the second camera assistant work. It seems trivial but there are some very professional, knowledgeable and talented people there. As described in other opinions, the movie is completely suffering from other problems. It is important to contact today's issues 40 years ago. Acting is a bit but the second camera assistant work is stellar! This person needs to get back to business - perhaps the directive? What is waiting for this person? I will be watching and delighting from the wait and sidelines! - Bob
