This Columbo episode is good and probably one of my personal favorites. Custom Rosemary has included Baby Cosvettes as Messro, her wife Blath Dannar (mother of Gwynth Paltrow) and Maya Lae (one of America's greatest leading actors in her time movies). Because I do not agree with anyone who criticizes this photo. This episode is one of my favorites because you're doing a great cast that works great in performance. I love Colombo with his favorite dog that he never names in the series. During this time, this episode concentrates on Hollywood ball classical music among LAA attractions. Of course, Colombo is interested in classical music because he is involved in any other crime.
