Everything is not right to tell the story, is not it? Barnes รถ, the title of the title of "Bright Novelist", almost "70 years old," which is astonished by many people including me. <br /> <br /> Children's Island is the title and no island. In the book, Rhine, the main character has The Guinness World Record Book as its own Bible. And he himself is interested in breaking a new record. Typically, the youngest person under water for three minutes <br /> <br /> The story is mostly deeply, consciously provocative and horrifying for most Swedish films and time books. Bergman started his final film, and Cree and Whippers were a little out of date. The expectations for any Swedish film were quite high. They teach us that the great theater, great actors, superb writers and talented directors have created the true team of perfection in the film. <br /> <br /> Saying all this, a story about burns and discovery. This is also a story of separatism: The cities are isolated, and one of them resides and most of our residents embrace. It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. This is a movie of great hope and frustration. Below the feeling of the layer and the covering layer and buried under a restraining layer from the world, which can not take care less ... here <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Koe Pollack's awesome direction in the script of Ollah Olsson of the PC Jerseys novel is not only on one prospect but it has become a master piece of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not agree with anyone who said that this work has forgotten all. This is not Even in 2009, I write it, the story of PC Jerseys is being directed all over the world, and the film is shown in many school schools and small theaters. <br /> <br /> <br /> Why? Waxing philosophically all of it will be difficult and many have already done it as a scholar with writing and lecture. Barnes O'Connell and why a special story is from the beginning, when you find out what a little child has said in the eye, then it feels comfortable then only. And that's where it ends. Maybe it's a clinical view, someone else guided. But deeply boring, moving and satisfied. The idea is deep: as long as we have no serious hair, we can still survive another day as an angel. After that, Ryan will be reflected in his novels as a novel: "Men are dry". She fears when she fears. When the world revolves around it, it finds love. He discovered the reason for not behaving as being older, because he abstained from crime. He lets his inner purity and confidence in others apart from reservation, only to know how a person's soul can be torn. <br /> <br /> Wherever there is hope for love, it is hated. Where compassion is needed, he finds suspicion and cold heart. It's a film of metaphor. A movie that is difficult to think and answers to questions is difficult to answer. Finally, the satisfaction of seeing this extraordinary work (which was later fully raised for another Swedish film)) A ride on joy and hope. Be aware that this is a movie full of dark in our nature. But, alas!, A film of hope and deep joy. Stine is an island in Stockholm, but if we have found our first signs of sexual fulfillment, today there is a great hope of living a whole life.
