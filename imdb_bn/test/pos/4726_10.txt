This is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s. If you allow yourself to identify with Patricia Arquette's character, you may find it a very moving story of a woman who feels the purpose of her life and can find a new desire to live. <br /> <br /> The performance of Arquette is brave because it is intentionally "wooden" - it defines its character's spiritual death, its complete lack of desire to be alive. Because he moved through life like a zombie, his family has been killed and he is not seeing the living point. What is going on is how it is reconciled in the way of the story - By the Burmese landscape, its scenic scenes and natural scenes and the primary choices are forced to deal with them. <br /> <br /> Boroman supports this scene (and Hans Geimmer supports one with his most striking, hunting scores) often with static cameras and with the tendency to shoot through glass, windows, windshield etc. We looked at the outskirts of Arkade ... as long as he found himself deep in the jungle and was forced to choose whether to fight for his life. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the 1954 film's opening plan. It is a similar story in a similar setting, and makes an interesting comparison.
