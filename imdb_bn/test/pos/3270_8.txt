Jimmy (Heath Laser) Pondor (Brian Brown) is given an easy job of an underwired Kingpin to pay from a common address, but when someone does not answer the door, Jimmy decides to sink on the beach to spend some time, but he is on sand Notice that his clothes have been messed up and gone 10 grand. Jimmy told Pando to tell him, but he does not want to hear it. Pendo and his sons try their best to identify Jimmy, which means if Jimmy does not take over. So now Jimmy Pondo gets the money back to organize a bank robbery to get back the money. Also around this mess, he oddly meets Alex (Rose Bairn) and together they are in a street ship through the cross cross of Sydney. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Two hands" is simply a harmful pick-up film that is intense, delightful and incredibly fresh. What you've got here is the most urban gangster movie that is a painful backdrop and with your face-to-face violence? What, fresh do you want Well, because it leads us to the underworld, where Australian culture is defeated with flip flops and shovel shirts, cars and beer? And do not forget the humorous, dry and satirical Australian ideas. You can say that it carries a lot of meaning for the inspiration of "false fiction", "goodfellas" (my shaft) and "lock, stock and two smoking barrels", but for me it still stands on my own. The film is a real mix of light-hearted moments, but it is an unexpected shock and black humor that can be boring. You just do not know what you're coming and it's a great startling (especially last) and a great time for her humor. If you have sewing a scene involving a bank robbery, I guarantee you The plot's outline really brings about an era story (or not a road), adding a punching love story and then adding gangster elements to stop it. Most sub-plots were cleverly built and intertwined, perhaps it could go without the supernatural elements involved with Jimmy's dead brother, but in the overall context, many plots seem to click together. The intense, natural and crisp dialogue is filled with indecent colorful script, with the slang / twang fast jabs - I'm fair dinkum! <br /> <br /> The performance of Brand Brown's Pando that really made the film. He just gave his character a terriblely charismatic / nasty personality that his presence still felt when he was not on the screen. He gave two aspects of his character - one being a holes, but on the other side is such a good block. A young Rose bows with her nervous sweet / quirky character Alex. She looked radially gorgeous and added a bubble personality. Then you fit the bucks as the hit laser who naive Jimmy. Great Support Cast involving Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Wilner and Steve LeMarkand's choices. Such raw performance is achieved and from that you get riveting, fun and credible characters. The rock soundtrack exploded in combination with the likes of Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd provides a cool pumping pumping. The shot in Sydney's cross-cross also really holds its own life, and it did it by showing the way of Australian living. Gliding camera tricks hold the city's retreat nicely, especially Knitlif is able to penetrate. It was a movie when it was finished that I was completely satisfied with what I got. Overall, an impressive pencil crime thriller has achieved what it has achieved ... a fun, cute and crazy roller coaster ride on the road with excitement and excitement. <br /> <br /> I say, it is a successful successful Australian "Lock", stock and two smoking barrels "Director / writer Gregor Jordan in his first film. If you come across it, do not hesitate to give it a go.
