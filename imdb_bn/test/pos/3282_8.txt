Man Beer Pig South Park is a beautiful fun episode. It destroys Al Gore and his lectures on global warming, replacing global warming with Manberpieg (a fictional monster that has a man, a bear and a pig). This is a school assembly and Stan feels sorry for him, so he and the guys decide to quarrel with him. In the end, they fall into the cave of their stone, where they believe that they can become human resources and they are trapped for the day. Meanwhile, Cartman finds riches but wants to keep everyone close to himself. Manibar Pig is a good fool for global warming and an episode of an interesting South Park overall. <br /> <br /> 8/10
