I was impressed by the stories. It was "ordinary" hunter gay male and "ideal" Mormon missionary. But, they all had friends and family who made their lives well balanced. There are number of characters, some are nice and some are not very nice, each with its own personality complexity. And, reminding a lot of people in my own life. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a curious moment and gradually turns into a heartwarming relationship picture. Progress without enabling explicit plot of stories and do not talk to you. You feel a bit awaiting to see what will happen. Even when I thought that something was coming, I was really surprised how it really came. <br /> <br /> Many movies let me laugh at gay intercourse and when I feel tears in my eyes are character pain. I saw this movie on DVD and could not stop myself until it was finished. (Generally, I break into a picture within a few days.) It looks nice to see a movie with gay characters, but not promoting. I highly recommend this film! And, not just for gay listeners. Relationships beyond sexuality
