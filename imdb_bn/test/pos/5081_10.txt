I think it was seen in a long time that your seat thriller was the most outstanding. The film was thoroughly researched, the author Kelly Shane did not leave any empty edge. The cast season was (all round in excellent performance). Omar Metwali was outstanding. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poetic, impressive and overall impact of music is extremely satisfying. <br /> <br /> The radiation goes into a region that even the media is afraid. This "war of terror" with espionage and legal web, which is actually a wakeup call for it. <br /> <br /> A woman came out of the theater and said, is this really happening? That's the masterful achievement of Gavin Hood himself.
