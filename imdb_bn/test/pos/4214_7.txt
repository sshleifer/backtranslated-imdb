A real Asian superstar Jimmy Wang Yu has directed and wrote this movie which I only saw in a Dualed Videotape version. WideScreen (Shaw Scope!) Shape was lost and the actual actor's voices were missing, but it is still good to see. The story goes on fighting against villains from the General Marshall Art School in Japan, our young hero is finally won by bangling together with a bang. <br /> <br /> The struggle to unravel the film becomes even better. It shows strict and dust at the beginning of the film, but later a great scene is seen where Wang Yue battles a pair of gambling and then goes to a snowy scene and takes some villains with a knife, sword and fist. That part is very exciting <br /> <br /> is pretty good but it is interesting to see a non-dubbed widescreen version.
