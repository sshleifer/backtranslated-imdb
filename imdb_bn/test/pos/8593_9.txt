To answer the questions of previous critics who named the name "Lumbuna" in the US, the character is named "Mr. Karluchi." Frank Curlouki reported as the Second Secretary of the US Embassy in Congo at that time. Later, among other recruits, he was appointed US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, Defense Secretary, and is currently elected Chairman of the Karlil Group. It is only surprising that on his www.carlylegroup.com web site, the biographical sketches of Curlukis failed to credit their service to the Belgian Congo. If his name is deliberately censored by the HBO version of "Lumbuba", it may refrain from the possibility of US court suing HBO. However, I recently mentioned the name of Karlukis in the "Lumumba" theater version. In this case I hope he will not refuse to be involved in the killing of Lumumbar. <br /> <br /> Others have commented on Lambumba related parties: Lumuba supporters, other Congo, even the Belgian people. Based on the book "The Murders of Loomumba" by the Belgian historian Ludo de Witt, "Who is Lilumba?" The BBC's documentaries appear to have some awful scenes from the headline. When closely examined, these films show that the fate of Lumumba and the history of Congo is not only black and white. Only the Lumbumbara killers believe.
