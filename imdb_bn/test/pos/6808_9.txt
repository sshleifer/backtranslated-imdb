In the 1920's, an emotional, heart-splattered family movie was established in England. A young Elizabeth Taylor won a horse in a Rafa and the Grand National decides to enter into her; Thankfully, we are going to give some help to former Jockey Mickey Rooney Lease. Director Clarence Brown has displayed some extraordinary controls with ingredients that may be too much drug in others. He and screenwriter Helen Duce and Theodore Rives are naturally taking real care of establishing realistic traits and naturally for the development of the story. True, one or two scenes that seem a bit stronger, but overall it's quite impressive, and technically featured in the nicely. The race itself is quite exciting, and like many great classic, there is a wonderful, last three hankie fading out. Lease proves that he was a real soldier from the beginning and Rooney - I usually find annoying - it's surprisingly frustrating and really very good. Donald Crisp is the great father of Lease and Angela Lansbury is happy as her old, boy-crazy sister. Most actors, Kudo, however, included Annie Reveyer, who won an outstanding supporting actress Oscar, who was able to play Leigh's wise and caring mother.
