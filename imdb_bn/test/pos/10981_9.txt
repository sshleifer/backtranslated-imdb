Witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, hard-hitting, fun and humor. There is more to this image. With a top notch plots and scripts, a great 'every man (and woman)' story is about. It provides clean fun, lots of smiles, lots of smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family. Other critics describe some details. I'll just offer this comparison teaser ?? It is "Best of Show", "Grampy Old Man", "Million", and any other comedy and life flick rolling in one. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < However, it is now out of DVD and I highly recommend it for purchase. If you like good fun and entertaining movies for family, you can not miss "Manna from Paradise". This image follows a sure fire healing for blues or sadness away at bad weather day or rough time.
