Although the story is light, the film flows so well and its visuals are so tranquil and poetic that it can carry almost the whole film. <br /> <br /> This picture is about four connected connections, people and / or women about different aspects of attraction and how often it is in the restless. Their true desire always seems to be something they can not catch, it will flow like a grain sand. <br /> <br /> I thought that the most interesting story was over where the woman was more inefficient, the man asked her more. It is parallel to deep love for God, who is unlimited beyond reach, but never near his heart. <br /> <br /> is a very good movie. 7/10
