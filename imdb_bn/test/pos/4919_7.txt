Being a good fellow IMDB critic, I enjoyed this show a lot. Because? Well, it did not try to be more than that; I mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, a well-known and repetitive plot, fun and talented actors and tricky jokes for post-college audiences. <br /> <br /> The source of all this is: Try to be mature but a fun way. <br /> <br /> Jealousy White is always as funny and some malicious, and ridiculous sexually oriented jokes are distributed. Humor is more than 90 without considering the trend of the new millennium and this is the main reason for my opinion that this show was not successful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, not a genius classic, but I'm sure it's regular regular nostalgia in 2000.
