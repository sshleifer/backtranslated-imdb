If I've always lived 100 years, think of Mr. Farith as Daryan Gray. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another. Inspired and perfect, every actor played the role correctly and each shot was well done. <br /> <br /> I finally found that I liked every single character so that there was no other type of movie inspired. Check it out, then try to see another version. It's not the same, is not it?
