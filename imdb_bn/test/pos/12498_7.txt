I'm breaking about this show. Although most parts of it seem to be healthy, I'm stupid and shock only for other parts of the shock Closing the parody of some cartoon walls is really bright like many scenes with children. However, I do not think clever children are smart to talk about. It does not seem to me that, "O poor children, they are being exploited" - it's not really clever! This is something that anyone can do, so it makes it easy and viable to make a paper airplane. To make this event better, it is important to have natural reactions from children, which I think may be fun compared to scripts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! It's really fun and it's mostly improvised. Check the patience of a very patient patient for a long period of patience about the importance of patience, in my view it is the most interesting scene. <br /> <br /> You will see this event though it is very funny at all, even if it is occasionally stupid.
