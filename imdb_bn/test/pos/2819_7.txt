------ Spoolers ----- Spoilers ----- Spoilers -------- Just a few small <br /> <br /> It has watched the Satyttite channel, the first 30 missed the minute of the film Keep this comment brief and informative. <br /> <br /> Movie is basically about 5 characters, the performance is very bad for letters. With the help of another girl 1 girl kidnapped three, but it comes back again and 3 kidnapped. This is one of the movies, where the script writers try to get excited or philosophical, mysterious ... and you point; But their own, personal, lacking thinking they fall too low. One of the prisoners, who thinks psychology as a bit of a brain - sees the part, but his tongue can not tell it. The author thinks that if Nerd uses a lot of 8 letters of the word as an amateur - I believe in the unknown - the viewers will be unaware enough to believe. I want to give an example, but I can think of anyone - just as it was said. The end was worse as well. But a woman prisoner played her role as an old and relatively wise woman, though she had many restful pictures. <br /> <br /> Why would I give this movie 7 stars? If I think above all? Easy, I'm giving Lisa Keller full seven stars - a sexy $$ momma. She is fine lol. I'm an appreciator of beauty, and he's just that. But I will not be confused because I'm not distorted and this movie is not in any way. Somethin about them I can not explain, but I like it. I remember the scene where a prisoner had broken down independently and he found a way out, fell into Keller. He tried to get in the way but he has no chance. She threw him down, kneeling on the stairs and she pulled down her pants, no panties down;). Now, though he has a wonderful ass - and this shot throws the imagination for a long 30 seconds - I think - this is his face-to-face expression that I got. He wanted it, and that look was to me thinking that I was behind. I'll torn up that loot! After that expression, I could not look more closely than Jus, I had love. Hah hah I was happy to see this movie but Lisa Keller did not play a major role, but I could change the channel ... well ... I saw the above scenario. I know a fan of Lisa Keller, but it seems that she is not a continuous actor, this 2003 film is her latest. But I look forward to seeing another movie with him.
