One of the most fun movies I've seen in this age is one. I saw it for about 20 minutes, a little surprised. Then I started to laugh and the movie did not stop after a while. Such mockery of dead bodies is indeed rare. Christopher is the real eye of the guest's unselfish humor that does not have any humor (about 90% to start with white heterosexual females). "Waiting for the Gaffman", guest nick is the stupid self-importance of the Middle East wall. I can not wait for his next photo.
