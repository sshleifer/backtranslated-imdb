Velvet Tipping (2002) (TV): Geoffrey Sacks was directed at BBC Television. The main plot is the story of the arrival of heroine Astley, who played well with Rachel Starling. As a teenager, Nan works in his family-run fireplace house. Everyone hopes to stay at home, then marry a suitable husband and live a family life. Naan also hopes this. <br /> <br /> Everything changes when Nan Kitty Butler (Kili Haus) is a beautiful and talented actor who wears men's clothing and holds the audience's heart. The listener included the nan, which does not attract her lover with sexual attraction. <br /> <br /> The rest of the picture follows in London and its compromises (arranged) and its downs (horror) as a homosexual and sometimes male impersonation. <br /> <br /> Ideal for the BBC, each role, performed by a nice actor, does not matter to the smallest. There is a depth and breadth of the acting artists that the BBC really fancy. Some of the supporting actors have stood in my mind - they were good at identical. Both Sterling and Haus are wonderful, and their performance also carries this picture. <br /> <br /> It is normal that a sad life can be difficult for a person, which is not suitable for the society in general. I know it's not easy for lesbians in the US today. Imagine the love and happiness barriers to Victorian England's lesbians. We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to travel.
