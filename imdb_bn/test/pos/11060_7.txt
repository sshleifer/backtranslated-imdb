Perhaps this movie is a little longer, but it still has some attractions after 45 years. The main role seems to be more suitable for Clark Gable and Vivienne Leigh. I can take less care about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is good, especially in dark hair. Movie Supporting Cost For Cast: Flora Robson is awesome as a Malatto Slave. She is a white woman on Blackface, and may have an expression of evil or a voodoo mistress. Jack Austin has a delightful role as a servant dwarf, that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes. Talking about the scene, Florence Bates stole most than she is as a dowager social lady. At the end of the film I could not understand the result of the battle of the railway, and the last scene was Hollywood's Derek. This is a strange feeling when you realize that the movie title refers to a railway instead of a piece of the luggage!
