During the solar eclipse, three-year-old children born at the same time started killing someone who killed them brutally. <br /> <br /> During these 80 friction, the kidnappers were not new at all. The children's theme as murderers works nicely for this photo. Bloody birthday provides some good coolness and mystery, while managing a suitable killer thriller with some weird qualities. It straddles a fine line between delicious and kinky, but it remains a whole-souvenir with an interesting plot. Some firm killings have scenes, as well as a good bit of cashlessness to establish it as a guilty slasher guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Throwing does a fairly good job. Young star Elizabeth Hawaii and K. C. Martel gave some annoying performances, while growing star Julie Brown stripped before a memorable murder scene. The veteran star Susan Strasbourg works well as a comedian teacher and Jos√© Ferrer. <br /> <br /> This off-bit slasher entry is not nearly all bad, though it is not necessarily corrupted, but for good success fans see it. <br /> <br /> *** ***
