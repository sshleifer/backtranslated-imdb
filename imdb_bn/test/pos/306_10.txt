Captain Willard (Martin Shane) was sent to a classified mission in Cambodia to kill Colonel Cartage (Marlon Brando) during the Vietnam War because he was completely mad and now no longer taking orders. And one of the most decorated men in the Kartez Armed Forces, Captain Willard realizes that the kernel cartridge will be closed deeply, as he has received, killed without clearance, and took the war to his own hands. Perhaps this great person could push at the top? Through the long journey of Willard, through the jungle to find his goal, why did he try to understand something. But what does he want to do after finding him? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The End" is a great film in my book, especially if it flows through mood The Apocalypse is not quite this now. I can not remember anything in Vietnam for the war and to make it better for the madness in the mind of the energy it is made. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through Vietnam's wildest wildlife, whose final destination is the killings. By using only music and scores, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and madness. A perfect example of how to set the mood through solo music is right here in this film. <br /> <br /> Except for the exception of Lawrence Fishburn, the overall extraordinary cast, in which Shane and Brando offer our filming skills enough performance to spread around the bread. I just do not like Fishbark, because I found that he was a cowboy curtis in Pieve Playhouse, my humiliation and hatred for this person has increased tenfold. I understand this tranquility but I simply do not care. We need him sick Gary Oldman Brando is as nice as Colonel Cartes and I do not remember any other actor that the good man has become insane and can hold the screen's presence. Shane is funny to watch as Willard and we can ask him in his mission and identify with the general war. My favorite character Robert Duvalera Leigh Colonel Kilgo. Before this movie I sometimes did not portray Dual as a wartime cowboy, but honestly it is my favorite of the parts. He simply copied his character, the best of the whole film, such as the commander of the Gang-Ho Air Cavalli who loves to surf. Maybe slightly above but still bright. I like the smell in the morning. <br /> <br /> This plot is quite simple and does not take much brain power to know what is happening. The Wilder Mission Kurtz is simple and easy to kill. But it's the journey of film, which is really its heart and the terrible conditions of war. The Redox version is compelled to sit through our extended French planting scene and Playboy Bonnie scene, which does not add anything to the fullness of the movie, rather it is a long journey. I do not think they take a little away, it's only a matter if you want to watch the movie three or a half hours or the original. Through this journey, this movie has had a great impact on the brutality and illogicality of the war and the warring soldiers in America ... In fact, that is the whole point. On top of that, the soldiers were not supported by the public, and it helped to characterize cartridge like a cartoon very well. <br /> <br /> There are these classics with a big fight movie lover, Platoon and Dir Hunter. I sometimes try to compare each other compared to similar movies, but in past problems, I found it in my reviews because I have to go back to what I said. These three have their own power and add to their own wrapping in the Vietnam War .... So speaking, a good one is better than the others. Even if it looks like recently it's even better. In the end, the apocalypse is now truly a classic and it deserves a given status. A fellow reviewer said beforehand, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever produced.
