Well, it tried 4 of them, but finally they think it's right! Karate Kid Franchise This fourth signal, the producer really hit a home run! Finally I appreciate Ralph McKeeo getting rid of them. I felt he had never played the role of Karate Kid. I would rather meet Danny 'Ralph face' in that role. MACCIO proved to be the best film of the series and where his career is now! Instead they keep a girl! They've got Hillary Swann, who are well-known for playing in several semesters in movies. I'm personally not taking care of her beetle teeth, but it's personal choice. But still, Karate Kid 4 has launched her career in orbit! She won a freakin Oscar. Jimmy Christmas! Where's the ralphi? She should tap some amateur porn like scripts or something. However, my only contradiction with the movie is that they are doing a girl. As a self proclaimed master of Karate, for the last 8/8 years I have been the proud owner of the white belt. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place for women in martial arts ... good except for judo ... but who are gay So for the sake of correctness, I think they should be stuck with other men for this role. I was probably thinking of Dennis Frange. <br /> <br /> Perhaps they will listen to my advice and make the right combination of karate kid. His Pat Murita is no more. I might have thought, Justin Garari is a loving Asiassi Mr. Perfect replacement for Miyagi. She has to give a whole new meaning "wax off wax". Hahhhhh funny haha? However, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with Karate and win the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Do not waste your time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! Karate Kid for this age!
