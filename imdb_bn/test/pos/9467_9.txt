This film is a great movie, but it is expected as much as most of the movie. The film's greatest highlight is the star character Amanda Bains, who is absolutely fantastic and funny. He is one of only a few people in the world who can use 53 muscles in his mouth, which is most strange and encounters an embryo. It is good for kids, and at the end there is male nudity and stimulating nudity. After all, they did a great job to update an old classic, and O and 10 things that I hate you can be rested on the film stand. Many actors debuts like their debut for the first time, do a swell job.
