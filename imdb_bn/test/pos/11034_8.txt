I saw this movie alone when I was the beginning teenager of my summer in India, at one time when the only thing that impressed me with girls was Tiger. I came home after watching this, with a shiny look in my eyes, which was hit by the friendships of the Tigers. What a movie and what a moment that was! The theater I saw did not exist and gave way to a shopping mall. I do not know how I will feel about it after so many years and I do not want to waste my childhood memory to find this movie on DVD or to find something similar and to find it interesting. I have learned from previous experience that childhood memory often becomes weak when some of the highways highways of life sometimes try to re-discover their incoherent past through filming, only his great innocence is completely sticky and no longer welcome. And I do not want to miss the film's air in the air. I do not have a baby, so I'm probably not interested in keeping this film in a sepia tone area of ​​my brain, I do not want it in DVD. But if you are in a steady age and want to remember the memories of a favorite childhood in the next years, try to watch this movie (if you can). It will really be worth it.
