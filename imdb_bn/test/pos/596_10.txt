I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with street muppets and later realized how these characters were brought to life. Jim Hensen was a talented and master Muppitier. When I saw this movie the other day when I was young I was back when I was a kid and things were so easy. For this period of time I have rated this movie 10 ratings. <br /> <br /> Find out how the plot line goes from fluid to Hollywood. Smiles and gags are classic muppetism. I'm still happy about these films for the next generation. I hope the magic of muppets does not grow out.
