Wherever I can hear people say this show is bad because its cover is too far ... Well a good-driving driver in Philly can stop it a bit (at least cab drivers ive met), but this event is great. <br /> <br /> The fact that this event is a little away from the reality track but it is still enjoyable and fun. It is highly observable and even though you know that Mike has finally won it, he never won. David Morse does a great job in the role of a great actor and title. His supporter cast is superb and I must say that the location of this position is especially great! <br /> <br /> I do not see this show because I'm looking for a good level of reality or a show with lots of work. I see this show because it's very good acting, a good courtyard and a great storyline every week. This is a plus when I can pick landmarks that run by it, or he can know it in a disguise. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this shot a shot!
