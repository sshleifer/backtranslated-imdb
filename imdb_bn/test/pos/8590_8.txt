How did the leader of the Communist leadership of the Belgian imperialism drop off the Western power with the hand of Mabutu? Stories of struggle and injustice, hope and freedom. The story could be one of the African countries. A very running film with full images of symbols and looks. If you have to see only a foreign film this year, see this one.
