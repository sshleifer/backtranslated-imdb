Brinjal is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. It is a study of movement, words, light and darkness, and movement than a real story to me. What you see as a video installation in modern art museums compared to a movie that was enjoyed in local theaters. I will not try to explain the nature of the mother, the animals of the cloth, the "child" of the harmful and oppressive body. Some things just defy explanation.
