For me, North and South (Book I and II) final TV series of 80. Jamaica Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia de Havilland, Robert Mitchell, and even Johnny Cache have come close to achieving this series. Have you ever seen Lincoln like? Dick Smith's prosthetics made even more of Hal Halock's strong performance. Fabulous clothing, jaw dropping position, everything. It is clear that today's nice and bright TV series (Deparr√©t Housewives, lost, 24) was north and south and still one of them. Do not miss it. Only David Carabin's Final Villain Screenplay (You Can Call Him Only Violent Spouse) is worth watching. Maybe some letters and situations are very stereotyped, I acknowledge it but the positive aspects clearly leave a shadow on them. I'm very happy that the DVD available in Spain is finally available.
