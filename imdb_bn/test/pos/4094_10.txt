Lost Hari√±an's 1973 musical version is the most wonderful loving and camping musical films of all time. Songs of the 1973 James Hilton novel song music about Shangar-il! A real special jewel Songs of Bochchacharrach and songs of HL David Direct play, adventure and musical sequence is a peculiar mix. It sometimes has the difference of being protected fantasy anti-musical imagery. <br /> <br /> This picture was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money abroad. Only America has failed it. It is highly different and unique in its instrument as a film musical, much better credit than it paid. As a story, LOST Horizon is an incredible adventure and both 1937 Frank Cappa Films and this 1973 trusted adaptation of the musical James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 edition is the freedom that is presented in the musical numbers. The film has a dignified cast and a gifted director and cinematographer. It's a bootchanger Shangri-la and it's a wonderful place. Songs like the world show that happiness is written by Hilton in her novel, growing together, sharing a cycle, fate and living together. Why does Shangri-La not be a little secret place? Two love songs, I'm glad of her unhappy and removed, I have come to you with photo sensitive spots. Paying attention to the philosophy of the story, these two songs have a peace and soft spoken quality. Moreover, I do not miss a good pair with a strong tone. It's a nice exchange of different perspectives and stupping Olivia Smiley and Sally Kellyman, who sings and dances to the table? They are a wonderful team and the numbers are well organized. <br /> <br /> I have always said interesting in this story about how to kidnap someone in the outer world to take her place in High Lama Shangri-La. The character of the high lama is a gentle spirit but its radicals in the eyes of all mankind. There is no hope for the world outside Shangri-La. If this image was rebuilt today, it would be interesting to see the emphasis on the controversy over Richard Owen, along with what he kept behind the outer world, which was found in Shangri-La. <br /> <br /> Of course, for the film to be credible, the character of Richard Convay should eventually be presented as a sad appetite, as he was in the book. The film versions of LOST HORIZON were not faithful to the novel for that novel. What conveyor did convey or imagine? They all died in flat accidents? Everyone has his own ideas of what will be his own. Confrontation with the Covenant is powerful to believe in Shangri-La and to return to the old life of the outside world. I like the sadness on the faces of Klementman, Kennedy and Van because they leave the mysterious valley of their friends. Conway is interesting to know how to leave heaven, but being pressed by his brothers. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both James Hilton succeeds in exploring concepts of secret valleys, where there is no value of money and restraint rules. So in a sense it's anti-capitalism capitalism where money and materialism are not motivation. Human kindness, modesty, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and consistency with each other. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has much stronger stories than most musical instruments. It tries to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and can not blame it in any way to succeed. It should be remembered that in 1973, the Lost Harrison Cabaret was posted. It was no longer fashionable to stop singing songs for the characters, but very rarely dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON Z was an easy target for critics. The expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. Two goals were to hit, producers, Rose Hunter and booths and critics got both of them. Ross Hunter enjoyed the financial success of the decade as a producer and Lost Harijan was his follow-up on his blockbuster airport in 1970. That film was the universal greatest money till that time, and the success of the film was a decade of disaster films. Over the years television has been shown on television, the most viewed movie in the airport. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including the best picture. At that time, Bart Bechratch and Hal David were one of the most successful writers in the country. LOST HORIZON's unabashed feelings were very easily an opportunity to break the censorship of movies such as RIDER, Midnight COWBOY and The GOPFARE. There was a new border between gender and violence in the late 60's, and in the early 70's, visitors came to the movies using screen viewing material. Lavish musicals were no better than no matter that they were made well. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated at various levels. This is a strong story, wonderful music, a costly budget and some final essence with some playful humor. The idea that the music is not presented for 45 minutes is immutable in this concept. When it is introduced in the medieval valley and why not change it in the middle? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heaven movie which is re-inventive. A reputable and legendary treasure deserved much better than his fame.
