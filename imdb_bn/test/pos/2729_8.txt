15 Park Avenue is in search of the movie that started from "Sweet / Mithali" (Kankana). "Professor Ann" (Shawna Ajmi) is a very caring and loving half-sister of Mithi's mother's first wedding sweetheart. The film revolves around these characters and finds a schizophrenic patient's life. Through his continued humiliation with the director Mole and others, he tried to explain to Mithi's imaginary world viewers. <br /> <br /> Conkona is not eligible for this song of Mithi in this film, but thousands of prizes (which I am sure, she will get). In the first scene, looking at the face of the patient in his own eyes, with lip lips and sleeping eyes. Rahul Bose did a good job, but despite the importance of his life, the film was reduced in half. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Shahana Ajmi, naturally made an impressive performance to remember as a sister who dedicated her life to Mithi. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We bring the movie to different edges instead of any other clay, we can think. He's off for this great movie !!!
