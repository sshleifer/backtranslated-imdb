This image is the best Nina movie of all time and if you do not see it, it is worth watching. I would like to rate this image at 10/10, if you want to see more see http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination. In the early sequence where the evil ninja is killing everyone in his way, his character is the best. Then he is the woman of Ayuong who seeks him for death. Then the police should retaliate that killed him, which means more killings and actions. But only one consignment can destroy itself, so that he and his lover, who is one of his goals, helps with the help of jadad (show kosugi) to destroy the evil spiritless soul and destroy it.
