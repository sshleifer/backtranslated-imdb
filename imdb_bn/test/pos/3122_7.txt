By the year 1950, John Ford had fully developed the concept and ideology that would create the main center of his most successful West. Always present, for example, a strong feeling of community, the most severely imprisoned in the pair family of Steinbeck's 'The Gripes of Rath (1940)'. Among these communities, even among the brighter themes of the racism and progressive attitudes, there are small friendships and romances that make life worthwhile to communicate with small people. After the release of the first two films in Ford's "Cavity" trilogy, did 'Wagon Master (1950)' come ?? 'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'Who is Yellow Ribbon' (1949)? And it only covers the same areas except in the military perspective and similarly in addition to John Owen's strong lead. Ben Johnson and Harry Curry, Jr. are good actors, but they feel that they can play a second puzzle for someone and the curse of the ward bond is not enough attention given to the candidates for the occasion of Mormon's age, perhaps the candidate is satisfied. <br /> <br /> In 'Wagon Master', Ford feels so comfortable with his tried and tested western sources that the development of any character has become the main gloss. Ben Johnson's romance with Juan Drew is thought to be more accountable than anything else, and Harry Curie Jr. is almost helpless in the impressive final film of a Mormon girl, so sophisticated to think about the survival of the deleted scenery. Ford only makes a slightly different effort in Charles Kemper's charismatic and embarrassing-ancillary aunt Shiloh, and it works, even hammam slack-jawed Yokel's army surrounds him. Where is Ford successful, is the Orchestra compilation of three distinct nations of Americans ?? Quality based Mormon, easy horse traders, brighter travel showmen ?? The pioneers looking toward a brighter future are among a solid community. This apparent harmony was disarmed by the advent of Oscar Shiloh's gunmen, who used to behave in the West Frontier, but finally lost to the noble cowboys who "sometimes draw on snakes." <br /> <br /> Ford is considered to be the wagon master of his films, and probably it has something to do with the lack of big names like John Wayne or Henry Finder. Armed with ordinary stockpile selection of his stock, Ford is able to create community ideas to avoid focusing on any character, although most of the tourists still remain anonymous. Although undoubtedly well-prepared, I can not make this movie even better that the Ford Pictures did better: The terrible greatness of the West border was presented more beautifully after 'He was a Yellow Ribbon'; Romance and friendly quarrels are more important in 'Fort Apache' community members; Initial relation with Native Americans, here only hinted, 'Investigators (1956)' were examined more thoroughly; Early in the Willow West Win Win (1962), the bold progress of the settlers was searched more rapidly (though by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall). 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but this is not a landmark.
