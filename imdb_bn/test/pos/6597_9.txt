This movie was awesome. A documentary about surfing how it affects skrobing early. This is Tony Hawk (my idol) = like interviews with Schwarz, and Stasi Peralta has been given the name of the couple. Dogtown was a so-called "gateway" part of California where an amusement park was used which was broken. People walk around the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon, the Jeffar Surf team was formed. That skateboardings led to the first real start of Dogtown. The Z boys were a group of ragatags that skagboarding and started the event known as vertical skating. They started it by skating the drained swimming pool. It's just a bit of stories behind. It also produces rare cameras from Stasi Porter's Charlie's Angels by creating a camio. I think if you are a skater then you would buy this movie. It teaches you that skboarding was not always popular. Even if you are not, buy!
