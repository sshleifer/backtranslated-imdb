I called this movie by a friend. I have never heard of it, but I think it was Christopher Lampart, so I hired it and found out that it was not Christopher Lampbert, it was Thomas Jane who was a great film. I love that the whole movie is set in this suburbs. Characters were great for each of them and the script was amazing I really want to write Wuds and want to write directly to another movie. My book is trying to make the man's story of this man's shameless story after a shady past on Thursday, but his old drug seller friend looks and it became quite Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential to Thomas Jane. But this movie is very rare but I found it in some Hollywood videos in VVS. So on Thursday the old VCR and pop dust closed because it got the pie seal approval
