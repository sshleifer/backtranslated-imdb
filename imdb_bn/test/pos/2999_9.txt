I bought this movie because of Rackle Welch. He was fantastic in this movie while playing the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry is trying to make a lucky one more trying on his luck. Harry had a funeral where he met Vittorio de Sica and went to him for a ride. When things do not work in the streets, they keep mines together to find the fastest way to get money. With the help of Harry and his gang Vittorio de Sicker, he decides on the public. It does not matter if the gang does not matter that the result is not the same and will keep you on the edge of your boss. Left out you need to watch for yourself. As far as Rakel goes, if you are a fan here, you should see this movie because he never saw it ****** at the beach better. I gave this film to the 10 Vesel Star on the Rackel Welch body alone. It is no surprise that she was the hottest actress in 60 seconds. He was the symbol of every person he wanted and could get one. He not only looks good, he can do even better. If you like, Raquel Welch then you like this movie
