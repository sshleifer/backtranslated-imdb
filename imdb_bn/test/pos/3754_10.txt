When I was very young, this film seemed to be seen and it was very annoying. I've found the story very annoying and can still remember the different rape techniques used. Especially when the children in other schools can sneeze shrimp in their soup before they can cut. They bind him and shaved his private parts. All this was because he was obsolete. Why was he obsolete? Because he was bad in games Although I was good at the games, he felt it was difficult to determine that he became popular for some reason. To me, he's a person who will always choose because the kids manage it. Popular children are popular because they are 'calm' in any way. Defining popularity is a difficult thing to do. So, when he succeeds in his career, he does not make any difference and he is still suffering. I found the end boring end as there was no resolution.
