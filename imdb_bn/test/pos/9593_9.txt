I think the first week of this TV was broadcast in the same week that Manchester United played in the Champions League Final (1999), they run many football related items a week and it was a complete position. <br /> <br /> During the FA Cup, all the fun that was played in every season was played, lucky underdog, lucky dress / mascot, cup name etc. And <br /> <br /> It was never repeated before another big football event, even now even running with the World Cup. <br /> <br /> Some of the non-football fans have said they liked it in the previous post, but a football fan will find this funny emo.
