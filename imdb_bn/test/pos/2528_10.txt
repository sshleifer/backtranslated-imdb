I'm basically from Brazil ... The tragic incident of this movie was to exploit that boy. They talked about his life and did not get a movie "SenaVo" (Brazilian St.). Fernando is not the first and the end of Brazilian life style. Sorry ... but we live in the world. It is not about making money to save lives. The question is where is Fernando today? Most probably ... dead. We tend to want to live this "Disney-filled bubble life" life Someone comes up to the plate to help ... with high power comes and says: "What can I get from this? Where's my cut?" I want people to talk about conscience!
