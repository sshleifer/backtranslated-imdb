Nice darn good for a French movie. I did not see any of the previous films of Catherine Braille, and there is no opinion about it before. The French movie usually takes place in the aunts and releases the Hollywood-A-M-Up and Star vehicles. Perhaps this is a good business strategy, since there is probably no resources to compete with such projects in any other country's art industry. Films are often boring about filmmaking because it does not have any resonance for the people in the business. But this one is more interested in my interest as I thought it. Despite the title, (oddly in English) it's not quite a comedy, despite some drill moments. I only saw some films from Perlin, but he showed a lot of talent and range from the "Innocent Blood" comedy from the action / mental drama of "La Fame Nikita". The film extends its range when she plays more or less ordinary ladies, but is still forced to screen. Mesuida in Coxos Roxson, with whom I was unfamiliar. He played an extremely unusual actress for most of the films, whose talents were drawn up to the end. If you do not have the pleasure to do traffic and blasts, check it out.
