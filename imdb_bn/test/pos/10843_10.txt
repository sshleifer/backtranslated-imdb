With the BBC velvet tipping they exceeded themselves with the cross border. In the past, they were 'brave' with Dennis Potter's work, but this mini series (it was displayed in the UK) was fantastic. The top notch of Andrew Davis's work - I do not read Sarah's novel but I can imagine she accomplished real justice in it. I comment on the pain - most men watched this for - originally proved to be the main point of the advertisement and the point of sale. In fact, it presented society in front of gay people in the 1800s - most of the time it seems that it was an old man and the boys hired - it was good - homosexuality was mainly closed and often behind honorable doors. You can also see Velvet Tipping as a 'love story' - as well as 'self-discovery' which goes through many gay / straightforward people and commentes on it and repeats it all the time. <Br> <br /> If you have not seen it yet - repeat it on TV or in DVD - Get it - you'll be in a behavior - even its production and filming are perfect. Just try to hide your blush in the part - just as I said - order the 'Budi' day - and 'fool' or both! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
