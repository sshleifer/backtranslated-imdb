This documentary is not one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, but I've seen the stage as one of the most fun and quietly beautiful movies. While trying to go on the path of American culture, two Sudanese youths followed Peter and Santino's life. Peter and Santino are the first friends, but they gradually move far further, as Peter goes to Kansas City, and is in Santino Houston ("a place called Houston"). Santino's beauty is her eyes. He took the man behind him, he supported a full apartment of another Sudanese, paid rent, did everything for other people. She is a cool hunter. Peter finds himself high school while learning basketball, playing basketball and creating Christian friends. It seems that the director Megan Mylan did not know what he got with the beauty of this story. The amazing characters that Peter and Santino moved to you. But the actual power in this film is in his commentary on American society. It is not judged. It shows strength and weaknesses in our world and how difficult it can be for outsiders. I suggest you find this movie, and see America with these two interesting and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My grade: 10/10
