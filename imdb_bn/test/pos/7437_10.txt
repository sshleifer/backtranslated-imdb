I can not believe how perfect this movie is. Great CGG graphics, good stories, and war, wow war !!! This movie was great !! The character. They look real enough to be considered realistic. They are definitely more similar to the game. That scene .... well all the scenes, created my jaw drop. Fantastic 10/10 Graphics Story Completely explained. Plus the way Aeris movies come in help with Cloud at different times. They explain it very well, and how to perfect your perfect drop from it. But repetitive fights take some stories, but it's only a minor thing. Story 9 .5 / 10 All other, great. The movie was just amazing. I can not really say that this movie was mostly not perfect. I love it !!!
