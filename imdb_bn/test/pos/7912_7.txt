An exceptional lead performance by the intelligent Donald Sutherland, and the psychological mystery thriller with strong support roles from Donald Pleasence and David Hemming directed at Photographical Psychology. The element decides to keep all the glam and shift from time to time to the story behind the victim. Suddenly, and the brutal nature of the investigation dragged me, but when it showed a flashback to the victim, its final days were not compulsory and some became like stodgy and stock. Although the script is strong enough and a certain degree of string is complicated with us, the final and wonderful publication should be more bone-jerking and it does not help by its drunken execution. Howard Black's music score is only lasting, and the manager's ability to handle Cloud Chaber (mostly good) is stable and firm, which has become the best of moody positions and flexible cast. The young faces of Lisa Langley and Ond Laundry are incredibly good.
