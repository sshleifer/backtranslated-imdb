Batman Returns is a really dark movie, which shows the war against the capsized crusader against the peppin and the sexy cateuomen (I'll go after them). Michael Keaton has performed well like Bruce Wayne, which he is a good actor Team Buttons handles this picture well and the location of the movie is impressive. Villains: Tragic as Danny Davito Penguin. A cruel, yet disturbed man, that was a really difficult childhood. However, Michelle Pfeiffer stole the picture. He is the best catman! She is threatened, and extremely sexy. A scene where he kissed Batman with a kiss of a cat which only heats the film. The action scene is very good, and the last dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a Batman movie. Tim Burton has shown that he can really handle the Batman film (he has already shown it with the first Batman) and gave Batman a dark nature. Many like him
