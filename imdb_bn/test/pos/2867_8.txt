I liked this a lot. <br /> <br /> Camera angles are cool, it's not all stupid like a blair wiech. And I thought they did a great job with the sound when we saw things from the point of view. A lot of fun Many people screamed on the screen! <br /> <br /> Cain has done a great job with his various psychological emotions. She is much less one-dimensional than the most terrible heroes. <br /> <br /> Kenny is most scary and most films are more credible than psycho. He was not clear how I would react in different situations. There are not many twists here, but it's tricky and original in its own way. Well, vague, b-movie slasher rental.
