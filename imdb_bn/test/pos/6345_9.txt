I'm not saying that there is no big fan of the original "Lonemon Dove" than me. Both the Pulitzer Prize-winning books and the high-tiny mini-series obtained from them are my moving, dramatic, credible and fun activities. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and no western film - since at least John Ford and John Owen's legendary collaboration. It was with the original reservations that I was sitting to see this new mini series, with the non-participation of McMartry and with the original Cast members absent It was clear after seeing the first episode that it was not "Lones Dove". In almost every measurable way, this signal is shortened to the original. But so what? I had no hope of measuring it. This movie, taken as its own effort, is an engaging, entertaining, and very good quality. If this is not a new story, then not as a series of "lonsome doves", I have no question that it will not achieve a very negative rating. John did a great job as Voet Call, Barbara Harece was a horrific clara and new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well acclaimed and credible. Louis Gasket Jr. Horse wrangler is entitled to specifications as ohm pickett. The film carries me care about characters, and I do not ask anything from an actor. It is unfortunate that these worthy attempts are in the shadow of the predecessor - it is worth seeing in its own right.
