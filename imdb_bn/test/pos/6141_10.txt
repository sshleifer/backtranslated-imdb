Although several scenes from Wiri Spindle can be described as "at the top". I thought it was refreshing to see something that was about to go around-inactive twined comedy levels. <br /> <br /> Wari Spindle is a great movie with great conversations. I would not say that this movie is for everyone, but the film is on my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you see occasional objection and see the film for it, I hope you will see it in the same light.
