George Barry is a gifted. "Death Bid: The Bit It's It's" is the 'slipstream' fiction and the camp's supernatural that is now prototype for such a fickle. Really innovative, maverick, and just brilliant effishing. Hyper kinky acting, subtly night atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's book "Nightmare USA" (Barry and "Death Bid: The Bid It's It's a chapter"). Available from FAB press. In a related note, "Death Bid: The bid it's" and "Out of Dream Door" creates a perfect double bill. Moreover, it is very tired and tired - and finally stupidly ironic - criticizing low budget films for being 'weak' or 'technically inactive'. B-movie aesthetic is part of the character of these films. Any amount of CGI can duplicate the growing effect "Death Bid: The Bid Itas" which gives the viewer an advanced palate.
