A horror picture has been set up in paradise until it is still played, but some of those who see what their skin looks like under the skin can be easily deprived or disgusting. I smile though. The real killer was easy to understand and his performance did not help him. It only led to the better looking Potente. Anatomie is not much of a horror film for foreigners like this, but there are some frustrating smiles in it and an interesting peak in German horror movies. 6/10
