The only person to refuse to surrender to the Roman Empire (still animated) is more delightful than "Asterix and Obelix Conte Sissé". <br /> <br /> Whereas the first movie is all ridiculous because the cartoon characters are completely brought completely without losing their cartooncoins, this siggle (a separate story like all comic books) is even better. Of course, all the elements found in the first film and comic book are again present: Obelix is ​​still going to die in the "magic smoke" taste which gives its powerful members much strength to the other tribal members, Caesar and the rest of the Roman Empire are still enemy number 1, but in some new, refreshing elements Have been brought <br/> <br /> <br /> Instead of just repeating the film, it is very idyllic (certainly the biggest drama drama) placed in number one, some additional other films (Bruce Lee etc.) have been added by creating references. This is not all too new, but the references to staff are really working without getting anything uncommon in the comic book (almost the same title as the movie), and without getting anything related to Astarix and Obelix. <BR> <br /> This picture further enhances the tradition of comic-writers Goscani and Uderzo, who did not hesitant to bring Laurel and Hardy gradually and dedicated even a whole story to Corky Douglas. <br /> <br /> If you are not happy to see these movies, but I am sure that Monica Baluchi plays Cleopatra ....
