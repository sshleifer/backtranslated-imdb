In 2023, a human hybrid of Kam (Bobby Phillips) and IBI (International Bureau of Investigation) agents in the economically-managed world of great corporations (and not by people or politicians) He is identified as a 'sub' (sub-human), and 80% of his genetic compositions and 20% animals. He is the combination of the gem jin, which gives his strength and flexibility; The falcon, which increases its ability to see and hear; And the camouflage, that gives him the power to disguise. In the first film, she was a very seductive and moral woman using sex to gain information. I still did not see the second, but this third one, the story is full of action. Scientists have taken a new and dangerous form of electricity generation for fifteen years. Research has not yet ended, when one of them betrays another and steals research. The problem is, due to its molecular unstability, a black hole will be made and the whole planet will suck. Cam saved Dr. Tess Adkins (Till Redman), who had survived the scientist's team and tried to recover dangerous inventions from the "bad boy". There is a very strong 'sub' in this gang, which creates a lot of problems for the people. This action and the Saifai television movie is better than the first, remembering 'The Terminator' in some parts of the plot. Bobby Phillips is a very nice actress, and her outfit is very cool. I am becoming a fan of this good entertainment Sci-Fi movie fans will not be disappointed. Now I'm trying to buy 'Kremlin 2'. My vote is seven.
