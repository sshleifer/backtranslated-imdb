I do not like boxing, I do not understand the attraction. I like this movie. Positive portrayals of Latinos with no drug, sex or street violence The plot showed the stable, loving family. The war ranges are violent, boxing, but Rocky is not the top of the film. Nothing wrong with trying themes familiar with a different angle and ethnicity. It's a good rental.
