Well, first of all - I'm a big fan of horror movies, but anyway - I'm very sick of those horror American horror movies. They are about the same thing - blood and violence. It's not even weird. Well, it's not bad with blood - even does not bother me - but it's not that a movie is obscure! That's why I made this movie entertaining - it's fun to watch a fun incident that is the "mainstream United States" making fun of Concepc. American Splatter / Gore-Cinema, they are not only frustrating, funny to think. OK. But when they seem "obscure," it becomes mostly merciful. However, there are some great American horror films (Polandians, Psycho, Birds), but ultimately this is the same thing. Why this movie came as a relief. Evil Ed is not just a ritual movie - it's a classic! I can not wait anymore, Master Director Anders Jacobson has created a new movie! I have to see Evil Ed again - until again - and again! But I do not have any difference - this is a great movie!
