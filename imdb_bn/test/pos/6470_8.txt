Martin Ritch's first film, Alien Cajen's more conservative "On Waterfront" provides three exceptionalistic answers. "Waterfront" benefited greatly from an electrifying Marlon Brando, who had masked Kazan's offensive theme to justify the names of the names (as Czan House encouraged in front of the un-American activation committee), "City Age" is a young people and an upstream Sydney Poitier "Waterfront" recognizes workers' rights and race relations, Brave to deal with the problem that failed to make <br /> <br /> "City Edge" boldly dives into this (then) unknown region, and although quite interesting black playwright (Poitier) may seem to be a bit simpler in Hollywood, thin touch The brave struggle against violence was not very young. How wonderful was the filmmakers of 1957 in a brave presentation of black-black relationship (if some people do not leave the theater, they will certainly become left-wing leftist, if not offended). <br /> <br /> The last part of the film will surprise the audience, because it refuses to sink "waterfront" to the expected clich√©s with stings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . This picture should be required to be seen in high school or college history classes all over the country, but no one can find it only on lazy night TV, if ever.
