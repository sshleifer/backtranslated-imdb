This way my guilty pleasure is all the way !! When I first tuned in America's next top model, I started becoming bored and found it very stupid. I do not This show is really serious fun I read one of the other reviews that makes you wonder if what it takes to be America's next top model. And it does so! Having a model does not love glamor and excitement? At ATM you will see how it looks. And who does not love to hear ugly about each other and get into battle? Or that Johnny lady enjoys wanting to throw something <br /> <br /> Give it a chance. Do not expect a show or something you can see for a life lesson. Just enjoy it for what it is. Serious fun!
