Heroning series about life in Ojj - an experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate the prisoners. Gay sex, rape, torture, separation, murder, humiliation, many naked nudity ... in your mouth and full power is running. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best written plays. The TV and almost all actors are just great. As this cable was on there was no restriction on what they could say or show. There are lots of racist comments here but it is for all the nations. In fact, the white letters are quite poorly (especially Arya) and black letters are better (peace-loving Muslims). Hispanics have a strong role and there are no Asian prisoners. All captive back strabs and moments seem to be willing to kill someone --- but you still find some sympathetic to them. Even prison guards, councilors and doctors have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I sincerely recommend this but do not rent it - do not buy it. I have complete collection and, to be completely honest, I do not think I want to see it again. It's incredible TV but so deep, dark and dull. I guess it will sell all online. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10.
