This film was created 13 years before my birth but I still think it's fun, great, fun, fun. It can not be easily mistaken with superb British character actor Cast. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Elster sim-pearles; Margaret Rutherford-Dicto; Wonderfully mad, silly gossip, the famous Jose Grenfell starred in perfection. Cadion Victor Hayd-Brown (a Guy Midston special) and the rest of the workers united in the middle of the Middle England England. <br /> <br /> Humor is sometimes obvious, but it is not her particular "Ealing" variety and ever offensive. <br /> <br /> I wanted to remember this picture more often and I still have a smile like the drain of Antrix every now and then. Storm of the girls captured by girls, the tragedy of the school's well-planned but ultimately destructive tour trips and anarchy of third school arrival to bring anarchy is invaluable. <br /> <br /> I know it's an old clich√©, but they really do not like them anymore. How i wish they are If you do not see it, please, you will not be disappointed.
