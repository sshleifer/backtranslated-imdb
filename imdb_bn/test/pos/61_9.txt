The centerpiece of Lacavana Blues is Rachel "Nani" Crosby, who runs the boarding house and the film's author gives vague support to a young boy in Ruben. Based on the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago, Hudson, this movie loosely revives the New York Board of Winds and, in the 1960's, the world has released a cultural climate. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. Address more complete letters in the second half boardinghouse. Nancy's ability to "slice and complete them" affects everyone in its spheres. Especially in a brilliant scene when he bothers a humiliating husband, she says firmly, "If you touch the child again, we're going to dance!" Actress S. Delivered by Ipatha Markersson, this line is so strong and so strong that her husband frozen her tracks with her hair trigger. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning, McArthur provides the presence of a commanding character, and its character combines the separate lives of its home boundaries. It was a touching, impressive film with a wonderful cast. Acting by Marcerson, Nanny's character only distorts love. This is a film experience that I will remember for a long time.
