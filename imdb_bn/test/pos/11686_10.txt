Nowadays there is a conviction type, it was necessary to see when this was high school. It was actually a wonderful illumination of the boycott punk scene in LA in 1980. Like bands, Spirits print songs on subtitles, of course if anyone wants to know whether the person is screaming in the microphone. But it passes through this alien world, tourists that activate the PV of the camera. Band interviewers express a positive view of the music that does not exist anymore. Then again, coats of ex-churches that do not come out of $ 16 / month ago, do not come like Chavez in a black flag. How many bands do you know that Dickens is not trying to get a record deal? These guys just do not care. And who can not love the comment of the small French couple used as "singer" for Catholic discipline (which was a member of Frank). His eloquent voice sometimes provides the best silicone captured in the film: "I have wonderful news for the world ... there is no such thing as the New Wave." In the room! What a tranquility!
