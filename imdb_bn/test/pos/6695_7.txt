I got it as a complete set of 9 episodes at 5 DVDs. I did not know anything about the history of the series. There are 3 episodes for Series 1 episode 1 episode 1 and above for more than 3 episodes. Season 2 is a 5 episode with the final episode of December 7, 1998, with the last episode. The other 4 episodes are broadcast from the period from December 22, 1997 to February 1998. So Bound Good and Evil Season looks like 3 episodes 1, there are no 3 episodes of the season. <br /> <br /> Here's the Spools. Two main characters of the first eight episodes Ian McClum (John Hannah) and Dr. Angela Moloney (Zora Turner) is absent from this paragraph. Dan Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and Dr. Charlie Fielding (Dr. Eva Pope). I recognized Nathaniel Parker from the series of serious in-the-scenes Linley Mysteries, which started in 2001. So they planned to do a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast. <br /> <br /> It seems impossible to try it consistently, the main character is named after McCormom, when the main character goes away from the series. So they're probably Ian McCullum is planning to return, but when the series was canceled, the series was canceled. I do not have any internal information, but I find that both John Hanna and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999. Is there any information about this?
