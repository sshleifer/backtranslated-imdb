I just saw this movie in the Berlin Film Festival Children Program and it just killed me (and everyone else in the audience!)! And do not make any mistake about it, this image is always between 250! I tell you that I am not involved with the makers of this film, if you believe in reading it. No, but really IT! The "child-film" label "Lettrasen" ("Clair Girl") does not match almost every account in classic (like "Biblical")! The 12-year-old ida of the story (magnetic: Julie Jungenberg) is concerned, who taught her father's terminal illness. The cost of a special surgery in the US will be 15 million and of course no one can afford it. So Eida and her friends, Jonas and Sebastian do what every good child - and steals a bank! Dry sound? Do not forget: This is not America and "Clutatesen" does not mean that Robin-Williams-Multiplex-Plat-Du-Jarre tears do not take seriously. Director Fabian Willevaler is preparing to make a big budget-action-comedy for kids, boy, what he is successful! Let me enter this way: This film is a little rocky and some others like before. And there's a whole lot more than just "action". After about 20 minutes of statistical publishing (well, allowed) it accelerates into a giant: <br /> <br /> - Shamefully puts "impossible mission" for shame (lots of action sequences are wildly handled and the real expensive look - Mummy Take it!) <br /> <br /> - Almost all other movies are sensational-based (no easy-to-cable-kids-antics are here) <br /> <br /> - Thick Looking for professional alternatives to Jim Carrick in London <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> <br /> - Actually, it's going to be useful and serious and sexy at the same time (Ohmigad, what are you saying? They're kids! They're kids! - Never remember, look at the last scene!) <br /> <br /> - Staff Stefan Pegasus Anderson, who has been since last year "Miracle" is everyone's favorite actor <br /> <br /> ride!
