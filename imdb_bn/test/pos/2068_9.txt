Amazing, amazing, amazing. What else can be said? Jacobs always grace the best Hamlet Stage, and take an inch of the character. Each of Hamlet's illustrations and illustrations is illustrated and illustrated. Some people complained about his age, but you can not really say when watching the film. If anything, he is less than 40 years old. I just want to think that Aphelia is more qualified. His acting is passable but he just does not see part. The only real exceptional performance comes from Jacoby and Stuart, who is a great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacob really enhances this teleplay.
