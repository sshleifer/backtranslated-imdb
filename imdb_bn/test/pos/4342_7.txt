Death Curse of Death Wish 3 has moved far away from Paul Crosse of the original film. After remembering the 1974 film, you remember that Cursee was "Kanchi" during the Korean War and she was physically ill after she first executed. Ten years later, Karsie learned how to make a tank tank operation during the unarmed war and extra time. But I will ignore that Gaffer because the best, low living scam bags of DW3 3 Signals are shot and killed, burned alive, their teeth broken, and armed with armed brushes by middle-aged housewives, they are thrown to death. Yes, I know gang members are many ethnic and for this they deserve some credit but if they are not racist, they still kill kemara and all the qualifications obtained from innocent citizens. Who needs mayor Rudy when you've got a bunch of old pensioners to recover from the streets of Paul Curse, a rocket rocket and criminal crop. Paul Curse I'll give you Sir Salute
