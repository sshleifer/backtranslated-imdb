It was originally a reconstruction of Victoria Rowell, Scott Bai and Charlie Slater's "Detention Assassination". Dick is playing a professor of a college who teaches criminology 101 and does not even find his own classroom. Barry is now a personal eye, not related to Dick. It fired at the barrier and shot at him faster, which a police could not do. Barry still gets the end of the girl. Tracy Oiham portrays the girl. He is the main suspect and Dick and Barry believe that he is innocent and proven. That's all the spoiler you get. Finishing is unexpected enough that you do not already know half way through the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not seriously. Do not criticize it. Just sit back and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
