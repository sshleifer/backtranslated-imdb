Radisson presents a very relevant topic in the form of a very fairytale thriller. It's a secret, and does not promote, movies. Seeing it in Arab countries by mixing Arab and European listeners, it gave an extra layer of environments. The audience was completely gripped by the film and after it gave applause to a loud voice. An Egyptian story, who married America, was suspected of links to terrorist organizations and sent "friendly to the Arab country (to the United States) for better interrogation" (e.g., the character of Merrill Strip is in the film: "We do not have to tort in the United States") today It seems from the first page. There are very nice connections between different characters in the film and the speed of the film never diminishes. The message of the film (thinks the character of Jack Gilhelle in the film), created a lot of terrorists through the abduction and torture of the suspects. Acting with Strip and Ridge Witherspoon together is amazing.
