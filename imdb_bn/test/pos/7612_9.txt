I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry If you do half as Drew Barrymore, you would love this movie. It has got all the necessary requirements for watching a movie. It's good actor, good character, good humor ... There are many heart-warming moments too. While we see Josie in high school while the flash-back moments make me cry. Every single time I'm sure you like it, it's like a teenage movie, but it does not judge like a teen movie. Of course, if you are a man and what you watch, only 25 movies have special effects on all movies, but this is not for you. But if you like romantic comedy then after watching it you will not forget, take it to a video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great!
