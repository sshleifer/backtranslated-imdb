This is the best movie (so far) that Christopher guest created using his very talented shoes to throw. Previously, they made excellent waiting for GIFFMMAN and followed the best in the show, they made a very pleasant breeze. For the last time, for your advice, the less well said. <br /> <br /> This image seems to be a documentary about dog shows and especially about different competitors. You follow these few selected dogs from predetermined preparations, where on Thursday night, the first show in "Meflower Kennel Club" was selected as the best show. However, none of these genuine dog shows are enthusiastic, but talent reformers, which the dogs meet with ordinary people of the show. Surprisingly, even though the characters are disrespectful, there are many truths to their favorite personality - I have had some experience with doggie decades ago and this is a very big group! My favorite of dog owners was incredibly high pressure and imaginary Yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. I like the gay couple openly, as they are awesome fun and cute. But the best performance is probably not from a couple but from Fred Willard, who was the most foolish and less gifted announcer in the history of human history. His views were equally incredible and often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid guy - some of the guesses of how he might be an announcer for such a prestigious show. Other competitions were also quite interesting - the high-quality professional Puddle handler and its rich owner, country boy and his body as well as the "parents" of the wing who could scrap enough to make the show. <BR> <br /> Despite the ultimate style of making the film, the pieces fit wonderfully together and tell a very interesting and engaging story - not just for dog owners. Exceptional acting has made it among the top comedies of the last decade. Glossy and consistently fun. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to watch it in DVDs as the extras were really valuable. Although somewhat painful to watch, I especially love Harlan Paper and its beach beach ball collection!
