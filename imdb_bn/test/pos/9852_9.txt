I've heard about this documentary so long that I knew it would take time to see it. As a documentary it has been done very well, it is a neutral observer of their experience. There are no voice-over, or interviews. It's honest It's true. It is a threat. After the film ended, two comments were really with me. One boy is told that American boys do not wear bags like pants, but there is no meaning in Africa, America does not have money in America, but there is no time. The biggest influence is hungry for the education of the boys, and how one of the boys is completely transferred to himself so that he can go to school. I saw this movie with High School Schoffer, who bothered to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real adaptation to America. He also said that he knew so many young Americans who could not grasp their cruelty in America. I will agree with him on both accounts. There is a strong film which will leave a person thinking about many things.
