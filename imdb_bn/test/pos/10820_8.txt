I think garments were nice, and hairstyles were well executed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, there are hundreds of backgrounds in the big scene. I was particularly impressed with the bridge scene. <br /> <br /> The main actor actress has performed well, she showed us a nervous, malicious woman, who knows what she wants <br /> <br /> Some scenes were sunny. Although it was about 2 hours long, but it was not boring. A very good entertainment movie.
