This movie is Latino Godfather. An unlikely mobster is something impossible to bridge the gap between the alliance and form an empire. I enjoyed the action and gunfights along with bratz acting and colorful characters. This movie is no Oscar winner, but definitely entertaining. Hey, what an Oscar? <br /> <br /> Have you got some balls to chip and work to manage this image (I think he also created it?). Another filmmaker reminds me, who likes to do it all, Robert Rodriguez. Keep it up, have a signal to work? There is a bunch of strings that need to be tied up. Son comes back and father dad dies?
