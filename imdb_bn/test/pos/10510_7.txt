Now, I have seen many B-grade movies in my 15 years of life, and I must say that it is one of the best. I personally enjoyed real estate and storylines, but it is suffering from amateur acting (though Adrian Barbeau played well as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms can not keep his part enough to be considered like. Barry Hope (Barney Resnik), another performance that really fits the film. It started by taking an Asian couple through a home with an enthusiastic real estate agent, found only a dead girl in the Shower Fountain. It's progress with intelligence speculation, and introduces the original character with reasonable favor. I think that any person who travels in the top-top-of-the-top play gives the huntsman time to give top-up-top-of-the-poor scenes, it's really a jewel ... XD Who am I kidding? This is not cool, but if you are indifferent, then a clock value.
