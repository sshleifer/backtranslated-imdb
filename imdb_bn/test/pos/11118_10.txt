This movie is trying to follow nine dreams of ambitious youth who are following their dreams, New York High School for Performing Arts: Coco, Singer, Bruno, Modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hillary, Fighting Dancer, Ralph Comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, Actors. Although they all think that their goals are exactly what they need to reach, they only need more than their talents. To achieve their fame they have to deal with disapproval, frustration, education, pain and love. <br /> <br /> "Fame" is always one of the most entertaining, classic and inspirational movies. It can be a teenage play / musical instrument: The most interesting, entertaining, amazing Irene car, the Oscar-winning song, the stunning dance number, a very compelling cast that you believe in letters and a coco with a great story when the video camera meets Hearty view <br /> <br /> I said, Cast is nice. Irene who really can work, and this is not just her singer, which makes her bright like Coco. Lee Kurier is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller Ralph brought a lot of humor. Marine Tiffy is awesome as Outsourced Doris, and look closely, and you'll see Paul Macro of "ER" as Montgomery. <br /> <br /> This is a really awesome movie. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to follow my dream as an actor and singer. Any movie that gives me a lot of inspiration in this book is the winner of my book. A must see! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as the actor and singer.
