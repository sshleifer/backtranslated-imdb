I'm a huge Rupert Everett fan. I enjoy Kathy Bates, so when I found it available, I decided to test it. Synopsis does not really tell you a lot. In some parts it was shameless, touching and some parts of others became violent. <br /> <br /> Any person can find some little identifying features with the main character of the huge fan of any kind. (Of course they are not many, but that is the point) <br /> <br /> If you do not give an hour to watch it, but it does not look very dramatic any thing. <br /> <br /> I can also mention how you can see Rupert long. I mean, he was 6'4 "but he thinks more about this film, he was feeling a bit bigger due to the height of the other characters, he is tall, I mean taller! And for you, a fan has a bare-chest view ... Wonderful!
