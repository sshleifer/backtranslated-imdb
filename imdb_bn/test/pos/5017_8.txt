<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some people call it "extraordinary" (like I really do). <br /> <br /> Why? I think this is because these films do not distinguish the diamond from shaking or glamor, and some people just can not cope with that mentality. They need a hero. And I'll add that they are gambling or poker players, if their existence is not suitable, they may feel personally betrayed. <br /> <br /> There is no high roller in a poker movie. This is a guy's movie. It's not perfect, but it looks good, writes well, and plays surprisingly. And above all, it creates a mental reaction and inspires reflection. <br /> <br /> And it probably makes some people so crazy crazy.
