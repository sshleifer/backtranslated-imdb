With a vague political message, a great movie. It is shot in a theater style, Most of the actions take place inside. Mayor Surov and Diana Ashcroft seem to be equally suspicious of each other. Emotions from Western tourists and business people became superior and Mayor failed to reflect eastern Russian charm, although he made every effort to understand their views. Two contrasting world-views have been clearly cleared, but the film also shows that people's emotions can not be controlled by politics. Her powerful acting and a 50's have a high emotional effect for movies.
