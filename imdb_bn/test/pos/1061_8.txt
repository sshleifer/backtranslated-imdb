This picture is my favorite Christmas classic one. Of course, it's Falafi, it's not "relevant", but when movies were simply entertaining and funny things are bad? No, this film must say Martha Stewart as "good thing"! Barbara Stanwick is so appealing in this movie and Dennis Morgan is absolutely congratulating. They both have charm and extra warmth. In the 40's and 50's - Sydney Greenstone, S. J. (Caddles), assisted by a crew of their invisible character between Shakal, Reginald Gardin and Una O'Connor. Where are the characters like this today? One might not have been well cast in the role Bate Davis declined this role with gratitude and had the right to refuse it. He tried to vaporize everyone and everything around him and completely destroyed the film. Stanwick was a strong actress, but there was knowledge to play this light. He has rarely been more attractive and the pitch is perfect. Morgan Excellent People Summary Because there is a tendency to ignore his skills at least splashy in his part. Surrounding its own surroundings by the actors of this individual character is only a success in his own, but he is absolutely perfect as Jefferson Jones. Ignore the ill advised (and pointless) 1992 remake and see this brilliant, fantastic holiday gift!
