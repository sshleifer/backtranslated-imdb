This is a film that does not reflect the real world in any way. Nothing in this film makes sense in a real world sense or a real world. It will completely manage your little world and determine the power to accept it or your love or hatred for this movie. <br /> <br /> I love the picture. At the very beginning, I bought the hit girl in her entire unrealistic firmness to recover her memory, because back in the past to come back. I thought that it was going to be a movie where the heroine did not want to know anything until it was done, despite this it was going for a moment, despite this, despite all the logic it would not happen. "Oh it's a movie" I told myself and the film was stopped for two hours during the transit. <br /> <br /> It is an action film with brain and an action film like Brahman that arises accordingly followed by logic and you will actually pay attention to twists and follow some of the watch. I am pleasantly pleasantly surprised when I like it a great deal and bump into people who I feel in the same way. People love it or hate it, if they ever hear about it. <br /> <br /> If you like the action movie, it's definitely a movie. You may not like it, but it must certainly try to find out <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />.
