During the Cannes or other movie festivals, in some 80s film directors in the eighties, Greppas, Aramangake, or Jungle juice sat in the evening and someone said, "Hey guys, let the boys do a movie where every one of us creates a segment of a worldwide Aria." Welllll ... it's kind of kind of work. Obviously some were smart enough for Eris' best recordings, for example, Bishorling's Nissun Darma, so if you were blind and had been lying on the floor, your money would be high after listening to the DVD only. Every director has not succeeded, but has done more than that, and it seems to be improving with every philosophy over the years. My favorite is the eerily beautiful love couple from the Die Tad Stats; All right, a young nude Elizabeth Hurley is eye-catching, but singing on her husband inside her husband, incredibly beautiful with great love, "Gia Nala Noti Densa" all of Otelo and Desdemona. It can be good, sure, what can not be, but it is especially valuable to you as a high-romantic mood.
