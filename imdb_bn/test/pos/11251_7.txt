I'm from Texas, and live near the Plano where the actual death happened, so I might say that "Wested" is a film that you can not get out of your head. <br /> <br> Stahl, Phoenix, and Paul all very real to play their character. You really believe that they are going to be addicted to heroin every day in high school. Drug material is handled very graphically - though what has happened in the movie accomplishes a purpose and at each moment the characters are more downbeat, heartfelt. I definitely recommend this film to anyone else Once you see it, stick it with you!
