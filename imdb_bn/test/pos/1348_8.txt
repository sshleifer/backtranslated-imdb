In July, 2006, I caught the film at OutSport Screening in Los Angeles. It's rough around the edge (especially the sound recording) and is often very fun. The script is rather abominable episodic and accidentally ended, but Ash Christian's film infuses with many real hearts. This is a refreshing change of the pace of a gay movie that does not star underwear models following the party's partner and straight boy. Rosnee (Ash Christian), as the best friend of Rodney, is a loyal and promising Ashley Finke, and Rodney's mother, sincerely compassionate Jonathan Coyote Pripeps, who gave the best one-liner. The script and its every scene stolen. The film is its author / director / star? Tall and bit weird, but very sweet.
