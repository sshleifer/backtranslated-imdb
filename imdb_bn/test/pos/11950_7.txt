It is a better follow-up to death. In the competition, Better of the Dead Hand-Down will win. But for star power, one crazy summer outshines Savage Steve's good script. Problems with One Crazy Summer (OCS): Welding Better Off of the Dead (BOD) looked so good. Friendship: OCS Bill shows Murray's cousin with a disgusting look to his younger brother. Set problem ?? OCS is more friends, but more real friends in BD. The plot was good. You will make some of its predictions, but predictions may be more than you think. So, although it is making the ugly midwife better of the dead, it is a look. For any other reason see Demi Moore before plastic surgery. John Cusack fans, you will see it, just you will say. If you do not like Bobcat Gothwee, I'm sorry. I do not like him too, but you can not avoid it. At least he does a great job of doing a tribute to another movie monster. Performing the necessary help on the beach, but in most cases, complaining is not too much. Overall, it's good and fun. But do not try to compare it to BOD or it lacks it. * Sighs *
