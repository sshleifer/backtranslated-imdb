"Thing" is the best film of John Carpenter. As well as enriching his talents for the tension building and the weighing production value, he has made a fully planned scientist / horror film. <br /> <br /> He made a very believable isolated research base by filming in a really difficult situation that caused tension even before something happened. This beard works well together, with the beard with cart rasel which also proves to be a charismatic leading man. <br /> <br /> Grows up with the horrifying moments of pregnancy (courtesy of influential girl Robert Bottine - currently managing Freddie vs) Jason) Carpenter created a movie that rarely matched. It can not be so different after it came out of the same year as ET! <br /> <br /> The value of a clock / rewitch. 9 out of 10 <br /> <br /> p. DVD is nice A lot of extra plus the best DVD commentary (including Carpets and Russell). Plus remixed into Dolby Digital for even scarier sound effects.
