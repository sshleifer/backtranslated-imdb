The present thriller in Portuguese with English subtitles is a modern version of the 40-second American film Naura, which is ultimately full of a wonderful package. It is riveting from the beginning to the end. My only criticism is its poor production standard. The film was created cheaply, and perhaps it was so, more than 30 years ago, black and white artists are worse than Goddess Vivere to quote another movie silent. Most maddening, subtitles are often difficult to read. When filmmakers will learn and supply yellow subtitles so that they can fall against a white background. I would like to give this a total of 8, although it may be high with good production value.
