In recent years, a number of biologists have found a number of famous singers, and there are many similarities with Ray Charles's story "Roy", "Walk the Line", which was made next year, and told the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were near-perfect contemporaries, both of which were first born in the 30's and died in 2003/04. American Deep South both grew up in poverty. During the childhood, both of them lost a brother in an accident. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both of them experienced problems in marriage and both were addicted to drugs. All these issues are emphasized in both movies. There is a similarity with Ron Howard's "Beautiful Mind". Although the film was a mathematician rather than a musician, it played a role in helping her husband overcome his problems just like both "Roy" and "Walk the Line". <br /> Ray Charles was born in 1930 in a single mother of a poor black community in Georgia. (His real name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he began his career as a musician, he dropped his title to avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray, Robinson). In some ways, Charles had a more difficult time than cash, two additional difficulties described in the form of blindness and racism which was influenced by the lives of all black Americans, especially the south, his life. Charles was a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother George, in a drowning accident and then going blind after a year or two. He was frightened by George's feelings of grief and sorrow over the death of George. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is rather slow, and a quality story of Shadowsij Biopic is taught to play the piano on young Charles, the story becomes a nightclub actor, and then gets fame as a great artist, in love with a beautiful della Bae Fall. Best scenes in this part of the Flashback movie in Charles's childhood. There is an effective repeating image of colored glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; Before she became blind, it probably had some visible memories of her life. There is also a memorable scene in which the teenager Charles Omaha pretends to lose her eyesight on the beach, pushing her on the bus driver (in fact she is only thirteen years old while landing at Normanland). The second half of the movie has become more interesting as it moves to more controversial regions, focusing on Charles' addiction, his relationship with Marie Hendrix, his supportive singer, and his fight against racism . Charles refused to play in front of a nationally separate audience in Georgia (although, in contrast to what is said in the film, it has not been banned from the state's execution). He also fought against ethnic divisions in the music industry, not traditional "black" styles such as the gospel and rhythm and blues, rather traditionally "white" such as country and western countries (recognized by many black Americans) redneck community's favorite songs). <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Criticism of the Guardian" film critic Peter Bradshaw, mentioned that "Roy" is a sunrise film that moves away from diplomatic things in a dark way. In the years of Charles's beloved mother Aritha's death, as her first marriage to Aileen Williams at the age of thirty years, and her marriage to Della BA in 1977, she finally mentions her short marriage about divorce. It also reduces its femininity and its illegal child numbers. There is a similarity to "The Beautiful Mind", which has left a number of controversial details about the personal life of the subject. <br /> <br /> Fans of Ray Charles must enjoy the film for the song, but for those who do not know much about it, it also reproduces Charles' behavior about the Oscar-winning performance in the title role, especially in the direction of Jamie Fox, so that we feel We're actually seeing a blind man, even though Fox has seen himself. (In "Walk the Line", unlike Zacquin Phoenix, Fox knows his own song - it was very difficult to sing singular singing of suspected Charles). He gets some other supporters, especially Sharon Warren Arretta and Kerry Washington, as well as Della BA. The film is asymmetrical and overlong, but still fruitful. 7/10
