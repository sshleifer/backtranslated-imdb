To see a documentary .----- There were many things to consider in this movie while watching it. It was a great documentary of the 15 year old black child trial by Brettton Butler. She complained of the murder of a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police accept the details of the person who killed her husband from the deceased man's husband. The husband said that the young man was defeated, and the husband wanted to make some changes to get together. Police investigation little police! Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness warns about getting information to help his client. He tells viewers what he thinks and tactically tells him to use police to show his unexpected investigation and fights against his young client. BRACton was asked where the camera took McGuinness. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how audio is monitored. He asked a policeman on the stand and asked what he heard from Brenton investigator and he challenged his words. Police investigating with McGuinness and Finlay were going everywhere and they should have done it but it was not done. The film shows Batler a loving Christian family who believes in the innocentness and belief of his son that God will liberate Brenton. They took him to prison and prayed with him to encourage him. Brenton, lawyer, judge and group prayer scene for everyone involved in this case. I see a black and black how I behave in the upper police location blacks other blacks. It was very frustrating to see the black and white police sticks together when they thought they got their men. Police have hard work and I believe most of them are not like this movie. I think this movie is a great movie for anyone involved in judicial systems including judges, police and lawyers and even potential judges to learn and learn from it.
