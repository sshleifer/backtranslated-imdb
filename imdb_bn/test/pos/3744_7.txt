A successful surgeon, Dr. Paul Flanger (Richard Gere), his wife leaves him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) does not respect him and he can lose the patient he is managing. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and her husband has been cheated on her to discover. They both need to get away. At the same time he saw a beautiful ocean monastic guard at the same time. They're all together alone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It is shot nicely with a romantic setting and lots of cool scenes. There is tragedy, romance, more tragedy and a hoist ending (sorting). The great acting of Gere and Lane helps in the disguise that this image is not really much. Each single bit of plot is predictable. I rolled a lot of my eyes in some events. Also it's too small - I do not believe in the romance between the second and the lane. Do not come anywhere and come very fast. Still works in the movie. Sun itself was absolutely fantastic and with the end of the audience I was tears by the end. So it's a wonderful but fantastic movie with some wonderful acting. This is not the right of all criticism. I give it a 7.
