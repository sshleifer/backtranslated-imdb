I like the show, but the author comes in, take some action! Drag it over and over. You have a great idea and it can be a whole lot. Miles (Jenkins) is great and will work in that age to find herself in the age that takes place as a child. Hey, be creative with animals, they have telepathic powers or other loyal power. Child actor of the series is very good and believable. Miles's parents seem a bit more sensible about what's happening, but develop it, come on! You have a great seed here and the next few new characters and animals and all kinds of disciplined science-elements can be completely new in the next season. If they can make a series of a witch, then you should be able to make one of these animals and kids.
