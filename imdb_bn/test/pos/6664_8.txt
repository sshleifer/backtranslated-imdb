'War Movie' is a Hollywood genre that has happened many times and has been reset, which seems to be essential for the highest-order action sequences for clashing conversations, plate rehabs, and any conflict with high-level battles. After a while, a war film comes up against grains and brings real and exciting stories of life on the metaphor screen. A kind of movie about the Civil War era "Cold Mountain", Judge Law Actor, Nicole Kidman and Reynie Jhelger. Calling "Call of Mount Mountain." Again, Calling Mountain is not a complete movie. Actually, the film opens with a series of fast (and quite literally) fast-and-dirty warfare, with the opening of the "magnificent" director Edward Zwick with shame. However, "Cold Mountain" is not so much about civil war like this period and people. This story is played by unhappy Confederate soldier Inman, Jude Law, who is horrific Hated with Jude and left home for the beautiful garden of North Carolina, Cold Mountain, and evenly left behind the southern southern belt, is operated by Ad Monroe, Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup seems to be formulas, since Homer's view of romantic interest in the Battle of the Battlefield Basically sympathy for the relieved soldier's plight At the same time, the previous part of the movie is relatively unusual and even <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, back to the farm, Ed's Sanskrit way proves little use in the field; Soon he was transformed into something like a Wilderbeast. On the way to Arda Rescue, Ruby Thesus Course, Ruby Thesus Course, Hard-A-Nak Ruby Thieves, who helped bring Ada back together and probably more importantly, fought with war with loneliness and isolation war. <br /> <br /> In these two settings, a lively, compelling and, sometimes, very annoying portrait of the anti-warrior south appears. Character characters in Inman and Ada are suddenly complicated, unexpectedly "rude" as Roy Winston, father of Rune's death, and deeply disturbed by Natalie Portman, and enhanced by the amazing performance of Brevin Glisson as the isolated young mother. Most of the worst for the worst has been greatly influenced and changed by "war of northern aggression". Overwhelmed by the bold, wide-ranging anti-war messages, effective, scary scores and great shots from Virginia and North Carolina, the audience is not so much contacted by the horrific war scene that the audience was fighting. Although the weapons and tactics of war have changed a lot in the last century, the brutal impact on it is permanent. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mingala mostly managed to maintain this depressing mood for most movies, but unfortunately unfortunately, a wonderfully formed character that denigrated by a rather inferior measure little justice. Inman and love love story begins and starts oddly towards the end, but naturally it relates to distant, abstract and even irrational nature in an otherwise uncomfortable nature. <br /> <br /> Do not make any mistake, "Cold Mountain" does not have any feeling-good romance or an inspirational war drama. It is also a unique aspect of an era that is not only for entertainment, but to truly dismantle the audience by war, and to fully absorb the audience encouraged to completely free the audience from the terrible reactions.
