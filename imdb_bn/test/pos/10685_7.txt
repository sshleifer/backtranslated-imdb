Okay, I'll donate to you that "Doopelagorja" (or "the journey to the sun's distance") is some of the science dopies. The idea of ​​an entire planet is unselected (because we can not see it) on the other side of our sun) - An astronomical 101 student does not know that the size of another planet will cause gravitational reactions at the speed of other planets. In this way astronomers have imagined the existence of Pluto and in this way they find comets and asteroids and regular moons. <br /> <br /> And the idea is that the mirror image is almost parallel to the earth in our world, to English-speaking scientist and human opponent for every human being born in our world ... from things in the "solid science" fiction and "twillite region" areas Highlights This is not necessarily a bad thing, but critical thinking of taking and enjoying it requires a major suspension. <br /> <br /> But people, this movie has been closed in my adolescence. When Hero finally won, I was still used in the most playful, objectionable science fiction films - even the meaning of ending "2001" or even "upbit" can be interpreted. <br /> <br /> In this case: Thinx tried to dock his orbit with his motherhood so that he can return to his own world, only to return to his docking pains (some 'polarities are not reversed' because his 'Dopelganger' Apparently Thins' DopelGannzar decided that he was happy in his new home.) Thinx's ship is Counterthorth L.  চ সাইটে ফিরে আসার শুরু করে এবং আমি নিশ্চিত যে সে যেভাবেই হোক ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত নৈপুণ্যটি নিরাপদে জমিতে এবং আবার চেষ্টা করুন, নতুন তথ্য দিয়ে সশস্ত্র করা যা তাকে ও তার সমর্থকদের সফল হতে দেয়। After all he was a hero, and the hero always wins the end. <br /> <br /> Thins could not maintain control of the stomach, and the ship was subsequently devastated and devastating in the launch site that it killed everybody (except the main project leader) and destroyed everyone and recorded the Thinnes' Existence Thinnes do not go home, and he does not express his secret, he silently terminates. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a sad and gradual ending, except the Planet of Apps series, and it always stuck in my mind - especially the horrific destruction of the crash scene at the beginning of this move. (You knew that the spaceship was not flying again!) And at the very end. <br /> <br /> I love watching this movie again, and see how well it's been in years.
