The impossible word was led to select a specific view regarding many incredible works. It was believed in 1927 that no person could breathe the Atlantic Ocean. Many tried, but failed, and some gave their life to this endeavor. Nevertheless, it should be done as it is necessary to meet each challenge with equal determination. Thus, the heart of this film is known as "St. Louis of Spirit" The only actor chosen for this historic film is none other than America's own James Stewart who is firmly playing Charles Lindbergh. Although there are many aspects of Lynburn's life, the feature segment here is his effort to be the first man to fly across the Atlantic. The story is interesting and Stuard's fans are forced to say the least. In order to start a journey on an unfortunate day in May 1972, in search of adequate funds for the construction of a special aircraft, he was named Lucky Lindy, which is very risky in this extraordinary movie. Movie Hamilton, who is Bard Gurney, Bartlett Robinson Ben Mahny, Arthur Space and Charles Watts and O.A. Play as Sholaj Now the sum of this famous movie is that despite its poor approval in its first expedition, it has become a classic in its own right. Savass! ****
