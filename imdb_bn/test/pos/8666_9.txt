Where is Andrés (Trance Fausa Aurvaag), right? Heaven? Hell? Is a parallel universe? When the annoying person closes the subway platform and fills a warm train, the next conscious moment takes place on the bus; Riding alone, new arrivals, a dead netherworld where all go to suicide. He was in the courtyard when he suddenly departed from the spiritual bioosphere, an official was greeted by Andres, who works on the eye, if the barbarous Flatland manages to disturb the city and processes it, then it is dead dead. Memory works properly on him, if he once sorted the settlement of the urban landscape. Andreas looks at a sleeping sleep, people disturbed by people and objects, struggles to find his barriers; At home, or rather, its assigned apartment; Or at work, where the annoying person is randomly nominated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Howard (Johannes Jonner), his master told him, "You use it", which covers more than just the crashing numbers, we suspect, like the old world of this world. <br /> <br /> If life is meaningless, such as French existential philosopher Jian-Paul Sutre, it can be said for the same reason of death. The gulf of the office life can be a heaven for a person, but it seems like hell to us in the context of "Mana Bisomey Manane" directed. To work in the next life, the essence is to work for the rest of your life. The social gatherings among the Andyrias officers can be passed as normal in the physical world, but death is a variation that creates a change in the audience, because he now accepts extreme labor of white collar edited by white collar workers. During a day like automobiles, their unwanted small talk and designated actions kill hours, each day, seems to be unreasonable in their spontaneous absurdity. To show the transcription of daily life in a fantasy light, "Dave Bresman Manne" treats the common man as Deppan comedy, as the crores of life has become a performance, Karl Marx transforms the meaning of "isolation", because here in the male and female offices, the "work" Identify them with their labor, such as an actress in a story, who make their fantasy shelves real Upe plan to present. But the annoying people do not fully participate in the face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> made of red splatters on that clean hose. Andrés confront the same tendency from his colleagues when he deliberately cut his finger, hoping that he would feel pain in a machine slicer. He is not It is just another sensation, as well as being able to taste and smell lost to hateful people. The inability to be able to get comfort easily, enhances the need for annoying people for love, where easy pleasures compensate for the loneliness of the physical world. In a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andrés Anna Britt (Petonella Barker) met They hit it off. He is walking in his house. She invited him. They become a couple. He continues. However, when they are sex, it is good for Andrés, nor Anne, who can get more pleasure from interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation in this world, but love for the boring people, so he again works with a girl Egirburg (Birgit LeJen). "Den Brysomme Mannen" deconstructs love to present its foundation as a gesture series that requires performance from both men and women. When Norwegian does not express the same flexibility for Andres with his high-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Brit for him, this Norwegian film is extraordinary but reveals its mystery about the weird city, which is solvable and open. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . This time, he will not die. How can you die if you have already died? After repeatedly hit the train, Andres' face turns into a field in the ground; The only angle seen before the art shows its body contorts. When the annoying people understand that love and death are out of her perception, she finds out the people from the club, who agreed to say that the walking city is disturbed. Which is: Death, no life, no meaning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remembering Spike Jonjor's "Beijing John Malkovic" Crawling through a tunnel in order to cross a world, just like the portal to Malcovitch's brain, Craig Schwarzz complained about the misguided people. In an effort to overcome the great division of Andrias, a scary paradox presents. Since heaven and earth are literally divided by the wall, this weak boundary acts as the perfect encapsulation of atheist beliefs that "heaven is a place on earth". But at the same time the reality of hell is proved in heaven; Andresa was sent to her destination after being exiled from the city.
