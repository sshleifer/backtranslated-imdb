Outsiders are undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Well-defined characters, tight scripts, diverse and attractive locks, great guest stars and a filmmaker ambiance combine to create this series especially. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Andrew Keir has passed and has not been able to enjoy small screen success in his native country (unfortunately) by Saskatche Hayhen from Germany. ABC repeats the series again, but its DVD release will not yet be done yet. <br /> <br /> This series is timeless. It can be lost with a resonant term as it happened today with viewers. Come ABC ... DVD Outsiders Release !!!!!
