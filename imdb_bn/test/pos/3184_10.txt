I can take Filipino movies, especially nowadays where this trend is based on gender, action and slopstick comedy (which I hate). Nasan a man started thinking of me and made me a mask during the movie. It was great with great cinematic view and editing, especially cinematography. I think Claudine Milon claims the best actress here than getting one in the movie. There are so few Filipino movies that I really really like. I think that Laurell did so well in this movie. I really like this movie, knowing technically and character development; The plot was complicated and it was awesome.
