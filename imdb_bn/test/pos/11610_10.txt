I saw this perfect piece :-) During Berlin's fantasy filmfest and when I went out of the movie, I thought it was "dugged down"! I have seen many movies, but the perfect call like Kanyakatsuki or the subconscious cruelty of the club must be one of them! Half of the people left the screening in Berlin and I can understand it completely! This is not a movie for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! A person living in a dream every day will not want to see all the terrible horrific scenes in our lives and on our planet will be very surprised to see this picture! If anyone has seen SSC, then read it now. And it sounds fantastic: Just contact me - I do not see as much as sharing my opinion - it will be great !!! This image earns 10 points 10 points !!! Finally I'm really sorry for my bad english - I'm not a studying person !!! (und das ist auch gut so * g *)
