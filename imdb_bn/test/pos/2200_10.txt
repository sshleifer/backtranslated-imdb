I saw "Swine Todd" on Broadway in 1980. It played George Henon and in 1982 Los Angeles played the most custom principals of the national travel company in the competition for the video on the TV on TV. Last night I saw the new DVD release of Los Angeles production, though I owned the video tapes for many years. Production and performance can be quite good, but the age of the original tape occurs because both the audio and video quality are below modern standards, even in a new stressed DVD. However, I still offer 10 out of 10 because of the greatness of the work and the amazing surprises of George Hornes and Engel Lansby. Even today, the most memorable reminder of my memorable theater performance is to be the representation of "this my friends". "You'll rub the ruby," Brrr.
