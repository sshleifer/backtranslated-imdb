"Doug Beach Love" is a truly remarkable documentary made for HBO about roaming the NYC streets in two pairs of lovers of Halloween addicted. I accidentally managed to catch it one night and found one absolutely mesmerizing. There is no description and we do not see any interview with the subject, the camera just follows them around, like a third eye, completely disconnected. The people being followed are not even aware that they are being noticed! (Or, at least, they do not seem to care). The footage is amazingly obvious. The most obvious thing I've ever seen is some. This is as real as it gets. Nut and bolts like staying on his street and adding heroin. We snap their scores, watch it shoot, make-up, hide and hide people, police camouflage, and nearly ten million other small details which watch the lesser watch the documentary filmmakers leave. <br /> <br /> Some footage is really awesome. Finding one person frustrating is like finding it. I prayed to myself that he would find it, just as his sad ending. And when he finds it, the man dances on a literal street. <br /> <br /> The chakrabarti nature of the drug addiction becomes very clear while watching it. Everything seems to be worth getting the next score for these people, but the next score they exceed is the huge problem they exceed. <br /> <br /> If someone knows where it is available, then I want to get a copy of it. Highly recommended, if you can catch it on HBO
