Definitely a movie that only requests for entertainment and does not think much about their movies. <br /> <br /> Too many steps, lots of conversations (eg fun to quote), a little conspiracy, and all the spots around. Samuel L. Jackson and Jina Davis cheered on excellent chemistry. Violent, but not glorious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3 or 4 months. Samuel L. Jackson was in the film because I initially rented the movie, but his memory was caught in the surroundings surrounding Samantha's search and never looked back. <br /> <br /> <br /> Once suspended, do take a little more seriously - you can actually enjoy yourself!
