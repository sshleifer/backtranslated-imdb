After watching this movie a few weeks later, it reminded me of the John Currenter's In the Mouth of Madness (not for the story!) For the atmosphere, the fast-paced elements and the dream-like sequences. On the other hand, this film mixes pictures and music very well (Note in the fourth chapter of the film)
