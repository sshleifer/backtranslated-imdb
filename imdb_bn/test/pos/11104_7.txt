The United States government is a wonderful drama about 2 isolated, humiliated birds taken to Afghanistan, each for its own reasons. One, a doctor wants to earn some money in his next address, but because of his father's dissatisfaction with others, there is a more bad agenda in part. Good performance and a hot script makes this a winner.
