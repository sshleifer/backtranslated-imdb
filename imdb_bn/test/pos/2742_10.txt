Oscars, two Oscars and a TV cartoon show have won short, but there are short animations, but stylish scripts (Theodore Gisele Ukil Dr. Seuss) and more memorable and vivid main characters. The UPA pioneered an animation style that even affected Disney during the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts done in the late 1940s and early 1950's. This is their best. There is a print of God. Highly recommended.
