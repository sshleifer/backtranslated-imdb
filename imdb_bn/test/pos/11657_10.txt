As well as the greatest effort of all times, the best cast in a movie, in the front row with The Director Team Robins and Susan Sarandon and San Pen. Some have said that this film is good because it is directed and written by Tim Robins, but I am pleased that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandan have given me a really nice performance, which is why I push my heart aloud I loudly loudly said. Their acting is so real! There is no doubt that this movie has received 4 to 4/4 rating!
