Tennysius D: The Pick of Destiny, the legendary story of the creation of the band Tenissius D., and the findings of Destiny's choice, have been asked, picking the guitar with the supernatural power created by Satan's own tooth (operated by Dave Grool). Jebie (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), together with fate, have to visit Rock N 'Roll Museum and choose Destiny to be the world's greatest band. The movie is delighting and non-stop laughs are distributed. Jack Black and Kyle Guss work together perfectly, have been real friends and colleagues for over 20 years. Part of the film, a musical instrument. All of the songs (or most) of D. Written and edited by D All songs are new elements and many of them are classic. Soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This film will be appreciated by most fans of Tennessee D., but if you are not a fan of D, still feel like you will enjoy the movie. If you are a fan of D. you must see this movie. As acting does not make you feel bad, and do not come off laugh and grudge. I suggest this movie to anyone looking to smile as hard as I'm looking off rocked to get their socks and laughs for a long time. Dave Planel, Ronnie James Deo, Matloff, Ben Stiler, Amy Pahler, Tim Robbins, John C. Watch out for Riley, and Neil Hamburger's Camios. Also, stay tuned for an extra view after credit.
