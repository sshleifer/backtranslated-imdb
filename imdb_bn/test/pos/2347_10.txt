I'm a big fan of Naruto, although I did not see each episode or read every Manga. <br /> <br /> I really like the first Naruto movie, and you really want to tell me that I was a little nervous that it would not be the first (or action packed) (mainly in Australia, this was PG instead of M A PG-13 USA or 12 United Kingdom). But I was wrong (thanks)! The animation was even better (though points seemed to be seen in some paintings) and were especially good in battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Speak of the war scenes! Animation and action of battle scenes were spectacular and very entertaining! I especially enjoyed the battle of Jinzoatsu with Canc√∫ro and the fight against female fighters in the fight against Garara! All the characters you want here! Naruto, Sakura, Gara, Cancuro and Shikamaru! If only you were in the movie, then Shikmaru could save her from the dramatic fashion of women's fighters! And perhaps they can have a passport! At the top of my summary, I say that it is a part of the movie as compared to an extended episode. And it does! The action is very cinematic and especially during the war, animations are very fancy! Overall, this is a nice animated film which must be seen for any Naruto fan! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Ok i stop
