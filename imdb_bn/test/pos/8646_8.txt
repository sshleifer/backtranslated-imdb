After two short scenes that seem to not always be related to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, definitely rich beauty behind a limousine. Its driver stopped at a strange location in the Mulholland Drive, which is a frequent wooden lane road within the philosophy of Los Angeles. Just as his driver and another man in the passenger seat roamed to kill him, two drag racing cars in the same direction got upset in Limo. Only dark-haired women survive. She works her way down the roof from Sunset Boulevard and hides a vacationing woman apartment. After some time, Betty (Naomi Watts), the holiday of the holiday woman, shows in the apartment and goes into the dark-haired woman, who now has hunger. The first part of the film is the Batty and the dark-haired woman who is trying to find out who is trying to kill her, and her thousands of dollars and her purse was a strange key. This is confused with strange weird threads about Hollywood producers and managers, sometimes with a place of hoodlumas and prostitution. <br /> <br /> The above can be a bit complicated and confusing, but it is not half. The film was created in such a way that money will always be open to interpretation. It's basically guaranteed that you can not understand this movie and you do not have much confidence in your own explanation for the first time. If you have many experiences with opinionated movies like Memento (2000), Donny Darko (2001), The In Indude (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004) - you can not understand it at second viewing, either. The studio was aware that their director David Lynch wrote "10 sources for unlocking this thriller" and they put it behind the list of DVDs. Lynch is a special characteristic, these sources are often mysterious like movies. The structure is extremely complex that it does not help when trying to detect it at the initial stage. It takes a lot of time to understand what parts are supposed to be "real" and in some areas Flashbacks are a complex dull, only relevant topics that they have flashbacks. <br /> <br /> But are you trying to evaluate the movie, or evaluate? That, probably depends on your taste. At the surface level, if you are fond of supernatural, the film must be interesting, although it seems to be somewhat slow and too confusing for some viewers. But those qualities and many other supernatural aspects of the film are like Lynch. At the beginning of an elementary luncheon moment, the old couple almost laughs intensely as they are trying to keep the foreign pods in front of people. If you are familiar with that style and it, you will find lots of love here, although in many ways, Mulholland Drive is completely different for Lynch. It is also valuable, for viewers who are primarily interested in it or enjoy it in other ways, the Mohalland Drive has quite a steady lesbian scene. This is not invalid, though there is no problem with my vulnerability, but instead an important violence in the film. <br /> <br /> Like all the movies in Lynch, his art is attracted to the unique aspect of every aspect of the film and his attention is detailed. Any serious student of the film (including "Armchair Student" / "Cinephil") will have to read the Mulholland Drive; Much will love it. Lynch does not let anything pass unmanipulated. He included bright color schemes (such as red and pins) in a significant symbolism. He uses abnormal words, such as the ringing telephone that follows it in the scoreboard (when Betty first comes to the airport). He ordered his actors to supply their lines in their characteristic odd enormous ways. He gives his wonderful and wonderful idea a surprise surprise through the "Winkie", and the "Hot Dog - Made for Pinks" symbol, which provides a formula for some color symbolism. <br /> <br /> Leitch's production focuses on designing and providing important sources throughout the film to help unlock money. It has been noted that Lynch even explicitly claims that DVD programming is abnormal - there is no section on disk; You must either watch the real-time or fast-forward movie or refrain to go back to certain points. <br /> <br /> If the film's superconscious and hidden meanings are attractive to you, or if you just like "puzzles", then Mulholland Drive is worth watching the views for that aspect. The fairly acceptable explanation of the film, at least on a broad, general level. I will not describe the standard explanation here - this study is valuable, but you have seen the film several times and after reaching your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written on film and interpretation; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have a feeling that my score may still be raised on the next visit). Although to me, the film's "bend" approach has been very good in other works such as I Indide and The Betterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to her surface surrealistic touch, but the plot pays some as well as some of their other films of Lin Ch. <br /> <br /> Still, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd. If you are serious about filming and do not intend to think about what you see (like two do not necessarily match), then you will not miss it.
