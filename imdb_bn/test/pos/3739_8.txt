Okay, we got a 2008 movie using our "Brief Encounters" and "Bridge of Madison County" themes. It is basically lost love, freedom and the victory of human souls. Story of Richard <br /> <br /> The performance of Richard Cerr and especially Diane Lane is very good. Gere operating on the table provides the anti-obstructive performance of the patient in search of money after the patient's death. Lane is a rebel girl and a beautiful young boy, who divided her horrible husband and also suffered the loss of her father in the same year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In one scene meeting with Gere. He is a heartwarming husband and he mentions his love for his deceased wife, it can bring tears to your eyes. <br /> <br /> "Suspicion" as a suspect's mother to her suspicion, Viola Davis understands the friend in the film and literally hangs her hair in a rather modesty performance.
