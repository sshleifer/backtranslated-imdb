I do not believe people who do not like this movie! I was the most fun movie it ever saw. It is my fault that I am the biggest fan of Mel Brooks ... I know almost all the words and when they censor them, it is very discouraging when playing in a family channel. :) This is one of my favorite movies, so I do not know why anyone will agree! Thanks Kristina
