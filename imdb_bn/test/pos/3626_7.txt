A band of 1930s comedy mystery "The Crooked Circle" Hooded Cruise planned to kill someone who took an oath to oppose them. Enjoyable but real disrespectful short films, the movie works only because Jazz Pitt's and James Gillson (both will appear next to Hilgarde Withers' film since Adana Mei is dropped from Oliver's series) and it's a great cast of supporters and actresses but you do not know the name. (So ​​I do not have the nomenclature). A pessimistic hour long romp, movie misidentification, hidden paragraph, spooky music and a great deal of knowledge with people who do not seem to have them. For a dark and windy night it's a perfect thing or a late night look nostalgic when watching late late.
