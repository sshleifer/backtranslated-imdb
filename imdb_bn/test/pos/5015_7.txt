This movie has played well and is interested in the main character of the whole film. Stu Unger lives in an extraordinary life. Imagine Stu is alive today! This film depicts an image that may be felt like Stu Unger's life. It was interesting to see how it was connected. I liked to know more about Stu Partying, his slavery and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But in the end, this movie is well done, played well and touched the many aspects of the story life which touched a lot bigger than life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
