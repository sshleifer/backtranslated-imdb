There is no point to compare it with the original series. Although the appearance and content are different, both main ideas are true. That's an SF / horrible math series. Due to the indifferent schedules of Australia, I could catch only a few episodes of the first few episodes in a few episodes. The very first episode really gives me the cripps (Nightmare at my age ...!) But others have also flattened; Typically the stories move away from the horror region and the SF. I only hope the DVD finally reaches our reach.
