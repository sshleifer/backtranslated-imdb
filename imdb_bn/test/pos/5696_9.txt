Although many think that this film is very slow and simple, I'm really connected to it. There is no such plot, but the film has become the story of the survival story of man, of which three people have been trapped in a tree trap, among which one is eating crocodile where they are hiding in the water below. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the performances were quite good at most, although the roles were claimed several times, and I felt the warmth of the letters. The conditions they were in were pretty scary and I really felt nervous for them. Because of the helplessness of their life and the constant threat of their survival, I found the whole movie very nervous vaccination. <br /> <br /> Magazine's effects were wonderful for so little budget movies and I believed, I saw my fair share of dodgy croc movies. The animal had become well and was a real danger and even though the audience I was with was not very interested in the film, even then when they started showing their brains, they started jumping. According to the script, I've made several changes in the end, but it was not a big problem. This will be a compelling movie for fans of slow-moving horror fans in the realm of the realm, but unfortunately I think many visitors will miss their romantic romantic efforts and easily find high quality standards from their movie experience.
