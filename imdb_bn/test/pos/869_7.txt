Writer Colonel Olurich is a very interesting plot of the film based on the novel "Waltz in Darkness". This is a play rather than a movie star, which tries to send a message that changes your own life, as you love anyone and love from you. A wealthy man really changed his life for love, when his mate finally realized that he loved her. Belmondo played well as usual, although a little young Michelle Bucket played an infinite role of detective or police agent. Frankly Bouquet was not so impressive in this picture, but the performance of Catherine Danev was less than that. She was not so strongly convinced in her role as Louie Maher (Belmondo) boyfriend / spouse. For those who want to visit the world, see the part of the film Ascension Island and see the parts of Leon Town of France.
