Sleeping out one of my views of golden boy / lost treasures are animes. A sexy comedy, a young man searches for his life to find out and he makes mistakes in all kinds of strange jobs, because in this way a sexy girl who eventually falls for him does not really understand! If you can miss your name easily, it's really something, but once you see it ... fall into the comedy / fascination inside. There was really a crime that only 6 episodes of OVA and pilot film were created. However, it's being as unique as I wonder it survived a lot of production. If you want a good smile, with high quality animations (100% CGI free), check out this animation. One day the boy can save the world ... or maybe not.
