George Hilton never caught me like Franko Nero or Clint Eastwood, but this is a great way for him. Originally rippin off Django / People with no name and doing an extraordinary good job. The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and a joy of the cat n mouse game that follows. Will be fans of Heaven fans.
