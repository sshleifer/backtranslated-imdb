A lot has been heard about this movie, in addition to the National Award and Oscar entry. This is a Marathi movie, I can not orange up from orange in marathi. But on Sunday night I saw the movie on DD1 and I became glood. Now I'm not a judge of cinematic tactics and acting skills. But I've seen a number of movies, different styles, and average viewers, I highly recommend this movie. Feelings are very earthy and realistic, although there are some composer moments. See it in the human mind. No movie has recently been seen, which touches the heart, especially in Hindi cinema. Movie Movie Achievements When Movie Returns Movie Returns The camera wanders, wearing black glasses, losing its eyes, the child spreads the other kids in the water and starts blurred. I was unconscious. And I spend watching two hours movie - it's worth a lot :-)
