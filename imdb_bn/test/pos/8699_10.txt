OK. So it is possible! We have the perfect vampire movie here. Gothic, beautiful. With all the elements. A realistic vampire. A wonderful story Take note - I'm from a transfillier and I assure you, this film respects the vampire! It's just like the stories heard in my childhood. For a transylvanian, it's quite ... credible. You must see it, if you are interested in real vampires, as illustrated in medieval chronicles and how they are working in recent Hollywood movies (as far as I can guess, the problem of Hollywood is that they mix vampires with Inqubush - which is very interesting for me. Never seen interesting, they are only horrifying and Ratisodhake can move. My country is one of the great monster called The Night Flyer, lover killed their love.) I strongly recommend it for any gothic man! See also the sequels, they all are 4 very good! And of course, do not miss the dark shade! Something similar to Venice Nosferatu with Klaus Kinski. I recommend that one.
