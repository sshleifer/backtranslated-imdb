At first I say that I have become the most punk fan of my life. I was always respected for the LA scene in the early 80's, which excludes Western civilization documents except X and Black Flag, more than New York and English Punk people. I saw this movie that completely changed. The people shown may look like a bunch of stupid people, they think they can achieve something through their life outside of the street, but it's a great demonstration, and it's a great demonstration of its best pitifulness with Rock n Roll. One of the best scenes, and indeed the most insightful, interview with Cloud Bess of the Catholic discipline, or interview with 'Kick Boy' because he was familiar with Slash magazine readers. Originally from France, he rants about litter, or DIY, music, politics, and rattan about many aspects of general lifestyle, from viewers in a dirty old French and formula-like punk rants. The derby crash of germs is mostly quite stupid, but the effectiveness of the soft germs is quite good, with a small Pat Smear. The voice of the black flag with Chavo Pedster in the voice (it was filmed a few years before Henry Rollins joined the band) and X and Fear gave the best performance in the film. Look for interviews with young punk kids. You will hear the most fun things you've ever heard in a documentary. Highly recommended.
