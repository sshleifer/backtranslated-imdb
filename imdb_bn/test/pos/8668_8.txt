The first look is like another movie / book on one another. Kafka's trial, Melville's Lands, The Fall and the Rise of Reginald Perine and Groundhag Day are becoming increasingly determined. A man comes to an undiscovered town, Andrade, where he was immediately given a job in the office and found a beautiful new girlfriend. However, there is a catch: All his friends are friendly, lovely and completely idle, and everyone knows, including his girlfriend, the conversation seems to be the subject of only intimate design. Welcome to the modern consumer fire, where people come out of the building themselves and do not raise eyebrows, or spend their days reading furniture catalogs and eating food that they eat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Suicide can not be an option, and when she finds a new girlfriend, she is feeling as old as feeling - a wonderful scene in a restaurant where she tells her to go with him and what she can say <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some ideas on the view. Yet its point is probably one of the repeated values, again over: one that is not living an uncertain life. Which has been added, it provides a perfect modern take on the annual theme on how capitalism is destroying our soul. More than one character reminds me of my known people, especially her furniture-covered girlfriend, and if filmmakers abandon the idea at the end of the film, then perhaps it will end - unless you find other people who share your ideas of isolation.
