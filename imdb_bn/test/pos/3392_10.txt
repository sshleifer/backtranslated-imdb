Even for a 17-year-old student who likes history and this series was caught in the glow of his emotions and excitement, it was always a blessing when he came to the DVD. North and South are really a series of friendships, love and respect ... by giving you the name of your own personal list of views from this series. I can still remember when I saw an eye on this series on an 8-year-old TV. I though this looks exciting Bad I did not have the opportunity to see one and two books in the Netherlands TV. In the summer of 2004, when the length of the three books in the series was over the Netherlands late evening, I knew I would have to see two more series. The book had three big disappointments for most people as much as I know. Well I have seen the book once in DVD, I must say that till now it is the best of 3 books. Patriot "Oh America for Liberty" is a more realistic scene for all the young people who can see only those who are here .....
