I remember watching this movie in a friend at VHS many years ago. At first I thought it would be an annoying car movie. But I'm not surprised that it is one of the best movies I can remember for its time. <br /> <br /> This is a good story line and the best some of these are the unusual Aussie cars and street racing. I actually liked Fox's car which was mostly working dz charger. That paint on this car was really outstanding in my opinion :). I got a copy of the movie VHS last year in K-Mart in Australia. I plan to convert this movie into a DVD because I believe it is a convertible film. But while watching DVD movie bin, I was surprised by this weekend, I came across DVD. <br /> <br /> However, if you want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars, in addition to a good storyline, besides the pilot driver. Then this picture is for you !!!! Here are some additional information taken from behind the DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People living in faster cars He believes that he is the fastest man in the street - but street racing is illegal. If he does not accept his latest challenge, he can open his daughter ... if he accepts, he can lose his life. Willingly living, living their life fast and earning their passion. They do not come back, do not give up .. And do not ask for help.
