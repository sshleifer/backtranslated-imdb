It was a very good writing film, and the actor had a very delicate way of illustrating all the characters. But when the film ended, I think there was more, but they forgot to keep it in the DVD. Perhaps they are planning to create a seagull ... it is not a good movie, but it is a good purchase, but a good purchase.
