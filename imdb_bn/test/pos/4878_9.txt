When my host recommends we take this B-Movie festival to Bid. I was resistant, because I would not travel to the movie theater, but I must admit I am not sorry for this one second (especially Stephen Malcolas's contribution). It probably helped that there was no idea what I could expect. <br /> <br /> The Dust SEA starts like a normal clothing drama. We've got a young medical student who is going to help a doctor whose city is being destroyed by a crazy plug (which is related to the blast head). On the way, he stopped visiting his drunk and closed his father's property off. During the trip, he found a girl on the street, another plague victim, and took him to the doctor. Yawn, I thought. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Characters begin the journey "on the other hand" and the dialog becomes increasingly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And when I thought it was a cage, then the picture changed, and it became really dark and bizarre. I will not loot it for the first time for the audience, but there is a tremendous sequence of simple people, a lot of chat about misuse of the religion of society, and some have been influenced above-above. And did I mention Stephen Molomas? This is not a perfect movie (if you do not get out of its look at a B-movie festival) it's a good fit for the bold audience. Great visual, cool soundtrack, plenty of interesting ideas. Actually it's a little Johnny, but I think it's the point. <br /> <br /> I had to go firing to find an American picture to look like a brilliant British photo. You find that one ...
