I've seen this picture many times, it's good. Maybe because I can relate to Titus's life. Everyone will not find it in their taste. Also, after seeing each of my Italian is improving. What a tragedy? Thank you Mr. Sorrentino I look forward to your next photo. Although I did not see the movie in the movie, I have a DVD and it would encourage anyone to buy it. Special Features Additional Single Price Price The time a director spends during filming is rarely appreciated, additional DVDs provide an excellent insight into the making of a movie. For the story of the film, I favor. I get annoyed with all my friends, but as I said earlier, I was very much concerned with the main character. In Sicily, Mafia Titas used her money in London for Swiss Bank. He made a mistake in the stock market deal before billions of dollars before spending their money. Like it.
