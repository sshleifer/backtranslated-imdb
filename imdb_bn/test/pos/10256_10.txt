Cooley High is such a great film that even with periodic soundtracks, urban landscape, clothing and ambiguity ... it does not look like dates yet. The Soundtrack by the Way itself is a timeless classic. <br /> <br /> instead it sucks you right. This is a staple of a good movie. Do not miss a beat from the beginning to the end and I will not be tired of seeing it. <br /> <br /> This is ultimately the most tragic and it is also the end of the emergence of all the movies. Maybe there may be a few (backdreams come in mind), but the Culele was the first and much more emotional.
