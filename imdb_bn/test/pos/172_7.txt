This film is not the most horrific of all time, but it's a campie shock of eighty thousand horror - low budget, a star, a lot of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the kids in their seats. Premier interesting and fun and three evil kids play their part well. "Just Say" Julie Brown is a wonderful starting point for her talent to showcase her early career. This picture will not be seen by many, but for the horrific fans of the 80, it is a must.
