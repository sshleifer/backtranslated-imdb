(Note: I saw I saw the dead at the Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) I'm selling a jet black horror comedy at the end of the medieval period, and star Dominique Monaghan (Long Off the Ring of the Ring), Ron Perlman (Hellboy) , Larry Fasenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrumm (Fantas). <br /> <br /> This picture is open with grave-robbers Willy Grimes (Facades), still angry and irrational, being dragged into guillotine and executing executions. His beginner and fellow Arthur Blake (Monghan) is locked in the tower when he is waiting for his return, when Father Duffy (Perlman), who is a whiskey-swinging priest with a beggar's unhealthy interest, gives him a clear vision of the purpose. Blake's final confession recording. However, it has soon become clear that Duffy's main interest is one of the most trusted aspects of black exploitation. Most of the plot here has been called in Flashback format since Monaghan has restored Duffy with his Macbroare career story. <br /> <br /> Initially, Grimes and Blake started working as easy-to-cracking body graduates, working in jobs. Violent Dr. Quint (scream), a corrupt, corrupt textureer who uses blackmail as leverage on our two anti-hero hiroses and gets unhealthy taste instead of his work. One evening, the pair had their first run-in, when one evening, Queens sent them to a unconditional moon-free chicken to rescue a corpse, which apparently was trapped in a crossroads according to some ancient customs. But there is something different about this body. This one has been wrapped in garlic cloves ... and his heart has been buried with a stain ... <br /> <br /> Following an awesome encounter, they machinations not only plan planners, but plan a plan to rid yourself of itself They will pay good money for the bodies of those who conceal a secret subculture, and even better meaning for the living specification of the NRI. It takes our cruel two to the hidden underworld of "grim hunting" business, where they shake their head from the head only to the vampires, monsters and zombies (and another unusual entity that I do not wonder), but neighbors and killers of the Murphy clan compete ghoul predators. <br /> <br /> I went on to expect a low key, a gentle confusing, low budget killer, I sold the dead. I was ready for incredible imagination, humorous humor, quality acting, great dialogue, thick atmosphere and mere personality, which I developed in the year for my horror movie. Except for some exceptions on the rough edge, the production prices are so fantastic for the low budget flickr - it seems to have been made for about $ 20 million, and when the director told the audience that it was significantly less than half (although he was still being sold in the distribution, the exact figure Were reluctant to give it). Tim Burton and Hammer Harrar, sometimes with a visual comic book, with the insertion of the film's "appearance" and the tone of the smart little Crupo-Esquiera artwork, sometimes a visual comic book. This plot is amazing, but the concept of a hidden underworld, which is running parallel to everyday life, but the general public is not as incapable or reluctant to believe, it is actually a good idea in the film context. <Br> <br /> Acting, if you want to expect from this cast, the top notch. Characters have been splendidly well, especially Grimes and Black, and all actors have provided their intense written lines so that the right tongue of the cheeks can properly produce both ridiculous and realistic dialogue. Angus Scrumeme is a slightly appealing, violin-playing antomist, as a queen, but also a good but memorable role as good performance. Conclusion - I like it. Since it was a long time I had so much entertainment by a movie. I struggle to find something bad to say about it. Mark my words, it's one of the culture movies like Avid Dead 2 or Fantasam, which people still love and fall under the line for 20, 30, 40 years.
