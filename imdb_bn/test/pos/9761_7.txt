If you like the book, as I do, stop showing the video after seeing Jane and Jo Australia. Until that stage it is a fairly faithful imitation of the book, and the visual great is great. 10 points out of 10 and I enjoyed it many times. Then, the story has been carefully re-arranged and corrected, which really destroys the main part of the book, such as how Jean made a city like Alice (Springs). In the initial stage, the big change is to create a 40-something bachelor in place of Stretch instead of a 70-year-old widow. It has made this love story clear, especially when small changes in contributing to making him more selfish and vicious, such as: in the book, he knew Joe in the ship that he could get more than a letter waiting for him. In Australia, however, in the video, he gives Joe the source of Jinn's position or purpose. The last hour of the 5-hour video screen and the last third in the book. There is no reason to see why they have thrown the fight between Joe and Jane - it seems to be out of character and only one Australian Dig seems to know what it should say. Then they bring to the stroke for marriage (instead of three years later) - and toast must be read !! - Very strange, especially in connection with the relationship between gene and nail. The full wedding scene screenliner discovery. These horrors take time in the last hour, which is not enough enough to judge Jean's resurrecting Willt own as a place where she and Joe both can be happy.
