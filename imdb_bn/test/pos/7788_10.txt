This is the best movie ever released in Bollywood. Best Comedy, Best Acting and the Best Direction So Far! Rajkumar Santoshi's writings and instructions prove that he is one of the best directors of the industry. Amir Khan is absolutely amazing, it was nice to see Salman Khan's acting. Shakti Kapoor was good, but normal acting like Jagadip! This comedy has still been copied by humans and any other writer and director has been able to do this thing again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi can not be able to turn this classical classic again! It was a flow while releasing this movie, but it has been a classic classic which it likes after the war of liberation and all kinds of people. <br /> <br /> Star. <br /> <br /> ACTING 10/10 <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is strongly recommended. If you have not seen it yet, you've missed a lot! This is a smile riot and the best comedy I've seen till today! Classic movies such as Hera Ferry, Gossip and Jane Vie Do Zarro are not as funny as this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
