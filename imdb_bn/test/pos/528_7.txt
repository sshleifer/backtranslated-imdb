As a fan of St. Attenaeum and London City, I was very excited to see this movie on the Vancouver International Film Festival. This movie has great shots, a perfectly unique soundtrack, and a striking insight into 'great-known' London. <br /> <br /> The movie is fully held in 'dark' colors, which I personally do not like too much. Further descriptions were very little British and the comments sometimes got a little flat. Still, there are some cool comments by London and excellent shots. Lincoln really gives insight into what he really liked, but the Finnish did not glorify London by showing the city's most attractive attraction. From the eastern edge to the vibrant center as well as the 'special little retreat' for Londoners <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> + Great soundtrack + Excellent shot + great insight <br /> <br /> - Breathing - tiring to see at times - Many dark pictures <br /> <br /> Viewable! I give it 7/10
