If you are going to watch this movie because Michael Kain or Michael Gambon has it, do not be bothered, though it seems to be a gambling, but it is not a common role. Instead of dying for Dylan, I see what I saw him as a fan and not an exception, I did not understand that he could work but even had to stop even the letters that he seemed completely credible. Considering the audiences they are fake are impressive. <br /> <br /> The plot is genius and although it does not smile in all the ways. A sense of humor is a great movie for the people.
