This is my favorite so all the time it can be awesome film. Like my 80-pre-teen children, my care for ninja vengeance made me a personal phase of childhood. I thought shaw ki Then back was badass. Jat Lee could wup him with a cast both legs! This film has a crazy crossover, including flash'dance, exosiist, and Lee Van Clef's own TV show. Disgust But as one of my friends says that anyone can get a good movie, it truly gives genuine talent to a competition that starts with a ninja, enough for the body to recover enough surgery to survive the 17 shotgun blasts. How nice. Previous commentators have met with a flying sword from the staircase, although no one has yet met strong love scenes. Where sexy leading people police reveal a mane of his knees peep off his shirt. Do not end the fun Rent this !!!!!!
