How nice. At first I thought I wrote these things! How difficult is the choice between a person who gives you wealth, dignity and protection of you and your children, which only oppose you against oppression, abuse, deterioration and poverty alleviation. But our choices do not seem to be clearly cut off. Indeed, the rich lady was a woman who could be optimistic about her and her husband ... her sexual desire for her was almost helpless. What to do, what to do ?? As the viewer confused you and he became misdirected as wrong. Anyway, I really came to visit this site, my Angie's voice was appreciated, I thought, though it was actually the voice of the film's Irish singer. I found Glenn Hansard, whom I had never heard of before. Find out what one I am so grateful Wow, what the voice! What a day! Thanks BFF!
