Hong Kong, in 1920. A young man dreams of becoming a hero since the beginning of the poor and most of his time spent learning and learning about Kung Fu and athletics, which is against his father's will. He helped rescue a servant from a brutal businessman, whose gangsters then came after them, and terrorized the youth's uncle Noodle's restaurant. Uncle turns out to be an old, reformed triangle killer, who now helps young people become proficient in martial arts. This is the style of Karate Kid with "Wash Wax" instead of "Wax, Close Wax". Kungfu Villan is a grandson of a merciless businessman, whose trademark is Scorpion style, which looks cool, though it is quite stupid and certainly totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But the story, which develops over time, has experienced an epic, good characterization, great kung fu and usually very entertaining. The young hero is very sympathetic and offers a good hero. Remnant remains of the Romance dimension remains, which is a little frustrating. Otherwise a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 out 8
