This is a unique film, because it gives our young Nobel Coward the only chance we can see all his miraculous glory. Because he feels so much reserved and isolated that he is the role of an unexpected cad, which is actually perfect for everyone around him. But the deadly serious (no punished) last job, when the cover should be flying like Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his way with an EPigram is stunned, and hect and McCartha have given him some gems (MacArthur, he really - he was a pair of wit). <br /> <br /> This image is nicely illuminated by the great Lee Garmas, but the slightest camera movement from a storm order is straightforward. Hect and McCarthy are taking care of a topic - they got their dialogue on screen. (Note: H & M as the left of their own bluffing-and-you-miss-Aime camouflage fluffouse scene). <br /> <br /> The most prominent supporting player is Alexander Alexander, the infamous Broadway Calcutta, and the close friend of MacArthur and the cover, who was always present as one of the scandalous writers, waiting for the publisher's cover reception room. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Legend Algonquin round table, in which he is a founder and some of MacArthur's associate members. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Plot no brightness It's covered, Walcott, and dialogues in your mind ...
