Well, I'm growing up watching VHS copy of this party, which is now ready for snap and spent the last few hours tracking DVD copies as a birthday preview for my parents. The movie is so silly and unreasonable it is suitable for all ages .... According to my opinion, Disney is much better than anything (and I'm working on the Disney Store !!!). Character is enjoyable and the award for the best scene is a tie in interrupted marriage (especially swat, fly and mosquito smack) and amazing night club scene. The number of musical instruments I have seen now has threatened me 20 years later. There is no other film that I can recommend for better while sitting on the kids and really know that every child (thanks to my dear parent's thank you) has seen this movie many times. It will always find its superb love story, a brilliant Baddy and top marks for all originality.
