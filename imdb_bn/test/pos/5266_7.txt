Florence Vidor is as big as her daughter gives her strict biblical girl father who drove her house when she tosses her house. In the big city, she finds the wife of her brother's death (marry two secretly) and gives her child up on her own. After several years, he returned home to face his family. <br /> <br /> This old melodrama is classy feminine themes (in 1921, but seems to be a great modern term). Some of it is associated with a trowel (such as the father, Theodore Roberts gives his eyebrows a real work), but it plays music dramatically and lovingly and shot by cinematographer Henry Sharp.
