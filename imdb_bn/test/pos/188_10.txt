Current movie output, especially American cinema is sick, I have made an effort to see the foreign movie of Oscar winning. That's when I came across this gem. Slow to start, once the battle is declared it picks nicely. Basically an old fashion girl-war-story-war-fighting-war-story, performance, cinematography makes it even more. Why did not she become the international star of this young girl (though she was successful in her own country)? You travel with him: The young man, the aggressive young girl, who is a very calm, stubborn woman who wins the light of hope (her last scene is devastating), through the wars of war. We love him as much as the camera. And the camera work! The camera was handy in hand with this hand? It really adds a immediacy to the story. And it looks like beauty (such as walking down the street stairs of Tatyana and a slatted fence). I'm submissive and grateful to see this film.
