The basic foundation of Flatliners is fairly simple. To fix what is happening in the brain, several medical students keep themselves behind the death penalty. It seems like annoying students make a joke like a crowd, but it creates the basis of some supernatural substance. In today's world, where Hollywood is supposed to buy overseas markets for the idea of ​​creating a horror film, Flatlines are one of the rare gems that can make Hollywood a little harder when it tries hard. <br /> <br /> Based on this premise, many film flats will come out today that it does not stop being frustrating or arrogant. Flatliners recognize that the movie is not moralised, that recognizes. In such a supernatural thriller, the difference of restraint is really incredible. What's even more incredible is that Julia Roberts is not annoying or displayed that she is only seen without Julia Roberts game. The obscurity theory works best with the small audience of artists, and works here forcibly. <br /> <br /> What are these subtles found during the damage to the beautiful things that make them alive, and how well it is done back to infiltrate them at the present time. The character of William Belvedwin is particularly confusing when his personal video tape collection comes back to his return. That sounds like a lot about the role of William Baldwin so scripts or the direction that many think about. I'm not sure which <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The past experience is confusing in the present and why it arises as a mystery For him really think. The character of Kevin Bacon found an old school peer, whose life he had created hell and how much he had expressed regret, the film became clear. We can try to change the past as much as we like, but what we do with the current is most important. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Effect Of course, for an awful movie Flatlines did not spend its budget where it was not necessary. What we see in more spiritual periods is professional pretense, simple technique photography, or stock footage. Sometimes the best things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the movie, it takes more than ten minutes. The finale seems to be more sophisticated than the final one, as one of the studios asked the director to upload the film so that they could bring it out during certain market hours. Of course, for this reason most movies have gone through the stain marks, so flatlines will not really be any different. Hundreds and fifteen minutes we can get extremely satisfying, though not too bright. <br /> <br /> I gave Flatlines the seven out of 10. It does a good job like a date flick or late-night popcorn movie. Alongside that, it makes a good reminder that the low budget horror shows are not always the tragic part of garbage.
