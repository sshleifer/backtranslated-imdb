Darling Errell Flin brings the natural temperament to the drama of the life of George Armstrong's historically flawed but entertaining film. Through the years of civil war between the extraordinary liberal and biased interpretation of history, he wrote the cast article from West Point in West Point on his day, and finally, he is misunderstood as a little Indian soldier of Little Big Horn. Plans are encouraged by the issuance of corruption by government officials and businessmen as well as protesters of his order as a protest against Indians' wrongful behavior. Olivia de Haviland, co-starring several of Flin's films, dedicated to Levi Bacon, and Anthony Quinn sees the part as Crazy Horse in this awesome cube. Photo battle scene is wonderful. A brief description of the war of civil war and some vinettes, where the cast, supported by a few soldiers, hammer to submit the Confederate Sen. The final battle of the cast against the Indians is a huge scene, there is no quaternion in the wild mix of the armed forces between the red men and the shadows, the battle between the scheduled fight. The great aspect of Mc Steiner, cinematography, casting and wonderful music makes this movie classic in Hollywood.
