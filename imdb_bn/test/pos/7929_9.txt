This movie is a classic one in Cinema History. It has not been made to please modern audiences, so nowadays some people think that it is cracky or styled. I found it to be absorbed across. Alexander Nevsky was able to play Charkasivve properly, as he had played Ivan Grozny (Ivan the Terreval) many years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> One of my complaints was poor soundtrack which was quite annoying. Although I know only a little Russian, it would be able to pick more words instead of relying 100% on subtitles. Although I was watching it on the old video tape in the library. Probably now a DVD version that has improved the sound. I would like to know that when the actors were talking, the ancient Russian or even the old church was using Slavic. Subtitles were weirdly sound, and it was difficult for me to tell whether it was reflected in an old way, or whether the subtitles were done a bit nicely.
