This is a very nice movie. When two people from different backgrounds and social situations think that they have nothing to propose to each other and ultimately they know each other to heart, it is a rule required. Sometimes we wonder why a man lives with a woman or a great discrimination and the outward appearance speaks one thing in our eyes, but we do not see what they offer to each other, that is uncommon and useless. When Nomi felt that she had nothing to do with Matthew, and Matthew was only looking for a quarrel (because she had an open marriage / his wife, Jenny), they realized that they could not live without them. Other It was valuable for them to resist what their family and friends were thinking, and what the society had said had the right to live with each other. Love of this movie restores my faith in love.
