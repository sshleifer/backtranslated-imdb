Lacwana Blues is a beautiful woman about her beautiful HBO. The film which made her house a house for different characters. A great mix of tactics, living, enters and stories - based on a true story featuring an all-star cast. A time capsule <br /> <br /> <br /> You have got points and no, I'm not in Payola for the HBO crew - I'm taking more titles but I'm leaving. DVD's additions include a deleted scene, a feature and commentary. The most interesting part of the feature is the "star" light that they used in the producer's producer Berey interview. <br /> <br /> It's okay - good times
