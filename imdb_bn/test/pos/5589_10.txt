I think Crooks did his bad part very well, he won a prize. There is something that Dunne has. Savvageable because Dunne is a great actress and some can pull away even a weak script. So I would recommend it alone for this reason. The timing of this movie may be a little earlier, this day may be more acceptable. <br /> <br /> In the Golden Age of Hollywood movies, for entertainment or to teach, most of us feel better or cope with time. This plot seems to deviate from that profile. Yet, I must say again that there was one of the Irene Dunes, at least, "good" because they made things so credible! The only actress I can say, think of me in such a way, Dobo! If there is nothing, get a chance to "act", see the Silver Cord.
