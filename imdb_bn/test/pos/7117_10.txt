My sister, dad, and I'm really on D & D and one night we were browsing the Netfix to find a movie to see it. We thought we would try it and I almost ended up with a smile almost endlessly. The writing and acting of this movie is so amazing! Wicked characters, great interaction, and sunny moments keep sewing our whole time. I like this movie! For those who do not know about Dungeons and Dragons, it may not be much knowledge, but it is a good film. It only shows that movies need an astronomy budget and the big name actor / actress does not have to succeed. Check if you want a good, clear comedy.
