I never feel like reading school, Sarah, Plain and Tall, but when my son told me about it and they saw movies in class, I also wanted to see it. I borrowed the video from the library and saw it as a family. It was a wonderful story. However, there were sequels that I did not know until a few months ago. I finished watching those who are this week. I've discovered a small sub: In the second film Skylark Inn, Jacob was remembering when he was a boy, and Sarah told "my brothers and sisters and I will dream ...". At the end of winter, those "brothers and sisters" do not exist in the conversation between Jacob and his father. But it's a very small oops, and I only catch it on the three-dimensional viewing, about the second time. To see the great movie, a good healthy family must see.
