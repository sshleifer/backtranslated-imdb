I saw this movie, did not read the book, and took the letters towards the face value, but already introduced them, it has recently seen it again. I got a completely different view from the film. <br /> <br /> To focus attention on each character, without the burden of learning their jokes and foibles, allow me to focus on the cultural issues presented in the film. Iowa farm families are so passionate about, since they are in the Indiana area, where I grew up in the 40's and 50's, so I immediately recognized stories and objectives behind the characters. Probably, Jane Smiley wanted to mean to see us outside the world of this world, but the audience has been so influenced by these actors that they have been caught in different actors "Hollywood" Aura that they missed a rich lifestyle layout, which is less and pass less in every decade. Another film with these features is "Madison County Bridge". Try to see these two movies again with the whole picture.
