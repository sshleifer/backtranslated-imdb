One of the most emotional and intense movies ever made out of color. One of the best movies of the 90s can be easily said by John Burman, who has acted greatly and in Patricia Arquette. Story and bright letters just grab the audience from the very opening, and do not let go. After watching the pictures, visitors can not forget "out of color" The movie made little money in the box office and it is very familiar, but it should be high profile. Seeing it, you can say that it was meant to be seen by a large audience. This is a very important and moving movie, and everyone should be seen by it. <br /> <br />
