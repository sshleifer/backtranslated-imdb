It was 1969 years. New York City was in place. To get some recognition, the second Robert Doney film was Putin Swiev. The first was Chafd Elbow (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a broader release. Pound (1970) and Gregger's Palace (1972) was even more profane and insulting. The two pictures mean that they were actually encouraged to suspend Prince's film career for many years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And it would be believed that it is a crazy furce / taunts. I'm not going to go through the plot here. What is the plot People looking for a plot are going to scratching their heads. Keep Scratching !! This picture is about the plot! One could compare this to a Mel Brooks movie; The mail always throws that except the Hollywood Parody Party. I see a little bit of Monty Python in this. Ways: This movie was shot before Monty was introduced to BBC !!! <br /> <br /> I noticed that the gags and lines are diminished, do not turn off the face and do not transfer well. You have to see them in the context of the movie. There are some errors in the film; But even the flaws are unique. For example: the actor often repeats the same line; And somehow it works. How many serial mario? Putin says that six daughters of Boatan have received the spirit! Etc ... <br /> <br /> B / W Photography outstanding. Sound / score even better! The edit is just so. Above average acting. The script is invaluable. Jokes are as un-pc as you can get: m. Bad news says "Sunny Williams is caught in a motel with a 13-year-old girl" Putin said, "At least she is not a supernatural" Be careful of the Vitthat Conservatives. The anti-established mentality of this movie will take you out of the house directly. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> There are so many things in this movie that are related to today: no smoking !!! Opposite racism; African Americans treat croup like crashes. Media mass media manipulation; Madison Avenue, Derit, Hollywood deliberately padding something that can be an 8-year-old authentic trash; Internet, I'm talking about "drum"; Interracial dating; I could go ... <br /> <br /> I shot this image more than 8 minutes in 16 mm color. These were shot by the doll's agency. The scars are fairly well-worked around for the first time. They get tedious even though watching the repetition. Here in the B / W section of the real magic film. This is a non-visible line with you: "hire a char Schmuck yourself". "I love you, I love you, love you ... did you take your pill?". "What I want to say will only be ineffective". And a host of others. I also like the bay with Mountain Minne on the wall: "The game warden wanted me to throw it ... I fought this kind of fight, I decided to mount it!" <br /> <br /> Putty Butler as Putin's bodyguard # 1 included in Cast stand. She should have been a big bigger. Antonio Fargas as Arab She goes to the studio on television and movies. Arnold Johnson has the right face of Putin Swieves. Robert Doney used his voice instead, because Arnold could not remember some of his lines. Done also realized that after dubbing his lead actor he can fill up any additional dialog / joke. <br /> <br /> The picture has some flaws. The short run time is one. I will extend the initial wishes with the members of the White Board. Stan Gottlieb and Allen Garfield are outstanding. She could not just think more gags if the last sea had been cast together. After all, it is one of the best budget independent films of its time. A time when New Zealand, Chicago, San Francisco and those who played very few Indians outside the LA, they are funny and comedians who at least twice see it. Downey's Putney Swoope's time before and after.
