I buff a huge space, and at around 44, I've just discovered this flick for the first time. I came to it on a roundabout way from Space to UFO 1999, then. I went hunting for another Anderson production and found their first live-action job. What a home run! I actually heard this movie many years ago, but I did not know what it was said, so I accidentally found it after finding it. <br /> <br /> This Anderson was not surprising in her writing, executing a complete, credible and realistic look model, acting quality, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not think it always shows up. I tell you ... I will take old models of fake-looking CGI rounds of anytime today! Seriously, the rocket scene looked very pretty practical. They had it down to a science! If you want to think of what you are looking for as true, it really is not difficult to believe. <br /> <br /> Also, set design, beautiful photography, detailed amount of detail in the whole face. Man, I hope he can go back to that time! They know how to make a great movie in the 60's. Personally, I've lost all interest in the Hollywood movie today. Anybody with a budget can CGI. I hate it! Get back the model! Think of all the people employed in style! However, I'm ranting. :-) If you like good sci-fi that you've done a great job, you can do it by looking at your service.
