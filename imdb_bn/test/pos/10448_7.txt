Ahh ... '80's In 1982, I felt really crazy during my face in America. In the 70's, "The Last American Virgin" comes from summer as another teenage wolf as a sheep comedy. Oh, sure, there is sex, but, I can not think of any other movie - okay, this is "Redemption High at Fast Times" - which is not really wasting time in cruel teenage scenes - some nice things were there in the clavez < br /> <br /> This movie follows three hormonal friends. Gary (seeking to lose his virginity), Rick (incarnation of the stud), and David (overweight, but not inexperienced), they work hard to ensure Gary joins with the world of manhood. But, the funny thing happens in the way of fun - Gary falls for Karen (beautiful girls who love bad guys), and David and Rick can not follow through any kind of sex conquest. The only problem is, Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen skips a period. Gary is beside her, since she is going to get her miscarriage, and it really takes care of Gary. But, with Karen's car, the picture is finished ... Rick. Remove "and" and add a "D" to where it is needed. <br /> <br /> How do we think this film is different from others, from the others, God, they try some real drama here, or not "My dad just pulled me to the driveway." And you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> It was not soft. It was not far away. And, when Gary saw Rick dance with Karen at home after the end of the film, I was really sorry for the man. Our teenager Romeo really believes in endless love - and when his heart breaks down, all kinds touch me. So <br/> <br /> <br /> So, in addition to all, there is actually a real credible and engaging story. Oscar worthy? Not by a mile, but, I do not know that I want to enter it in the "Let's le Let" section. Like the "Fast Times at Redgimant High", they were trying to try the real movie here, where it could be between the collapse of the Hyde-Genx.
