After the success of "Muppets Children" Warner Brothers created "small tones". But instead of creating Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and all the other Lonnie Toon gangs, they created new animal characters, who had children with their own individual personality, but copied their ancestors. Brush and Babes Bonny (no relation, which is their running gag or catch phrase), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, DG Devilie, Sheryl 'The Lun, Elmira, Montana Max, Furuble, Sweetheart, Rats and Mixed Animals Perfecto Preparation, and the Ultimate Looney Throw themselves toons "Tiny Tunes" used to live in Acme and joined the Act in LÃ¼nder, where Lone Ton gang worked as a comedy for the young generation's brain. <br /> <br /> During the show, various pot shots were taken at Bush SR. Coupled with administration, pop culture, and other other gags and spoofs. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, logically the main characters of the show mentioned above, were similar to Bug Bunny in some cases, but they had their own personal personality trick and comic style, namely the tendency of Babes, to propagate someone, while Booster himself qualifies himself as a fool, usually playing man (or direct rabbit) directly with Babar's antics. The plucky duck was a virtual copy of Duffy Dook (not Scroul Duffy, not Promonium Duffy), almost an arrogant like Defei and Dosty Bags was more interested in buggers and dad to raise, although he is usually flat on his face, despite his fall He remained strangely brave out. Hampton Poker Pig was a shy version, and Parky had an extraordinary work to play in Plaki's Defei. Sherkley, the blonde duck girl, was in a new age valley girl type, whose palpitus would go in and out of the mocking or vying stage for her love. DG was the purple version of Tasmanian Devil. Football was silent Sylvester and sweet pink twitty bird. There was also a boyfriend and the butterfly female skunk for Pin-Size version of Will Quet and Road Runner. Evil was defined as Montana Max, it was a rich child, who always used to spend a holiday or make people's lives sad. Elmira was also a scary animal boyfriend, who all were afraid. And then Gado Dodo, a strange thing-at-goge creature, which had no definite specific species, without it, "Walky Land" or something like that. <br /> <br /> In the Pop culture references, Batman (mostly in fact), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Wallace, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supermarl, Fast Food Joints, Ten Commandments, Twilight Jones, Saturday Night Live and even Simpsons Including Dennis. <br /> <br /> Just not funny, but it is also warm and touch-operated, its successor "Anonymous" has never quite been achieved. Also followed by "Taj-Mania"
