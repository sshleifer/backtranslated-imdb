I'm going to make this small and sweet. It's not surprising that you do not have any use of this movie. It is a story about the underlying power, beauty and possibilities in a meaningful education. Based on your patentual copyrighted comments I can see that your own education has been negatively neglected ... or worse ... completely lost. Your comment is really unconscious person. I would suggest you do something about this situation ... but I feel very late in your case. My hope is that you do not want to go to teaching yourself (especially in film studies) because you can only harm. Oh ... the last bit of advice. In the future, if you want to write more opinion pieces, you should really proofread your work. This will take you more seriously.
