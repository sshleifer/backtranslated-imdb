Excitement can only be avoided in the illustration of the sixth edition of Imamura's Best Writing, on August 6, 1945, of which 90% of Hiroshima and 1,000 were killed. Instead, the Imamura has emphasized the unprecedented curiosity of the disaster, as the cinnamon mushroom cloud sits quietly in the distance and black rain makes clear the beautiful young girl face. The rest of the film has identified the raptures of the next event, which resulted in the understanding of nuclear holocaust and its subsequent (more than 100,000 people died due to radiation toxicity) and Yasuko (Jessicon Tanaka) and its small community disaster. <br /> <br /> Strive to struggle for normalcy and consistency, especially to find suitable marriage for Yasuko, but radiation emits the imminent possibility of illness in every aspect of their life. Yasuko's potential suitors, naturally enough, shy from a young woman, no matter how attractive, can suddenly get sick and die. Actual love, when it is finally displayed, so unexpectedly and ambiguously. We believe that love is a "damaged product" or a common token of common humanity, which puts brave relief in the harsh situation, which exceeds class classes. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Imamura's skill is clear, for example, in the joint scene of Yasuko's bath, the first emphasizes his lovely back and legs, secondly how his hair falls. Shots often stand in the trajectory of books as books, which weaken its sad essence. The film's documentary-style reality is violated several times for publisher purposes, perhaps a scene that carries the annoying internal life of the shell-hacking experience. Famous ant-guard composer Toru Tammatu and both stunning black and white photography have contributed greatly to the film's brooding atmosphere. When, in the final shot, Jasuko's uncle (Kazu kitamura), a remarkable narrator of the film, looks in the sunny sky of a sunny sky as a sign of hope and rebirth, then black and white images suddenly become so foolish that it is almost helpless. Some Japanese films (or in any other case, on that subject) can be compared to the great, humanitarian Japanese superiority of the 1950s. This picture is one of them. When I finished the first time, I was surprised to be unable to move for at least five minutes, I was terrified of being emotional due to panic: terrorism and sorrow
