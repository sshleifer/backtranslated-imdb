We saw this picture in the film festival last year in Toronto. It was a real moving experience. I have heard the truth and the process of reconciliation, but others have written, I do not know the details about the process. This film shows the process and growth that can happen when people can face their feet, understand the incidents of others involved, and express sympathy together. Archbishop Tutu and others involved in the development of the TR process are able to recognize their understanding of human emotions. Seeing this picture I hope the human race. If we can not do it again, we can not just destroy ourselves. TRK will come back as the first step towards the quality of human suffering and quality. <br /> <br /> As a movie, there was certainly error. I did not see any major problem in acting, direction or writing - but in the first year I completely lost a movie, so I probably did not notice. <br /> <br /> See this picture. For the next photo, viewers in Toronto will not leave the status, there were many questions and comments for our stars and managers. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett, and Chettiel went out of the way to continue the conversation with Ezifo. People just shake their hands and came thanks to them for the film. It's all of us removed.
