I was attracted to this movie oddly because I saw it in early 80's on Saturday. I oddly say because it is rather a ridiculous bit of soft-core flop, I'm a section which is not particularly interested. The conversation is widely and nonsensically philosophical (i.e., no doubt, only Franco-Italian producer) and completely external plot. What a wonderful hypnotic and thoroughly happy mood to achieve it. Scenery (beautiful Philippine), soft-focus nudity and surprising scores contribute to strange and highly observable exercises in today's rarely seen movies. It's really one of my great "guilty pleasures" I was fortunate enough to find it at the old Laserdesk and saw it more often than to think of healthy. A suitable midpoint
