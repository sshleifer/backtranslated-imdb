A discussion in this mid-length movie will start with a short story about the hypocrisy of people in Hollywood. In 1988, Chuck Norris watched the film at the Cannes International Film Festival. He had a stupid comment by stupid saying that the assassination described in DeckLog 5 is far more effective than healing. He has been portrayed as a strong action star in his Hollywood films. He was talking about a innocent taxi driver, whose face became vaguely vaguely vague in the film of Kesselovsky, cruelly with a big stone. We should not support any violence in any human society and absolutely no support for its perpetrators. That is why Chuck Norris's statement appears as a cruel joke, which protects the violence in a society that is becoming restless. An honest critic would not be wrong if he said that Kislowski's film "Decalogue: Declug, Paik (# 1.5)" has a universal definition. Because the events described in DeckLog 5 can happen in any part of the world. Keolskski made us concerned about the level of acceptable violence in the only society. For this reason, the innocent cab driver can be brutally killed. Feelings of adversity in us When we look very artificial in films featuring Anwald Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Gene Cloud Van Dam, we do not feel the same hatred as the film's assassination. It can easily realize special effects and modern studio strategies. Only children can attract, but serious film enthusiasts can not make any sense. Kisloscowi became the champion of helplessness to save people from death and death from human beings. It has been particularly attractive and has repeatedly proved that strict laws and capital punishment have not been able to prevent homicide.
