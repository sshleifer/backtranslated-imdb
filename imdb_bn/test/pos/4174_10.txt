What can I say about this movie that is not said by all other comments here, they mostly enrich everything, those who love it enjoy it, those who hate it ... well, they hate it. This is the equivalent film of marmite. <br /> <br /> I personally express my gratitude to memory every second, it is one of the most unique films of Chakrabarti, Quadrophobic, Spontaneous, Magical and ever-Produced Movies. Despite what many have said, I believe that this is really a culture movie, that diamond is almost a relatively short wait, it is once discovered that once the fantasy cycling visual and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable, which itself is an achievement. Those who saw it among my friends compared it to a musical instrument, and in many cases, who do not fully understand the context of this movie, it might be more likely to see the title. <Br /> <br /> When I repeated in 80 minutes, I always liked Muqi, especially the TV show. When my mother was impressed with me on TV late night, she knew that I liked her, I saw it a day later, and it was in my memory until almost two decades later I was able to find a copy in the DVD. A special edition of what I like now, it will be interesting to get more insight into the creation of this great essay. We can only hope.
