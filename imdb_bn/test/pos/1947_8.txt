I finally saw the video after years of hearing about it. This is not a perfect movie, but it's a funny hypnotist - it's a rare, special movie that creates its own world. <br /> <br /> *** Speaker *** First, the bad thing. Burqaite's class scenes are frustrating. If the subject is social studies, then this person has gone up. His speech is so ridiculous that they are ridiculous. And I would never grind such teachers to students like them and those who "shut up!" Want to protest? These scenes are short, but they break the mood and pull out stories from the visitors. Later, how did Leakee finally go to the police station? Also, what happened to Shamson's car after the first scene in town? He spends the rest of the movie, lanie or fax around the fack. *** Last speaker *** <br /> <br /> Ahhah, fak ... this guy is awesome. Dennis Hupper Immediately stole the movie. "Check Mail", "I Love Company", "You are My Friend" - Each line is a classic. He makes an interesting fact that the story works. Unbelievably, he feels sympathy for the viewer of this person, especially when Shimson talks about his future (Samson's). <br /> <br /> In contrast, the Crispin Glover has to be tough sometimes. Nonetheless, driving scenes around Beetle are perfect - kids always have to do something with high-school cars and work with it. Matt's low-key attitude creates good foil for Lane - their friendship is trustworthy. Glover's approach is a bit more, but he is consistent throughout time. He exchanged the plot and nobody else exudes a sense of immediacy - just letting if Matt or Samson - snoozefest as many as a zombie try to imagine this flick! <br /> <br /> *** How does "River Edge" make it stagnant, actually it's not really bad Samson really, in general sense. He was an annoying man who fell ill due to illness - in other words, he had thousands of other boredom boys like him. After he killed Jamie, he began to rush, which creates some mysteries, while he is waiting for a while we are waiting. *** The last speaker *** <br /> <br /> The appeal appeal of this movie is about thirteen years old and is moving towards their point of view. Parents are Comic Relief - Clarissa's mother, Tony's father - or drunk - Matt's mother. Hanging it together for the attention of kids how someone else gives them. It keeps the story focused on the relationship between the story, and emphasizes that only adults can relate. "Reverse Edge" is a textbook of isolation. It conveys how strange, mysterious, and disconcerting teenagers like any other film.
