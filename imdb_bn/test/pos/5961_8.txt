Excellent exercise on multiple plans: <br /> <br /> - Still in France the colonial spirit has not ended. <br /> <br /> <br /> - Generally the annoying mentality of superlatives from all Westerners <br /> - Spy and Renewal of Thriller Movies: Ossus 117 is stale and stupid! The good idea is that in spite of all these messages, this is a fun movie, lots of jokes and jig, very light and amazing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> May be success, so the next version will probably come.
