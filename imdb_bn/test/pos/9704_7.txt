Like the first one, Jacques's team tries to kill themselves by the way they are fit. Again, it likes to tie the tractor tires and walks around the slope. Deliberately destroying itself with a lightning. Other things even worse <br /> <br /> <br /> The first was crazy, and so can you describe it. It was a really solid sunny movie. But it's completely nut. It's got more dangerous stunts and even hard smiles, so I think that fool Idiot killed himself, it seems like this week would be the most fun thing. <br /> <br /> So, before burst goes out, I'll laugh at my A ** out.
