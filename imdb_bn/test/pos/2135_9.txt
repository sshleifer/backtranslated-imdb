Many of us who are dedicated to the "art" of the film will ignore or forget that movies are business ventures. Most of the time, they are very expensive for the production of something else. In light of it, it often seems to me a miracle that really great people are now and later created. In a while, filmmakers will go ahead on the budget to make such a film that the traders responsible for financing the enterprise will be badly damaged and will be very angry about it. When I finally got released big studio for photo and some big critics like "gun" both often came to know that it happened exactly how it happened. Awesome expectations are created and they are looking forward to seeing their cloud outlook. <br /> <br /> You can work in this case incomplete, but you can see the rebound '62 rebuilt ', and you can certainly see the "Heaven's Gate" response. The simino took too long, and this artist from United Artists Spending too much money for the construction, the company was severely wounded by its torture and, doubtless, this strange, great epic was finally released. Khan's powerful people were out to see his reputation destroyed forever, many film-directors who dislike long, heavy pictures are not always complete with great economics or at great speed, like Stanley Kubrick, Symino often speaks with specific scenes. Instead of trying to spell it out. Instead, he grabbed it at this moment Feel that the viewer can feel like living at this moment, which gives time for his imagination to visualize what is being expressed, many people do not respond favorably to this method, they want to quickly and clearly move the story and they can easily Depressed and confused by the kind of films. These factors contribute to the failure of the "Heaven's Gate" box office to suspicion. <br /> <br /> Nature, a movie editor, is deeply disappointed by the two problems in this movie. Here and there, a scene is clearly too lengthy and can easily be pruned without damaging its functionality. Then we came to the scene of a huge, drawn war fighting scene at the end of the photo. Where this is concerned, clarity of storytelling is indeed damaged. If you like the movie at the moment where this happens, it becomes unclear to understand what you understand and it's really frustrating. I did not see all rough footage, I do not really need to re-shoot or I can not tell if some critical plot elements have been cleared by carefully editing some moments. In view of the time and money inserted into this picture, it should be more careful and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, some acting poorly, some dialogue which is not true, but this is really a minor concern. For this reason I am so frustrated by the problems mentioned above that like many people nowadays, I think that the "Gate of Heaven" is so nice to see and so great to be associated with great historical, political and social problems. Just a masterpiece short. Despite its losses, it is so dramatically and visually strong that I have ever seen that most of the other Hollywood movies stand on the head and shoulders. I want to mix many words again. I want to re-direct and re-edit the scene where I killed Ela, but the glory of this photo is that these considerations are really trivial when compared to the total production value. I should add that a glorious wide screen should be able to provide it so that the secondary effects should always be achieved.
