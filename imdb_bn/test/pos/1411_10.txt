After all these years the theme song often goes through my head. I was never more than a TV voucher, probably within two years of my busy schedule when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it did not become part of my life. But I was hiding in the first episode of Lawman, and this is the only TV show that I have set my schedule for almost a week. <br /> <br /> Cute, credible, well-written and well-played, and John Russell I still saw the most beautiful people are still mys. (Peter Brown was not a dog, either: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that this is one of the lowest TV series ever. I hope I can find some episodes for my grandfather.
