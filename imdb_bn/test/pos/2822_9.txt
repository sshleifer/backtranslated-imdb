I am surprised by some comments on this site because I really liked this picture. If you are looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Surely your common psychological story that does not seem to be a bone-crooked star in Ben Eidet Affleck or any other Hollywood. This is an intellectual film, you have to pay attention so that some people may close it. However, if you're looking for something that keeps your toe, it's a good choice. Parental alert - It has a number of graphic sex scenes that can be seen once in a pure bed. Those who like euro flicks will prefer this one. Fans of Adam Sandler should avoid it because it is above their heads and of course not their style.
