Philip Garrell breathes our forgotten atmosphere of Novevela Vag, which was almost lost in the oldest majesties, but remembered the past and prepared to revisit around it. On the other hand, although little is known about the affairs of the directors, it is very well known that the reality of the reality is as anxious as it is covered by harmful ideas. "Les Amant Regulers", therefore, showed us a paranoid story of "Amor Fou" and a tempting revolution destroyed by the direction of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of the story was a continuation of a series of wonderful series of wonderful series of wonderful planning-sequences about the events of May 68 in France, which consistently consisted of the continuation of the film, which kept the rebellion against the pitch-black background in a harmonious light. <br /> <br> A lot can be said about the specialty of black and white photography to describe war between students and police, where high contradiction maintains an increasingly unrealistic atmosphere and closes the dead bodies. In mystery. Completely depicted images of the images show the genuineness of prejudice, causing irrational violence, and emphasizing more by the film's motivating reality. The person is not counting everything here: he remains invisible in the mass. What is really important about these war scenes is the importance of public consultation, the obscenity of the children's attack, the arrogance of the crowd, even if it is different from a passion like a separate light, cold and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> The second part of this story is described in a neutral and intimate manner. Looking at the horizon, a bona fide portrait of self-centered generations, completely unknown about the human standard, the recent defeat of a funeral in order to rotate in his own eyes and praise him. <br /> <br /> "Les Amant Rayares" has repeatedly revealed the shadow of Great Robert Bersen, except that the special sensitivity of Gare has been corrected and corrected without moving away from the main argument, trying to extend the overall outlook on human dissatisfaction Though the perspectives may bring painful truth to us In my opinion, trying to get deeper into the story page, if a person allows himself to go and play things with the ear, he will probably see that he can bring out the dark side of his heaven with terrible and hostile consequences.
