All right ... I just saw everything ... and some people seem to be classics that should not be (like all the Halloween films that are bad or even Steven King junk) ... and some are considered All right, that's good ..... ..... (like the carnival of the soul) ....... and then some are easily ignored ............ good (Bad version) or (the dead body of the pumpkin head and brain "mud corta") then there is some stick on your head It has been seen and never left ........... This is with me ........ And for my money it is much better than the last house on the left ......... ... the last house was too big ... and then it jumped ... what kind of a dummy is that someone just killed their kids for them a blow job day ???? If you want to find the movie "Bully" or even "Funny Games", then the reality is needed and ... .. but this wonderful thing stuck with me this year ... Connors were always scary .... Two Tania Roberts is the best female victim ... ... Three chick flushing in plaster is still one of the deadliest killings in the film ... .... And the 4th teleconnectic power thing is mine Blown up and completely unexpected ............ Dummy wax number dolls etc .. It's okay with saiko, last house, texas, chains etc .. This is a Classic ............. and so suitable ...........
