I first saw The Coach Trip (1988) on the late night before the television year and quickly fell in love with her. The funny thing is I usually caught all the comedies I've seen but even this never even heard it. Dan Akrood is a simple and easy mountain time. He did a great movie with Belushi and do not forget Saturday Night Live. But I think the couch trip is probably its best and fun. This piece of movie with Charles Grodin, David Klein, and Walter Matthau throwing a good support shines with comic gold. Acad's wife Donna Dixx also did a fine job here. My favorite moment of the film is the Accord and David Kleinon character Lawrence Bayward involved. Those two played well off each other. So if you do not see any good comedy then travel in the 1st of 1988 and rent or buy a cottage trip. I'm right, Amazon 78 cents. What a deal, very bad I got hit with 2.50 shipping fees. Oh well still good value. No guy will check out this flick love it out.
