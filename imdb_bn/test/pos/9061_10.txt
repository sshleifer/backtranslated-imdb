Who would think that suicide could be operated in such a way that is obvious to all? I saw the movie in his premiere SXSW and it has become the best movie so far. Yes, it warped and it is odd, but it creates film maker (Michael Parnes) that makes sense in the world. If you did not laugh (most everyone did), then you are not getting it and it's a great shame. Especially in the note, a bunch of scenes as Gilmouro Diaz Hector is stolen and chemistry between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The film reminds Harold and Moud one, but not really, it takes an intersecting spin after another and they all live in this crazy mixed world. We all live. I am (at most) for the question-answer. It was great to know what was later and what was happening in my head the same thing "happened" why they heard the same reason. I do not think you can say bad about the film, unless you get it. I think I got it and it worked as well as everyone else. This movie is called a suicide comedy, but it offers many hearts, lots of smiles and lots of hope, but it does not move away from the horrors of suicide. It is a nice little movie that will get attention when it receives a release, which hopefully soon happens instead.
