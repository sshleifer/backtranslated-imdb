He played directly, but with a calm intensity, he made one of the top police in movie history. Roy Scheider has the same mad application that is big in French connection to a poor man. FC is a good movie, but I like to see it because 1) I think Skydare is superb and it's the best movie, and 2) It's the best car behind all time, which looks like Bullet's cable production (Thanks again Bill Hickman, who actually plays the driver Play). It does not hurt that Tony LoBianco stops by playing a badie (again). Enjoy.
