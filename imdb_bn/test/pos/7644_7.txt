I saw this movie on HBO and I had a good time. <br /> <br /> The director did a great job. Once I started once in this movie completely absorbed myself. Norman Ridas's performance cools down. I hope more cool movies from her. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that sometimes I wanted to grab gun from Norman and shoot the snake girl. Hey I liked movies while innocent looking girls played tricks with really cute men. The last one I wanted :) :) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You expect this but something else will happen. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the huge image scenes that were cut were really painful to the eye. <br /> <br /> While the Norman Rudas currency notes were not changed? Or it stands by me freeze. :)
