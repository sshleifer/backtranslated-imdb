Debbie Wickers (Nell Shufffield) and Su Nate (Jad Kappel) want to be one of the best girls in their high school. Uncool and ugly girls had two options, be a joke or a prude! Debie and Mam use their cheating practice in an experiment to imitate them. Two of the cool boys, Gary (Gove Row) and Danny (Tony Hughes) ask them for their answer and they are all upset. After coming out of Headmaster (Bid Tingwell), the cold girls met them outside the playground and faced them with their "dooe". Debbie and Su did not invite "cool" to smoking their cold girls. They start hanging with them on the beach this weekend, watching all the boys surf. Gary ends up going out with Danny and Debbie with the case. Most teenage works including sex, drugs and rock and roll are performed. Gary is at the last stage of a heroin that debates Devi's life inequalities and she decides to learn to surf instead of seeing the boys. They are not happy, but watch them, call on the name, and finally the Master of Debbie board. A great 80's Aussie movie is a cool.
