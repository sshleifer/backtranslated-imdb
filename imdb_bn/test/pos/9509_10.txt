I have seen movies and are going through my years, and when I see a disaster film I am hopeful that I will not be disappointed. And I was not at least with that. The story of an entire country drowning in the sea was a great world where a novel writer, Sako Komatsu, wrote the deepest theories. Character top was pure and although I was not Japanese, the translators did not need to see how they could combine their most frustrating needs for common good. Special effects blown me away, I literally saw tidal waves at the edge of my seat and saw land blasts that worked perfectly for a few months. I thought of acting, yes, it is doing its best, tendency is going on throughout the film, and in the most serious scene I louder loudly aloud loudly aloud loudly with a loud and a little aloud I said loudly. It's good to follow and the feeling from each person and character is like it to you. My hats have shut down Shinji Higuchi for managing it, I hope he can enhance his experience to blow the other mind. As I said, .... awesome movies.
