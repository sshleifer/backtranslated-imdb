This movie is really an entertaining, well-clear fun movie for kiddies. Kelly (played by Niccol√≤dron's talented Amanda) is similar to a deceitful boy, who is difficult when telling the truth. It works in a movie script that is finally stolen. I will not bore you with details. If you have children and want to look entertained without thrilling kids movies, I highly recommend it.
