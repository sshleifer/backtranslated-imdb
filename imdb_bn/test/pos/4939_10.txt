Bonjoo, Mansiaria Shomomi is just a wonderful movie! Writer / director Sheme Jarhin has created stories in other ways and has consistently acted in a consistent way that it is a puzzle to me, that this movie has not turned into a favorite audience around the world. It's intelligent, emotional, advanced, and warm, entertaining, and it's a winner in all sections. Slimi (Oshri Cohen, a brightly different performance), a 16-year-old boy who takes care of his most effective family: his mother (Eztie Jakim) often cheats her husband in an impressive and often unhappy way of betraying her husband and supporting her ill-son-in-law For doubting the counter-work (Aric) Elias, who as a grandfather of the Slayom Jjbala, funny, intelligent, loving old man who cares deeply about slomi); A married sister, Joab (Rottenham Abubba), who did not help with her husband's two children, came back home with constant strife with her husband; His brother Sasi (Aashi Kohen) whose life is high power guitar, Braggodoko and his mother's favorite son about women's victory. This mixture drops and results doomsday functional family units Schumi cooks important food for them, cleanse shops, run ramps, do bathrooms, and care for this grandfather and generally gives him a life to submit to a family who thinks he's 'upset'. Slomi became tall for a girlfriend and virtually failed. The school devoted its lack because of the lack of care and density of her family. In his surrender, his mathematician teacher (Nisso Kevaya) notes his natural mathematical talent in a cancellation test and encouraged him with the help of Head Teacher (Iglal Nayar) and discovered that he was a talented (by dalixia?) And a special school for Haifa Arrange to try him. Slammy's mother will not listen to her, but due to the absence of Schome's father (Albert Eelige) and clash with the teacher and the headmaster, they eventually agreed to his exams at the school. During this time, Shomi was moved to his old rona (Aya Korin) who has moved to the next door and gradually intertwined a physical and intellectual relationship between two. Always the support of grandma's grandmother in the background, and when Dada dies, then she starts her journey to save her life, to understand her gifts, to find her happiness. The family comes to the mobile phone with the ultimate method of this method and does not need to be released for reducing the message's power. The film is well-photographed, the musical score is creatively beautiful, and the ultimate result is the ambitious human spirit. Highly recommended on every level. Hebrew with English subtitles
