Take me to the end. Bobby died in his father's father's hand. Mike tried as Bobby could get out. Only a child can think that it is possible to create a machine that can fly. Bobby died .... Michael survived like an alternative in his mind after surviving ... How Bobby went ... Mike made Bobby an aircraft carrier. Victims of sex and violent abuse create their minds for the whole world to survive. <br /> <br /> My old housing area was also good to see. We called San Jose Blvdvrd and this room was dry where I was right. It was so curious to see that they were decorated inside the houses ... not studio ... it was in my kitchen, bedroom and living room. And those hills ... we use them to raise children like ... looking at our little valley ... seeing the bottom of the bay. There was a real nostalgia trip for me.
