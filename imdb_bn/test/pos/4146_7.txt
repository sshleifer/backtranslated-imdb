Where do I start? I tell how great the cinematography is. I appreciate the specific view which shows the director's scenery. Tell me how realistic I am visible on Alice Island. For the change we should mention that there is no clutch view to see our Statue of Liberty. (Now immigrants have a clutch to see the statue from the ship's railings) <br /> <br /> Now that is not optional, two main things, this is a modern song score and not good for boot. <Br / <br /> <br /> The second and almost deadly image is annoying, it continues slowly, that the paint drying will improve. <br /> <br /> Running time is 118 minutes long and till now the movie seems incomplete. We see no scenes of this family in the US. Referring to our hero, he wanted to find out his two brothers, instead of the other scene, I would probably enjoy the unrealistic view of lucky searching. <br /> <br /> This image is a perfect miss <br /> <br /> Rating *** (out 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDB 7 (out of 10)
