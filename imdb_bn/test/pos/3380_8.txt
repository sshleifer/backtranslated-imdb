I saw the premiere of this movie out of curiosity and cruelty. I liked (not liked) "Mork and Mindy" as a child for Robin William's extremely energetic performance. Why this movie remembers me. The main show was great? Not really, but Robin was certainly. Which brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to wonder, a growing number of listeners (which it was) repetition of an image. But, of course, the actual focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from the national TV star fight from the street Jester, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long-suffering wife. And my hat was closed as a Chris Dinantopoulos star because he portrays Mr. Williams with honesty, sensitivity and heart; Just did not have an intelligent impression, even though it was even dead. (In a related note, I noticed that Robin's struggle was similar to Andy Coffman in some ways, which was praised under the network television and was preserved creatively, but "taxi" behind the scenes biopic.) <br /> <br /> After all, It was a very enjoyable flash, I felt that I knew some more people behind Orakan. Acting was all tough- I never thought of melodramatic- and stories moved along well. Gary Marshall and John Beljuice (especially the Beloceys Hackle Robin), there is no great title in any way (I have seen more about Palm Doubler), but especially for those Robin Williams and "Mork and Mindy" fans can be seen there, Nanu, Nanu !
