Things will be one of the great movies all the time. It certainly had a special effect during the war of liberation, which has affected me so much, in 1982 only my heart bloomed, I have never seen anything like that! However, even though these effects made the film even more horrific, it was the story, music score, clustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarchik, as well as the interaction and tensions between members of the debris research center, which make it classic. <br /> <br /> nothing better than that! With this helicopter behind this hospita, you are initially assuming that some stem was some annoying scientist from some station. Yet when you saw them that they continue pursuing them on the US base, you think that the Norwegian suffers from some form of cabin fever or extreme strain. Yet this tempo sets offset that menacing opening music score! You just do not know anything exactly! This is a mystery until it exposes itself to 'mystery' at this time. However, the mystery comes back because it becomes such an Agath Christian who is "world" (i.e. ten small Indian films) science-style styles, because the members do not know that any group of them is actually a stranger . Suspension is to go behind them and proceed as one after another eventually they are blocked off or expressed as aliens. Untruth in the station crew is rich in the film's progress as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> After the 20-year progression of computer graphics and film production, it did not bear the special effects of "THING", it was the same weight in 1982, but more than that, Cast was perfectly good with some great performance.
