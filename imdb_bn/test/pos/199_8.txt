While watching this movie recently, I reminded myself that it was created in 1957 ... and the USSR! That makes it all more extraordinary. Most of the cinematic influences in the film were captured in 2002, but they were quite original in 1957. It was first published in 1963, when it was first published in the United States and then I was hurt by its originality. Now 40 years later, there is no reason to change my mind.
