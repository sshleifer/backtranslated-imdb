After watching the first 'The Gold Rush' and then 'City Lights', after being greeted by Charlie Chaplin, I was interested in watching 'The Great Dictator', as I said it was his best film. I was actually a plot to have it; Chaplin's first one. <br /> <br /> The beginning is Chaplin and intelligent evidence that when the word comes, the Chapline can cut it, when the mood does not fully depend on setting and talking; It's fun, good times and slopstick elements, such as closing the anti-air guns and well tied with jokes. It was good to attract the viewer with the opening of this 'Classic Chaplin' and at the same time, start the details of the characters to know each other. The way to disappoint Hitler was also well done. In this movie, Hitler or 'Hinkel' scenes were fun and even now; He knows you as well as spoofing and creates some internal reaction and think again. More evidence of how jokes and jokes with Germany were made to adapt to the Chaplin Taki era during the conversation scene. My favorite joke was the five minute lecture of Hankel, to translate only the English translator into just a few words; When you think of returning to Hitler's footage, you may have seen some talk in your life and, indeed, you can laugh with him. <br /> <br /> Historically, the film also got some rights. Hankel watched taking pictures with her children; Hitler did something for the recognition, because he used the media, but here, Henkel looks at the mess and is indifferent; Hitler's underhand tactics to win over the German people through sympathy (Oh, he embraces and kisses the kids. He's OK!). The film has been given a great symbol of a Jewish civilian, which is going on in all the disguise, but it is caught unaware that it is unknown. 'Pianist' and 'Came and C' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people, nowadays, we can look at everyone behind and cut our heads when it was painted in the late 1930s, that cruelty was on and it was The fact that it was exploited makes it even more a wonderful achievement. Chaplin is operated to replace guns and transfers for tomatoes and snacks, and still closes it. <br /> <br /> I do not like about this picture, but it was actually installed in a real story after opening. . It slowly lit the film slowly and the gas was stopped for a while. The pictures begin to indicate the story and the sub-story. Among these, the barbarous and female neighbors are falling in love with the permission of Henkel's palace, which has not really been upgraded. 'A woman is giving a shave' and 'Anyone who keeps coins in their puddings' indicates the path to this plot, but ultimately, nothing is material, but an unexpected mess that is an excuse for disappointment. <br /> <br /> During the final decision, The Great Dictator gets inspiration from the role of Italian dictator who adds much needed life and excuses for the comedy. When we see their debate, it acts as a behavior and more underhand techniques are exploited when Hinnel tries to "rule" through a series of fierce strategies (though they have been laughingly damaged). Despite some weaknesses during the middle section and I felt that the message was a little under my throat, The Great Dictator is standing to see today, but that is why he knew there was no other buyer of the exploiters.
