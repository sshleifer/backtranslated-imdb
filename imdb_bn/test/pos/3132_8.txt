Trevies and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are forced to sell their animals to a Mormon group of horse traders and lead to a settlement across the border. Do not they expect that their infamous leader Uncle Shilo (Charles Kampar) will face the infamous Khilgaon killers. Ward bond illustrates the Elder Wigs, the main ring of the Mormon group is to remove the Wagon Train at Lord's destination. In addition, they are in Loxley at "Doctor" and lend their "Hoach Kochi Wagon" and their help. <br /> <br /> A group of lovers who are closely related to the real problem who are closely guarded by Ford will encounter a group that faces an unbroken Wagon trill time. There is a wonderful cast made by actors in the movie which is a real star in the movie, which is not really a change for speed, but a blessing to see. Young Johnson and Kerry, Jr. came really well, but like his best movie, Bond's film is bright. Johnson is one who can understand ruffians and brutes like the Shiloh and of course some conflict when Clegg boys may develop a piece alongside them as well. <br /> <br /> I would say it is one of the best and least appreciated Western and it seems to flow very well.
