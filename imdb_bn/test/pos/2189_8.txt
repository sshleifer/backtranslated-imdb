Well, I'm not the biggest fanatic fan in the world, so I have a cast album and I have heard it several times that I did not actually see this show and I did not even see the Tim Burton movie version. I think I wanted to see some more faithful before looking at Burton and give it a chance as a movie. This version is not a movie, it is an imagined game with some real cast members, including Angela Lansby's performance as Nelly Lavebet. It is a performance similar to the heart of the magic of magic in Broadway and theater. She was so much fun with this role. Swine Todd did not play Lane Kiero himself, who originally did it, but George Hennon. Hearing does not do a fantastic job; His voice is not as good as the Carrio, but it seems to be a bit more broad game. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only problem I was with was Johanna's character, such as Batesy Josin and her lover Anthony, starring Chris Gr√∂ndendallal. The high note can not survive in the voices of Josin, but I was not entirely sure that it might be the point, because I'm not familiar with this game. More importantly, I'm not sure that the story of "Swine Todd" actually holds enough weight for some protection, but grateful that the whole thing does not seem to be taken very seriously by its creators. As a star and a comedy in "Grand Guigniline", it is quite enjoyable. I do not think it is significant as a part of the job as "company" and "indo woods" or some other show. Some of the music is spectacular, but in other points it seems to exist outside of the show in a world. <br /> <br /> I will not say a whole word about this because it is a movie website and it is not actually a movie, only a game that has been shot in the movie. There were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they could remove the camera but it was there. People want to see it because it preserves Lancer's legendary performance which is worthy of its legendary status because it's a ridiculous and insightful performance George Hennon can also be proud of his version of the switcher. It will be a good film to show the children of 5-year-old kids so that they may be interested in musical instruments because blood and cancer can really surprise them. Seeing a performance so beautifully so efficiently, I think that for more such efforts, the musical theater was created for years, because I like the choices to show this later age in the 20's to 50's. "Swine Todd" is an extraordinary exhibition of his era, but miles and miles away from El Weber's insanity.
