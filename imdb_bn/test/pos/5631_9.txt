I rented this movie for two reasons. The first one I read was good. I was definitely impressed, and I could not agree more with all the reviews I read. The second reason I know these guys. I do not know Mike as I mark. He did not change a lot from the years he knew each other. I known him as "Rainper" from the local Milwaukee radio station (WMSSE). In this movie he is really 100% Mike. He gave me a table once. It was a small, about 15 "tall, Metallica said in it, the strange thing about it was that it was only two legs. Sometimes it's a thought to count and Mike always thinks about others.
