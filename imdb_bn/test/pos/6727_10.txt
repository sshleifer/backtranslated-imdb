I saw this movie in the early 90's at the age of about 12 minutes. I'm trying to find out what it was and finally I did it! I'm enjoying it and it looks like it's going to be a little late. Face the young boy and his ghostly face! Please no one will allow me if I get a copy of it but I like to see it again. I remember that my boy was making friends with a little yeast. The kids were stuck there with the mining, but it seemed that the boy helped them from the mines and a boy who died while working there became a ghost.
