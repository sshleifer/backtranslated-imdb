This film is clearly on the wire, and I have never seen it, it's like Bruce Willis's film "N America", stories about American freedoms, etc. But it was not; It was too much! <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Shane is excellent; (I saw him in a movie which I did not like, though the script is also bad, because he is so gifted). Kathy Bates is the supernatural mom, and does a great job. The real wonder is Emilio Estevez, who was not always on the greatest films, but the film was run. Do not stereotype him from the "breakfast club" movie; She is much better than this, and she wants to do more non-commercial, weird Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The picture is realistic, we see the time of Thanksgiving from Vietnam to Emilio home. Kimberly Williams is sent as a sister, who thinks he is a soldier back, "disgraced and ashamed" by his brother. He is quite isolated from the family, and, especially at this time in US history, this story is very relevant. <br /> <br /> I learned a bigger issue about traumatic stress afterwards, and you'll actually empathize with this character; This is not a violent, journalistic screenplay, for example "platoon", for example, it is more in a character's study, which is even more stimulant and anxious about the impact of the war, especially when considering the young age of a soldier the victims. With today's violence, it is a rare event that a movie actually feels sad, and tears a tear; This is it, and deserve recognition.
