A pleasure from the beginning <br /> <br /> I just feel sorry for you if you do not like muppet. This awesome movie Muppets's popularity is not only cash - it's a concept and well written film. It got great lyrics, and it was always present in Jim Henson's creation, and the character of the lady czet character has the most sophisticated sad sadness threads. I always respond to this as a kid, and it still makes Muppet enjoyable for me as an adult when the purpose of other children makes me drive crazy. <br /> <br /> The big name displayed in the comes is a huge cast. This image appears to be around 80 times in the "cuboid-sized version" around the world, except that it is about 80 times higher. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
