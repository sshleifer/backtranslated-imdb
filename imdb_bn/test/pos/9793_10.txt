This is really sad, and sensitive movie! It deals with child abuse issues. It's really sad, but mostly true events, because it happens every day. Eliass Wood and Joseph Magello play two kids or Lauren Braque, the single mother who tries to build houses for them. When living with his parents, a man who likes to say "king" comes to his life. He hit the youngest boy Bobby, but two brothers would not tell their mother. But finally he found out, Bobby was hit badly afterwards. The last type is destroyed for me, because it is so totally incredible. But, except that, I love the movie.
