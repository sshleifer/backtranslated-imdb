If there are people who do not like this film, I do not think they are humans. This movie places all the emotions and shows many aspects of Judith Lite's character. Created in 1997, it is one of the best movies I've seen and the film that really has played for Judith Lite has created a huge fan of her. This movie, though sometimes you want to rattle the son to rely on him, is incredibly moving. I cry every time and it takes too much for me! This is not much in the plot, but the performance given by Judith Lite is incredible. He looks beautiful all the time and ultimately, does not want to impose his fate by the court. Overall, a movie worth my highest compliment! Thank you for doing this and redefining my opinion on the death penalty. Since the beginning of publishing some films to Lifetime customers, I have waited to see this movie on DVD or any other media media. Although I do not have such high expectations even though it happened almost nine years ago, which is still hard to believe, because at this moment the film is still in my head.
