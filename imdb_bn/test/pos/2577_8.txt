(My senapasis) Rai (Cristina Ricchi) was a high school fracture and a nymphomaniac who was associated with Ronny (Justin Timberlake) meeting his needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and everyone will have to ride. Roy is not alone for a long time, because he trumps the city with a strong need to hook up with the people of the city. After a party, Rike takes a friend home, who beat half of his death and throws him on the street. The next day, Lazar (Samuel L. Jackson) looks for the verdict and carries his house. Lazarus arranges for Rai's treatment and believes that he can protect him from himself. Rai is a dog like a dog, so Lasra keeps 40 pounds around him and his radiator, so that he has to go out in search of men. Lazarus has his own problem, because his wife left him for another man. To ease her pain in Lazar, her blues music started. <br /> <br /> (My Comment) Once you have sex and violence beyond the movie there is a deep meaning in the movie. In the film it has a different feeling. The story is raw and almost keeps you in the movie as if you were there. 40 pounds chain is a good metaphor, and a purity belt symbol. You do not love anyone, but you keep it for your true love. Discipline can also be parallel to a wife who is bound in the kitchen but did not cook the judgment. Rae could not only have a wife when she wanted sex time. I think Craig Brewer (author and director) has created a great movie and Samuel L. Jackson singing an average blues song. Tactically deal with the issues of ethnicity, race, religion, music, and gender. (Paramount Classic, Run Time 1:56, Rated R) (8/10)
