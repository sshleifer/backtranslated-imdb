When I was very young, then there were four of my mother's tape lone tune / Mary Mediade shorts and I saw them several times. A quad dico was one of these shorts, and I am really surprised to read in other comments that it has been banned. I could not even start the Black Beauty Gag when I was young. Even though it was probably forbidden, even though I saw it on a video site, I did not think so. After watching the video I felt a few shots - especially Daphi's cap and Daphi's eyes were shrinking, because Deco was surrounded on the lake. I was probably not bothered by the joke that Gog was probably banned. Instead I was flooding with memories of this brief observation childhood memories. As a child I liked this short, how I rated it 7th.
