You know, this movie reminds me so many people, I think that's why I love this movie so much. I was just sunny because it was so serious and document, but the dialog was so ridiculous that you can not help but get a good time. Basically the movie is about the crazy dog ​​owners who are competing with the best dog shows to see who is best in their best. Dogs seem to be a dog that takes this competition seriously, it is as insane as the owners. One of the dog owners, the megans, almost the serial psycho killer of the hotel manager, is murdered because he can not find skinny toys for special bees for his dog. <br /> <br /> Another couple that is just so adorable, Gerry and Cookie, that this is absolutely so lovable and attractive women that are so lovable. At the beginning of the film, Gary Cookie describes how many lovers he was. Throughout the film, her "lovers" see her and even hurt her in front of Gary! It was great and fun to see Gary's appearance. This whole movie is simply a hot, and you can not stop with identifiable faces keeping popping up. It's just fun to watch a great movie, I highly recommend it! Now, to see the mirror of my own friends, like these couples, my friends have to find a great way to show it. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
