Reality before reality TV? "Redemption High at Fast Times" copy? Is a pioneer "tell something" that grittier? I can not decide, but the soundtrack * * 80s - Blondie, Journey, Rio Speedwagen, Devo, Lionel Ritchie, and U2 - I can not believe that they will never throw a single young man together in this generation. <br /> <br /> I remember this as a teenager - mainly sex portions and not hints at God. Why? I was a horny teen in the 80's. Seeing again, I can not describe how I played by Rose Kimberly Richardson, "Pepper Ann" voice in the 90's, and she was almost American when she was in the latest American Virgin, as well as playing 16 years old - fantastic! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy, and comedy - with a sincere cherry at the top.
