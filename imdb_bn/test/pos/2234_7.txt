This is a fantastic, cute, modern version of 30's best-acting version of the female's elf romance. In this case, while serving as his secretary, he became the head of the company and won his love from an extreme social butterfly. Interestingly, the concept of his business has been shown parallel to his home-grown skills parallel and women in the office are portrayed as "power behind the throne". The way raised above average by Mrs. Astor's intelligent performance.
