In this Story's Story Tales of the Soul, the game writers have tried to judge how a character appears in some areas of the world map, it is very disgusting. That's my only glitch about this game. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Martial arts discipline Even a second story mode that creates a weird story of ghost stories. <br /> <br /> The FMVs sections are also interactive at the time of the soul, where you can determine the fate of your characters, which is a striking feature. <br /> <br /> You can create many combinations of letters, in different ways you can explore in the story mode of the Tales of the Souls and The Chronicles of Swords, this game will be a betam up / RPG fan is happy for a while!
