The only part of the Zombie Bloodbath episode from Camp Motion Pictures is the amazing Junk Bladth Trilogy DVD. Zombie Zombie Bloodbath 2: The Aftermath of Andy's Rug. This one has surprised me a bit now because of some plot holes and some confusing twists, but it is a good film at many levels. Director Todd Sheet really shows a major jump in style and genius in two films. Again, for those who do not want gloss and Hollywood style horror films, those who like bloody, raw and grains like their bodies. As far as I can say, basically try to steal and steal from an elderly couple who see it as almost two robbers who were only members of a couple in 1945. One person is killed and the other is charged, one is turned into a scarecrow and crucifixes and they stand in the nearby field, still survive but die. Cut off today and break the kids full of college villa in the farmhouse. At the same time jail escapes from a prison in the vicinity. Both groups end up in the same house. The house was an elderly resident and when one of the accused was very scared and took his jacket, the awakened awakened sleep and he turned back from the body. How nice. And all of these first half hours. Another plot is going on in the city, where some of the serial killers have some kind of a hostage. This really works, because people are finally trapped in the same Dellie trapped in the house. Most twists work quite well, but it is clear that it was very complex for some of its spots. The rest of the heroes find something like eating a delivery truck or meat eating bacteria vials and it ends in a huge showdown. Of course, they thrown on each other and exploded some big and exploded a few heads and then we could get an odd, thoughtful provocative end. First of all, tell me, when it was not always easy to follow, I still had good time with this movie. It was fun and had a nice darn good for a low budget effort. It was clear that Todd Sheet was trying to bring more than the table to the real Jimmy film, and in that case he was successful. It was a great influence on first film, great pacing and some cool music and visuals, plus a knife was thrown into a knife through a true show-stoop. Care is taken here and it shows. Vulnerability lies in a few of scripting and Lazier performance. Again, I recommend listening to the comment track. It was better than the first one and I learned a lot. The Super 8 movie was shot in some scenes and the film was destroyed from the lab and they could not use it. While returning to the film, they are already editing the film, so there is some confusion in the film because of some scenes. Also, I learned that Todd Sheets really have a passion and love to create horror movies. It shows. The film is a good example of a budget movie that can use a more rewrite, but I still see brightness with more style than most DV movies. The first movie is quite fun as well, though technically a good movie. I really appreciate the true inventor and trilblower of the DV movie area ... and this is a great addition to the cheap zombie style!
