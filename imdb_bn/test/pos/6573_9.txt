When I saw the first poster of this movie, I drowned it on another young man. A few days later, when it finally turned into a theater, a friend of mine told me it was a good one. <br /> <br /> One year later, for the first time when I saw the advertisement, the joy was going on air on television and in the last minute I flipped the channels and for a moment I stopped watching and that was the end of watching the whole movie. . <br /> <br /> And now, after three years, I want to see the film at least 7-8 times and I never see the movie again! <br /> <br /> This film is great, because it tries to be different, when all Telugu films have 6 songs and 4 fights. <br /> <br /> This is an easy movie, a little slow, but very convincing screenplay, there is no loose end in film, very well spoken dialogue, which is really hard <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The edit is not chic, but it's just enough for a romantic one. However, you are really beaten in this movie. Two things- 1. Each scene has been treated with respect, now famous, Shaker Kummula <br /> 2. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br <> Other actors are equally good, King's title character and little girl, and when he gets a new dog, he screams. Finally, I can tell you that this movie is going to be another classic with the old classic romantics, as well as another classic romantic piece of Kamamulla, Godwari.
