Uzumaki, a wonderful stunning movie, and I do not think anyone can argue about this issue. But, unfortunately, the story is a bit flat. <br /> <br /> Still the film is very entertaining. It uses its wild style to tell a little non-existent story. The film often works based on its character and style, but in my opinion, it leaves something to be desired.
