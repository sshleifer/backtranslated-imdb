Until I saw this movie an incredible dancer Lanna Turner never realized. She was only 19 years old and was fantastic. What joy to see his dance with George Murphy? The story line was generally for her days but the dance was really special. I was not tired of ever seeing Fred and Ginger, but in this movie it was very similar to Lanna Turner. I always tended to act on those who played about actress Lanza. She should be more dancing and less the role of Madam X and Peth Place. After seeing this movie and his wonderful dance I had a new perception for him. Very bad "academy" does not give an "Oscars" for dance.
