Restoring my belief in the two hands in the movie Aussie. Take it to an old premises and make fresh. I finally enjoyed this movie. I recommend it to those who love singing Richie movie. Brian Brown was fantastic and perfect for her in a role tailor. The laser was very stupid and its performance enchored a very satisfying movie for me.
