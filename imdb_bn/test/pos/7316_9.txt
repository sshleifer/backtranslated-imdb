This incredibly cruel and often violent funny ramp imbciles to run amokciles in a hospital, everyone's favorite trio. These guys never fond their way across a bunch of doctors maximizing the misconduct of doctors without doubt. Among the comic highlights, Stoges constantly breaks a glass plaque in one room, facing them with a tragic patient who claims that the rats are coming out of Bathhole in his shirt, stogus is a giant bike, a huge horse, and a lesser race car, and our supernatural stupid trio After a poorly-colleague ended up operating on a helpless patient's stomach inside Leave the bowl. Director Ray McKeary adds great comic sequencing to a neutral, unstable dynamic pace and manages extensive slopstick gags with plenty of gluster. Moore Howard, Larry Fine and Curley Howard are all in the top lupis form, in support of Dell Henderson's Sterling, the long-time hospital supervisor Dr Graves, Skeeky-Voiced Jenny Roberts Hickicking Nurse (The scene where Stojes works a stupid) is incomplete group singling with this cheek absolutely biased!), Ruth Hayat is a screaming nurse, Billy Gilbert as a crazy rabbit patient and "Little Billy" Rhodes Like it The enthusiastic Luanyasi does not pay for one minute, which makes this the best ever-ever beautiful stunning child of Stuges.
