From "36 Cherry Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", Aparna Sen has traveled a long way. If the first person goes to history as a clear slip of the debutant, then he will definitely make a special place as a "mature" movie. You can not feel the thrill feeling because of not seeing Park Avenue 15 and have been transferred at the same time. Thriller to look at the director's cognition and quickness to portray in serious challenging situations and move by sensitivity across the film. It's not a movie that just thinks you're "just like", how difficult it is for schizophrenics, but you ask deep questions about the reality you see and believe. Sen has highlighted this ultimate truth of our existence that we are trying to live in our own faith, in other ways, in our own beliefs, trying to follow miras in the name of happiness, peace, satisfaction. In addition to portraying a confusing mind, Sen's magic has given a very small concept of human relationships because they cause intense pressure and pressure. True, we sometimes get calm, break up, choose the wrong, fear the crime, behave in a selfish way, and in this way we get great consciousness by Sen. She showed cruel contradictions which Shabana wanted to deal with with her life. , A schizophrenic sister and herself to choose between a husband and a normal life with children. And always staying next to her sister, always working with strong personality, support, decision making, she unknowingly cut oxygen oxygen which her sister was born. Is it not so strict that sometimes trying to do the best for someone, we stabilize their conviction and hurt their self-respect? Of course, Kanakona and Shabana's acting were always good enough to be appreciated because these ingredients were not so good, so the dish could not have been so extraordinary. Aparna Sen has again made a best-selling film for those interested in "Movie for thought". Bravo!
