We are in a small town, a house widow (Ida Lupino) hired a guardian (Robert Ryan) to take care of her house. Ryan began to become uncertain after so many hours, soon she began to feel sad, she seems to be a dangerous schizophrenic host, and now she can not escape from her house. <br /> <br /> Be careful, my girlfriend adores Mel Deenelli's (The Spy Starce) story and "The Man" game. Most of a set film and two character-driven pieces, this film highlights two great central performances and plays an important role in mental illness. However, it is not a violent and nervous shredding picture, because it is not one. Ryan's Howard Willton is dangerously dangerous because it is clear that it is a different kind of "Danger" movie. One that touches up another slant up on the psychologist and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous hero. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino have a great combination, they have been nice and very good, even in the same dangerous ground. So with both actors definitely cozy together, it is based on a modest tuned character story based on all one's house, again: Prison. Ryan is especially strong, because her character has emerged in the crazy and outward, strong in some scenes and often gives fear and deep sympathy to others. Harry Horner's order is safe [he does not really have to do more than run it with his actors] and George E. Discent cinematography has some smart and influential visual touches. Christmas tree baubles with a very involved memorable. Be careful about getting a bit fierce between average and average, with My Lovely enough to follow the recommendations of people in the border and follow film-making. For Robert Ryan's fans, this is an essential sighting something, oh yes, and then something. 7/10
