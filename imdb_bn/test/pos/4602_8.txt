There is no other word for this ... Fox has exceeded it without any such marketing. Nobody knows anything about this movie except waiting for the movie. All the red flags are flying. It must be a mess, it can not be anywhere near office space as well, right? Wrong Although it does not have office space, this film definitely has taunts and wit. It is a distraction at certain level, but who can be blamed for mystery. <br /> <br /> Based on what is currently being shown in the theater, I can say IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes laugh-out loud fun It's effective, sometimes impressive. As far as I can not say, it's over. We will again see some of this movie, whether it is an extended cut or resume. Alone it can be pleasing. It's sometimes tough <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater, looking around the mall, I was surrounded by advertising and billboards, business and folly. It does not damage a Dustipia like 1984, but this film gives an ugly future picture for our culture. And it does not seem to do a lot about it. However, try to find out what happened if you can and it is specially buried.
