It is known to the man that this film was made without any shelter and when he finally saw some part of it, he announced that the film would not be shown in India or he would cover himself, he would set himself on fire from petrol. I do not know whether it has been shown at all times or not, but at that time I doubt if talking about his position as a senior politician. Then, I saw a report that he was fired from the office and was charged with more crime from the day of his robbery, and as a result, he was concealed. <br /> <br /> Consolidate his own thoughts, make it a nice film, all the more so by his refreshingly brutal approach; Melody of a pink color can not expect from an Indian film. There should be concern about how the film's messages really are feminist and inevitably irrelevant: This is a true fact. His misconception, does not seem to be, with what he has been portrayed but how his image is portrayed in the film.
