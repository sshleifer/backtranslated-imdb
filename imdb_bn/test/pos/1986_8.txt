I always believed that any film in the plot is not centered around virtual reality video games, it does not seem to be something special, but Exstenz has proved that I could not be more wrong. This film is incredible and, while highly entertaining, offers a lot more than that. From the beginning to the end, this film has been conceived in the point where you can have many ideas, you can not make a final decision. David Cranburg has such a talent that he does a lot of things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The way it is written is very unique in its style and it can only be a good thing. Craniberg made a clear goal with this film and guesses what the audience clearly did. This film is not necessary for his love for the great love of the flight or nude lunch, but still some elements like game ingredients and how they are made can surprise the viewers. It's a pretty awesome combination, related to its previous work, Exstenzied VideoDrome and the combination of a less violent scanners. Setting the film in a distant future was a very good decision because it allows Kr√∂nbourg to be extremely fantasy around the movies and enables him to make more ideas visible for writing lesser ideas. The film could not be confusing and it was important to avoid it very well by making it relatively easy to make Craneberg the subject. Besides, if he wanted to create an unexpected film, he knew what he would do better than this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The ecstasy character congratulates the actors of a very gifted artist and everyone plays very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives standout performance as a game designer, who spent more time than the reality. Commanding his role as Leigh Sexy and Allegra and he really got his teeth in the role. He is particularly impressive in the psychological range shown in movies, making him totally believable (if you can believe anything). Jude is very good in law and fear of the implant of his character. Chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film extra bit. Ian Holm and Willow Dufo add more depth to the film with very colorful performances, which are just two great actors supporter. Cast of the film is not huge, but Exstenzade is certainly 'better than the quality than the quantity' which works very well. <br /> <br /> As well as entertaining and thought provoking, exstensives touch social problems such as controls and self-harm. It also illustrates images as an intellectual ship and could explain why it was not a huge hit in Hollywood. Exsthenj has been offered a lot and although it is not a taste for everyone, those who like Kroneberg's work or prefer science fiction, they will almost certainly be sure to like this movie. This is a film that needs to be seen with an open mind, but it's really something special.
