I remember watching every Saturday evening this Saturday morning. It was the highlight of the week. I like it about everything, location, clothing, and amazing music by the actors Clannad (I still have their legend albums). I like the way to solve Michael Powder's problem, this time Robin creates, Huntingdon's Earlty. I believe there were various Robin legends at medieval times. Another thing I like is that it was filled with young actors, I'm sure Robin and his men will be young, not all days survived those days. Other robins are always too old (Kevin Coster looked like Robin's grandfather with his ridiculous pronunciation). The only tragic event was over, it is embarrassing that they stopped it to finish at least all loose and it could give a happy ending.
