This movie is one of the greatest films made in the course. This is a story called a steady pace, not mostly by word but by expression media. Spectacular special effects and perfect blend of classical music can be imagined in both practical and poetic way. The story itself is quite easy at first glance. As the title implies, an archetypal journey, repeat for a purpose thousands of years. This purpose always not only depicted a trip to space and time, and beyond, but had a rich philosophical meaning. The film is a poetic thought of the most exciting eternal questions. It's not just a person's ODG; It is an ODG of our species. The film itself is great, but in my case, the impression of it will always be mixed with the book. I read it at the age of 10, 'What is the relationship between the evolution of mankind and the development of human morality?' But this impression was enough for me to fall into the full form of science fiction. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Academy Award' has become two words that have absolutely nothing to me.
