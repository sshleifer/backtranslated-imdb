The direction is brilliant, casting is wonderful (although I loved to show a little more than Harun Logist's (RRR fame) playing Paran Shafa. I have two minor quips like film, as fine as it is. One- Robak Leno is excellent, but the presence of his stage (i.e. A loss of two-stupid language while I was tapping on one of his last show episodes.) I wish to tolerate stupid language. Chuck, until it was used unused, and a degree, the film was unrealistic. The language seemed to have been used as an instrument for reducing the passage of bats, otherwise it is well illustrated in the continuous use of kushnik and due to its lack of use, Robbok Lenno makes a good-happy (of course, if the character really did not behave this way, everyone kudos). However, the pieces are a f One is the one, as long as the television and the video are concerned. I think, there was a potential film for big screen, but re-casting was needed for bit parts and was probably a different director (as well as the beauty of the Latin Sands show, good for HBO, medieval for film) .
