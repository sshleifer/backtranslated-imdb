If you see this movie you will quote it and mention it for a long time. I've been through Dolmeet for many years and I still have cited this day. This is a true classic. It makes it a ridiculous scenario that it is so bad. Every terrible line of dialogue is completely amazing. Every wobbly industry has a job (?) And every punch and kick is so harmful execution. You will not believe in your eyes It's all I can say. If I really make fun of this movie then I can not stop and I will exceed the IMDB 1000-word limit. <br /> <br /> Please see this movie. You will be hysterics. Laughter depends on your ideas, is 1/10 or 10/10.
