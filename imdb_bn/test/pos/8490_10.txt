Jamie Fox is dark, emotionally disturbed in this dark life, African American genius of pop jazz, m. This beautiful ride through Ray Charles runs a brilliant cast. Although the Cast completely marvelously, Mr. Fox has achieved more than just the Oscars. If an actor is nominated for successive years, I would consider doing it for Mr. Fox. Fox does not just play Charles, he regenerates it. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also have the right to render the role of Ray's mother (inspiration of her life) and the young Ray's screenplay. Provides strong support for these two films. <br /> <br /> Charles' plays fight with crime, his younger brother and mother are well-nourished with the death of blindness, discrimination, addiction and success. Her music tapestries The music is beautiful, the script, as far as I can say, is perfect, and the acting legend is nothing short. <br /> <br /> Discussion about the instructional approach of film. Taylor Hackford - A director who I often hesitated - had to choose between a life greater than Mr Charles and any aspects of the complex life story would tell his story the most honest, dramatically and comprehensively. Although some disagreements (like a documentary rather than seemingly dramatic biopic) I believe he has chosen his theme in praise. A large part of this film's success is its consistent focus on some consistent themes of Charles's life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his likes and credentials, his addiction and criminal complexity, his musical talents, and his deep seated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is portrayed as a man struggling boldly against an army of private demons. When I was on the football game TV on Sunday night, I learned more about my old turntable with my dad in my living room on Sunday night than I did. And "ray" did not contain any sugar coating. The theme is forwarded with power and human dignity. These themes create a unified play that extend the length of its long and enlightened life. The power of these themes, strong script and guidance, music and acting have made me the most enjoyable and growing biography film. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
