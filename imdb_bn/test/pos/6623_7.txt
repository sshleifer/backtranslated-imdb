This movie is interviewed by almost all Z-Boys (unknown to Chris Cahill), the most notable bad ass Tony Alva and J. Adams, the youngest, who think the talent (along with Peralta) has crossed the rest of the group. . The team (and Dogatown Shop) founder, Surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Angle and Craig Steelet have interviews. While commenting on the influences of Sky Boarding, Tony Hawk (apparently), Ian McKay (Fugazi), and Henry Rollins, who were young children of 70th children, have also been interviewed by the views of the Scottish Board (sketchboarding documentaries explaining the whole other context in previous years). <br /> <br /> It really shows you what the Dagoutine team was and how they formed, but why their style not only changed skateboarding techniques (pool skating became popular and thus they gave way to skating), but the game is easier (Though not in today's extreme commerciality) it was more than just the fastest fad that the surfing kids It was like, those who needed to spend their time in the morning and finally skateboarding. Rass Howell and Allan Gustand's days were as long as Dogton, at least through the propaganda of their skate team, created new generation of scripts. Because Dagowna received all the attention, they were able to push skating in the next step. <br /> <br /> It's a great documentary to keep together, though Stacy Parata always knew how to do this.
