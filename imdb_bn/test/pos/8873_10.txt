Hitako is an obvious spin, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny Davito) brings unexpected life: Larry's former wife has become rich by publishing a book written by her, and Owen's bizarre mother is fantastic. When Larry tells Oven to calm down with "train strangers", then Owen is thought to be able to kill Chris Cross like the movie. And like in the movie, Larry thinks this is a joke, but Owen's serious. <br /> <br /> I do not know how they come up with the idea of ​​"Train to Womens", but it's a ridiculous movie. This is not a dull moment. And that last was a hoot. Crystal and Davito are the best of them, and Anne Ramsey "Gianis" as she is here as a hag. A modern classic.
