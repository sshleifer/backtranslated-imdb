Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a good job in propagating a story based on a realistic basis. You do not have to like to play golf praising the story of a man struggling to overcome the unique. This can be based on a game or any situation involving only a contest, although it can only be related to golf. The only problem in my story is that I liked to look deeper into each of the main characters, esp. Mr. Umit It is frustrating for Mr. Francis Wyamat to be an ideal young man of his time, America of the century, where the "line of class" is well illustrated and disappointed for anyone trying to stay permanently in his "class". I did a bit of historical research and had answered my biggest question, my satisfaction. Although the picture is slightly different than the illustrated images, I came to feel the content. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I believe you too will be.
