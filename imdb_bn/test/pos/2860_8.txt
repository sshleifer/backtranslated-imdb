Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. I guess we all know that the characters in the reality show are not real, which you can not explain in any way that it is not just actor and real person. <br /> <br /> 'nurse betty' is not always a nurse at all. In real life, she is an ordinary housewife who works at the diner. To escape from the problems of his terrible husband and his sad life, he became a very dedicated fan of a soap opera. After being witness to her husband's murder, she goes into any kind of shock and she lost all the rigidity of reality. She thinks she is in love with soap opera, one of the characters of a doctor and decided that she will meet her and start a family with him. Hitman thinks he knows a lot and behind him to kill him. <br /> <br /> As I said, the matter is quite well known (if you go out of professional Hitman and its murder) and the movie was fun. The story is well directed and actors have done fine. I always like to watch while watching a comedy. I give it a 7.5 / 10.
