This is an incredibly fun action / exploitation 80s rock. Charles Branson Paul Kiri rules as Villains are cheerfully bad. Jimmy Page's soundtrack is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill and Ted Bill) is great as one of the street punks who are broken by bronze and crew. Sailor? Oh, those violent people, who are teamed up with Brunson to win back the streets. The whole film is enjoyable, with the last half-hour or non-stop action and Mahmood blasts. 9/10
