My only problem with the Curse of the Wear-Rabitt is that the film does not take time for Wallace and Gromit to not properly identify small film in the park. Curiously, "a closed shave" manages to do this for some time. Yet, I love seeing boys returning to work and love all new characters, people and otherwise. I especially like Skype's voice as Ralph Fiennes as the Victor Quartermain. It's interesting to watch the big screen series. The craftsman with the soil character really stands. This is a hoot, and great for the whole family! I bought very few DVDs but all of my Walls and Gromits are there and will gladly add it.
