After 18 months of releasing this B & W film, my French village had reached the Spartan movie house. On that day, our full-length comedy fare was appreciated by Denmark (blue-pop someone?), So this movie was hit like a thunderbolt - it was me crying helplessly, ROTFL which we now keep. Okay, so some scenes Gag was actually recycled 'Vicky' in Voodville, but at that time what was the 'Charming Boy with Bronze Cheek'? In any case, my favorite scenes were Jerry's unique brand like boxing boxing. <br /> <br /> Fifty years later, I still continue to "watch the sailors." Approved, without nostalgia elements it would probably be another matching-to-cat comedy. But then, another film that throws me more helplessly, Spike Jones is coming out of "Fireman Save My My Child", it seems now that some of the Orchestra bits and Doodle Wavy scenes have been omitted from the scene. Martin and Louis products must have some special components to stay stable. I have eight of these ten at least ten.
