Recent revisions of the French crime film (original title 'The Riffey Chase Les Hammes'), with a 20-minute silent jewel list sequence, now comes in the US with a great new collection of criteria for quality subtitles. And some extra. Zeus Dasin was an American (Julius Dasin in Middleton Connecticut) who became Carlliest because he was forced to make films in Europe. The Riffei was well-publicized in the United States and did well in the Art House. Later, Dasin performed his 'Green On Sunday' (1960) in America with his wife, Greek actress and political activist Melina Marakouri. (Greece again became glamorized and popular with Mihalis Kakogianisse's 1964 'Jurba the Greek' Anthony Quinn for Americans and others, which was even a major hit in Cairo.) The new Riffey DVD included a recent interview with Dasin. I did not realize earlier that one of the main robbers was played by Cesar The Milaniges, Dasine, who became the original actor unavailable. He is one of the most memorable characters, a French Italian safe cracker who is not French. <br /> <br /> Although the classic French film Nir has all the touches - but the well-lit black and white evening world, shiny black cars, men's in suitcases, nightclub scenes, dramatically portrayed and club with titles, little faces, club faces and galves Hand or face - I do not think it's a style as the atmosphere of the atmospheric or quite distinct Melville. But there is messenger robbery, which still stands as Tour de Force. It goes like watch, with a fine sense of teamwork between robbers and bandits. Some nosy policemen are dealt with efficiently. When they go home and distribute the loot, they quickly go wrong when a player becomes a runaway and gives a dam's ring with a million dollar bunglow. Is there a violent movie that has lived happily afterwards? <br /> <br /> This is a special place guaranteed unaccounted hit sequence, and Dasin, who is an American dancer and an American director of external careers, is eligible for complete credit. He adopted a novel, so he is going to reject the conventional, and added some special elements which is especially this. Eventually, he could not adapt: ​​he needed a lot of money. Jean Surreys, who played Tony Le Stefanoise in the lead role, was an actor without the fate of his fame. Perfect for the role of her chic face. He later headed to Deccan's Hugh My Must Myself (1957), which used to be French actress in Greece for a political story. 'Topkpi' is a somewhat frustrating movie in the copper film of 1964 (comparatively more than 'rififf') which also has US distribution. It has a good setting, but it's gone, all have been bland and bright and prettified. Dasin's Post-Hollywood Ovev's 'On Never Sunday' popular theme songs and charismatic heroin including popular themes (and ears won the best films in 1960); Political choice 'Who will die?' The choice of 'rififf' style Marcouri and Tony Parkins (1962), with an extraordinary piece of his 'Fida' Old-fashioned Hollywood artists will avoid these and enjoy early films of Dasin, including a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947); A Police Blank 'The Nogue City' (1948); And two hard-core characters, 'Theways Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally I love French silent and non-silent spinxs of America better than the original elements of the original American source - so my long lasting attraction with 'rififf'. But Desin is rather unique in making Hollywood a silent example of fifty years of French Derivatives after going to Paris without being silent.
