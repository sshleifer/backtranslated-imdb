Wesley Snipes is half as full blade, half of the people known in Dhaka, were cast as semi-vampires. He has all his strength and his only weakness is thirst for blood. Since he was involved with Whistler (Chris Christopherson), he has hunted vampires living among the dwellers of ours for hundreds of years, but Almighty God Deccan Frost (Stephen Dorof) is tired of being tired of people who are tired of blood Plan to wake the god and take control of the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, funded and directed; The exhibitor has an exciting ride from the beginning to confirm. Packed with great war sequences and sticky dialogue, Blade is certainly more than arrogant, but it clearly distributes it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
