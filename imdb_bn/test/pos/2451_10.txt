I have to agree with previous author's comments about excellent performance and plot. This movie has started showing accidentally ... (Click to see if something was good by clicking the channel on the lazy Sunday afternoon) ... and it was made by Martin Shane and Emilio Estevez. How nice! Git Wrench! Humor (Everyone always admired Martin Shane), but was especially impressed with Emilio! Acting and instructing works excellent ... simply fantastic! So why did not you hear this movie before? I have to spread the news.
