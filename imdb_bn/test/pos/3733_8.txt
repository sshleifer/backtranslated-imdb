I'm a man, so I was very hesitant to see the movie because I know Richard Gear likes to stay in Tier Zerker's film. I would rather see action / adventure / science fai. I was right, the course of the movie is a tier jacquer. Diane works like a billionaire several times, but they bring it around and it works. The girl had a stressed couple with huge attitudes, so you started out of her hat. The film is very predictable, but for recreational purposes, it was a wonderful composition. Rent it, see if you do not run a tear. If you like the notebook, you will like it. The beach scene is shot immaculately. Although hurricane scenes were a slightly closing order, it was still a bit intense to respond.
