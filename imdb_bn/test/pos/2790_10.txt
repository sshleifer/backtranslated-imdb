This year my favorite film. Great characters and intrigues, and the direction and editing were smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the few years after six years of foreign-graduate students set in Barcelona. Culture and language conflict but intertwine the heart and life. Hollywood's main role was never thrown, but he carried the whole part. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and correct. There were two notable scenes, the measurements were really inspired. The film is emotional, and last ten minutes can be spent, but it was surprisingly entertaining. <br /> <br /> I did not see it around, but I saw Audrey Toru. His role was small in the second or third bill, and was outshined by other other characters. I wanted more films like this. It seems to be the Big Chill or the Breakfast Club. Do not start this movie late if you plan to go to bed through 1/2 ways.
