Barney "thought" about what you did not want to hear from my priscular "notion" that show that as they did, then I would have worried. What 2 or 3 years old actually gets all of that color and singing whatever it is all about. Those of you who say that they are going to Berne eat junk food, and as well as recommending St. that "cookie giant" that he eats, but I did not see anyone commenting. I am happy that sesame is a good educational event but Barney is not as serious as a show for fun if you do not like watching your child's TV and you are worried about not worrying about them, then you should not push them in front of TV Because they are all fake actors fake actors fraud so why do not you take your fake brain and it If you have problems, then stop the fake television program for kids and play with them and teach them that you do not want them to learn what they want. Big Birid or Bart and Arnie or Barney are those people who see all the shows. And becomes fine.
