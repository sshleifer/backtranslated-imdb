I saw this movie on a big screen several months ago. I do not know what I can expect properly, and for the first ten minutes I was afraid that I could not enjoy this movie. It started very slowly, in silence and almost incompatibility, which was quite bad and impossible to read a lesser title. <br /> <br /> But I'm certainly sorry to leave it watching. It's one of the most beautiful Bergman movies I've seen, people at the same time, ruthless and mentally so convincing. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw the actors' so wonderful game, face them with a sharpness: the interpretation of Live Olman is unforgettable, and Sido is excellent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, this cool, violent And in strong movies there is a wonderful people's depth that creates strong relationships between men and women. A nice Bergman <br /> <br />
