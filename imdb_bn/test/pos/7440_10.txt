Hey, I think this movie was great and it had great graphics and I was glad they used the ultimate fantasy. 7 I think the game I played well anyway is a great movie and I like it. They might make another one they will use Final Fantasy 7 again or the Final Fantasy 10. There are fantastic surprises from both: Tyler Shanna Hope you can email me if you have any other information. Anyone else reading this for the people I'm suggesting you see this movie is animated but it looks quite realistic and it's got fantastic fighting scenes that I do not see a movie fight for a long time. The final Fantasy 7 game is not really good graphics but it's really fun and challenging
