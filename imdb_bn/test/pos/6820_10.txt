The youth among us is a pitch-perfect gem. I saw this stunning short this year's 2005 Sundance Festival. The story took me to a deeply transformed ride. Directed by Joshua Gorener and Lucas Hassan, Directed by Joshua Leonard, art direction, painting, score - each element was true for the bone. The only hope that this extraordinary and stimulating film is initiated for this is better than the gifted director. <br /> <br /> Just like a small movie is shown before a feature of Sun's, the commercial movie theaters use the same format as the past. Small skills like the youth among us can reach the larger audience in this way if it is surprising.
