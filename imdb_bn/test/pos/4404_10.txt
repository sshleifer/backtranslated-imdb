Please kindly thank you for Coen Brothers. Their success has brought their big budget, but their creativity does not save them. I've been planning to show another movie, but it was sold so I went this one instead. After the start of time, I saw what movie I was there. I was surprised by more than one way. This movie is lovely, but they do not just have the cheap joke to get laugh. The author has brightly delivered brightly, and George Clooney (after that, nobody can say that he is just a pretty face) and the rest cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the ODC. Last time I saw a movie which was not this trick. I have seen others that I will be described as beautiful, fascinating, funny and charming, all of which are described as "Oh brothers", but this movie reminds me of the old Sweenfield episode where all the concubines gather together. You can think that you are building some of their journey, but you can not say what. And Coen's brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not frustrating. It's wonderful, and without wearing the story, clearly close all loose ends up.
