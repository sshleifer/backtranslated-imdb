This concert concert type which only comes every 20 years or so, Madonna Confessions of a dance floor era must be remembered as one of the high points of her career. He is 48 and he only looks divine, he keeps almost with the dancer that almost 20 years his junior. I am very happy that all songs are sung live, which is good because he really listens to good life. Every song was so unique, where stunning visuals. The performance of 'Live to Ball' was fantastic and made me stand out, 'Isaac' was exotic and fantastic and political symbol, Arabic horn, American Eagle was free. I especially like the rockin performance of 'I Love New York', I was almost in my lounge room and I was happy when his critics asked George Bouches to suck. And then again I was influenced by the 70's inspired music (inferno remix). This spectacular disentant concert created a fan from me. Ray: High Capital H.
