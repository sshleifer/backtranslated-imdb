Wow, I love this movie, this picture was filled with plot twists, good acting, great stories, and a wonderful ending. This movie was not too poor to be completely honest, but it was some of the Gore, but it was more psychologically. I read it on the Internet: The film shot $ 3,000 in 8 days. Amazing !!! For anyone who wants to create and think about this great movie. What starts as a terrorist thriller slowly turns some more twisted, even a bit more sinister transformed. With the exception of plot point, I can not say that this film has exceeded my expectations
