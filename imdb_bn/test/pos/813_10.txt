This will be the most fun movie I've ever seen. An ordinary family is keeping everything behind the bus in the desert. When both mother and father lose jobs, they do not mention their bathtub has green keys. They decided on the interest of moving Oregon to their families. Once everything goes wrong. Let's appreciate this movie in an interesting cast of characters. Including a young Molly Ringwald, this is a movie I would definetly recommend.
