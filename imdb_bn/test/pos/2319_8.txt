The first few minutes of this movie does not judge it! For me, it's not funny until they're on the sub-board, and those ridiculous letters begin to be in jail. I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia and shared with my "different" sailors - even I got married! Most of my favorite movies are not fun, funny, not dependent on sex or violence, and when I see them, it's fun. Groundgay Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Persepp is still interesting after learning about the conversation by heart. Her "God I Love This Job!" With Kelsey Grammar was sincere, genuine and loving. Rob Schneider is shallow as the crew comes back to annoy him. I'm still in the shape of the fishing boat that is beside the Subam! I can see why the people who live this life will keep watch on Uh-o, but it is not a documentary after a comedy and I like it!
