I recently discovered this fantastic series and I just do not seem to get enough of PI to return to Garner's back. Shows consistently show excellent levels of writing and hidden episodes. <br /> <br /> This episode, Slate of Hand, is a little different. Make a lot of humor on Rockford for more serious change, because he is looking for his missing girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The mystery is great and it is enough to reveal. It is based on a book (the name can not be remembered) and it can be easily extended to a feature lengthy mountain. Garner excels here as Rockford became tough and really means business. It sounds like a "silent" in all the ways, echoing dark light and overall moods 40 and 50 of the big dark thrillers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A really good episode of a class series. Easily a 10 claims.
