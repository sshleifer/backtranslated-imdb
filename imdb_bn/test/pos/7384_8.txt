I really liked this movie. I did it very well. Character traits were wonderfully done as characteristic of interaction. The actor was definitely credible. The plot was very deep and playful. Although its parts are a bit slow and sometimes a bit annoying, it must certainly be viewed several times. Chemistry in three major actors was great. If you do not want to see it for it, then see it for at least the characters in the plays. I mean, the whole thing was "Oh!" It was like I could look away. The whole movie attracted my attention and even made me interested through slow parts. I like this movie and almost everything about it I love it till the end because it was very funny and, if you watch the movie a second time, it makes perfect sense. But I'm not spoiling anything.
