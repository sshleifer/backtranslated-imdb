This show is really Broadway American Idol. It's singing, the British Guy, a man who is sometimes beautiful and a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Of course it is different, because there are singing and dance there and there are some acting (we just do not see anything played). <br /> <br /> I gave this program 7 because there are some tweaks that I know that many people (with me) know that they are working for the show. The first thing that needs to be really changed is that the judge decides to go home. I know they want to find Danny and Sandy right, but America can decide who is at home. There is really no point in singing. The lowest voting person usually goes to any country. Another thing that I want to change really works on the show. What is Broadway without acting? Last thing that needs to be changed is to sing the last song in the last man. Removed Danny always sings the same song and removed Sandy always singing the same exit song. As they sing songs every week, those songs will eventually become annoying. <br /> <br /> I do not want to be a fan of film, but Greece, but for some reason I'm scared. These shows are very underrated. It has many memorable performances and moments.
