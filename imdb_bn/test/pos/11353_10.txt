This film is recommended as one of the best love stories I've ever called. And I'm a huge fan of love, I bought a ticket and I'm sitting in the theater. After 90 minutes I was not frustrated except for the theater and the theme was considered to be the only positive thing of the film. I was scared myself in the story that two people might love each other but never fear it to work. I just could not overcome language barriers and cultural barriers. The second time I was running in it ... I was in a different mood, and there was no hope ... and I had patience, there was a more patient mind to watch the film ... and as soon as I opened my eyes, I discovered love. Picture Beauty I went out of language and love story and saw the acting (even for a moment I did not act!) And saw the film's screenplay. For the first time I heard the definition of a film, I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs and a movie that matches this description. Almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with music ... and light effects ... the result is just a great composition! And a wonderful composition is just something that your movies should have in collection.
