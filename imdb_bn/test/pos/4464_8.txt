Do not spoil an accident before Phulchi (and, in fact, by storyline, well ...) movies - and although Phulasi is not known for the usual "vampire" - it is still a very unique and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders is happening. Some racist characters involved in the investigation - as suspects or who investigate "help" (or in some cases both) - city police forces, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich pre-drug addict, a young pastor and his mother, an old People are magical and their ladies love, mentally challenged city dwellers, and deaf / silent little girls. Until these real killers are published, these people are involved in the conspiracy to engage with the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Do not make a copy of a "classical" gaelo or a common hilarious picture. Although it holds both elements - it is much more than an old-fashioned murder mystery, with a few scenes of dark topics and graphic violence (though some are not as hard as the posterity's posture). This is a good writing that most of the twists that I guess at the end. Recommendations for fans of ghazal / murder-mystery, or looking for some of the non-splatter movies of Phulchi - but do not be frustrated, it is still not more than neutral violence and slavery fate. Some children may be stopped by the murder, and there is a strange habit of hitting very young boys in a major female character, which is equally annoying - but if such a thing does not bother you, definitely give it a look. 8.5 / 10
