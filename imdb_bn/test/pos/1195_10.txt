Milos Forman's main HAIR is a perfect film that is not actually published in the United States, especially in this country, by changing it. One of the film plots is used in other films that come after hair, for example, in American graffiti, etc. This is an original story with a generational depression touch. The characters of the film were like "cells" in the "body" that all change. Overall, a very good film, though perhaps a little underrated. Annie Golden's role was small but she played very well. It was the picture that implemented the implementation of John Savage as an actor. A Chicago member played his role well, though it was a minor role.
