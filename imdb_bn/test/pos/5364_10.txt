A nice movie for those who just want to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Switch of Scotland. Actually, the film takes you on a journey of love into spectacular philosophy. Castes are 'clothed' for the parts they play, so there is no funny dress or narrow hair in the movie where acting is supernatural, great and under the earth. Each character is a definite time for the island to provide the strong symbol of the life, beliefs and culture of those who have even the lowest drop of Scottish blood ..... It will tug at the heart strings and stir the soul. Something that can be shared with family and time and time can be seen .................. a real classic, I am sure that along with one of the great movies, live forever.
