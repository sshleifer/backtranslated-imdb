The story of a young boy from AIDS, Dester (Joseph Magello), who shares his rough opposite and boyfriend (played by Brad Renefro) with his friendly friendship, is sadly sad, if you are too much soap, then your emotional "message" will drag the film With the heart in the right place. That's true, that's a suggested view. Highlight can simply be to find their friendships and keep watching hanging with each other when someone else takes them. <br /> <br /> The real story is centered on boys' AIDS - one day when something happens to a local supermarket, Dexter's eyes are detected in the Tabloid Magazine, which invented New Orleans doctor's healing. Both of them, perhaps a tad naive, made it possible to set any money possible for New Orleans. Which kind of pull me in two ways. It's a tiny heart warming and I hate Net-Peak, but I've got a coat of a pilot, spread in the prophetic sense, and a shiny coat on them, as well as works like movies. I could not escape from the idea of ​​self-invention, illness and tugging growing up looking up a travel movie about me. For example, I know they are young, but I found this a real work to believe in what I do to these boys. Prefer to eat a tequila diet of hot leaf leaves and hot tea or chocolate bars because they believe that it will fight against dangerous diseases. They have nothing to say about cross-country visits, because they do not show any legal or cruel, frightening reactions. Still the wrong ideas, the movie conventions you come to expect, is a story that is particularly suitable for the family.
