I saw this picture when it came first, and did not know exactly what to expect. What Overlord has followed is the most enjoyable movie experience for me. Britain's Leslie Briakus (Doctor Dulilit and Wiley Wingka and Chocolate Factory fame and make his mark in the Broadway musical scene) is a collection of songs and songs from music and extraordinary collections by Williams. There is not a bad song in the whole picture. Plus, most of the cinematography, costume design and the place of filming that I have never seen. Not to mention the performance of Academy Award nominated by Peter O'Toole, and my opinion, notably mentioning strong performance by Petula Clark. Now, Peter is not the same fit as a singer of Petrelar, he still drives his songs to sellers to the audience, and since that's all about it. This is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by James Hilton, and the upcoming generation demands to be treasured. I recommend this film for watching the family, although most men would consider this a 'chick' flick. But if you really want a great movie musical, then this picture is for you. But the standby box of CleanX is just as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure.
