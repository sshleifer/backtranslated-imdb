The last and eight-month movie "Gek nu Yu Punyo" (Cliffe Panoo of the Sea) is an excellent fun and fantastic look at the time of Hya Miyazaki's studio gossip. While designing the Disney / Pixar CGI masterpiece, the animation of the film's animation takes place, it seems that Miyazaki relies on traditional hand-shaped animation to tell its charming and playful stories that it is refreshing and comforting. <br /> <br /> This story revolves around friendships of children that encounter a strange sea sprite / goldfish and a strange excuse to see the child's child. Human child, Sosuke (Dooe Hiroki) is a small port town in South Japan (based on Seto Island) in a small house on an arch, where he lives with his younger mother, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke kinky goldfish takes on the day care / nursing center that works the name "Ponyo" and Lisa. Ponio is definitely not your ideal goldfish, and soon after some blood samples from Sateuk's finger cuts human mentality and Ham's have hunger for meat and begin to accept it. However, at the beginning of a bond development in Sosuke and Ponio, Ponyo was brought back from his father, Fujimoto (Tokoroz Jogi) who is a former man who rejected the patronage and is now trying to collect and the magician from the sea Evolix develops that helps to repair and revitalize the Earth's oceans. <br /> <br /> The desire to become a human has become so powerful that Fujimoto can not contain him and he goes back to see more people's face and his water breaks from the world's home and Sosuke. <br /> <br /> During his break, Ponyo freely released Fujimotra's wizard Elixir's cache, which freeze all kinds of magic sea creatures causing a violent storm in the surrounding seas of the city. Encouraged to solve Pioneer's rebellion, he urged for the help of his beautiful wife, Panoeira's mother - water basic, mother / lady of the sea (Amami Yuki). Like her past films, Miyazaki's "Gekku You You Pione" touches ecosystems and various environmental themes, this time focusing on the health and living conditions of the ocean of the world. As soon as Panoeu was leaking under the sea, Panoe faced a face-to-face confrontation with the ship. One understands the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto, who has tried to repair the loss of its life in the ocean area, but it is still finding a difficult and almost fruitless effort. <br /> <br /> It is not enough This wonderful animation will be mentioned in this movie. At times it is wicked and humiliating but at the same time charming and weird. Miyazaki apparently wanted to catch a child's imagination and style. The art style has the appearance of painted crayon / pencil and is wonderful colorful and fanciful. It often lives like a children's color book. <br /> <br /> Child actors Nara Urea and Doi Hiroki do good work in Ponio and Sosuke. They bring adorable rituals to their role. Nora urea, especially in the beautiful color of Piano, that Doyir Sasu falls for the magician girl. Modern mother of Sosuk, in her role like Lisa, the daughter / model of the former campaign and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Sachin Nataku, Salovilla) is very good. I was a little confused by her character first because I first thought she was Sosuke's big sister. It also did not help to mention Sosuke as "Lisa" instead of his mother, but I think it is probably a sign of time and an indicator of modern Japanese family (Anime series Crane Shinkan, Shinosuke also mentioned his mother's first name). <br /> <br /> The 80-second Comedian Toko Jogi sounds completely different as a serious Fujimoto but wisely does not play his role. Although we do not know much about his character, former pro-baseball player and actor Nagassima Kazushija (who sang Sosuk's father Kochi) also provided some excellent voice work. The opening theme of Japan's Swapan Masako Haiyashi, "Umi no Okasan" is simply beautiful and attractive. On the contrary, Fujimaki Fujiwoka and Nujomi Oahashi "Gek No Yu Panoo" theme shows light and funny and pictures of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. A bright continuous soundtrack takes the word Wagnerian with the term "die wakurere". <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect but Piyo and Sasuk's refrain from the central story moments Miyazaki's superb fantastic visual takes some back seats. I wanted more time to explore the story behind Fujimatov as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> "Qiki's delivery service / Mazo no takuki bin", "Havle Moving Castle", "Princess Momonok / Momonok Himam" and "My Neveshon Totoro / Tonari Note Tutorial", "Get You You Pioneer" Miyazaki is a classic which is an extraordinary festival for the eyes. Like the modern story, the film is a continuous story of friendship and love, which must be fulfilled in the coming years.
