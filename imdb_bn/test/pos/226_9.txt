The creative team that brought us a police squad - and the cash from it - has been told in interviews that through their network communication the program will be canceled, after the first stage delivery. Basically, the show was not given any chance. Usually Hollywood. The scene apparently told the group that the problem of the show was that the viewer must see it to make the show fun; Most of the shows are presented on TV that the viewers wake up and miss a few minutes during the meal, or go to the toilet, etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > It does not use any smile-track), and the one that lives in the universe's letters, anything that can happen, is logical, as long as it was completely unbelievable; So, for example, in one episode, the surgeon has to bribe a user on a street for the operation of heart disease. <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with nude song movies, they have to be careful that there are a number of interesting divisions between shows and films. In films, Nilson made a special "adoption" method - that is, the eye is more broad when faced with unexpectedly. This does not happen in the show, where Nilssen's drein center surrounds the rest of the center - nothing seems unexpected to him. Also, there is no romance on the show and there is no parody of MTV. Finally, avoid the films that take some risks to the show; In the first episode, draggin, to "reconsider the crime", group intelligence detectives shot each other with each other at different angles - they work hard to get busy. This is actually a risky big bit, since we need to acknowledge that during the investigation of crime, the police are completely normal to kill each other, for any reason other than the exam. These kinds of things are rarely done in movies. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < There is no rush for punch). There are some inconsistencies in the film (originally "2" and "3") that do not occur at short show frames. <br /> <br /> Of course there is no doubt that cash songs (first film) are one of the great comedies of theater movie. And if you look at the TV show episode after a single episode, the dry quality of laughter can be one of the tolerances of one. <br /> <br /> No one is less, it will be beneficial to enjoy a DVD, and watch a episode for several weeks - if there is a smile, someone claims, medicinal value, seeing this show is good for your health.
