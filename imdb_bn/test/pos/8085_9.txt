Yes, I am emotional, and yes, I love the movie where the kids are good people. True, Klatret√∏sen has some logical or even conspiracy shortcomings. The great acting of these kids (the role of Julius's first film!) And the character of a Dagma movie (I liked this kind of cinematografic industry long before Dogma; from Herz's 'Hargus Aus Glass') Well, I screamed for the last fifteen minutes, a higher tear factor than Bobby's or moving around me for the house.
