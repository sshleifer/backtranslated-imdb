A movie is visually graceful but interesting mainly conspiracy. The film highlights the development of a quarrel with the main actor's intimate feelings. Max lived in New York for two years and he wanted to marry a girl there, he returned to Paris, and unexpectedly met his ex-girlfriend, whom he still loved, but eventually he loves most his best friend. Non-linear descriptions are thus quite a lot of flashbacks and each part is well presented. Max's three women have met some of our symbols that we must follow even though there is no clear picture about the underlying motivation. He needs his fiance rather than his needs and then we can fully see any loyalty. She gives him no love but only stability. True love is not found in its relationship with a former lover. Just a fantasy for her escape - many romantic she did for her but almost nothing seems remarkable. Indeed, one of Max's best friends to animate his life is his best friend. The balance achieved at the end is not the same as the primary balance, because Max understands more about his intrinsic feelings. The nonlinear structure makes the progress of search more complex. "Paul Fiction" is not equally impressive, but "The Apartment" seems to be more natural. Max is the only character who does not cross transformation and is actually describing interesting Roman Boehing. Good cinematography makes him and Monica Bellucci look very nice. Today's love is a good commentary and undoubtedly a valuable film. <br /> <br />
