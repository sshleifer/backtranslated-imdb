I recently saw this movie hoping to see the exact screenplay of the 20th Century Bloody War. What I expected and got so much more Just thought I came across this movie by luck, even I was not even listening about it. It is a German film produced in 1993, so I think it's amazing that it is not completely unknown to modern American listeners. It's a shameful reason, it's a really great movie, I boldly say that if it's not good then Platoon, Flower Metal Jacket, Apocalypse, and all the front in the West are cool. Which is all an economic war film <br /> <br /> 1942: World War II is fully accumulated. Nazi Germany runs parts of Myanland Europe and North Africa, Adolf Hitler ordered the entire scale attack of the Soviet Union. Finally, it is a deadly step to defeat Nazi Germany. The attack continued in the initial phase and the German army conquered the greater part of the Soviet region, but an important battle took place in Stilindraad, which contained a great symbolic and strategic value. War soon became a nightmare of the epic proportions, in a nightmare of fighting both the German and Russian soldiers. At the time of taking the city, the Germans suddenly attacked the Russians, who deployed the whole German army in Stalingrad. To make matters even worse, the Russians create incredible pain for the winter Germans. This whole war is being watched by the eyes of a few German German soldiers who do not just fight the Russians and the cold winter conditions, but also against their own simplest officials who also show little respect for medals and honor and generals. Average foot soldier <br /> <br /> This image is going to joke for me for a while. The German soldiers who are watching the film are so young and naive, their humanity and the proximity are separated from them and you apologize because their giant nazi is not often portrayed in the film. What they were fighting was not important anymore, and what they believed was isolated and after a terrible battle against Russians in Stalinad, we saw them getting worse with the winter sunset, many of which could die. War and winter scenes were like a terrific nightmare, but it also seemed real. It is amazing, at first we saw the whip of the main man in their life, and in the end, they tear all of their previous slit shoots. After witnessing so much murder, these men lived their lives, it was really sad. Finally, a moment of hope when they betrayed Hitler, he eventually abandoned this man to a terrible death, which left the warring people to kill one of Hitler's offense only by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war film raises the horrors of the war and how does this movie. The battle for the tractor factory sequence is the closest thing to the Earth's Hell, but what was really the war for Stalingrad? German and Russian soldiers were portrayed with humanity, it was only bad apple (especially toward the German side) that destroyed men. The bottom line is this movie is amazing because we see men's physical and psychological breakdown during the war. We all had our limitations and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battles of our time. The average foot soldier at Stalinager was what was beyond imagination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
