It has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerners I've seen. Having a soft spot for the article (Western ?? or they were, since they are never made? Morals are often played by insulting intellectual advocates), I bought the DVD, the scene was invisible, because I was working on William S. Hart's work Enough to read, which he wrote and directed). My interest should be strengthened and at least one of my videos should be collected. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I approached the actual visit with some trepidation. My previous experience with the silent movie "Classic" was left to leave feeling in me. Chanir's Phantom of the Opera, a nation born of Griffith and Fairbank's 'Zorro Mark' were penalized, but as an honor, nobody often expected anyone as good. They are either too long, or very dramatic, or both. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Black Hearing (played by Heart), a notoriously successful outland gang leader, thinks the time has come for the group to be disconnected before the fate ends. However, he opposes his Chief Lieutenant Jordan, who takes them all to the end with a huge wealth commitment, but takes them into a trap that he is pure. Everybody is killed, who is detained without the daring. When his prisoner recognized him as a man who once warned the soldiers and the people around the oncoming attack, they let him run away. Free, he tried to find honest work but must be mastered and laugh and eventually stole again for survival. Soon, he is not just by the sheriff's animal but Jordan (now rich in his reward money) and his chicken follower. His flight took him to a single mother and his younger son live in the remote cabin. After some initial misgivings, they take him to their hearts. Deering could see a chance for a new life but, with POSSE and Jordan closure, realize that this may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Heart was the first big Western star and the first inspired the reality. As one of the pioneers of filmmaking, he created several other characters and situations, which turned into the West for more than 90 years. But what keeps her movies interesting, was the ability to go out of the clinic (probably her followers did not have enough), so that the content seems to be fresh and innovative. In the toll gate these three examples illustrate this: <br /> 1) In one scene, his character shot to death by killing people in an attempt to kill Jordan, and instead killed a deaf. A next close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated. But due to frustration, he shot a man shot, until he did not harm, but he missed his target. <br /> <br /> 2) On the other hand, when he escapes from the brink, his "horse" takes the horse to a cow's hole and breaks a leg. The heart dragged his dog to pull his dog out of his pain, but before dragging the trigger, the head gave a sad, loving pat, such as farewell to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) And finally, after beating Jordan, after lifting her dead body, she came back to rescue her gun and her pistol on the ground. Before he went ahead and mounted his horse it gave a quick kick. This is a general gesture, but it shows the deep hatred that it and betrayed him and his colleagues. <br /> <br /> and I love the title, toll gate. It is transformed into its inherent nature that a person can not start a new life until he is paid for his old sins. Deering's payment comes in the form of sacrifice. Today's more sophisticated audience can not be fully bought with that feeling, but if you leave it, it can still work on you. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I do not think so at all. A copy of this 1920's movie is even a miracle, since many silent film prints have been lost. If you think of it and see the film as a part of history, its visual errors are not difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> William S. Hart was born in New York in 1870 but was born in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian Sign Language. He counted Vatit Arp and Bat Masters in his friends and collected Rimington's imagination, so the West had his knowledge at the beginning. If his viewpoint seems too romantic by today's standards, it is closer to reality than the fact that the 60-60 and 70s spaghetti are closer to reality than the West and the revisionists followed. The star and his film are overdue for re-evaluation.
