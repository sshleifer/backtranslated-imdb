Sony Pictures Classic, I see you! Sony has got rights in Harry's records - you have to distribute the movie and you will basically increase the sales of its back catalog! However, this is a fabulous study of an impressive musician, sadly unknown, great story, great music, and it could be over 3 hours and I liked it more. Santa Monica saw it at the American Sinet Mode and at the Robbers Festival in its theater, where it played in a packed house. They were turning the people off the door! I went through a number of Mads and Robbers Festival films, and I can assure you that no other film has come near the sale, but only the people away. Watch it in the theater, buy a DVD, and make sure that some slow organization [cough * Sony cough *] likes it ASAP!
