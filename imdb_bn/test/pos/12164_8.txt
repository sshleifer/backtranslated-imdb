I have never talked about six British comedy groups The Crazy Gang (or even still not seen), but their contemporaries Will Hey and Arthur Askey - and especially Graham Greene's fridge lights ("The most fun English movie ever built ... it's the latest of security And compare to the general ") - I have received this network and the following movie Gossbags (1941; see below) Jump into the bones of R2 DVDs. Which was officially released with no fanfare at the beginning of this year. <br /> <br /> A British made western is a rareness, but a British western spoof is still rare (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] still 25 years away). Incidentally, going back to the silent classics mentioned by Greene, this film seems to me more explicitly in Golf Russian (1925) and Way Out West (1937). In addition, it is the "Snow White and the Seven Darefs" fairy-tale (which is immortalized on the screen through Walt Disney's animated masterwork), and where the seventh member is an ancient comic and frequent Will He Fife Moore Marriott; The gang actually calls the beautiful heroine Aylin Bell with the full name, and there are surprising sequences with six of them, preparing to bed and cook Darfes's song from Disney movies! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Jim Bacchus is looking somewhat like this), straight people Chesny Allen and Mitchcheid, Schwicky-videed Teddy Knox; However, Charlie Knutton was often upset - as he always used to pick others. Yet, it's Marriott who stole the movie from his first scene - where he transformed every officer into a ghost movie in a ghostly theater! <br/> <br /> OUR routine between Flanggan and Allen is really Abbott and Costello's famous "Who's On Fast?" (Film, in fact, hinges) for the sake of his humorous phrase - which does not necessarily travel, especially at this moment). Yet, there are a number of hilarious sequences - some of them even bring tears to my eyes: Initially the Ganges violated the band of angry lenders; They hit Yukon after wearing their clothes like Indians; To enrich the Ganges silver with the same piece of gold; They all break Maritut's mask for sleeping (a hazard which can be invented by Marcus Bros.), the sequence of sunny shades of Doc Soup [1933]. Spot theater sketch that makes fun at Hello Molodrum; When followed by villains, surreal moment, the gang climbs a staircase that is part of the scenery painted in a theater; And especially at the end, when a group of singing stood up to the Ganges Rescue at the Police Galp Mountain (though being increasingly concerned by the Ranger hero) <br /> <br /> Skinny soundtrack and abstract nature have sometimes been difficult for gags for me to get all the jokes - in this case the subtitles will certainly be welcomed. Craig Gang has only made five films - the first two have also been well-respected, Life for For the Sound (1937) and Alf Bowon Eflot (1938), and a lot of reunion (though Allen has been replaced by this illness, and replaced by Eddie Gray) E. A. Cycrass (1960; operated by the Well Guests), incidentally, I mentioned beforehand with Gong Films as Hey and Some of Askey's vehicles Writing with Buying!).
