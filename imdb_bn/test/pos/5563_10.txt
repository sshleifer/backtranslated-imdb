One of the greatest crimes against Saifai Television was the cancellation of Persian. One of the best texts, best performances and one of the best shows, to satisfy AirWebs, has set new standards for Science fai television. Once the flashships, the highest rating, the child's channel showcase of the study, explains why it explains why Bofi, Tremors: series and even Stargate: SG-1 explains why. Yes, even Buffy. But I'll save my Buffy bashing for another time. Farscape is badly treated by the Saifee Channel, constantly tossed around the schedule, rarely shown reruns and is not really notified. However, if the show is canceled, those who are involved to listen show the show (even Henson CEO CEO Brian Henson) and want to bring. There is a massive fan based movement brought back to the show. The overall thing is looking away from the dark, and hopefully, fans will get their season 5.
