Years ago, I read the book 'A Macquina'. I again read this little book again, I was not even more impressed by the author's imagination and the prosperity of the Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I knew about movies, I was really afraid that one spoils one of my favorite books! Well, happily, my fears were irrational and the film is such an amazing and exquisite piece of art. <br /> <br /> I can not remember any movie that can bring tears in my eyes due to the beauty of it. Text's I can not even remember the powerful performance of Gustavo Falcon. <br /> <br /> You can see how big Karin loves her. You understand that he moved to the mountain and did something for this love. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, see the children in your eyes, fool yourself!
