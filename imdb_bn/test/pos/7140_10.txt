This is a fact more. Special in the afternoon There is very good writing at a very low price if you search for it. Take for example cat mates / scouts. It was not a comic book it was supposed to be a comic book. Comic art (as well as filmmakers) missed the boat. One at least knows really great movie. John Sayes is a great script but a strong point of acting is good as well. Perhaps the best "super hero" film I've ever seen Short on special effects but short credibility. This one is the keeper. I have never seen a DVD of this movie but I own a VHS version. Good hunting
