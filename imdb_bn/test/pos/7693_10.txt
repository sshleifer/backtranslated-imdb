It was incredible cast, music, songs, stories, etc. This is a tragedy that can be available to generations after generations of proud family (Gershwin or Priming) generation. I wanted to see all of my life again. I found this site and read it why it was not found. Shame on this family for their family. My wife is from Germany and she has not seen the movie. Not my kids or my grandchildren. It is tragic that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to watch. These stars, how they stop such proud, self-important, arrogant and foolish decisions to ban the generation from this movie's enjoyment, this performance, this music! Release the video and judge them and judge the world!
