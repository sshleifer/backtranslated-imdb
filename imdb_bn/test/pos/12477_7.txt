Will we take the opening shot as a weird frame ??? I guess we have it. However, two women are behind a closed umbrella, they walk upstairs to the talent organization and we go with them ... and then they will not meet again. Well, do not come out of words like piano, piano or even piano, then track over inside, La Hitchcock ??? So I think Clozot is telling us in such a supernatural way that we are following a part of the poster society: especially how he uses civic citizens like song = song to cut the song into five pieces so that the lady from genius travels. The agency is the first of all the roses, and all the way to the opening of his Vaudville debut. <br /> <br /> After the illiterate observer about a harmful description of the lethal knee injury of the defeated country. And no one has ever been able to cope with a little hatred compared to Clujot. In fact, very bad he did not try to break the cortex. The first few minutes we see almost everything makes us so little curious. Okay, okay, I'm overtaking fairly, let's get stuck for the general feeling of many pictures. Carefully look, and you will even see one of the police to pick up his nose. And nobody ever made any films. Then a major nose appeared in front of the photographer Leanne in front of the chief superintendent of Lebanon, and he noticed that he did not embrace any eye or raise his eyebrows. <br /> <br /> All these things are seemingly atoning immensely, most likely, until you can visually smell each view and see and feel it. <br /> <br /> For the other part of the film, others here cover them much more detail than them. But forget about the mystery here: this is the final MacGuffin. Clauses are interested in genuine killers, since these two women are coming out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and are not seen again. From the beginning to the end, what he wanted to do was to follow a bunch of people around, not even particularly interesting people, and tell here, look at this woman's groin and see that people have their pants all their imperfection, years and years before Tina Turner We did not need any other heroes. <br /> <br /> Even the last forced intensity is done in a detrimental part of Paris and shamefully in the apartment with silent bay walls. Only couples love to see each other through them, so that you can have opinions of two to three million people across the city, stop your fingerwork for a little while at night. <br /> <br /> Reducing fear and fear from it was just a short step to final. <br /> <br /> They do not know how to create such movies in the United States and how they are so much in France, now much less. The gesture's continuous story makes even the neorealists of Italy look like a bad psychic. Which I guess is a kind of roseline at the clock speed. <br /> <br /> This movie is very enjoyable. The only error, I think, and is indicated by another viewer, the main woman is not right in any way. The film is filling everyone else perfectly perfectly.
