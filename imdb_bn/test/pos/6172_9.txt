I have been a dedicated IMDB inspector for several years. This movie finally forced me to write a review. <br /> <br /> I grabbed this movie with the opportunity (one morning I had the credit to scroll past scrolling while opening my TV). I've enjoyed this movie for a great many reasons, all of which are well covered by other critics - Moods, forgotten history of Czech pilots, fine draw of helpful characters, animosity of main characters, and people during the first war scene. <br /> <br /> But the element of "dark blue world" really stood, especially during the war (and it was a good thing!) Dramatic effects were lacking. Because the pilots were flying in the war, there was no musical score with them, no aggressive shots of worried spouse / friends were contradictory, each little airplane did not give up brave patriotic cheers and was not asked to consume the incredible James Bond-Esc pilot heroism. . Instead of being allowed to stay soft during the war, these single pilot fighters are allowed to feel annoyance, fear and isolation. If we were killed in comrades, we would protect tears and revenge-based heroism in general (but pleasant to the audience). Instead, they need to be deeply focused on their own safety and intentions at that moment - instead of keeping other pilots fate and fortunately their fellow pilot. We experience the short experience of the pilot's breathing and the voices of the background of the engines, because we keep the audience, his friend silent, his friend, his friend. And then immediately 'we' need to jump back into war mode and focus on survival. <br /> <br /> Often in Hollywood we are perceived as spam-emotions which we feel and the imagination of the viewer does not leave any room. "Dark Blue World" maintains a sparrow that attracts the viewer and includes the viewer, lets us invest in the movie and uses our own thoughts and feelings to fill the gap and places. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie, good value.
