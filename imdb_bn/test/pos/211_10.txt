For a long time, network television programming, I think for the first time I "Police Squad!" I've grabbed one episode. It was completely by accident. It was at the beginning of 1982 to run the initial network in ABC. When I was flipping a lasting channel surfer and one evening dial on my TV screen suddenly "Police Squad!" Its opening credit sequence was presented. I immediately recognized it as one of my opening-favorite favorite police shows, one of the inaugural credits of Lee Marvin's "M-Squad". I stopped surfing. Then came to the headquarters, then followed the immortal Rex Hamilton Abraham Lincoln. So far I'm telling myself "what is this hack ??" Then came "special guest star" George Stanford Brown getting flattened by a plumming safe. I was hooked from that moment. This episode was "Ring of Fear / A Dangerous Assignment", with the anecdotal reference of "On Waterfront" and "Muhammad Ali", but of course the most memorable was all sight and unknown. Lee Marlin and Allan North's Lee Marvin and Paul Newall of "M-Squad" were their final parodies. "Finally", I said to myself, "A network television program is really valuable !!!" You do not know it will be canceled after a few weeks. Leave it on the network - I should know. However, I only bought six episode DVD collections and 27 years ago they were fun like today. "Naked Guns" movies were awesome, but I was really like Alan North (he was so well-educated as Ed Hawken), like Peter Lupus Nordberg (they were thinking of doing weight-shooting in that part?), And especially William Duel's "Johnny" Shoeshine guy . Great stuff.
