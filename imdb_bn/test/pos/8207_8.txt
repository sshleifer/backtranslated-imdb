It's a solid underlying small thriller, which is thrills-lots, with a great story, Sandra Bullock is awesome! All the characters are great, and I was amazed at how much I expected, just like some predictable moments, plus Sandra Bulac is just such a surprise! Jeremy Northam played a terrific villain, and I know what was the character of Bullock, because I'm the same person (I'm rarely going out), plus it has been well-formed and mostly written in part. In my opinion, should be more than 5.5, Plan Dennis Miller was surprisingly better in his small role. The view was very awesome, as Northam considered Bulkak a terrorist in his boat, and was one of my favorite moments, and I liked Chase's scenes at the Carnival, plus I liked the end because it was good, even if I've lost the Northam very quickly. I think. There are also good chase scenes as well, and it's also sometimes tricky, plus there are several frustrating moments, it's a solid underlying small thriller, which has a great thriller with a great story, Sandra Bullock is awesome, I highly recommend this one! Directions are great! Irwin Winkler does a great job! Work here with excellent camera work, good atmosphere, good angle added and keep the movie at very fast speed. Acting superb! Sandra Bullock is always amazing and amazing here, he is extremely flexible, still very weak, and I was able to feel for him because I said that I'm not like Angela, I rarely go out. Really enjoyed his work in this movie! (Bullock Rule !!!!!!!) Jeremy is as nice as Northam villain, he was sticky, unpredictable and very fierce, he was great. Dennis Miller is surprisingly okay and annoying in his small role, and some comic managed to bring relief. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 out 5
