I do not have a lot to say than this is a great finish in this story. Most people have said that there is enough plots and not just eye fat. But think about this, everything has been explained on FFVI. You can not add more plots to such a huge story, it will destroy it. They did what they could and I think it should end as a final FMV. The last war. Graphics - 10/10, absolutely amazing <br /> <br /> Story 8.5 / 10 - Do not think they can expand it. And the things they could access, I thought it was quite clever. <br /> <br /> The letter 9/10 - most of the time has already been explained in the game, but it still can not fit in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> - 10/10, because I'm a fan of metal, I like war music .. and the piano just gets there. It's a great ST and I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tile / Replay 10/10 - Every time enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Overall- 9/10 (see FF fan view) <br /> <br /> I personally think it was necessary, the fight to end all .. The plot was already in place. As action people were required as complaints. I like this movie every second. <br/> <br /> <br /> Just remember, most movies that have created a game, are directed by movie directors, I think it's pretty cool. A team of game managers .. I think I saw a good game in movies .. <br /> <br /> Thank you square, I think you did it right!
