The tragic cruise of Donald Crohert's 1968 reminiscent of the film's event, the Golden Globe unites the whole world in the yacht race. I was 13 years old, living in England. Last year, Francis Chicester (later Sir Francis; he was the nightmate for his exploitation) completed the world's first solo circamavigation. I think this is mostly because she was given time to school to see her return (Danny Black and White TV!) And then Queen's Nighting This has provoked the great outbreak of British patriotism. It all seems so diverse now. Chechster became a national hero, but in Australia he stopped halfway to bring his yacht again, so trying to move without the next logical step of the yachtsmen was stopped. It is important to remember that it was a world pre-GPS, when land contact was still quite uncertain, never remember in the middle of the ocean. Now the GPS receivers which are impressive in a chain and calculate the position of a meter somewhere in the world, it is difficult to remember and completely disappear when you can go to the ocean. As Donald Crowhart did. <br /> <br /> Some yotsom sign ups (when everyone comes back), mysterious people with Crouhart. Originally the weekend sailor, Crowhar did not have spectacular success in a previous initiative, including a carrier like British Carrier, Air Force and Electronics Entrepreneur Sales Navigation ADC. He wanted to do something bigger in his life, and he saw the next prize in the first prize of five thousand pounds (more than 100,000 dollars in today's money) and as a way to start his campaign. He signed a contract with Sponsor, which proved to be stronger than his boat, and which means the failure will make him bankrupt and soon he is ready to find himself as a popular personality with journalists. Now Brits always love taking gutsy amateur ideas to accept 'pros'. (Remember Eddie Eagle's Infinite Olympic Ski Jump Competition, and Amateur Riders who started regular Grand National Horse Race.) The public aligns him for a farewell, but his boat is not really ready and even the start of the Rival) Crowhurst must know that he was not serious enough to have a chance. But too much was on the road to leave him. <br /> <br /> In the excellent archive footage, we wrote all doubts in the mouth of his poor wife. Behind them with their 4th child, she is interviewing moving across the film, together with Crowurst's sons. He was in a no win-win situation. If he tried to stop him, he would have been considered a mockery, but later he would have been fooled with suspicion so that he could save his life by saving him. His boat has been diminishing and face some of the truths that will not create it through the South Sea and can not be confronted with ridicule, bankruptcy and irrationality, Crowhart made plans to cheat. Finding Argentina and Brazil beyond radio contact, he waited to surround Cape Horn and started back the Atlantic, believed that he could insert at the end of the line and pretend he had traveled all the way around the world. . He greatly proved his logo as false and 16mm film and audio recordings were made to back up his plan. But apart from another competitor, he realized that he would come in second and his logs would be examined. Certain identities can not be confronted, its journal has lost its strength on its implementation, and ultimately suicides. His yacht was not found. He never had that. <br /> <br /> This nicely edited movie follows the journey of experienced and intelligent French sailor Bernard Moessesier, who was in second place, and certain of the fastest journey award, when he suddenly left the nation, he was confronted and campaigned. He was confronted with and traveled in a wide blue era, eventually reaching Tahiti after about 10 months. I spent seven years working on the sea myself, (though they were very different ships) I could understand the ocean tension. Standing on the deck, looking at the water in each direction in the horizon, you have a few miles of water below you, there is nothing in you and isolation, but with a thin metal hull, easy access to the TV or radio (even today, on most work ships, you feel quite isolated), some days For the daily life can be removed from the responsibility. There are some thoughtful analyzes about the kind of people who want to have such a long, unrivaled journey and human mind. Most people will think that trying to raise 4 kids is just enough adventure, but the need for self-sufficiency for self-sufficiency in sea problems is created. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, who won the former Navy (who has been from many) and probably knew very well that he was before he was set up, so he could not win the race but the root remained close to him. Keep it Those who went in search of something deep within themselves, did not like what they found. <br /> <br /> At the end of the 60's, the wonderful archive footage of Britain was a great reason to watch this, (was it really bad? I do not think it's too bad, but maybe we're the worst side of blott's past?) But overall, it's a nicely created and wonderful movie. Highly recommended.
