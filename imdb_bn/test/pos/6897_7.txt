I'm Dead (2009) ** 1/2 Dominique Monaghan, Larry Facenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scream, John Speedacos, Aylin Colgan, Brenda Kony. The horror of the King's Karamen and Hammer Studios' 60's horror films is horrific and an uneven mix of comedies that culminates with two Christine's burial robbers (Monghan and Favorenden) with guillotine, but not before their stories. Can be recalled in secret flashbacks. Fun and thanks to some well-pitted Jolt but really a B-movie, trying to make a mess a classical classic thanks mainly to the welfare of Perlman and Scrimm styles in any way; A good rental for Halloween.
