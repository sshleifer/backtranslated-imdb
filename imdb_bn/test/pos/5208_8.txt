About the film Stalinad War. For those who do not know anything about you, it was the worst war in World War II. More than 10 million people died during the war. I have seen that this seems to have caught the only film which was actually the worst thing to fight between Russia and Germany. I really like it that these two ideals (Nazim and Communism) have never been in the film. Unlike most American films, Germany's bloodshed is not viewed as murderous, but a German soldier in Germany was a person. <br /> <br /> This picture is about four soldiers fighting in Stalinadrade. They were tried there and moved to take the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to early 1943. At the time, they learned about the horrors of war and tried to find ways to fight. <br /> <br /> Through the whole film, one feels the frustration of the whole war. In contrast to "Gates Anime", filmmakers did not try to sort out some sad love stories or incidental events in the war. This picture may be fiction, but it shows what happened in the bloody war of World War II.
