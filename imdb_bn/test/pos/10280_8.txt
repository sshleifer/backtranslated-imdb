Not all movies should be expected to end in a way that we're all using, and really great to see movies with awesome twists. However, that said, I was really disappointed in the end of the apartment. In my opinion, the finale was not perfectly fit with the rest of the movie and it was originally said that the story was destroyed. <br /> <br /> You spent the whole movie exploring each and every person's feelings, but events have had a major impact on each of the final 2 minutes of the movie, but the film ends and keeps it all open wide. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film was very well-formed,
