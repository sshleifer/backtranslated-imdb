In the 60's, I saw this movie on TV and still it has still stood, even D. D. Gomer Pile as USC in Li Eremi, Lou Gosset and even Frank Sutton (comic vin). I was not in service, but my brother was recording the drill instructor of the Air Force and it was scary. Others in the family of Marina told me that the army and even the Sultan also had excellent places in their roles. "D. I" is the only thing missing. Language In 1958, they did not use superstition in the film, but Jack Webb came in most of the play without it. I think it's his best role ever. He was pretty tough in the dragnet, I'll acknowledge George Rough as bad as though, but he is only using it at "D.I." Do not forget the funeral for dead fleas! The romantic part was only expanding the film, but in reality it did not interfere with the fundamental plot. Dawn Dubins was pretty good, but he did not cross the movie in his career. Until patriotism, John Wayne of Jack Web TV was. He carried it very little in some dragnet episodes, but "D.I" 40 years later I hope the film can stand like "flower metal jacket" and others; And what is it!
