Are the sidewalks sad, they resort to a few places that they are always portrayed in movies and novels? Certainly this film is marked as a particularly lazy and destructive tourist trap in Venice (near "contemporary", with a more light-hearted approach, see Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy) along with the contemporary "Do not Look No". I'm not sure because I have never been to Venice, but it has created the perfect setting for a perfect view of Lucino Viccanti, one of the finest stylists in the world. I have seen this movie now that I found it based on Thomas Price Novel (which Sir Appleton inspired an opera of Britain). Since I do not know the story behind it and the film is too little for the plot or exposition, so I was surprised by the emotion of Dirk Bogarde. Is he gay? A pedophile? Or something more innocent than a beautiful young man? Perhaps Tadji also reminds him of what he can think of and now he knows he will never be. Those who complain of slow motion in this movie should be in the car crash and Kung-Fu: It's not particularly long in 2 hours and 15 minutes, and it comes at a retired but rarely lazy speed. The film is well-received from Gustav Maheller's extraordinary music, on which the character of Aschench is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives an ongoing performance, and one of Italy's great beauties, as Tadzio's mother, is graced by the presence of Silvana Mangano.
