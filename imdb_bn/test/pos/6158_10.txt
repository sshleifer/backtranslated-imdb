There is a small flaw, this film is a wonderful composition, and I certainly saw the best war movies. Not to mention it is one of the best movies I've seen in all the generations. I used to write it for no man's land before, but now I think it's good. At the end it was very sad, and I almost cried almost twice after the scene which came to the final of the film in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The character of Karel was fascinating as the main character, although he wanted to be a rocky man in his age. This picture makes you think a lot, you cry (or at least come to you), and you hate any kind of war and political BS. Flashbacks make the movie more palatable in prison hospital. <br /> <br /> A small error about this film is the British non-British pronunciation of the people. The British were mostly British on screen, but how to talk to the British and talk to foreign accent? That really did not fit into this adorable film. But I've noticed that quite a single error. Effects may be a bit better, but again, we all remember a lot of movies on a particular land, which include a great FX and absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is a total of the writings and every single person will see it. If you want to visit Czechoslovakia of 40 and you want to feel a lot of passion once, this movie is for you. If you do not want to do them then you have to make this movie.
