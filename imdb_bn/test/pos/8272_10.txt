I was extremely happy I recorded it in VHS tape when it was featured in Master Piece Theater. This is a movie that I can see repeatedly. In the early 1800's, living like England was not difficult, but Pru was born with a "bone lip" and was expelled from birth. The people of his village took him a little but always feared that he "from the memory of the devil" and quickly turn him away. Especially when a lot of misfortune befalls her family. He is firm and brave, but he is away from Kerster Woodsaves, who is a traveler leftist who looks at his eyes. Partly because he is afraid of rejection and because he thinks he is so scary that he should have a wife who is as beautiful as Lili. Keizer is a modern man who does not believe in the darkness of that time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart. The film is going on in the original story of Mary Web and looks at it from beginning to end.
