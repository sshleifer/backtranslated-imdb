Terry and June were one of the classic British sitcoms in my opinion. You know what you can expect - and that's just not so typical! :) Contrary to modern weather, with the fully built plots, this show is still breathing fresh air. Not commenting on physical functions, listening to or listening to beautiful or not atheistic or impossible families, do not see a family late for the family. And there are secrets: Terry and June are living with relative resilience alongside today's strenuous plots with 'D Rigour', unhappy family (made to look hip) based on a middle-class couple. <br /> <br /> Personally, I voted one of the best "away from the bridge" episode. In this case, Terry's antics reminds me of Basil Fawlitti - both of which sometimes seem almost impossible to be embarrassed! <br /> <br /> Terry and June highly recommended. Your tea and biscuits are ready!
