For me, "Let's Crisisanths" was not only interesting because it was my first film in Nasser's first film, but it enjoyed it perfectly because I was technically as modern and innovative by seeing the 30th work. This does not mean that the introduction of "breathlessness" in the cowshed 1952 did not mean the introduction of innovation. <br /> <br /> This edit is 30 seconds / 40s, but at the same time he is incredibly fit about his way of telling stories. Like them, it did not intentionally attempt to "invisible" or make myself "invisible", but together with cinematography, I thought that I was traveling in a gentle stream, always feeling the waves below me, like the gentle stroke of the arm or a paddle almost unnoticeable rocking. In this sense, the film was comparable to the works of Ozu and Mijoguchi, but anyway it is more subtle. <br /> <br /> It was so modern that the editor was almost a character in itself, instead of showing the camera's extravagant drawer (1954) or Vredens Stag (1943), instead of just showing them the deeper understanding of the film and its characters. Is doing <br /> <br /> I think the editing and filming of Naruis are the most interesting aspects of their films, elevating the significance of stories beyond the obvious. Wonderful set and settings should not be forgotten! I think the story is rather traditional. <br /> <br /> The story and its characters were presented very interestingly, and I thought that the first half of the film was creating emotionally subtle emotional spectrum and interrelations. Unfortunately, the second half of the film was comparatively more sophisticated (though it was perfectly suited to any other complex complex itself) rather than set up instead of its resolution. Somehow it seemed that he failed to try to dissolve many layers of woven. Maybe he will keep them intact. This criticism may seem to be somewhat rude to the audience of this movie, especially since the process is again reminiscent of Ozu in the manner related to the plot of his films. Unfortunately I still do not have a feeling that Naruaz was able to present the story and his characters in a similar novel on the conclusion of his film. The best effort seen in time was - Vikigoomo (floating clouds / 1955) and Madreguumo (scattered clouds / 1967) - he sustained the power created throughout his life, when he gave a furious and resonant finish. <br /> <br /> It's already more than most of the directors, and in my opinion the basic skill base of the secondary medium. In this regard, and if I look at her, considering the resonance of the last two films, she may already be my darling. <br /> <br /> This is my only problem at the moment, where I'm going to watch her movie more on the big screen.
