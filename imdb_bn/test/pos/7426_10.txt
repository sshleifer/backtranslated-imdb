A fine romantic comedy. errol flynn shows what he has a deft touch for the comedy. A genius that probably shows some prankster self to some of his truths. The comedic writing in this film is excellent. Anne Parker works erroneously as Flannie's ex-wife, who is trying to make a mistake. Anano is also easy to eye. The sets where the 1940s glamor and style are appropriate. <br /> <br /> Flayen's comedic timing and intelligence are displayed here in full effect, it takes twice as much, its ability to respond with verbal swings or the ability to straighten the man, and where it requires total credibility and sincerity, this man works can do! It would not be an embarrassment mistake to have the opportunity to play more like this across his career, he was very gifted to the extreme. If you enjoy some of these with Gayle and Colbert "It's happened one night" or William Powell and Murna Laume Comedy, you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Good pencil and lots of laughter. A movie is a lost diamond.
