Yes The left cried a few times and so did Englund. And probably you too will be The whole cast has returned to work and this gang-up in Naxville has become the true leader of the opposite reverse parties (I mean it by the best possible means). I first thought, maybe left or Steve-was the main people .... No, the main people are now Johnny. Do not make me wrong, everyone, and I understand this is great on this Flickr! You're going to laugh properly, and you believe me, do not plan on resting your smile. I personally think the movie is a better moment than the first. You know when you go to a theater, and you do not want to have high expectations for it ... well, this movie removes all expectations. If you love Jacques, you can go into this with giant prospects. No matter what you laugh at your ass. If you do not smile but you probably have a gun in your mouth, you are probably not saying if you die or feel embarrassed about your laughter or the maximum probability is that you are Jack! Eat! For breakfast and for the rest of the Jack city. I have to say all, prepare yourself a sad face after the movie. :)
