L'OSSESSA, which is known as TORMENTED or SXORCIST, or laughably titled EEREE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST RIP-OFF, one of the best horror moments I have ever seen. The scene is when the crucifixes are alive. This great wonderful view is unforgettable and complete (great FXs). It is a shame that the rest of the film does not maintain an amazing level in the scene. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating movies ever. The producers imagined that it decided to create an exstestist copy, but when creating it, they can actually create something original (a sculpture of crucified people, which you find when challenging), but completely forgets their original idea, is a boring and uninspired Close the express rip. If the film continues with the concept of sculpted sculptures (with characters trying to destroy it), this movie will be running out of a while. But once she was possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never called the ghost from where she came from. He, and the script, stupid which completely forgot the spectacular crucifixion !!! <br /> <br /> If you like the so-called "Euro-Patch" movies, the first 45 minutes will be distributed in contrast to any other euro-culture movie. But after the scene, the girl dreams of crucifixion and she gets stigmataas, the rest 45 minutes, Sak. Annoying It goes somewhere (badly) as it tries to imitate the creators. So, look at the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the fashion of the 1970s, the riddle and the wonderful statue - the living-to-the-rivish-the-tha scene, but after the first 45 minutes, press stop and eject and along with your go toenails clip.
