High intelligence and activity is a film. As well as in the 60's and with a strong capsule of personality, the film is really amazed by its unique presentation of thought-provoking themes and the power of a group's system. William Greaves employed himself in the group's role. He asked his crew members in film and film and filming. The first two actors, then the actors filmed crew, then settled bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks in full set, including scales, police, and finally a homeless man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not expect to be bored by this film. The crew is scared for everyone involved in conversation and often thinking that watching these observers times. Greaves work well to integrate multiple cameras, which synchronize three-to-one images and use other conversion modes. Finally, if the film is really what you are looking for: If you are looking for an abstract army movie that feeds your own autocratic ego, then see elsewhere if there is no point. If you are looking for a film that is about to talk for long periods of thinking about the "reality" of the document and the desire for honesty and sincerity of its inevitable transparency, then it is the perfect movie.
