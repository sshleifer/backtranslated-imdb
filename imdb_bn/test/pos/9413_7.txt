Mavrique director Sajun Suzuki finally managed to create his dream project "Rajkumari Rakun" and thus he was lucky, he did not use it in the 1960's. Special Effects and Computer Graphics Surely this type of production can easily be achieved compared to the old film matte technology. <br /> <br /> Some of the contacts with Japanese history and dramatic heritage will help in the film's enjoyment. The more familiar with Shakespeare's "The Tempest" will be with Peter Greenway's dense "Prospera books". Though these two films are really somewhat common, but for anyone other than the "Princess Rapuno" background, it's much more colorful and easier to see. <br /> <br /> The art design, acting and direction are mostly fine for movies, this viewer seems to have continued in the third quarter of this film. Most of the catchy sets have already been introduced and the camera appears to be back in the background for an imagined level playing experience. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a unique film experience and I recommend it to anyone interested in the film's performance options form. It really is not meant for children, although it would not really be annoying for them. If the last third is good then I could have given 9 stars.
