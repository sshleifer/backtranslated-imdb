Well this movie was certainly to be observed with the current time. Any happy ending, super hero, or miracle here. Terrorism, and stimulate our minds with what-ifs just below earth fiction. Percival Kudos to Percival and Mickery for an excellent play and gorgeous direction. Such movies are essential for us to be aware of what we have. If every peace-loving man and woman in the world is likely to report suspicious activity, I believe terrorism can not be successful. This film shows how difficult it is to remove these terrorists with good intelligence. Although Islam is a little preacher against Islam (using a Muslim police officer as a main character), I believe that it was completely realistic. Shock-value was meant to be a bomb attack case. As an extremely clever tool of human deprivation and inhuman to catch such an attack, they showed complete nudity of decontaminated women in the post attack. It did not take me a long time to understand that it meant to encourage the audience more, that is, we think, in such a situation, we do not control everything. Although it took place in London in high-level British acting, it made statements in any part of the world. Great movie does not have to be a blockbuster epic production, and watching this movie is very very worthwhile.
