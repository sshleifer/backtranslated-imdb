Above all, if you do not lack subtitles, pornography, strange sex and curiosity, scary and lack of real frustration, then you have to keep an eye on this. I've mentioned the strange sex, but the second half of the movie would be pretty disproportionate to "weird". If you are not prepared for this kind of illness, then it is confronted. Who says, I can go back to reviewing this incalculable piece of cloth brought to us by our fake Japaneses. <br /> <br /> This plot seems fairly basic, almost helpless: a girl is hired to perform amateur porn movies. Do not expect much in the first 30 - 40 minutes. There are some conversations - if you do not speak Japanese, it's not too meaningful for you - it seems to be chatting occasionally between the girl and the crew and the performer, then there is some porn (straight sex) and then the scene performer and the crew end up taking a break Is. And then ... it starts to happen. Looks like the girl is talking about another scene - this time tied with a rope. The abuse begins: Strap, slapping, hot wax ... Finally, the girl breaks and cry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He apparently shaken and he seemed like to leave. He roamed the door, sitting on the floor to lay his shoes ... and at that time the hell broke. <br /> <br /> She hits the head with a baseball bat, treats her wound, she is tied on the bed. What can be briefly described in the name of rape during the separation (I am not going to waste everything for you). Think of "the flowers of the flesh and blood", mix it with obscenity and you get the idea. It lasted for about 20 minutes or more. SFX is very good, makeup too. Everything is shown, with no mercy for exhibiting. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitor Question" is a very sick movie. After watching "Niku Daruma" it looked like a fairy tale to me. This movie is so sick, so distorted, distorted, so annoying that the hardest word is pale than its end. Very bad it is only released on VHS so no subtitles are available. But the movie still works without them. So, if you are in the supernatural disorder, extreme grief and other beauty of this favorite genre, check it out. I hope you will not have nightmares .8 / 10
