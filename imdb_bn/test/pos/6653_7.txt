It seems that its director, Anthony Mingela, is deliberately trying to overcome himself and his own film, which he is trying to hit, from 1996 to English patients. "The movie is quite similar to the premises. There is a passionate love affair and they try to find each other on their own after surgery Time reduces the fight like retreats. The difference between the initial plot is that the character of Nicole Kidman is not married, Jude Law is a merciless, and the conflict is a civil war. <br /> <br /> "Cold Mountain", story-based, more waterfalls And "English Patient" is gentle rather than talking and it's more for a level that likes a simple love story which is due to any problem It is a small film, which is a plus for less patience. However, it is not considered as a literary or original, or indeed "English patient." * Only big complaints about "cool mountain", surprisingly, in law ) And the love relationship between the characters of Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Surprisingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the movie. They do not have a real relationship; We do not feel the real passion from them and the emotion that we see is more physical than the mentality. I was more cautious with drawing friendships with Nicole Kidman and Oscar winner Rene Gelweger, and drawing attention to Jude Law's journey across the country. If Mingalela strengthens the importance of the story of love, she would have felt better, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The order of civil war is absolutely great; They are the modern heritage which shows war as horrible and arrogant. The revision of the Petersburg campaign, where explosives explosion from the ground exploded and then scared of hand combat from the ground. Mingala is not ashamed of showing blood and gore in an artistic and intelligent way, and she is not afraid to show innocence and loss of life in these scenes. There are moments where women and men are often killed by crossfire. And it has more. Just create the sound design tension in the film. There is a scene where Inman and another discouraged eat a dead cow's head and eat it himself. We do not see slicing, but the effects of Blade's sound going through the bones are sick. Finally, for the acting I must congratulate the acting. Jude Law was horrific in the film and he received the Academy Award nomination. I think Nicole Kidman deserved her as well, though her character was a bit shallow. Rene was the best seller of jellwigs and screen savers. And then there are only a few parts to fully complete this stylistic world to regain a terrible time in America's past. Perhaps the "Cold Mountain" war was good as a war, but it was obviously like "English Patient", if his love story was run, and screenwriter and director Anthony Mingilla were even more encouraged. Whereas, it is a most enjoyable picture, I was not bored by it, and I recommend it. I just want to say that his love story - though a central plot point - needs to be slightly milder than that and everything around it really works.
