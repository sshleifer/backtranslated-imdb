Whenever Hyo Miyazaki created "Tri-Facta" (film, wrote, and animated), he made a classic film for ages. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The name Fujimato The fish escapes from his father and goes to the shore of a jellyfish, where he is caught in a dredging operation and stuck to the bottle. The order of this water should be one of the greatest drag animated scenes ever, and it must stand on its own as the reason for finding the theatrical release. Miyazaki, who scared to show a busy scene, surrendered herself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The name of Sousuke is able to break the bottle, spot it in its water and save it. Since he was the result of his father's magic, he was able to magic himself - and his father actively tried to rescue him. Son ponyo fish name When Sosuke knew that Pony could speak, his father successfully succeeded in capturing him. <br /> <br /> After the war of will with his father, Ponyo managed to run away with the ability to change himself in a person. She again met with Sousuke in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. There are controversial reasons for this movie's competition and Tanar√≠ Totro crossing. Joe Hashashi, again offers extraordinary musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is easy - such as Miyazaki films - and visitors must apply in a wide spectrum. Although I did not see enough to be sure, the film does not seem to be one that will hold the scholars in a long discussion, as Senna did not make any kamikakusi. Yet, this final feeling-good entertainment movie. I gave the movie ten with ten rating.
