Maybe I'm biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter aircraft - although F-14 is probably the second or third - but I liked this movie. The series (Iron Eagle II and III) does not measure according to acting and plot, but the first - along with the top genre - has excellent flying and music with reasonable plot and acting. The second and third is definitely low in a "flight budget", but their main flaw is plot and acting. Compared to Tom Cruise, Jason Gardrick's fame and popularity reflects the relativistic fame and popularity of the iron eagle as a whole completely iron metal. Another plus (for me) is a very brief look of Shannoni Smith. 7/10
