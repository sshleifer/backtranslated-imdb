Very tightly written, played, and filmed. Violent, but not too much. Anyone knew this edited exactly he wanted to portray. This movie is not an isolated scene. The "general suspect" fancy was fantastic; A collection of these outstanding individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but this is the price of one owner.
