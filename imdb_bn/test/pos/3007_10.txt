I just started watching shows around July. I found it by mistake, I was surfing the channel during a holiday. This is a great show, I just did not have too late at night. It's at 12:30. As an active person, it always makes it hard to keep an eye on. <br /> <br /> I read some comments. At the age of 60 I have not agreed to grow and I do not believe this thing can happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60's. I was Hispanic and I was a "White" boyfriend plus we had high school black friends. I believe people go together because of their interests and personality and it does not have anything to do with a particular nation or color. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to go to this program without going into the DVD so I can buy it. In this way I can see it from the beginning.
