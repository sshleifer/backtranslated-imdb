A bunch of sorority girls spend a nights at a strange tomb in a new promise. Of course, recently the dead did not die for a long time and all the hell broke down. "A Dark Knight" is a horrific terrible dead body of 80, which is controlled by the spirit of Rayamer inside the dead body of floating dead body. No gestation and nudity, but the atmosphere of a tomb is very eerie. Acting is difficult, but impressive characters take a lot of time to develop until finally 20 minutes Raymar breaks from his grave. Cinematography is impressive and the tomb is a great place for climatic events. The film takes so long to go and its main error is 10.
