Chasers fight over everything. 5 words that I like to watch. Chassar fight in everything is a wonderful Australian comedy. As the name suggests they wage war on everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) where the best comedy is there. <br /> <br /> It won the Australian Film Industry (AFI) awards, but won the best comedy in Logija <br /> <br /> Last year (2006) Chatter was broadcast on ABC on Friday night when everyone was out so nobody could see it. Well they were transferred on Wednesday night at 9pm (a good timelot for a lift) and the best thing if I missed a part or want to see it again, I can download the best thing from www.ABC.net.au/chaser.
