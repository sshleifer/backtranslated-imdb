Peter Lor turned into a wonderful act, to create a Hungarian watch, he came to create a new life for himself, and one day brought his daughter to the big pond to stay with him. Laur's infectious optimism and brilliant outlook are very effective, which, when facing him in the face of the fire, burns in a fire in the hotel fire and when someone does not give him a chance to work, then reluctantly lean towards the life of crime. Lor's duration as an actor is rarely his genius, his immigrant behavior with the blind woman, compared to his average hood - for his true belief in America, with his depressed, relaxed, inadequate nature, his intelligent, intelligent, better- Fall in love. The story is well-structured, has some interesting twists and offers lots of opportunities in light of light. Director Robert Flory did a quality work behind the lens and all the supporting caster help with Evelyn's special appearance as a dark girl. I love the end - and going to the society, despite all the negative issues present in the truth - people's character. For a little B photo, The Man Behind the Mask is making good films for its time.
