As an American fan of The League of Gentlemen, I had to wait for several months after coming out of the DVD, but its (irrelevant) wait was good. "Apocalypse" is superb - funny, weird, tricky as hell, full of cryptic references to the jokes and television series; What you expect from Gentlemen is basically. <br /> <br /> This plot has already been discussed in another review, so I will not be annoyed to capture it again, though I would say I read it first, I would have said a little distraught. Evidently, this device - the fables entering the real world to face their Creator - especially in Wesley Craven's underlying "New Knightmare" and Stephen King's "Dark Towers" books (where the king himself was the character). Even though Gentlemen has broken the fourth wall of fun, add even a new element: a second imagined world ("their day"). Soon three realities have been weaved together, and the results are exhilarating: Geoff's tips being knighted in the middle ages (and tried to court in Queen Victoria's wood); The original league of the gentleman vysate royalon, polin and Dr. Face like a sugar-like character; David Warner calls a homunculus outside the church of Barnes. I have heard that some people dislike sub-plots of the "Evil of Kings", but I saw it in the Sunny, especially Reese's character (Jad ith who is being channelized from series three to "Witch"). While talking about the characters, I was pleased to find it, though Hillary Briss, Geoff and Hare Leip were firmly planted in the main part of the film, on the other hand, the more familiar characters were given due to them. Initially Benissis's confession was hilarious, focusing on the quick, more sketch-based sentiments of the first series. Pauline and Mickey Kimes (although no juice is weird), although I wanted to see Mrs. Campbell-Jones more. Pab Lazaro, considered as Tibbas and Edward. Three are rarely used, their small screen time almost gives magical feeling (and how did they hack the hack like a pornographic hair?) According to the DVD commentary, "Sticky Rubbish Hairstyle" <Br> <br /> The film looks incredible, but then what's new? Music, as always, exciting I am happy to hear the new explanation of the talent of the song Thierry Music, and to repeat a slightly recent repetition of that, "Apocalypse" and the three final episodes of the series. <br /> <br /> There are some minor accusations- It looks beautiful to look older, known to the oldest known Ryston Vassi, and I used to think stop-motion animals (beautiful, deviated) were little unused. But both of them can be justified in the film budget, so they understand. Yet, as much as I liked the new church of Barnes, it was calm to see the final battle in the high street (Gentlemen's original view, according to the comment). <br /> <br /> Overall, "Apocalypse" is amazing, especially if you're a fan of the series. I can not recommend extremely high. 10/10.
