This is the best movie I ever seen. It has all tragedy and happiness to love and hate. And a deep friendship that can not even destroy war. <br /> <br /> The most gorgeous welding I've ever seen. Patrick Soze and James Reid top grade in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you see part 1, you will want to see it. Some of my friends saw the movie part of my house, then went out and bought the movie. <br /> <br /> I am a civil war but the movie is interested in the history of my grandfathers. Any movie that children can learn history is great. To me books are first, second and third, and when girls come from Florida every year they want to see North and South.
