The movie takes a little slow first. But it got picked up speed and got the right to the point. It shows how governments and scientists argue for the causes of humanity and "gadget". I enjoyed it. It is very close to the fact that as a result of the collapse of any film of nuclear bomb near Japan. I recommend it to friends. I was especially pleased with the ability to play Dwight Schultz.
