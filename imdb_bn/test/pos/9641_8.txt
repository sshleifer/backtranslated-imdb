Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are the youngest submarine officers in Italy during the First World War. The dialog is very entertaining and delightful as the "Ptoomaine" of Jimmy Durante Ship. The character of Walter Huston is inspiring as a superb example of a submarine captain, an officer and a gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the technology level displayed in war scenes. I was amazed at how similar the technology of World War I technology was published after 25 years in World War II. The fundamental human nature was similarly illustrated in modern times and far from conservatism I had been so-called "innocent" in the past. Above all, I felt that the first figure in the film, character, action scenes and history scene illustrated in this film.
