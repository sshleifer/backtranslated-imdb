So now it's a little date, it's about 30 years old. Wonderful enough I have this in beta tape and it still plays just fine. If it comes to the DVD, then I'll snap it in the hitbit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> then it was not as 'harmful'. A lot of driving without airbags, seat belts and baby seats. My father was crying so loudly that he was laughing so loudly. I was a coworker in the 90's who saw it and I could get it on the crossbow and kill them by saying "IiiVVVAVIAWYAYYYYYY". <br /> <br /> Great lines, extraordinary explosions of origin, and even fun to me even after three decades!
