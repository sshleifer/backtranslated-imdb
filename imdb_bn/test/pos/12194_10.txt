I've seen this movie count now and it still can not get sick. It's like a freak drug. I know many people do not like it, but there is something about it that attracts me. Every single performance is spectacular, but Alea stole that show. He did not only play the role of Axa. Its body movement and beauty are exceptionally good catch. It is very nice to see that a black girl was selected for the role of Egyptian Queen (No, I am not biased against white people, I am also one). Indeed, the ancient Egyptians did not even know exactly what color it was, but it was a wonderful change. Stuart Townsend has completely forgotten me that Tom Cruise's Lestat script and margaret were again hit. At all it was a good time in the movie. For those who did not see it, do not forget to see it with an open mind and do not take it very seriously. I mean, this is a movie about a vampire that has become a rock star. Take it as that.
