Darya star Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cocon, Barbara Petton and Raymond Massey. It is directed by Stewart Histler, Ernest Haller's Photography and Penn Twin John Twist. Produced from Warner Bros., Dallas is greeted in Technikolare outside of the Iverson and Warner branch in California. The tongue is very strong in the tongue with the tongue, this film is a pursuit of the West, which is without proportion or deep sharp meaning. <br /> <br /> This plot was repeated in Copper's Civil War, Blaude "Rib" Holisth made his own death fraud so that his fame could be stopped and he could kill his own family and find himself out for the brothers Dallas. Originally a routine plot, Twist's story looks on the path through a lot of fun and exciting diversions. Room reversals, bed fashions, horseshoe pacities, shot outs, a private triangle, strong dialogue and little twists are all to make this piece completely transformable. <br /> <br /> Cooper seems to be enjoying himself, which suggests a better factor. It is true that he is not really asked to do anything more than a lenonic dude in a mission. But when asked for workshop, he provided the desired product of his fans during his successful career. Villains [especially Steve Kountour Wilhelm and Dopi Bryant Marlow] have fun reasons because they have a little pack of candy to keep away from their own shortcomings. The pieces allow two ladies to be well-kept in superb appearance and machismo, while high production value Haller really involves eye-treatment with the lush Technicolor and engages in camera work around the location. <br /> <br /> It is ideal to be a list of Oater lists in Dallas, something it just can not achieve. But it is not for lack of effort, and the end result is one of pure entertainment, that should be really, in the cold winter day, when the audience needs to pick me up. 7/10
