This film is definitely the fundamental film. Plots are amazing, amazing acting, and the directions are amazing. In an all-time classic, this should not win the best picture sequence versus. Kramer,. Although it was not even nominated. Jack Lemon and Michael Douglas are their best. Ever the best one ever. If you have not seen this movie, you can not rent it. Should have been in the top 100 of the AF. It's not just for Fondara, but for all. <br /> <br /> **** of 4/4
