With the help of eight stories written and directed by Richard Bell, the 102-minute film can have a few storytelling conventions, but at the end of the audience there is a fine feeling of commitment to all cast and crew. The movie wants to work - and so is it. Yes, producers can earn more money to spend the final cut, but the aspects can be happy, but as a small independent film in Canada it is a weak, silent ridiculous, weakness and very sensitive story about communication and commitment. It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> While we are opening a very good dancer, we are in a family dinner for Voices, where something maybe a terrible thing, and as a result a child and two boys jump into the car and the accident happened. Of which a boy was killed. 18-year-old Pip son (Paul Anthony - looking too old for credibility as a teenager), his mood sets his family with an expression for living in the desert and on the street. She drinks a male prostitute, Clerk (Clarence Spagnal), who gives pipe food and shelter, Jenny (a pretty beautiful Kelly Pope) who keeps her from annoying with her partner Derek (Ryan McDonnell) and is romantically involved with Pipes and Father Chris (Alan Cumming) plays a subtle collaboration role as a priest. It is Pip's 18th birthday and his father (Serge Houd) should indicate the pipe to give a gift from his dead grandfather, with the instruction that the gift should open on his pipe's 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> Pip, full of anger, tape machine pawns but keeps tape and starts listening to the words of his grandfather Jason (voice by Ian McKellen), who mentioned his 18th birthday in France in World War II where he ( Now a very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher) has an experience with injured wounds named Macaulay (Mark Hillrath, also pretty) and his cabaret at one night's wedding Ayaka Hannah ( "Queer ash Folk" fame, and here is a fine singer and actress), to reflect the wedding. To live a little while during the war: Jason gave McAulle a chance to help, when he died, he eventually ended up with a beautiful scene for the release of two men. Pip and grandfather tie Jason's parallel with every pipette and change his view of life and love after listening to the lead pip. Clarke's isolated existence in subplots, instead of Huffler, Jeffer (David Bizelli - in the debut of a wonderful fine movie) who likes to like easily; By an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; By faith, the father raises Chris Pip and Clark both in a good shepherd's way: and a flashback takes place due to a car accident where Pip can protect his brother Daniel (Paul Daneskiv) from an insulting work in his father's hands. Accident, but failed to do so, was shown by his deep blame and consequent wrong rage, reflected by his grandfather's taped experience. This concubine gathers up to the end and creates a sense of closing for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> It looks like the production of a big budget: musical score is performed by members of BravoWettleCenter Symphony, Kevin van Niemer's cinematography is strictly atmospheric and the common quality of this Canadian cast performance is very fine. Although Paul Anthony managed his role well, playing an important role could make the story very young, and Richard Bell promised to give a young talent to another film, 'Two Brothers' on his resurgence. Meet up Despite the flaws, eight of them deserve a suitable film and attention. Grady Harp
