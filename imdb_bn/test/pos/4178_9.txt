For a long time, I refused to see a fan of "The Monkas" TV series "Head" because it was not about TV show characters, who were warm and wonderful. "Head", instead, is called a ferrous, dark movie. Finally, the curiosity led me to the cave. I certainly could not find a new episode on TV shows, but an interesting movie attracted to my bold side. <br /> <br /> I was always fascinated by the dream, and "Head" was like dreaming of many, with an incomplete hint of stories, and a short story at the end of a scene, causing the movie to be closed in new ways, many dreams The process of consciousness like flow. Incomplete story really drives my imagination wild, time and time! <br /> <br /> The film has very interesting, beautiful cinematography, black colored white color, black and white characters. "Daddy's Song" The music is a great way of hunting, especially "The Peepz Song". ("The Pippaz song" is my favorite song of dark, I like the bright side "Zip-a-de-Du-Dah".) <br /> <br /> Finally, I think the TV series "Head" Drama, conspiracy, and intensity might use some. But "Head" could use some of the warmth, humor, and friendship of the TV show.
