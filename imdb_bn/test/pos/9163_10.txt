Within a year less than a year after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the film was cast, the cast, the director and the audience seemed fresh in mind. Most cast soldiers and officers returned only from war. The Soviet army cooperated a lot during the filming, which is odd; <br /> <br /> Afghan interference was a bloody and unmatched battle, even the generals even forgot the reason for bloodshed. This image shows the pain of tension and cruelty in military life, mental abnormalities felt by soldiers and imposing a small nation consumed by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> There is no shortage of powerful scenes. The first is the steel coffins being loaded in a transport system for the USSR. Even though an official quietly shut down the destinations, their workers left: Moscow, Roostov, Donetsk, The Baltic. <br /> <br /> A previous comment describes the last scene with Major Bandura as unreasonable. It is perfectly reasonable and the spirit of the film: The only human relationship of the Bengal was with the Afghan family, which he was killed in an attack. After losing his only buffer against the stupidity of war, Bandu's son (and his gun) pursued him to resign from his fate. <br /> <br /> I especially like the last scene: Mi-28 is rising above the hills, like the pilot's voice, "Uhodim! Uhodim Rabbit! (We're leaving! boys, we're leaving!) /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Afphanski Ezlam is an excellent film - cruelly honest and as unholliwood as they come.
