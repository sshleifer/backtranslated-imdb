The famous French detective Henry Casin took his first leave in St. Margot in 11 years, where he met holiday homeowner Nannyt. In spite of Henry's age, despite his father's opposition, the childhood boyfriend Leon, Henry and Nyanet fell in love and decided to get married. On their wedding day, Leon Returns and Knaint run after him. Two people are not heard until both of them died, and Henry swears that she will not rest until she finds a murderer. Henry had to work with Leon's found footprint, but he received a written warning that soon others would die. Soon Nanate's mother died and Henry did not have any idea as the killer's identity. When he returned to Paris thinking of his failure, he realized (and feared) that the murderer could be only a person, even though no colleague could believe his explanation. The mystery of the general killing that does not actually follow the formula of Colombian or other B studios. It certainly goes to credit manager Luis, who, despite film settings, turns it into a noirish film, it also helps with better camera work and lighting. Geray is probably able to carry a very good performance in his sole lead and carry their performance to the rest of the cast. Ratings, 8
