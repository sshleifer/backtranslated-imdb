I consider this movie a complete creation - I actually consider Fernando Fragra's best work and undoubtedly the best of all Portuguese films. I do not think you can see such a "zero budget" movie as it is impressive and wonderful. <br /> <br /> The direction is done in an incredibly fast rate and music is also composed mostly by Fragata. The story is astonishing and ridiculous at the same time, and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying "Mrs Love Company", an advanced study of the situations associated with mysterious mysteries in a brain. More from the perfect recipe to glance the eyes of viewers from one to one on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's called Neo-Hitchcock, and I agree. Like most of the best hitcos, it kept me guessing the whole movie time, and most of my dreams were far from the end of the smartphone release.
