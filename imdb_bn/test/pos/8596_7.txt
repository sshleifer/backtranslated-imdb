I've never read Jackline Susan's novel, but I saw dolls based on his other books. On both occasions, I think the film is probably better than the book and the age will be better (in contrast to the books). A movie focuses more on specific style in fashion, design and behavior patterns. And love machine in this direction offers quite a lot. Set design perfectly fits the story. And all the characters are very fit. The perfect way that they completed a good balanced general picture. They are sponsors and are not developed, it is true, but in this movie I do not want it any other. <br /> <br /> David Hemming reiterated the role that Antonioi played in Bloop. And it's more than a rip off. She is a fashion photographer, apparently looks old and the seed seems to start going a little bit. Rick Ryan raised the role played by Max McCullough, who once again resurrects Smith Wolrieg, greedy, bored and annoying, strangers and obscure. It is possible that Ryan does not want to remain in the film and acted accordingly, on the other hand he may think a lot about his part and then carefully studied performance. Whatever it does, it fits the picture. Dian Canon is a fantastic (fantastic dress!), He influences each of his scenes and is involved in two highlights of the movie: losing the character of Heminges with a luxurious bed fire and an Academy Award statue. <Br /> <br /> Title, The Lavin Machine, Of course, surprisingly. Robin Stone is a kind of pop-era Barry Lindon (incidentally, the film is a little crazy). He seems to be a mere coincidence to select a TV station for his work on top. He sees only love for money (i.e. sexual gratitude) for personal progress. There is a scary indication of an annoying sex that is not explored in the film. Homosexuality is treated very casually, probably the mayor of time is not ideal for cinematography. TV executives free fights should not be compared with other good films about Fas In the View In Network or TrueMon Show. They are producing shit, they agree with each other and they know that they will make a lot of dough in it. <br /> <br /> I was not busy with this movie for 108 minutes and if not surprised, it follows a worship, but it is given a chance (i.e., a DVD release).
