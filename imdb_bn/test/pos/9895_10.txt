A wonderful story that should be seen by all the families. The story, acting, and production values ​​are all the first rates. I highly recommend "check out!" Peter <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is acting in an old age, who wants to decide who will die, so he knows how to end and "Members" will not be listeners. "His three children entered New York to face him and tried to change his mind. Of course, homeless family solved problems, and scripts and actors operated with their good and wonderful humor <br /> <br /> This story is about a Jewish family, but it can be easily related to any other family, well, maybe not a WASP family, there is a problem with their dad as well as the siblings. I love writing and direction, as well as acting Above all, a ridiculous and sensitive film.
