I've been a fan of Larry King's show for a while, I think he did fairly extraordinary work and I do not think he's ever been 'wusses' out, as many people believe. She gets a fine scorpio, her zings when she needs, just as she managed last night with Paris Hilton, during her first post-gel TV interview. <br /> <br /> The thing about this whole incident that really surprised me, Hilton is still apparently stupid why the judge Saor believes in him, is a very strong sentence (and also what he actually serves). Every time he was in jail, he was in jail for 23 hours a day, he never once reviewed events in his mind, which seems to judge Judge Suarer being appropriate for him. He never realized that he had closed a flagship red flag when he (1) had delayed the court for the original hearing and (2) informed him, when he asked him that he did not know his license had been suspended, Did not get the papers, "I have people who read this thing for me." <br /> <br /> When he was in his cell, he never realized that this action (showing late) and that statement - and more important, attitude - is the arrogance neglect system and the law in general and its driving privilege He showed - only Judge Swar (will ask for forgiveness) could put pressure on him. <br /> <br /> Last night, on King Shaw, his emotional experience changed forever after how he had learned "learned" after his lip service, he answered his question, "Do you think a raw Got the agreement? "With a felt yes And during the conversation (if you can call it), he once said that he does not think he deserves what happened to him. The king, softly, asked more than once, if he does not think that he creates situations in his life that he "finds" himself, which he rarely saw to him. He basically believes that he has been victims of this situation; She does not understand how she did it herself, in the court on that day, by her barbaric behavior with the judge. I think it is very sad - sad, even for some people, Hilton considers a huge "role model", and last night, his complete and complete stupidity about his so-called rehabilitated state, describing any of his concerns and hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> During the interview, Hilton ordered her to spend a lot of time reading the Bible in her home. At the end of the interview, the King scored the key points by asking him what was his favorite Bible passage. He had his cruel notes (completely unclear non-insight, which he had in Nelson Mandela or something like that) and finally grunting out, "There's no favorite passage." <br /> <br /> Judge Sauer Hero in my book, and last night, Larry King, he freely expressed Hilton truly for publishing.
