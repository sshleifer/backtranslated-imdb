Two people living in the same flat complex have a relationship with their partners. When they try and piece together how it happened, do they start a mental journey that gives pain to a resolution? <br /> <br /> Based on its previous success with Happy Tigadar and Chunking Express, Wang Kar Yi is rather surprising stories of old fashion and reawakened feelings, surprising and unrequited love to us. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, there is no taste for love in everyone's mind. It has been spread lazy instead of 98 minutes: not particularly long for a movie, but it is displayed much more because it does not happen much. But this lazy feeling is a very tightly-knit film created. Most of the stories are played in a series of pieces of role plays fascinated around a series of dramas, where the characters work in their respective circumstances in their wives, trying to work on how the matter begins. I say shiny because, of course, the audience (and characters) make it difficult to know what it is "role" and genuine. <br /> <br /> <br /> If all this sounds cunning and self-evident, it is because. Unfortunately so. And it is perfected by some of Hong Kong's top two, Maggie Cheng and Ling Chui Wei Ping Lam Siew and some excellent support from Rebecca Pan. <br /> <br /> This is also Wang Kar Y, the audience behaves a sensual, and sensual, overload. Christopher Doyle (who later established her flowering style in Heroes), and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautiful style was seen in Springtime in Small Town) was a cinematographic genius. Doyle has all the brave beauty, undoubtedly, his work glasses at Athen Poster Hero. Always, music with Wong, prominent. From the main theme hunting styles of singing in NAT King Cole in Spanish, it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> Whether to judge all the leading movies, plots, acting, cinematography or soundtracks? Likewise, it is a beautiful, old fashion story about missing and recovering from Women Wonder is more accessible than Wings of Desire. See <br /> <br /> and Tony Leung's Hotel Room 2046, which presented Wang's latest movie with the same name.
