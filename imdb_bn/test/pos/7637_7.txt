"Cherry" is a naive, unmarried virgin, who has decided to have a child, but it is not sure how to go about it. This is going to be a little relaxing in quirky characters and tongue-in-cheeks full of situational humor. Fresh, fun, mold-broken things, I really enjoy this flashlight ... whatever happened that happens. Recommended for romantic comedy lovers who want something different.
