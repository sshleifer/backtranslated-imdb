The TMHS on the page looks like another generic high school drama; But surprisingly, the bottom depth, fundamentality and disillusionment will not make it immensely visible to the audience, rather it makes one of the best animations produced in the last few years. <br /> We look at the world with the eyes of Kyan, who meets Huhu Sujumiya on the first day in high school, the girl who boldly demands in the rest of the class has no interest in her 'normal person' and it is unexpectedly close to meet any aliens, time Invite travelers, sliders or espers. Kyon stares into unbelief, joking surprises shes or has a few screws loose. However defying her pregnancy instinct, she started talking with her. Thus, it soon became clear until some normal high schools. After a long time, he created his own named 'SOS Brigade' school club and dragged Keon to join other very unfortunate people. <br /> <br /> This animation does not meet any general rules, but the play is an overly cynical disappointment, and the show contributes to a satirical narration. Normal 2D has been moving from the leading character of the male to the middle of a long distance. Episodes are not themselves chronological and compelling the audience to revel in events and how they relate to previous events. This genius is a stroke; The effect is like a mess puzzle, to make a new piece we get more of a sense of big picture. Previous scenes are now completely new, and their perception is deeply satisfied. It means that de-jedish (something other than this) seems, the very cleverly written script has overcome this problem and it starts to make sure that it flows from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story is very original, but I will not be far ahead of the simple Ben-Hohn plot, because it's no doubt about you. However, what I'm referring to is that this plot includes a wide range of formats from comedy to science fay. How did they achieve it in the fourteenth stage space is outside of me, and there is no doubt that there is a huge achievement in ourselves. <br /> <br /> TMHS is a real jewel, with a variety of diversity and depth that will appeal to it with an interest in an anime. See it, but it is something unusual that reaches to the living hypothes which it has got - and even it crosses it.
