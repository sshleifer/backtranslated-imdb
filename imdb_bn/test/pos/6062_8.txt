One of the best new Danish TV series I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This series is a part of the Danish police police force unit 1 - a type of FBI-style team which always helps resolve cases of murder. The country, and in which they work, as well as their actions affect their personal lives, and any price has to sometimes be part of the top police force. <br /> <br /> I do not expect much more than starting this series - I was happy, the series is exciting, sometimes funny, it got both the drama and mystery, I love it.
