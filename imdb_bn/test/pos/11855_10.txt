Intense, funny, malicious, and more, social comedy in adult dating, and its results-it's good or bad. Couples and Nicholson are two months away from the date of marriage, when a bizarre ceremony at their instinct party forced Nicholson to re-think the relationship and started dating other people so that sexual experience should not feel so old. As a result, Mohar, Nicholson and their classmates have a disaster in the following incidents. Very intelligent and funny, charming comedy this time is needed, when your usual variety of tricks, sex, and frustration characters (especially Charles is a sexually provocative sexual stimulant ... as very annoying) Those who feel their true feelings also seem to be from this heart Felt <br /> <br /> Movies will continue going on this day, showing that people are sensitive and moral in the heart. Most of the letters of man are moral, simple sight, and the woman is a new face guard who will not stop to get pleasure. The boys will be grateful for messages made with self respect, but it is easy to assume that most men who watch this movie will use its message of sensitivity, which is an error or feature that a woman may be dishonest. Nevertheless, the formula of the writing is used as a tool for finding managers in men's leads, especially the seafront, the researcher, and a man like Kyoma! <br /> <br /> Most feminine by females as they will be nothing but joy and nothing but something else! Although they are covered by erotic kitten images, although there are interesting features. Very interesting thing <br /> <br /> On another level, the film follows some parts of its relationship in relation to different relationships. Richner divorced with a son named Penelope, who is divorced with a son who hates her to disagree with her father, a stressed divorcee (always an outstanding and notable performance of reliable Helen Slater). When two relationships go deeper, the interests of the people are expressed and both the comedies and tragedies of divorce start and start new. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Mahal and Nicholson have become a way to go deeper on the great head to see what is happening next, and they decide what they have learned about each other and decide on their own decisions. Come next. At the right time it becomes accurate and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The direction of Waldersky is very well imitated when learning how to face each other after the characters have happened ... at the right <br /> <br /> Finally, the film should have been released all over the country, and I hope this will be for academy awards ... probably Helen Slaughter will get her recognition. Anywho, this film is missing a hit, giving it all you got in the romantic sex scandalous, displayed very mature and aesthetically. <br /> <br /> Great Film!
