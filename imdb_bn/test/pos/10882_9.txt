This game is sometimes not the best N64 game. Sure, it's good, but there are only 4 players. Except for 4 players, see the only fun thing to dig remote and how many people you can kill. But half the level of this game where you have to save Natalya, so you have to restrict the use of remote mines in them, and it becomes quite annoying. Graphics have not reached the level of Super Mario 64 or even Mario Cart 64. And if you're talking to a great multiplayer in the first person shooter, you have to go through Perfect Dark. At least you can play "multiplayer" by yourself.
